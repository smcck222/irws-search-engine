<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to the FT guide, 'Eating out in London', which accompanied the
issue of September 10/11 and, in particular, to the photograph of Marco
Pierre White of the Hyde Park Hotel Restaurant which accompanied your
article, 'Attractions all their own'.
I was amazed that Marco Pierre White was not wearing his chef's hat, nor
were any of his colleagues for that matter. Also, Mr White's long forelock
appeared to be at a 'dangerous' angle over the food he was working with. The
photograph resembled a scene from 'Joe's cafe' rather than a kitchen in a
top London hotel.
By comparison, the chef at the Connaught Hotel, featured in 'At a glance' on
the opposite page, is dressed in his 'whites' and hat, as are his colleagues
also pictured. In the circumstances, I think I will opt to dine at the
Connaught]

FT  17 SEP 94 / Bank for millionaire monks: A look at the changes in
management and profitability at Goldman Sachs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The abrupt announcement this week of the resignation of Mr Stephen Friedman,
head of US investment bank Goldman Sachs, has caused a certain amount of
hand-rubbing in financial circles. Goldman is probably the most ferociously
successful investment bank in the world. Last year it made Dollars 2.7bn in
pre-tax profit, most of which was divided among its 150 partners.
This year, the markets have dried up or gone the wrong way, and Goldman's
profits have collapsed - some say by more than half. Other firms have
suffered too: but according to the rumour mill, the two events must be
connected. First pride, then the fall: and Mr Friedman is paying the price.
This, says Goldman, is simple nonsense. The volatility of markets is a fact
of life, and it is no use blaming individuals. Mr Jon Corzine, who this week
was named as Mr Friedman's successor, is co-head of the firm's bond
business, where most of the losses were made.
The truth, according to Mr Friedman, is quite different. At 56, he is simply
dog-tired. An exceedingly wealthy man, he wants to exchange life on an
aircraft for trout fishing at his country seat in Wyoming.
There seems no reason to doubt him. His evident relief this week at handing
on the burden of office would have been hard to counterfeit. The question
raised by his departure is a different one. Mr Friedman looks young and fit
for his age. If he were running an industrial concern like Dupont or General
Motors, he would have at least five more years ahead of him. Goldman is
notorious for its fanatical devotion to work. Has the point been reached
where it is only a young man's game?
Not at all, says Mr Corzine, aged 47. One of the most productive members of
the firm's management committee is in his late 50s. People's attitude
to-wards work, he says, is a matter of individual taste. 'Some people like
reading, some like sports, some just like working.'
Nevertheless, the Goldman culture can seem to the outsider slightly spooky,
even monastic. Take, for instance, the apparent addiction to running. Mr
Friedman is reportedly an avid runner, and Mr Corzine goes out four or five
days a week, 3 or 4 miles at a time. A story from Euromoney magazine -
possibly apocryphal, but irresistible - tells of a bankers' meeting in
London which broke up late in the evening. The other bankers tottered off to
hail cabs. The Goldman team donned track suits and sprinted off in the rain.
Though harmless enough, this seems symptomatic. The Goldman culture does not
hesitate to reach into its members' spare time. The firm's published
statement of business principles says: 'We expect our people to maintain
high ethical standards in everything they do, both in their work for the
firm and in their personal lives.' Or, as Mr Friedman put it in last year's
annual review: 'We recognise . . . that we must be prudent in our business
and personal planning and in our lifestyles.'
It is a principle from which Mr Corzine does not dissent. What matters for a
financial institution, he says, is reputation, both public and private. 'We
don't try to dictate terms on how people handle their personal lives, but as
a partner and a leader you have to be credible.'
The private nature of the firm obviously plays an important part in its
success. This week's announcement, however, set another hare running in the
financial press: the familiar rumour that Goldman - virtually unique among
banks of its size in retaining its partnership structure - is hungry for
capital, and may have to consider going public.
Mr Corzine, like Mr Friedman before him, gives this short shrift. The firm
is always looking to raise capital, he says, if the terms are right. It
raised Dollars 200m of equity from financial institutions last year.
Something under a quarter of its equity belongs to outsiders at present. But
going public, he says, 'is not on my practical agenda today, nor on my
primary agenda for the future'.
Perhaps the real threat to privacy comes from pressures of a different kind.
Last year's Dollars 2.7bn profit was rather larger than Goldman's entire
wage bill. That is, the 150 partners received more in aggregate than their
8,000-odd em-ployees.
The question of fair distribution, says Mr Corzine, is a perennial one for
Goldman. Compared with 10 or 20 years ago, the system feels to him fairer
than it was, 'though of course, I may be biased'. More fundamentally, he
argues, the bulk of the profit is left within the firm to make a return
going forward for partners and employees alike. 'You must remember that the
vast majority of that money is reinvested and at risk.'
This is perhaps a little disingenuous. Anyone earning around Dollars 15m a
year, as the average Goldman partner did last year, will aim to invest the
bulk of it for the future. Goldman's equity capital at the start of last
year totalled Dollars 3.7bn, so the Dollars 2.7bn of profit represented a
return of 73 per cent. Faced with an opportunity like that, no investor in
his senses would put his money anywhere else.
For Goldman's employees, jostling around below partnership level, one
obvious question is how many partners the firm can take on without
exploding. According to Mr Corzine, this is not an immediate problem. 'At
some point the group gets too extended to be a community of interest. That's
probably not 250.' In any case, he points out, expansion is not inevitable.
'Theoretically, if opportunities in the financial arena were to decline over
the next decade, we could have fewer partners.'
This brings us back to the question of current trading. It has been, in Mr
Corzine's restrained phrase, a difficult year: not just in the turbulent
first quarter, when the Federal Reserve Board raised US interest rates
unexpectedly, but in successive quarters as well. A lot of money was raised
in world bond markets in 1992-93, when interest rates were low. 'That was a
great window of opportunity, and a lot of people jumped through it,' he
says. Business this year is down accordingly; Goldman's underwriting of
municipal bonds, for instance, is down 50 per cent by volume.
'So some of our vital core business has slowed dramatically,' Mr Corzine
says. 'That might go on for another couple of years. No one can predict.'
Meanwhile, 1994 looks like joining 1979 and 1987 as a memorably bad year for
the industry: not as bad as the other two, says Mr Corzine, unless maybe you
were focused on European bonds. 'It might depend on what generation you put
the question to.'
This does not mean, he insists, that Goldman is pulling in its horns. 'There
are lessons to be learnt. You get overly optimistic in the bountiful
environment of bull markets. It was very easy in 1993 to think you ought to
have a presence in every capital market in every major country in the world.
There are ways of doing things more efficiently. But that's not
retrenchment. It's adjusting the pace of expansion.'

Sir, It is encouraging that Mr John Major has declared war on 'yob culture'

FT  17 SEP 94 / Dealt a mixed hand: A look at the challenge before Jacques
Santer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pity Mr Jacques Santer, next president of the European Commission. In the
next few weeks, the affable Luxembourger must decide a division of
portfolios, a thankless task which will produce few winners, many losers,
and bruised egos all round.
Mr Santer took soundings this week among fellow European prime ministers.
From Lisbon to London, he heard pleas for special treatment; none louder
than in Paris where the Balladur government had warned of the need to
respect France's 'weight' in the European Union.
The pressure must be faintly unsettling. Mr Santer never sought the top
executive post in Europe, and only secured it on the say-so of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, who saw the Franco-German candidate, Belgium's Mr Jean-Luc
Dehaene, fall to a British veto.
'This is Santer's first big test,' says a Commission official. 'It's a test
of his grip on the new Commission and of his clout with member states.'
Mr Santer inherits a demoralised Commission whose mission needs rethinking.
His preparations for assuming the presidency on January 6 next year
coincide, too, with debate on the shape and pace of European integration
which may affect his team's composition.
Spain insists the balance between north and south be preserved, despite
likely enlargement of the EU next year to include Austria, Finland, Sweden
and Norway. Italy, too, was unnerved by the recent paper from the governing
CDU/CSU coalition in Germany advocating a 'hard core' of five member states
led by France, Germany and the Benelux countries.
For its part, the UK is struggling to fend off French-led attacks on Sir
Leon Brittan, the chief EU trade negotiator. The UK's obstructionism in
Europe has weakened its bargaining position; but it is lobbying to persuade
the Bonn government that keeping Sir Leon in charge of economic relations
with central and eastern Europe would better serve German interests than
would giving his portfolio to the protectionist-minded French.
Mr Santer's greatest constraint is that he may inherit as many as seven
Commissioners. Of them, Mr Martin Bangemann, the German industry
commissioner, Mr Karel Van Miert, the Belgian competition policy
commissioner, and Sir Leon are heavyweight 'barons of Brussels' who form a
powerful old guard.
In the summer, Mr Santer hinted incumbent commissioners might keep their
present jobs, though he reserved the right to trim or reorganise their
empires. Opinions differ on whether this was a shrewd or short-sighted move.
'Santer passed up the chance for a real shake-up of portfolios,' says an
official who recalls that Mr Jacques Delors' first move in 1984 was to
demand commissioners' resignations. But another long-serving official says
Mr Santer's tolerance of the status quo was clever as it reduced scope for
conflict.
Allocating portfolios is the Commission president's most demonstrable power,
but interference by member states renders it something of a fiction. The
question is how far Mr Santer can pick a team in which talent is given due
weight and the Commission's role as umpire, power-broker and policy catalyst
is preserved.
His first problem is that there are not enough good jobs to go around - even
more so now that the number of commissioners is due to expand from 17 to 21
if the Scandinavians and Austrians join the EU next year. At most there are
five top jobs and five medium-sized portfolios; the rest are consolation
prizes.
Trade and competition policy are in the top rank as they carry statutory
powers and the authority to negotiate international agreements on behalf of
member states.
Hence the declaration of interest - some would say presumptuous - by Mr
Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the French technocrat who served as adviser to a
French commissioner in the early 1980s.
Agriculture is also vital, not just because the Common Agricultural Policy
accounts for half of the EU's Ecu70bn (Pounds 55bn) budget but because
further CAP reform is crucial. Other attractive jobs include the economics
portfolio (where the Commission has the right under the Maastricht treaty to
recommend which countries qualify for monetary union), and industry (where
Mr Bangemann wants to expand his telecommunications brief).
Medium-sized jobs include environment (which might pass to an eco-conscious
Swede); regional policy (for which Mr Neil Kinnock, the former UK Labour
party leader may make a pitch); and social policy (a high-profile dossier to
which Mr Padraig Flynn, the Irish commissioner, appears committed). Finally,
there is the job of administering the single market. Many hope for someone
more forceful than the incumbent, Italian diplomat Mr Vanni d'Archirafi.
Mr Santer's aides are considering an expanded 'institutional affairs'
portfolio to prepare for the 1996 inter-governmental conference to review
Maastricht and liaison with the newly assertive European Parliament. There
is also gossip about a new 'turbo-charged' transport portfolio overseeing
proposed trans-European networks linking north and south, east and west
through rail, telecommunications and gas pipelines.
Transport may be offered to Mrs Edith Cresson, former French socialist prime
minister. Best known for comparing Japanese workers to ants and her
aspersions on the sexuality of the British male, she is awaited in Brussels
with some trepidation.
The most pressing problem remains reorganisation of the Commission. Mr
Santer must decide whether to unscramble Mr Delors' most important
innovation: the creation of a commissioner for external political affairs,
currently Mr Hans van den Broek, former Dutch foreign minister.
He must also decide how to improve co-ordination between commissioners,
their cabinets and the career civil service. Without action, the bureaucracy
will creak along with its duplications and petty infighting. The most vivid
example is the turf-battle between Mr van den Broek and Sir Leon.
It is a formidable challenge. Mr Santer might do well to ponder Mr Delors'
response when told Greece wanted him to stay on for a few months while his
succession was sorted out. 'Never again,' he said.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW LONGHURST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report, 'Plan to base mortgage benefit on 'standard' interest
rate' (September 14) raises a number of issues.
In December 1991 the Council of Mortgage Lenders and the government took a
number of initiatives to help solve the problem of rapidly increasing
mortgage possessions and arrears. Since that time the number of possessions
has fallen by more than 35 per cent.
A key policy change was the agreement of the government to make the payment
of income support direct to mortgage lenders rather than to unemployed
borrowers.
In the knowledge that income support would be paid direct, lenders agreed
not to take possession in cases where mortgage interest payments are covered
by income support.
Mortgage lenders generally currently adhere to that agreement. However, it
will not be possible for them to do so if, as reported, income support
payments are made on the basis of a 'standard' interest rate which is less
than the mortgage interest due.
Under those circumstances no borrower claiming income support will be in a
position where their interest payments are covered by the Department of
Social Security. The inevitable result, in what now seems likely to be a
period of rising interest rates, is an increase in the number of arrears and
possessions, with consequent increased pressure on the government's social
housing budget.
There is no getting away from the fact that, having encouraged people out of
public rented accommodation into home ownership, the government is now
considering cuts which will pull their hearth rugs from under them.
For many, losing their job will mean losing their home if income support for
mortgage interest is cut back.

Sir, The University of Sussex was built '. . . far removed from the inner
cities', according to John Authers and John Willman ('Dreaming spires on
city rubble', September 10/11). But the campus is only 5 miles from the
centre of Brighton, a town which has suffered more than most in the
recession and is characterised by levels of unemployment and poverty
normally associated with the large conurbations.
Our response, in partnership with the University of Brighton, Brighton
College of Technology, the local authorities and the Sussex Training and
Enterprise Council, has been to create an academic corridor designed to
stimulate the growth of enterprise based on 21st century technology.
We have raised Pounds 2m from Brighton and East Sussex councils and Seeboard
for a flagship innovation centre which is to be launched next week as an
event during the corridor's 'Festival of Innovation'.
We believe it is possible effectively to marry research of international and
national excellence to significant growth in the local economy, and that the
key to success lies in this kind of partnership.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Lines open for the global village: The price of phone calls
is falling and will fall faster if the international telecoms cartel
collapses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the telegraph and radio, the globe has contracted, spatially, into a
single large village.
That was Marshall McLuhan back in 1962. So it is hardly new to claim that
today's 'information superhighway' is creating a global village. Much the
same was said during the printing revolution in the 15th century.
If the essence of village life is immediate personal communication, however,
that oft-evoked vision is at last becoming a reality. The international
phone call, a rare and luxurious item only a few years ago, is now a
commodity within reach of most inhabitants of the developed world.
Prices of calls are falling as technology leaps ahead. They would be falling
faster were it not for the cartel in which most of the world's national
telephone companies collude to maintain their vast profit margins.
Now, even the international phone cartel is coming under strain. Many
observers expect it to break up within the next couple of years. As it does,
cross-border call prices will collapse. At that point, at least the
developed world will feel more and more like McLuhan's village.
'We are moving into a distance insensitive world in telecoms,' claims Mr
Thomas Luciano, AT&amp;T's director of international settlements. 'Soon it may
actually cost less for a Londoner to put a call through to New York than to
Bristol.'
Even in the developed world, the international phone call only recently
ceased to be a luxury. When the first regular phone service opened from
London to New York in 1927, it cost Pounds 458 for a three minute call (in
today's money). The entire transatlantic service was provided by radio until
1956, with capacity for no more than 20 people to hold conversations at any
one time. It was not until the late 1960s that undersea cables provided
lines in the hundreds, and direct dialling to New York began only in 1970.
'Making a transatlantic call was a real challenge until the 1970s,' says Mr
Neil Johannessen, director of the British Telecom museum in London. 'Only
then did international calls become truly part of the national phone
system.'
Two decades on, capacity is abundant. The latest transatlantic fibre-optic
submarine cable being installed will provide 30 times the capacity for the
same price as its state-of-the-art counterpart of a decade ago. A cable
little thicker than a finger, it can carry about 600,000 simultaneous
telephone calls.
STC Submarine Systems, the London-based supplier of telecoms cables, is
working on a more sophisticated fibre-optic system able to carry 10m
simultaneous telephone calls - enough for the entire populations of London
and New York to speak to each other at the same time down one cable.
STC estimates that the cost of providing a telephone circuit by fibre
between London and New York has fallen by 90 per cent in just the past seven
years. According to its projections, the cost is set to fall to about one
tenth of its current level over the next five years.
The problem is that these falling costs are not fully reflected in prices to
the consumer.
At first sight, the drop in prices looks impressive. BT's transatlantic
rates have fallen by more than a third in the past three years. In today's
money, the price of a three-minute daytime BT call from London to New York
is down from nearly Pounds 14 20 years ago to less than Pounds 1.50 now.
But with their cost base shrinking even faster, the main international
carriers are making margins of more than 50 per cent on much of their
international traffic. On the all-important transatlantic route, industry
estimates suggest that it costs little more than 7p a minute in direct
network charges to deliver a call, yet the daytime prices charged by BT and
AT&amp;T average nearly 45p a minute.
A large part of the reason for the disparity is that international phone
prices are fixed by agreement between national operators. These are mainly
monopolies, subject to few competitive pressures and heavily reliant on
international calls to sustain their profits and subsidise their local
networks.
The cartel keeps prices artificially high, with serious consequences for the
growth of new 'superhighway' services and for industrial competitiveness.
This is particularly damaging in Europe, where prices for cross-border calls
are many times higher than for equivalent distance domestic ones.
For companies, one way of reducing the cost of calls is to lease telecoms
lines and build their own private networks. However, Europeans are at a
disadvantage here, too. According to a recent survey by the UK's Department
of Trade and Industry, a leased telecoms line between France and Germany
costs nearly twice as much as the same leased line within either country,
and about 16 times as much as a 200km leased line in the US.
Pressure to reduce prices has had to focus on the arcane regime which
governs international telecoms, whereby operators agree prices among
themselves for delivering calls between countries. The agreed prices - known
as 'accounting rates' - have traditionally borne little relationship to
costs.
After years of criticism, the cartel is cracking, and may be in its last
phase. Three trends are evident:
a breakdown in co-operation between the telecoms operators that sustained
the accounting rate system;
the rise of competing, non-cartel carriers in leading markets, notably the
US and UK;
a growing emphasis on privatisation and liberalisation in Europe and much of
the developing world.
Multinationals have been lobbying against the cartel for years, and have
been helped by divisions in the ranks of the telecoms operators. Because far
more calls are made from rather than to the US, AT&amp;T pays out far more to
other carriers than it receives in return. It claims this imbalance is
running at Dollars 2.4bn a year, and is campaigning to reduce it.
In response to such pressure accounting rates have fallen sharply in recent
years; and the International Telecommunications Union, which oversees the
cartel, has resolved that accounting rates should become 'cost-oriented'.
A row this week between AT&amp;T and BT indicates the distance still to go: AT&amp;T
is pressing to cut its rate with BT from 31 cents a minute to about 11
cents, but BT will agree to a cut of no more than 25 per cent, arguing that
reductions have to be 'managed'.
Pressure for further sharp cuts will none the less intensify following an
important change to the regulatory regime due to be announced next week by
the Federal Communications Commission, the US telecoms regulator.
It will permit a new form of transatlantic telecoms competition using leased
lines, which will benefit companies that make their business from leasing
lines from the top carriers and re-selling them at a discount to standard
tariffs. After the change they will be able to connect the lines into the
public network on both ends of the Atlantic, giving them wider access than
previously.
'This is a big nail in the coffin of the international cartel,' says Mr
Laurence Heyworth, telecoms analyst with Robert Fleming, the brokers.
Although this month's change concerns only the US and UK, the US is by far
the most important foreign destination for UK calls, while the UK is the the
third most popular for US calls. Canada, which is the most common
destination for outgoing calls from the US, already permits the same form of
competition with both the US and UK.
New operators are bound to find ways of using the new regime to offer
cut-price services to mainland Europe, whatever the formal rules laid down
by the US and UK regulatory authorities.
Not withstanding the current controversy about over-priced calls, demand
continues to race ahead. International telephone traffic has been growing at
a compound rate of about 17 per cent a year for the past decade.
Such growth does not just reflect the globalisation of business. According
to the ITU, residential calling is contributing as much, if not more. The
residential market is burgeoning, thanks in part to the increased mobility
of populations: the US alone gained nearly 9m new immigrants in the 1980s,
while the influx into western Europe has been running at about 2.5m a year
since the collapse of the Berlin Wall.
In the UK, Worldcom, a competitor in international business services to BT,
is about to enter the residential market by targeting immigrant communities
through direct mail. 'We are confident that lower prices will stimulate a
lot more international calls to friends and relations,' says Mr David
Hardwick, managing director.
For all this the global village will still be a somewhat exclusive
community. Most of the world's population has no access to a telephone of
any kind, let alone fibre-optic international telecommunications and
multi-media wizardry.
The average global citizen made about seven minutes worth of international
calls in 1991, but that average conceals a huge range: from seven hours per
citizen in Luxembourg to six seconds in Africa.
Barely a fifth of 105 countries surveyed by the International
Telecommunications Union boast more than 25 phone lines per 100 people, with
most developing countries providing fewer than 5 per 100. The UK has four
times as many phone lines as India.
The priority in the developing world is to build more lines. Investment is
accelerating and new technology - such as 'fixed cellular' systems - may
slash the cost of infrastructure. China plans to quadruple its number of
phone lines over the next decade.
Yet on the most optimistic projections it will still be decades before the
phone is a standard household item across the globe.
Governments and phone companies are coming to realise that rapid expansion
requires a radical recasting of the existing telecoms regime. In many Asian,
eastern European and Latin American countries, governments are now wooing
foreign telecoms investors instead of seeking to fund expansion of their
monopolies largely by taxing international calls.
As a senior Chinese official put it recently: 'We used to think it was the
roads that mattered: now we realise that telecoms links are more important,
and a crucial agent for growth.' Perhaps in the true global village the
motor car will be a quaint relic of the 20th century.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Man in the News: The one who knows where he's going -
Kenneth Clarke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Something strange happened this week. The government looked like it had
recovered its grip. Mr Kenneth Clarke took the credit. Yes we do have a new
style of chancellor.
There was the inevitable blip. Mr Jeremy Hanley, installed as Conservative
party chairman because he is telegenic, discovered that an avuncular
personality is not enough in today's television studios.
But Mr Hanley's slip-ups over yobbery and interest rates were a sideshow. At
centre stage stood the solidly self-confident figure of Mr Clarke. The
government can still field someone who knows where he is going.
We should not get carried away. Nor should Mr Clarke, who by all accounts
ended the week in pretty exuberant spirits. Remember that Budget last
November with the biggest tax hike in history. The pundits loved it. The
voters hated it. Were the economic recovery to falter, this week's rise in
interest rates would not look quite so shrewd.
Even if the latest opinion poll is right and Mr Tony Blair's honeymoon as
Labour leader is coming to an end, this government is sitting at the bottom
of a deep hole.
The punters are not thrilled about picking up the bill for its mistakes.
There is more to come. From next month they will be paying new insurance and
travel taxes. Next April the value added tax on their heating bills will
double.
Nor will higher borrowing costs and the extended freeze on public sector pay
bills have the voters singing in their baths this weekend. If you are paying
a mortgage or are selfless enough to be a public service worker, the
feel-good factor in this economic recovery is going to be a long time
coming.
So why the plaudits for the man in No 10 (whoops, that should read No 11)
Downing Street? It's simple. After two years of what Lady Thatcher used to
call wobble, Mr Clarke has defined a strategy which looks further ahead than
next week.
His game plan has as its starting point the simple but not uncontroversial
premise that sensible economic policymaking and good politics are not
mutually exclusive.
He came back from his summer holiday with two thoughts uppermost in his
mind. To have any chance of winning another election, the government must
remove the deep insecurity caused by the recession and by the pace of
economic change. It has also to re-establish a track record for doing what
it promises. Mr Clarke's people, the middle classes of middle England, are
in desperate need of reassurance.
The chancellor assumes (rightly) that after the broken promises of 1992, the
voters don't believe a word this government says. The only way to change
that is to deliver the steady growth and low inflation it has promised - and
to clear up the mess in the public finances. If the Tories fail this
credibility test, they may as well not bother.
That was the context into which Mr Clarke slotted his decision to call an
abrupt halt to the cycle of falling interest rates. Inflation is not
expected to pick up in the near future, but he is thinking 18 months to two
years ahead.
The message was that here was a chancellor who will act before he is pushed.
Perhaps it was no coincidence that this particular demonstration of
decisiveness coincided with the second anniversary of the event which
shredded this government's reputation for economic competence: the ejection
of sterling from the European exchange rate mechanism.
The same strategy lay behind Mr Clarke's decision to rule out tax cuts in
the Budget this November: and to warn colleagues it may be impossible also
to deliver a substantial electoral bribe in 1995 or 1996.
Of course he hopes to be able to combine fiscal prudence with a
demonstration of tax-cutting intent. But if it comes to a choice, he will
opt for sound finance. The voters want tax cuts that will last.
No one noticed, but Mr Clarke did something else this week. He quietly
buried the monetarist ideology which lay at the heart of the Thatcher
revolution.
Look at the reasons he gave for raising interest rates. Buoyant growth in
output, sharp rises in exports and an upturn in investment pointed to a
shrinking level of spare capacity in the economy.
The Treasury press release did mention the narrow measure of the money
supply and allude to the recent weakness of the exchange rate. But the
chancellor is not interested in excursions along the fog-bound monetary
motorways on which his predecessors found themselves lost during the 1980s.
As befits a chancellor self-consciously proud of his roots in the industrial
Midlands, he intends to watch the real economy.
Mr Clarke would say that nothing that has happened in the past few days
should surprise us. His first act as chancellor was to tackle public
borrowing. It was he who decided to inject transparency into interest rate
decisions by publishing the minutes of his monthly meetings with Mr Eddie
George, governor of the Bank of England. And anyone glancing at his record
at health, education and the Home Office could have guessed his attitude to
public sector pay.
The trouble is not everyone in the Conservative party - or for that matter
the cabinet - shares all his inner certainties. One or two noticed that the
Bank had not anyway left him much choice this week on interest rates. Ken
and Eddie may be getting on famously, but what happens when they fall out?
Colleagues on the Tory right detect in Mr Clarke a politician whose
convictions are too close to the social democracy of Mr Tony Blair, the
Labour leader. The obvious mutual respect between the two men does not help.
Others harbour still darker suspicions. The chancellor has been quiet lately
about his enthusiasm for Europe. But the Tory sceptics fear that, once the
economy is in suitable shape, he will again take up the cause of economic
integration. He has after all admitted he would back a single currency.
Then there is the small matter of Mr John Major. Close aides in both camps
insist gossip about rows between the prime minister and Mr Clarke are
unfounded. Sure, the prime minister gets irritated when the chancellor will
not stop talking (Mr Clarke should watch for the moment when Mr Major starts
tapping his fingers on the table).
It would be odd also if the prime minister were thrilled by Mr Clarke's
cheerful public admissions of his long-term ambitions to succeed him. But
the two men are agreed on the central planks of economic policy.
That could change. It was Mr Major who promised, during the 1992 campaign,
tax cuts 'year by year'. His enthusiasm for fiscal prudence may fade as the
next election approaches. There will be plenty of colleagues telling him to
put some money back into the voters' pockets; that Mr Clarke has gone native
at the Treasury; and that he, Mr Major, should set the government's
electoral strategy. The prime minister should ignore them. Mr Clarke
reminded us this week that a clear sense of direction is everything in
politics.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Well done, Mr Clarke
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday was the second anniversary of sterling's summary eviction from the
ERM. That Wednesday has indeed proved black for the government, whose
credibility has never recovered. But it has been white for the UK economy,
which has enjoyed an accelerating recovery. On Monday, the chancellor of the
exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, saw fit to celebrate the anniversary by
imposing the first increase in short-term rates of interest since October
1989 (except for that on that Wednesday itself). Has he ruined the chances
for enduring growth, or ensured that this recovery will run and run?
Changes in interest rates take perhaps two years to affect the economy. The
lag is uncertain and, in any case, variable. Whether base rate at 5.75 per
cent, rather than 5.25 per cent, will make a decisive difference to
performance two years hence is anybody's guess. But the new base rate is not
intrinsically unreasonable for a country whose counter-inflationary
credibility is weak. By historical standards, it is low: the last time base
rate was at this level (apart from the months since the cut to 5.5 per cent
in November 1993) was in November 1977.
The yield curve is strongly upward-sloping, which shows the market's
expectation that current short-term interest rates are low (and so
expansionary), in relation to expected ones. The shape of the yield curve
reflects the jump in yields on longer-term gilts since January to 8.8 per
cent, a rise of 2.7 percentage points. This was a larger jump than in
Germany, where corresponding bond yields are only 7.6 per cent,
notwithstanding higher inflation. In addition, the gap between conventional
and index-linked gilts, which offers an indication of expected inflation,
increased from 3.3 percentage points at the turn of the year to close to 5
percentage points this month.
Lacks credibility
In short, the government lacks credibility in financial markets, not just
over its aim of 1-2 1/2 per cent inflation indicated for the end of this
parliament, but on its official target of 1-4 per cent. Such lack of
credibility has costs. It means, for example, that real interest rates on
conventional gilts are higher than they need be. It may also mean a
premature re-awakening of inflation in the labour and goods markets.
The counter-argument is that the markets are being hysterical. On this view,
the economy remains burdened with large amounts of slack. Correspondingly,
the inflation 'shocks' of this week - a 0.5 per cent increase in the retail
price index in August and a 0.3 per cent increase in producer prices - are
little more than blips. Excluding mortgage interest, the annual increase in
retail prices was just 2.3 per cent, the same as for producer prices.
Meanwhile, July's provisional underlying increase in average earnings
remained at June's unworrying level of 3 3/4 per cent.
This objection can be strengthened by looking at nominal gross domestic
product and domestic demand, where increases in the year to the second
quarter of 1994 were only 5.6 and 4.3 per cent respectively. If the
inflation target were converted to this form, these would be the sorts of
increases the government would want. Is there any chance of rapid
acceleration? A measure that suggests the answer is no is broad money (M4),
which grew only 4.8 per cent in the year to July, vastly below levels in
previous eras of accelerating inflation.
Fundamental issue
The fundamental issue is the extent of excess capacity, on which evidence is
ambiguous. The recovery started, tentatively, between the first and second
quarters of 1992 (a few months before black-and-white Wednesday). But GDP is
now only 5.4 per cent above its cyclical trough and a mere 1.6 per cent
above where it was when the recession began. Manufacturing output in July
was 1.5 per cent below its last cyclical peak. Logically, there must be
substantial excess capacity, particularly when unemployment is 2.6m.
There are two objections to this line of argument. The first is that if
there were excess capacity (and the economy were, correspondingly, well
above its 'natural' rate of unemployment), inflation should be falling. But
it is not, which suggests that the excess capacity may be largely
theoretical. The second objection is that, because of this uncertainty, any
excess capacity should be brought into use slowly. It is depressing, but
true, that resources rendered idle by deep recessions cannot be brought back
into play with ease. Complementary investment is required, which takes time.
The huge damage caused by deep recessions is the main reason for trying to
avoid a repetition. This is more important than reaching the (unknown) point
of full capacity as swiftly as possible. In erring on the side of caution,
Mr Clarke showed common sense. If needed, he can always press the
accelerator again. So Mr Clarke deserves praise. He may fail to get any from
party colleagues. Will the British electorate prove more understanding?

FT  17 SEP 94 / Diseased turbot will be culled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thousands of turbot at an experimental fish farm on the island of Gigha, off
the coast of Argyll, are to be killed after government officials confirmed
they were suffering from a fish disease which has not been recorded in the
British Isles before.
The fish are affected with viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS), a disease
which UK and European Union legislation requires to be eradicated if its
breaks out. The disease is said to be endemic on the Continent.
The affected fish farm has been placed under quarantine for killing and
clearance, and movement of fish from a salmon farm on the island has been
banned.
The disease was discovered last week at the turbot farm which is owned by
the McConnell Salmon company. Its confirmation as VHS has alarmed fish
farmers in Scotland, who fear that they could be affected by the disease or
suffer from bad publicity.
The Ministry of Agriculture says VHS can affect salmon, rainbow trout, brown
trout, grayling and other species.
However, Mr David Windmill, managing director of McConnell Salmon, said the
company had found no evidence in the scientific literature of VHS affecting
salmon, which make up the majority of fish farmed in Scotland.
Mr Seumas McSporran, sub-postmaster on Gigha, which has a population of 120,
said: 'It would be a crisis for us if both the fish farms had to close.'
The turbot farm, which has been operating for a year in its present form,
contains about 200,000 turbot, worth about Pounds 500,000. McConnell Salmon
started the operation to see whether turbot could be farmed as successfully
as salmon.
Mr Windmill thought the disease could have reached the fish through their
moist feed.

</HEADLINE>

The end of the ban on broadcasting Sinn Fein members' voices was welcomed
last night by broadcasters. Mr Michael Grade, Channel 4 chief executive,
said: 'The lifting of the ban ends Britain's most embarrassing attempt to
censor coverage of the most important domestic political story of post-war
years.' Mr John Birt, BBC director-general, said: 'We can again apply normal
and testing scrutiny to all sides in the debate.' Mr Tony Hall, managing
director of BBC news and current affairs, said: 'Lifting the ban means that
we are now able to do our job properly.'

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein was announced in the House of Commons by
Mr Douglas Hurd, then home secretary, on October 19 1988 after a
particularly intense period of IRA violence.
He said that the time had come to deny the 'easy platform' provided by radio
and television to those who 'propagate terrorism'. The ban would 'remove
from the men of violence an extra weapon which the existence of direct
access to the media has provided for them'.
He said: 'This is not censorship, because it does not deal with or prohibit
the reporting of events. Broadly, we are putting broadcasters on the same
basis as representatives of the written press.'
The move was supported by unionists, but Mr Roy Hattersley, then shadow home
secretary, said it would 'make the government look simultaneously repressive
and ridiculous'.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said the action was
'ill-conceived, ill-judged and almost certainly counter-productive'.
The government's action came more than three years after Baroness Thatcher,
then prime minister, suggested after the IRA attack on the 1984 Tory
conference in Brighton that the media adopt a voluntary code of conduct
denying publicity to terrorists and hijackers. She said: 'We must try to
find ways to starve the terrorist and the hijacker of the oxygen of
publicity on which they depend.'
Initially the policy was judged a success. Even Sinn Fein at the time
admitted it was having difficulties putting the case for the IRA campaign.
Since its imposition the ban has been sidestepped by broadcasters, who have
used actors' voices to dub the words of individuals such as Mr Gerry Adams,
Sinn Fein president.
In recent months ministers have come round to the view - held by Sir Patrick
Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary - that the ban was no longer achieving
anything and had become a lever for people to criticise the government.
The Irish government lifted its broadcasting ban on January 19. Irish
officials said that in the past week the lifting of the ban had been the
subject of several telephone conversations between Mr Major and Mr Albert
Reynolds, his Irish counterpart.
Mr Reynolds said after consultations with Mr Adams and Mr John Hume, the
Social Democratic and Labour party leader, that lifting the ban, with other
measures such as lifting border controls, could help enforce the IRA
leadership's commitment to the ceasefire without alienating unionist
opinion.
According to Downing Street the timing of yesterday's move was decided 'very
late' on Thursday and followed intensive canvassing of unionist views -
including those of Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader - by Mr
Major and senior ministers.
The lifting of the Irish ban has had little impact on Sinn Fein's electoral
fortunes.
The view of some Irish officials - apparently now shared by their UK
counterparts - is that far from turning Mr Adams into a media star, lifting
the broadcasting ban will help remove the myths surrounding him.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Intelligence report helps shape strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's refusal to accept unequivocally that the IRA ceasefire is
permanent persists even though an intelligence assessment says that the
IRA's internal discipline is holding.
Before announcing the lifting of the broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, the
IRA's political wing, and the opening of some border roads, the government
was advised by security experts that the IRA leadership remained committed
to the ceasefire.
Yet security officials are thought also to have advised the government that
there were hardliners in the IRA who agreed to the ceasefire because of
raised expectations about the speed of the government's response.
The most immediate threat of renewed violence is thought to come from
loyalist paramilitaries, who are ignoring the advice of more moderate
unionist politicians and are prepared to exploit anxieties in the unionist
community. The referendum announcement is aimed at minimising that risk.
There have been some symbolic gestures since the IRA ceasefire such as
ordering British soldiers to wear berets instead of helmets, but security
forces have not relaxed their monitoring of suspected terrorists and their
sympathisers.
One area of concern is thought to be the civil disobedience campaign by Sinn
Fein, which includes the illegal opening of border crossings. The security
forces are also aware that some army and police personnel continue to be
tracked by IRA 'intelligence' units.
British intelligence is thought to be keeping a close watch on any arms
movements by paramilitaries and whether they are using the ceasefire to
re-arm.
There is still uncertainty about whether the ceasefire has brought about any
significant change in the paramilitaries' fundraising activities.
It is against this background that the government appears to have opted in
public for caution - awaiting reassurance from security advisers that the
military situation remains under control while being seen to maintain an
even-handed approach to the peace process.
The strategy includes moderating its objections to a US visa being granted
to Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Referendum promise eases unionist fears: Paisley's deputy
welcomes 'step forward'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's explicit commit-ment to submitting any decision on the
future of Northern Ireland to a referendum in the province appeared last
night to have reassured several leading unionists.
It was also welcomed by Mr Albert Reynolds, prime minister of the Irish
Republic, and Mr Dick Spring, the republic's foreign minister.
Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party,
who has been strongly critical of the peace initiative, described the
commitment as a 'step forward'.
Just over a week ago after a stormy meeting with Mr Major in Downing Street
he joined his leader the Rev Ian Paisley in accusing the government of
reaching secret deals with the IRA.
Last night, however, Mr Robinson indicated that he was prepared to put such
conspiracy talk behind him. 'The prime minister's announcement has taken us
beyond that . . . the issue is now one of consent,' he said.
Mr Reg Empey, a former mayor of Belfast, described the government's
announcement as a 'very major step forward' which would encourage unionists
to commit themselves more fully to the peace process. 'For the first time,
it opens up the possibility of people participating in their future,' he
said.
Mr Reynolds said the holding of referendums north and south of the border on
any substantial new agreement would be a 'logical development of the Downing
Street peace declaration'.
He was supported by Mr Spring, who said Mr Major's commitment was 'in line
with the position in our government programme that the final outcome of such
negotiations would need to be acceptable to the people, north and south'.
He added: 'It will, I hope, reassure those who at present hesitate to engage
in the process of political dialogue, which is so necessary if the potential
of the present situation is to be realised.'
The holding of a referendum was implied in the joint Anglo-Irish declaration
last December, but yesterday's more specific reference was aimed at
reassuring unionist opinion against the background of threats of loyalist
paramilitary violence.
Since the IRA ceasefire was announced some unionist politicians have been
claiming that Sinn Fein and the IRA are dictating the pace and scope of the
peace process.
Some unionists last night still said that the government had made
unjustified concessions to the IRA by lifting the broadcasting ban and some
border controls.
Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, one of
the areas affected by the opening of border controls, said last night: 'Law
abiding people . . . quite simply do not want concessions given to Sinn Fein
without some certainty that a ceasefire is permanent.'

FT  17 SEP 94 / Telephone banking at Barclays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays Bank is to launch a national telephone banking service for personal
customers which will be integrated with its branch network, Alison Smith
writes.
The move follows an 18-month pilot study involving 15,000 customers. The new
service, Barclaycall, will be launched in November.
It will open every day but will not be available on a 24-hour basis.
Initially it will be able to deal with 20,000 new customers a month.
After the success of First Direct, the telephone banking subsidiary of
Midland Bank, all the leading banks and some larger building societies have
launched some form of telephone banking, although some are still at a pilot
stage.
Midland is still the only bank to offer an entirely telephone-based service.
The others see telephone banking as a complement to branch banking.
Barclays is thought to be putting Pounds 20m to Pounds 30m into the project.
The operation will be based in Coventry.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Lex Service spends Pounds 20m to boost Hyundai sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lex Service, the UK's biggest vehicle distribution group, is spending Pounds
20m to carve out a larger slice of the UK car market for Hyundai, the South
Korean car import franchise it controls in partnership with IM Group, a
Japanese vehicle importer.
Lex, which took over the Hyundai business late last year after losing its
long-standing Volvo import franchise, has made a first-half loss of Pounds
800,000 on the South Korean franchise and expects to break even at best for
the year as a whole.
It has decided, however, to spend Pounds 20m to increase sales and
strengthen the 170-strong dealer network on the basis of a new model
programme and expansion plans by Hyundai, South Korea's biggest vehicle
maker.
Hyundai, whose output will this year exceed 1m vehicles for the first time,
has said it intends to be a 2m-plus producer - and to join the world's top
10 vehicle makers - by the end of the decade. It is spending more than
Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn) on expanding capacity at three of its four
plants.
The Lex investment comes as Daewoo, another of South Korea's four main
vehicle makers, is making final preparations for the launch of its vehicles
in the UK at the start of next year. Kia, a third, is selling about 4,000
cars a year. Like Hyundai, each has ambitious plans for expansion and new
models.
The rapid expansion of the South Korean motor industry is causing concern to
parts of the UK motor trade and industry, with some seeing parallels with
the earlier development of the Japanese industry.
In January the Lex/IM venture will start selling the Accent. Hyundai has
spent Dollars 438m on bringing this small car to production to replace Excel
models.
A medium-size saloon, coupe and a multi-purpose vehicle are scheduled to
form part of an expanding range in coming years.
Mr Chon Sung Won, Hyundai's president, said the models would help to double
Hyundai's European car sales to nearly 190,000 by the end of the decade.
Last year 9,189 Hyundai vehicles were sold in the UK, down from a peak of
more than 11,000 at the end of the 1980s. Sales and marketing activities
this year have already paid off, in sales if not financial terms. The 9,320
vehicles sold in the eight months to the end of August represented a 30.6
per cent rise from the same period a year ago.
Mr David Walker, managing director of the UK importer, said sales for the
full year should be a record 13,000 to 13,500, with further steady increases
later.
He refused to predict what share Hyundai might eventually take in the UK
market.
Under a deal reached late last year Lex acquired a 50.1 per cent stake in
Hyundai Cars (UK), with IM - which took on the Hyundai franchise in 1982 -
holding the rest. The joint company has a three-year rolling contract with
Hyundai.

FT  17 SEP 94 / US court bars extradition of IRA man: Appeal against San
Francisco ruling expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is expected to appeal against a ruling by a US judge blocking
the extradition of a convicted IRA gunman.
Ms Barbara Caulfield, a San Francisco federal judge, ruled against the
extradition of Mr James Smyth on the grounds of 'the punishment, detention
and restrictions on his personal liberties' that he would face on his return
to prison in Northern Ireland.
The ruling drew an angry reaction from prison officers in Northern Ireland
and from some unionist officials. Mr Finlay Spratt, chairman of Northern
Ireland's Prison Officers' Association, said the judge's decision was an
'absolute disgrace'. Northern Ireland had 'one of the most relaxed penal
systems in the world'.
The ruling was also seized on by Irish-Americans sympathetic to the
republican cause. Mr Smyth said he planned to stay in the US 'until the
British leave Ireland' and to campaign on behalf of three other Irish
nationals who remain in US prisons.
UK government officials yesterday played down the political significance of
the ruling, indicating they would not allow it to get in the way of their
collaboration with the US administration over the current Anglo-Irish peace
process. They do not believe there has been any political interference with
the judge's decision.
Officials think it likely that a US court of appeal will eventually rule in
favour of extradition. The case is not expected to be settled for some
months, by which time political developments may mean Mr Smyth will return
voluntarily.
Mr Smyth was arrested in San Francisco in 1992 after spending nine years as
a fugitive from British justice. Before the latest ruling a request for bail
had been refused by a US appeal court.
The government has been seeking Mr Smyth's extradition so that he can
complete a 20-year sentence for the attempted murder of a prison officer and
face trial for taking part in an armed mass escape from the Maze prison in
1983.
In May last year a request by Judge Caulfield for Whitehall documents was
refused by the government. These are thought to have included details of UK
security policy in Northern Ireland.
The Irish government yesterday signalled that it might consider releasing
some IRA prisoners in coming weeks as part of the peace process.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Signal workers' chance to speak out: As RMT delegates meet
this weekend, Robert Taylor looks at the executive's hardline stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Delegates representing the signal-worker members of the RMT transport union
meet this weekend in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk - the first opportunity in the
nearly three months of their dispute for rank-and-file signal workers to
express a view.
The annual conference will be held behind closed doors and has an advisory
rather than decision-making role, but both RMT leaders and Railtrack
management are anxiously awaiting its outcome. A union official said
yesterday: 'It should give us a good idea of the mood among the men.'
Railtrack was taking a cautious view. For many weeks the state-owned company
responsible for administering the network's infrastructure has been running
a 'hearts and minds' campaign among the signal workers urging them to
persuade their leaders to return to the negotiating table.
The company believes many signal workers agree with the results of a MORI
poll published yesterday. The poll showed that 75 per cent of the public
think the union should hold another ballot on strike action.
It also believes, however, that few signal workers are willing to speak out
openly at union branches or elsewhere for a return to negotiations.
Behind the RMT leadership's show of unity attitudes are by no means so
clear-cut.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, the union's general secretary, cannot dictate the tactics or
strategy of the dispute. He is accountable for all his actions to the RMT
executive council, which he attends but at which he has no vote.
Mr Knapp is 'subject to suspension' by the executive if he is ever 'absent
from duty' or responsible for 'gross neglect or incompetency'. His full-time
officials are also responsible to the executive council.
Day-to-day power in the union rests with the 21-strong executive council -
which is to be reduced to 13 from January as the union contracts to save
money in the face of dwindling membership and tight finances. The balance of
political power on the executive is held by the left, although its majority
changes.
The executive is unique in the trade union movement in that it is full-time
 -elected RMT members are seconded from their jobs to work in the union's
London headquarters and are paid an annual allowance by the union, usually
about Pounds 28,000.
The signal workers have traditionally been a rather isolated section of the
union with no substantial influence over policymaking. Only two members of
the present executive are from signalling grades, although Mr Knapp has a
signalling background. One of them - Mr John Tilley - heads the specially
created six-strong strike committee that reports to the executive.
The main internal differences on the RMT executive in the signal dispute
have been over tactics and not strategy.
The most decisive evidence of division came on July 14 when the executive
defeated by 12 votes to six a proposal to concentrate on weekly one-day
stoppages. The move was proposed by most of the strike committee, backed by
Mr Knapp and Mr Vernon Hince, the union's chief negotiator.
The eventual decision to widen the action - passed unanimously by the
executive - was very close to the left's demands and both Mr Knapp and Mr
Hince refused to approve it.
Suggestions that the two have been overruled at least once by the
executive's majority on the proposal of a compromise settlement to the
dispute have been denied strongly. But RMT headquarters is an unhappy place.
This weekend's conference may put pressure on the executive to change tack
or at least reappraise its strategy. It is not wholly without importance.
After all, last year it passed a motion calling for a strike ballot of
signal workers if their long-standing grievances had not been resolved
within six months.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Bank is 'keeping Ucatt afloat'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ucatt, the construction union, would not be a going concern if it did not
continue to have the full backing of Unity Trust Bank, the trades union
bank, according to a report prepared by the union's accountant.
HW Fisher submitted a memorandum to the independent Certification Office
this week with the union's annual financial return for 1993.
The union reported a Pounds 1.05m operating deficit last year, down from
Pounds 1.83m in 1992, with a negative net cashflow of Pounds 685,000 on its
current account, down from Pounds 901,000. However, Ucatt's general fund
reported an accumulated deficit of Pounds 3.17m on December 31 1993. Ucatt
had to pay Pounds 200,000 in interest charges on its Pounds 1.25m bank
overdraft last year. It also said it owed Pounds 1.14m to unspecified sundry
creditors.
In its report - which is addressed to Ucatt members - HW Fisher says: 'The
bank has only agreed to maintain the overdraft facility on a temporary
basis. We consider that there is therefore a significant level of concern as
to the appropriateness of the going-concern basis.'
It says that its opinion 'is not qualified in this respect', on the basis
that Ucatt's bankers have indicated that they will continue to support the
union. The overdraft has been secured by fixed charges over union
properties.
Unity Bank has said it will continue to support the union commercially until
a new business plan is completed and the bank is 'satisfied that its
implementation will restore the union to financial sta-bility'.
Mr George Brumwell, Ucatt's general secretary, said yesterday: 'We are now
in a position to make a significant reduction in our debts.' The union is in
the process of selling property and reducing its staff.
The accounts show that the union has saved about Pounds 800,000 in personnel
costs. Its regional staff cost Pounds 1.67m last year, down from just over
Pounds 2m in 1992. There was also a reduction in general administrative
expenses to Pounds 661,000 from Pounds 749,000.
However, the union has had to trim its services to members. There was a cut
of more than half in legal assistance to Pounds 204,000 from Pounds 510,000.
Funeral and other benefits amounted to only Pounds 56,000 in 1993. Ucatt had
investment income of just Pounds 8,000 last year.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Delayed Murdoch data bid rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Television Commission has rejected the highest bid for a
data broadcasting licence because the application was received nine minutes
after the deadline, Raymond Snoddy writes.
Skytext, part of Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International, bid Pounds 355,000
a year for the licence to broadcast data on the ITV television signal
compared with a bid of Pounds 78,000 by Simple Active.
The ITC has ruled that the Skytext bid was 'non-valid' because it missed the
noon deadline on August 3.
The licence is therefore likely to be awarded to Simple Active, a company
controlled by the Guardian Media Group, which was the only other bidder.
Mr Justin Cadbury, chief executive of Simple Active, was at the ITC offices
as the deadline approached. Two seconds before it the ITC received a call
saying another bid was on the way. Mr Cadbury was there when the Skytext
application arrived at 12.09pm. The company blamed heavy traffic.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Travelcard costs that carry a price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How far can London Transport push up the price of its Travelcard - allowing
multiple journeys by train, bus and Underground - before it kills the goose
that lays the golden egg?
Reports that London commuters face an increase of up to 10 per cent in
Travelcard prices, with other tickets rising by just 6 per cent, have
prompted concerns that the limits of customer resistance are about to be
reached.
Introduced in 1983, the Travelcard boosted passenger numbers when public
transport use was in decline in the rest of the country.
For commuters, the Travelcard is relatively cheap and convenient. Weekend
and evening journeys on top of the daily journey to and from work are free.
The advantages to the transport company are that it is paid in advance,
there is less fraud and travellers do not pay each time they get on a bus or
a train - allowing passengers to board buses more quickly.
Mr John Cartledge, assistant secretary of the London Regional Passengers
Committee, a consumer watchdog, said: 'The Travelcard puts public transport
on a par with the private car. Once you have bought a car the only marginal
cost is for petrol and parking, so you have an incentive to use it as much
as possible. The Travelcard also means you can make extra journeys for a nil
marginal cost.'
But LT thinks the Travelcard is too cheap. It was priced at a discount when
it was launched but its price has increased more quickly than other tickets
 -for example by 10 per cent in January 1993 when fares in general were
increased by 8.5 per cent - but LT calculates that it still provides a
saving of 30 per cent.
Reports emerging from this year's early talks on fares policy indicate a far
larger gap between the two rates of increase this time round.
Commuters might be happier if LT used the same method of calculating
Travelcard fares as Network Ticketing, which administers the Network Travel
Ticket for transport operators in Tyne and Wear.
Network Ticketing bases fares on the average charged for individual journeys
by the 30 local bus companies, the Tyne and Wear Metro and British Rail. Mrs
Julie Johnston, manager of Network Ticketing, said: 'It is a straightforward
mathematical calculation, so we can easily explain how our prices are made
up.'
Its weekly rate is based on the cost of nine journeys, a discount of 10 per
cent on a presumed 10 journeys a week for the Monday-to-Friday commuter,
although some people make up to 15 journeys on a weekly ticket, a discount
of 40 per cent.
LT may have greater scope to reduce its 30 per cent discount because many
commuters have no alternative means of travel.
But if it pushes prices too high travellers might be tempted to take to
their cars, increasing congestion. If they stayed with public transport but
bought single tickets, queues would lengthen, bus boarding times would
increase and the cashflow benefit of advance payments would be lost.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Privatisation tops Major's agenda for foreign tour: Saudis
and S Africans seek help
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saudi Arabia and South Africa have asked the UK government for advice on
privatisation programmes that could generate massive consultancy and
flotation fees for British companies.
British officials say privatisation will be near the top of Mr John Major's
agenda on his five-day visit to the two countries and Abu Dhabi which starts
tomorrow.
More than a dozen top businessmen will accompany Mr Major. The group
includes senior executives of privatised companies, merchant banks and
stockbrokers. Mr Anthony Nelson, the Treasury minister responsible for
privatisation, is also going.
The trip is the first visit to South Africa by a British prime minister
since Harold Macmillan's 'wind of change' speech in 1960, which signalled
the start of the white-run government's international isolation.
Mr Major will hold talks with President Nelson Mandela, and his
vice-presidents Mr Thabo Mbeki and Mr FW De Klerk. He will also meet Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Zulu leader. The prime minister will announce more
aid for South Africa.
However, the focus of the trip will be on developing business opportunities
identified during an exploratory visit in July by Mr Michael Heseltine, the
trade and industry secretary.
The African National Congress ruled out privatisation before winning the
elections - but the multi-party government is considering asset sales as a
means of raising money to finance its reconstruction and development plans.
The state-owned railways, ports and airline are thought to be possible
candidates for privatisation, with the water industry and Telkom, the
telecommunications agency. The government also owns a number of businesses
such a phosphorus mine and a gas field which could be sold. Political
demands for land reform would probably prevent the disposal of the state's
vast land holdings.
Many of the British companies represented in the party have long-standing
links with South Africa, and some are believed to have held preliminary
talks with government officials since the election.
Mr Michael Marks, chief executive of stockbroker Smith New Court, said: 'We
think there might be quite a lot of opportunities as the government looks
for ways to finance its reconstruction programme, and we want to be part of
that.'
South Africa is also thought to be interested in buying British naval patrol
craft and military aircraft. But British officials said no deals were likely
to be finalised during the trip.
Saudi Arabia is said to be considering the privatisation of part of its
extensive public sector to replenish its reserves which were severely
depleted by the cost of the Gulf war.
The government has run a budget deficit for the last 12 years as a result of
declining real prices for oil exports and rising spending, particularly on
arms.
The state-owned telecommunications, petrochemicals, and airline businesses
are thought to be potential candidates for privatisation.
British Aerospace is thought to be close to finalising the sale of about 40
aircraft to Saudi Arabia under the Al Yamamah II arms deal, under which
payment is made in oil.
The business party with the prime minister includes Mr Howard Davies, CBI
director-general; Mr Tim Barker, vice-chairman of Kleinwort Benson; Earl
Cairns, chief executive of SG Warburg; Mr Michael Dobson, chief executive of
Morgan Grenfell; Sir Christopher Benson, chairman of construction group
Costain and Sir Ralph Robins, chairman of Rolls-Royce.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Cambridge votes for status quo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cambridgeshire residents prefer the existing two-tier system of districts
and counties, according to the results of a referendum announced yesterday.
Keeping the status quo was the most popular option in the 'advisory
referendum' carried out by the Local Government Commission - even though
this was not among the structures proposed by the commission.
It was favoured by 38 per cent of those who responded. The commission's own
preference for abolishing the two-tier structure and replacing it with three
all-purpose unitary councils was favoured by 23 per cent, while alternative
proposals for two and four unitary authorities were both favoured by only 14
per cent of respondents.
Almost 10 per cent of the county's 293,816 households responded to the
questionnaire from the commission - a much higher turn-out than in
Leicestershire, where only 2.3 per cent of residents partici-pated.
However in Huntingdonshire, which stands to regain administrative
independence lost in the reorganisation of 1974, 47 per cent favoured the
commission's proposal. This repeats the pattern for Leicestershire, where
residents of Rutland, another county which ceased to exist in 1974, strongly
supported a return to the old boundaries.
There were overall majorities in favour of the two-tier system in both East
Cambridgeshire and South Cambridgeshire districts, while a majority in the
Fenland district favoured creating four unitaries.

FT  17 SEP 94 / City disappointed at Pounds 3.2bn budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's budget deficit deepened unexpectedly to Pounds 3.21bn in
August from Pounds 1.1bn in July, well above City forecasts of Pounds 2.1bn.
But the public sector borrowing requirement for the first five months of the
financial year was Pounds 15.5bn, down from Pounds 18.1bn in the same period
last year, indicating that the Treasury is still on course to reach its
forecast of Pounds 36.1bn for the PSBR in 1994-95.
Part of the reason for this month's figure was high central government
outlays and smaller repayments by local authorities and public corporations.
Analysts were disappointed by the August figure - but remained optimistic
about long-term PSBR prospects, predicting a deficit of between Pounds 30bn
and Pounds 34bn.
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, said: 'This month's
deficit will restrain wildly optimistic forecasts. But it is better to look
at a run of months because you will realise that tax receipts in general are
rising more strongly than public expenditure, so an undershoot on the
government's forecast is still on the cards.'
Receipts from taxes, excise duties and other income totalled Pounds 17.19bn
for August, up from Pounds 15.56bn in the same month last year, but down
from Pounds 19.3bn in July. In the five months to August cash income was
Pounds 87.1bn, a rise of 5.5 per cent from Pounds 82.5bn in the same period
in 1993-94.
Cash outlays for August were Pounds 20.97bn, up from Pounds 20.39bn in
August last year and Pounds 20.79bn in July. In the five months to August
cash outlays were Pounds 104.1bn, up 2.5 per cent from Pounds 101.5bn in the
equivalent period last year. Net departmental outlays in the five months
were Pounds 98.3bn, similar to the same period in 1993-94.
The auction of privatised companies' debt brought in Pounds 1.3bn in August.
If these privatisation proceeds are excluded, the August deficit was Pounds
4.49bn and the running figure for the year is Pounds 17.7bn, compared with
Pounds 21.6bn in the same period last year.
Central government borrowing on its own account was Pounds 3.8bn in August
and Pounds 17bn for the financial year to date, against Pounds 19bn in the
same five months last year. Excluding privatisation proceeds, the figure
rose to Pounds 5.1bn in August, Pounds 19.3bn for the year.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Japan savings bank in Pounds 9bn exchange loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's postal ministry, custodian of the world's largest savings bank, has
revealed foreign exchange losses of at least Y1,374bn (Pounds 9bn) caused by
the rise in the Japanese currency.
The shortfall, on the yen value of overseas bonds and shares bought by the
postal savings bank and the postal life insurance up to the end of March, is
unlikely to be turned into a cash loss because both institutions are
long-term investors, over 15 to 20 years, say officials. By that time, they
hope the yen will have weakened enough against the foreign currencies
involved, mainly US and Canadian dollars and sterling, to yield a profit.
Yet the speed at which the postal institutions' foreign currency losses have
risen, by 36 per cent in the year to last March, has worsened the postal
ministry's poor relations with the finance ministry. Postal officials are
unhappy over being informally asked by the finance ministry to avoid selling
foreign equities to help government efforts to curb the yen's rise.
They have lobbied the finance ministry for permission to use derivatives to
hedge foreign exchange exposure, but financial officials do not want state
institutions to be seen using such instruments, blamed for creating
volatility in Tokyo's capital markets.
The yen's continued rise, from an average of Y107.8 to the dollar in March,
when the postal funds closed their books, to around Y99 yesterday, suggests
that losses on the yen value of foreign securities will have grown since
then. Of the total deficit, Y910bn is attributable to the postal life
insurer's Y4,222bn foreign exchange holdings, while the remaining Y464.2bn
is from the postal savings bank's Y2,354bn foreign holdings.
Postal fund managers will reduce purchases of foreign securities this year,
said a postal life insurance official yesterday. 'We are now very very
cautious about buying foreign holdings,' he said.
Until now, the postal ministry has increased purchases of US and Canadian
securities whenever private sector investors have sold the same paper,
according to Mr Richard Koo, senior economist at the Nomura Research
Institute. 'At times, they provided, intentionally or otherwise, back-up for
the Bank of Japan's foreign exchange information,' he wrote in NRI's latest
monthly guide to Japanese investment. He expects the ministry's new caution
to spread to other Japanese investors.
The rise in the postal institutions' foreign exchange losses is
unsurprising, since they bought overseas securities heavily in early 1993,
when it looked as if the yen might stabilise at around Y120 to the dollar,
said Mr Robert Feldman, director of economic research at Salomon Brothers
Asia. However, in the long run, the postal institutions could well end up
with a profit on their foreign holdings, he predicted.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Officials strain at finance ministry leash: Bureaucrats at
loggerheads over Japanese rules for investing public funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Y1,374bn (Pounds 9bn) foreign exchange loss on Japan's postal ministry
investments highlights the conflict between the finance ministry and other
ministries over the management of investment funds. The postal ministry
wants to hedge its foreign assets by using currency futures and options and
blame their unrealised foreign exchange losses on legislation which
prohibits the use of such financial instruments.
Fund managers of the Y72,300bn postal insurance also want legal changes
which will allow them to invest in property. They argue that current weak
conditions in the property market make it suitable for investment. And the
postal ministry wants to diversify investments into corporate lending aside
from the conventional stocks, bonds and deposits. This has met loud
opposition from the commercial banks, since it would hurt lending to
companies which is already dwindling because of faltering demand stemming
from the sluggish economy.
The postal ministry is joined by the health and welfare ministry in fighting
for more autonomy over investments of funds totalling more than Y350,000bn
collected through the state pension system - over which the health and
welfare ministry holds jurisdiction.
The finance ministry lays down rules about how such funds are to be invested
in order to maintain 'prudent' fund management. However, the two ministries
claim that in order to maximise returns, the funds need to be managed more
efficiently through diversified investments.
The health and welfare ministry wants to raise investment returns ahead of
the surge in state pension receipts at the turn of the century. It is
demanding that limits on investments - 50 per cent of the funds must be
invested into bonds, while stocks and foreign assets cannot exceed 30 per
cent - be eased.
Ministry officials also want to hire investment advisers, including European
and US fund managers, to manage the funds. Currently, funds are allocated to
14 life assurers and 15 trust banks, with one institution managing as much
as Y2,000bn. The US government has long been pushing for similar changes
since it would mean greater opportunities for US fund managers.
The finance ministry officials argue that high risk investments such as
stocks, in which investment advisers hold high expertise, could lead to
losses and hence hurt the policy holder.
The health ministry wants to manage its funds directly instead of the
current arrangement, whereby the bulk of the Y100,000bn state pension fund
reserves are funnelled into low-interest loans for public works and the
health ministry borrows Y20,000bn from the finance ministry to invest in
financial instruments deemed suitable by law.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Rabin ready to return entire Golan Heights: Israeli premier
set to drop election pledge in order to win peace deal with Syria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
At the height of a stormy Knesset debate this week on the future of the
Golan Heights, Mr Uzi Landau, a hardliner from the main opposition Likud
party, declared bluntly from the podium that Israeli premier Yitzhak Rabin
was 'a liar'.
When seeking election two years ago, he recalled, Mr Rabin had promised
never to sanction Israeli withdrawal from the entire Golan Heights. Yet now,
Mr Landau charged, Mr Rabin was planning exactly that: a full pull-out in
exchange for full peace with Syria.
Sitting in the front row of the hall, Mr Rabin flushed a deep red, and
turned furiously to Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, the Likud party leader, demanding
that Mr Landau be condemned for branding him a liar. Mr Netanyahu grinned,
and retorted that he would be happy to condemn Mr Landau in the strongest
terms 'as soon as you convince me that you're not planning to withdraw from
the Golan'.
Mr Rabin had no answer for that: he stood up and, without another word,
stalked out of the chamber.
The lesson from this extraordinary exchange is plain: Mr Rabin has indeed
changed his mind and his policies. The man who just two years ago said, and
believed, that to abandon Golan was severely to undermine Israel's security,
now thinks differently.
Privately, and anonymously, some of his aides are confirming what Mr Rabin's
Likud critics and the leaders of the 13,000 Jewish residents of Golan have
been saying for several weeks now: that the prime minister now considers a
peace treaty with Syria, the last and most implacable of Israel's former
ring of neighbouring antagonists, to be worth the price of a complete
pull-out.
Mr Rabin has said nothing too explicit in public, but he has been dropping
hints. In recent interviews marking the Jewish New Year, he expressed his
firm hope that an accord could swiftly be reached with Syria, despite the
'painful compromises' he knew would be involved. Earlier this month, he
unveiled a simplified peace formula - providing for an initial 'slight'
Golan withdrawal, to be followed after three years of normalised relations
by a 'substantial' pull-out. Crucially, cabinet sources stress, he did not
rule out a complete withdrawal.
And when, a few days later, Syrian President Hafez Assad responded with a
speech to his parliament, intimating that Syria was ready for full relations
with Israel provided the entire Golan was returned, Mr Rabin and his
ministers reacted positively. An old equation; a newly upbeat Israeli
response.
Just over a year ago, Mr Rabin departed from a policy he had endorsed for
decades, and grudgingly stretched out a hand to welcome the Mr Yassir
Arafat, leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, into the peace
process. Now, his aides indicate, he has made another strategic policy
departure, abandoning his insistence on retaining at least part of the
Golan.
Why has the prime minister - who as chief of staff in 1967 oversaw the
capture of the Golan Heights - changed his position, flying in the face of
his own Labour party platform?
Mr Yoel Marcus, a veteran observer of Mr Rabin who writes for the respected
Ha'aretz daily newspaper, put it simply yesterday: 'He has come to the
conclusion that peace without the Golan will contribute more to Israel's
security than the continued retention of the Golan without peace.'
Three dozen Iraqi Scud missiles during the Gulf war taught him that land is
not the peerless security asset it once was. And with Egypt, the PLO and
Jordan on board, a deal with Syria - and the accord with Lebanon that would
automatically follow - would give Israel peace on all frontiers. At 72, Mr
Rabin is nearing the end of his political career; a treaty with Damascus
would be a crowning achievement.
However, at present, the prime minister does not even have his whole party,
let alone the country, behind him.
Mr Avigdor Kahalani, a Labour backbencher who, as a battalion commander, was
one of the heroes of bitter fighting on the Golan in the 1973 war, is
defying Mr Rabin by leading a bipartisan campaign against withdrawal. A
group of Golan residents are several days into an anti-withdrawal hunger
strike. And an opinion poll published this week indicated that fewer than 50
per cent of the electorate are ready for even a partial withdrawal.
But these are early days. Mr Dennis Ross, the US Middle East peace talks
co-ordinator, is due in Israel next week for a series of Jerusalem-Damascus
mediation trips. His boss, secretary of state Warren Christopher, is
expected next month. By the end of the year, says Israeli army chief of
staff Ehud Barak, believed to be one of the very few aides directly involved
with Mr Rabin in the secretive peace manoeuvrings with Damascus, 'we could
well be in the midst of negotiations with Syria.'
Mr Rabin has pledged that, when the final deal is drafted, assuming it
involves significant territorial concessions, he will hold a referendum.
As things stand today, he would lose, but he will doubtless utilise the next
few months to prepare the Israeli public for the bitter pill of complete
withdrawal, seeking to sweeten it by persuading President Assad to come to
Jerusalem or at least meet him for a smiling eve-of-referendum summit.
After all, if President Assad wants the entire Golan Heights back, it is he,
not Mr Rabin, who will have to play the main role in persuading a sceptical
Israeli electorate of the virtues of the full-withdrawal-for-full-peace
equation.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Hurd doubts on Hong Kong talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The depth of official concern over Hong Kong was underlined yesterday when
Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, admitted that existing
machinery for discussing with Beijing the colony's reversion to Chinese
sovereignty in 1997 was inadequate.
Mr Hurd, at the end of a two-day visit to Hong Kong, said Britain and China
needed to be 'imaginative' in finding ways to accelerate the work of the
Joint Liaison Group, a body established in 1984 to oversee the detail of
Hong Kong's reversion to China.
'If present procedures need adaptation, if work can be done in a different
way in order to accelerate it, in order that purely technical matters can be
dealt with without a political overtone - well, this is something the two
sides can discuss,' he said.
It was not readily apparent what imaginative steps the two sides could take
to accelerate work in the JLG. Mr Hurd met the British and Chinese
representatives to the JLG yesterday. After the meeting, Mr Hugh Davies,
Britain's senior representative to the body, said both sides would look at
ways to speed progress at next week's plenary session of the JLG in Beijing.
There is, however, deepening concern among British and Hong Kong officials
that the JLG will not be able to complete its work by 1997. Next week's
meeting is taking place against a background of diminishing expectations; on
present trends the colony runs the risk that many statutes will be invalid
after China takes over because they have not been 'localised'.
Mr Allen Lee, a conservative politician, said Mr Hurd during a meeting with
legislators had spoken of 'an imperfect transition' because of the lack of
progress in the JLG. The foreign secretary also told legislators that 1997
marked the end of British Empire and that Britain did not want to see it end
in a 'shabby way'. Mr Hurd will meet Mr Qian Qichen, his Chinese
counterpart, in New York the week after next. The Chinese government has
already sought to play down the significance of the meeting.
The foreign secretary said he would tell Mr Qian Britain was serious about
co-operating with China on Hong Kong matters. Both sides had a legal
commitment to do so and had a shared interest in seeing the colony enjoyed a
smooth transition to Chinese sovereignty.
Hong Kong will force 82 Vietnamese asylum seekers to return home next week,
it said yesterday, resuming a controversial policy suspended after police
tear-gassed protesting Vietnamese in April, AP reports from Hong Kong.
Human rights groups condemned the announcement, as Vietnamese in detention
continued a hunger strike in protest at forced repatriations.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Fast growth for Chinese groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By A Beijing Correspondent and AP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Market reform in China is producing an expanding corps of fast-growing
conglomerates which will be in the forefront of foreign trade initiatives
and industrial restructuring, according to a new survey.
The assessment - conducted by the Development Research Centre under the
government's State Council, the State Statistics Bureau, and Management
World, the Beijing magazine - found China's largest companies recorded
higher growth and efficiency in 1993 and were evolving into industrial
groups that will set the pace for reforming the loss-ridden state sector,
the magazine said.
The Chinese corporate evaluation shows sales volume in 1993 increased 61.2
per cent over 1992 to Yn1,023bn (Pounds 77bn). Profits and taxes rose 37 per
cent in 1993 to Yn156bn. The top 500 companies represented only 1 per cent
of Chinese enterprises but accounted for 40 per cent of profits and tax
payments, the survey said.
The number of companies with sales in excess of Yn1bn totalled 287, up from
254 in 1992. The smallest of the 500 reported sales of Yn570m, reflecting
sharp growth from 1992, when the smallest recorded sales of Yn370m.
The 500 are located mainly in the city of Shanghai, Guangdong and Liaoning
provinces and several other fast-growing coastal provinces, and are are
concentrated in metallurgical and industrial and transport machinery
sectors.
The top ten companies and their sales volumes are: Shanghai Automotive
Industry, Yn30.7bn; Daqing Petroleum Administration, Yn27bn; Anshan Iron &amp;
Steel Group, Yn21.7bn; No 1 Automotive Works, Yn21.6bn; Baoshan Iron &amp; Steel
Group, Yn20.2bn; Dongfeng Automotive, Yn20bn; Capital Steel Complex,
Yn17.5bn; Shenli Petroleum Administration, Yn14.6bn; Wuhan Iron &amp; Steel
Group, Yn14bn; Beijing Yanshan Petrochemical, Yn11.4bn. China is showing new
flexibility on trade issues Australia wants resolved before it will agree to
China's admission to Gatt, the Australian trade minister said yesterday, AP
reports from Beijing.
Mr Bob McMullan met his Chinese counterpart, Mr Wu Yi, in concluding a visit
to Beijing, Shanghai and Canton.
Australia's main concern is that China lower or eliminate tariffs on wool.
Talks on trade issues concerning Australia had been frozen, but the tone of
his meetings in China convinced him there was 'room for flexibility,' Mr
McMullan said.
China wants to be a Gatt member before January 1 so that it can be a
founding member of Gatt's successor, the World Trade Organisation.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Palestinian economics chief offers to resign over funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ahmed Korei, minister of economics and trade in the Palestinian Authority
running self-rule in Jericho and the Gaza Strip, yesterday expressed grave
pessimism over the future of the autonomy process and indicated he was on
the point of resigning.
In a telephone interview with the Financial Times, Mr Korei, who is also
known as Abu Ala, responded to reports that he had already submitted his
resignation to the PLO chairman, Mr Yasser Arafat, by saying: 'I am still
not resigned officially. The final decision will come in two or three days.'
He added that he would not be attending today's weekly meeting of the
Palestinian Authority in Gaza. Palestinian sources suggested that Mr Korei
might have filed a letter of resignation, and was now awaiting Mr Arafat's
reaction.
Mr Korei was arguably the key Palestinian architect of the Israel-PLO
autonomy accords, leading Palestinian delegates through the months of secret
talks in Oslo that preceded the official signing ceremony at the White House
just over a year ago.
He is respected by both Israeli economic officials and international donors,
and his departure would be a painful blow for Mr Arafat personally and for
the fragile autonomy process, which is already being undermined by the
non-arrival of hundreds of millions of dollars of pledged international aid.
Mr Korei is known to hold Mr Arafat responsible for some of the funding
shortages, complaining privately that the PLO chairman is scaring off
would-be donors by insisting on personally overseeing the disbursement of
funds rather than establishing fully accountable institutions to perform the
job.
In a veiled attack on Mr Arafat yesterday, he said Japan, Gulf countries,
the west and other donors 'want to help the Palestinian cause' but were
withholding promised funds 'because they want institutions to deal with'. He
noted that 'no more than Dollars 50m' had been received so far, out of
Dollars 2.5bn in aid pledges.
That lack of money, combined with the slow-moving pace of the autonomy
process, he said, left him 'very pessimistic'.
He said that, under the terms of the autonomy accords, the Israeli army
should by now have redeployed away from Palestinian population centres in
the West Bank, that the Israeli civil administration in the occupied
territories ought to have been dismantled, and that preparations should have
been well in hand for democratic Palestinian elections.

FT  17 SEP 94 / The candidate and the TV magnate: Subtle media manipulation
has boosted Cardoso, the favourite in Brazil's election - A look at a
real-life election 'novela' that is prompting complaints from opposition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazilian TV, better known for screening scantily clad women, is running a
strange commercial. Paid for by one of the country's largest construction
companies, the advertisement talks of the need for improvements in education
and advises viewers to elect a president in next month's elections who
'knows how to teach'.
The commercial seems a clear attempt to lift support for Mr Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, the former finance minister and government candidate. Mr
Cardoso was a university professor while his rival, the left-wing Mr Luiz
Inacio Lula da Silva, barely finished high school and has a slight lisping
accent, which is the target of middle-class derision.
Such support for Mr Cardoso from business and the media has helped
consolidate his lead in opinion polls and led to complaints from Mr da Silva
that the elections are no longer fair.
The claim seemed to gain weight when Mr Rubens Ricupero was forced to resign
as Brazil's finance minister earlier this month after remarks he made in a
private interview were broadcast by mistake.
Mr Ricupero let slip that TV Globo, which is sometimes watched by half the
country's 157m people, was using him regularly on programmes as a way of
supporting Mr Cardoso. Globo's owner, Mr Roberto Marinho, has not concealed
his support for Mr Cardoso, nor his unease with Mr da Silva.
Mr Ricupero's indiscretion is embarrassing for Globo, especially since the
station wanted to regain credibility lost when, in 1989, it helped elect
former president Fernando Collor, who later resigned amid corruption
charges.
Mr Cardoso's extraordinary rise in the polls, from about 20 per cent in June
to more than double that figure today, would not have been possible without
the Real, Brazil's new currency launched on July 1.
Mr Cardoso planned the new currency when he was finance minister before Mr
Ricupero. Monthly inflation fell from 50 per cent to 5 per cent, giving
poorer wage earners an apparent increase in purchasing power.
Mr Cardoso has also benefited from the optimism which has swept Brazil since
the currency's launch. This is partly a reaction to 10 years of economic and
political bad news. But it has also been manipulated by the media, in a
country where only 30 per cent of Brazilians complete eight years of primary
school, and where in some states illiteracy is above 40 per cent.
TV Globo has been scrupulously fair in the time it gives each of the main
candidates in its evening news broadcasts. But the station then fills the
rest of its reports with feel-good news stories about the success of the
Real, thereby lifting Mr Cardoso's credibility.
After the news comes the TV 'novela', or soap opera. Novelas are extremely
popular in Brazil and play an important political role. Globo launched a new

de Lima of Brasilia University.
The support for Mr Cardoso has prompted complaints from Mr da Silva's
Workers' party, the PT. Pointing out that Mr Cardoso is supported by the
government, most businessmen and the media, Mr da Silva said recently:
'These elections are not as free and fair as we would like.'
The PT complains that media ownership is too closely concentrated in the
hands of too few, largely right-wing, people. According to some estimates,
nine families - of which Mr Marinho's is the most important  - own 68 of
Brazil's 71 TV concessions.
But if Mr Cardoso wins the elections as expected, the PT is unlikely to
succeed in its efforts to widen media ownership. Mr Cardoso's main backer,
Mr Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, , owns the TV Globo franchise in his home state
of Bahia, as well as several radio licences. He and other of Mr Cardoso's
supporters are unlikely to welcome moves to break their monopoly.

Brazil's car workers are likely to return to work next week after reaching a
compromise with the government and manufacturers over an 11.9 per cent pay
claim.
The main unions, which went on strike on Monday, bringing Brazil's important
car industry near to a standstill, are to decide at meetings at the weekend
whether to return to work. But union leaders and manufacturers'
representatives are hopeful the dispute is over, and some people returned to
work yesterday.
The breakthrough came when the government withdrew from negotiations and
said that it would not stand in the way of a one-off pay rise, as long as
the increase was not passed on to customers in the form of higher prices.
The government is trying to protect its new currency, the Real, from
inflation, and argues that car makers can afford to pay for the increase
from recent productivity gains, instead of by pushing up prices.
The deal could lead to demands for pay rises from other unions. According to
rules issued at the time of the Real's launch, pay rises can only be granted
during each union's annual pay round. Since the pay round for the main car
unions was not scheduled until April, other workers may now push to speed
their claims.
A widespread round of wage increases could weaken the Real, since it would
be likely to add to consumer demand. Some economists say demand is already
rising too quickly because of the rapid fall in inflation following the
Real's introduction in July.
The strike, which has so far led to lost production of 18,000 vehicles,
mainly at Volkswagen, Ford and Mercedes-Benz, seems to have had no effect on
the standing of either of the main candidates competing in next month's
presidential election.

Creditors to commercial banks in Peru are set to re-open formal negotiations
regarding the restructuring of Dollars 7bn of commercial bank debt, a senior
banker said yesterday. Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citibank, which
heads the country's bank advisory committee, is to meet Peru's minister of
the economy around the time of the International Monetary Fund's Madrid
meeting early next month. The way for reopening talks has been cleared by a
recommendation from a Peruvian congressional committee this week that loans
made by two US banks - American Express and Chemical Bank - should be
recognised. Peru's Congress is expected to discuss the recommendation on the
loans next week, and the committee's view is expected to have a strong
bearing on the decision. The two banks claim some Dollars 36m, as well as
perhaps twice that amount in unpaid interest. The loans were repudiated by
the 1985-90 government of Mr Alan Garcia.

Striking a blow to US nuclear disarmament efforts, Ukraine will not accede
to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) this year, said the country's
parliamentary chairman, Mr Alexander Moroz. He indicated a vote would not
come until January, adding: 'We cannot be indifferent to the NPT's
shortcomings.' Ukraine has been pressed by the West formally to declare
itself a non-nuclear state under NPT, and President Leonid Kuchma was
expected to ask parliament to vote on the treaty next month. But Mr Moroz's
opposition makes that unlikely. Ukrainian leaders complain that the US has
delivered less than Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.4m) of Dollars 350m promised for
dismantlement as part of a January agreement to deploy Ukraine's nuclear
arsenal to Russia. They say the US keeps moving the target for smooth
relations and economic aid, from the January agreement to the NPT.

A widening gap between Russia and the west over security structures in
Europe was left unbridged by talks in Prague yesterday intended to prepare
for the December summit of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe (CSCE). Russia wants to establish a 10-nation CSCE steering committee
modelled on the UN Security Council, able to issue mandates for
peace-keeping operations. At the Prague meeting of senior officials from the
53 CSCE member states, most western officials flatly rejected the Russian
proposals on the grounds that they would diminish the status of Nato. In a
separate dispute, Russia wants maximum freedom of action for its military
activities in the southern republics of the former Soviet Union, while
western countries are reluctant to give Moscow carte blanche.

<TEXT>
A confidential report by an Independent Court of Auditors has criticised the
French foreign ministry for waste, bad accounting and steeply rising costs.
However, the foreign minister, Mr Alain Juppe, maintained that the report
referred to the period before his appointment, blaming his Socialist
predecessor. The report, leaked to the weekly magazine L'Express, said the
costs of official travel and the receipt of visiting VIPs by the French
president and prime minister soared from FFr81.5m (Pounds 9.8m) in 1987 to
FFr391m in 1991 before falling to FFr185m in 1992. In its defence, the
foreign ministry said that while these costs were part of its budget, it had
no control over travel by the president or the prime minister. The report
concluded that large amounts of cash were unaccounted for, and that the
ministry had no central supervision or computer records of payments.

The Bank of Spain said yesterday it was studying a relaxation of its strict
accounting regulations on bond portfolio provisioning by domestic financial
institutions, in a move that should sharply increase home demand for
government paper. Pressure for easier rulings has come from both the
domestic banks, which have suffered losses in their trading operations this
year, and from the treasury, which is becoming concerned over net medium-
and long-term bond sales by non-residents. Government paper held by Spanish
banks in active trading portfolios currently has to be marked to market on a
monthly basis and losses must be fully provided. The regulations are less
aggressive for bonds held in investment portfolios but are also considered
to be more stringent than those imposed by other central banks.

South Africa has announced plans to restructure its controversial R2bn
(Pounds 285m) a year General Export Incentive Scheme from next April and
will scrap it completely by the end of 1997. Under the new cabinet-approved
plan, all subsidies currently paid out to exporters under GEIS will be
phased out over three years. The planned cuts are broadly in line with
recommendations by the National Economic Forum, a tripartite group
incorporating representatives from business, government and labour, but have
been strongly opposed by the paper and iron and steel industries. The moves
follow tariffs cuts on various imported goods announced last month and are
part of a sustained effort by the government to increase the competitiveness
of local industry. GEIS was introduced five years ago as part of a programme
to wean South Africa from its overdependence on primary commodity exports by
offering a wide range of subsidies for the export of manufactured goods.

A federal jury in Anchorage yesterday ordered Exxon, the US oil group, to
pay Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn) in punitive damages for the 1989 wreck of its
Exxon Valdez tanker, which caused the US's worst ever oil spill in Alaska's
Prince William Sound. The award, which will go to fishermen, native
Alaskans, property owners and coastal municipalities, comes on top of a
Dollars 287m award of compensation for damage to fish stocks. The jury also
ordered Mr Joseph Hazelwood, the Exxon Valdez's captain, to pay Dollars
5,000 in punitive damages.
The plaintiffs had asked for punitive damages of up to Dollars 20bn after
the jury found the wreck was caused by the recklessness of Exxon and Mr
Hazelwood. But Exxon argued that it had spent Dollars 3bn to clean up the
spill and to settle lawsuits with the state and federal governments. It has
indicated it will appeal against the award.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Kaiser averts Ghana smelter shutdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ghanaian power authorities and Kaiser Aluminium Company have averted a total
shutdown of Kaiser's big Volta River valley smelter while negotiations over
the company's access to cheap hydropower in the region continue.
In an agreement announced yesterday, Kaiser will close one of the smelter's
potlines, or about 40,000 tonnes of annual capacity, tomorrow.
Depending on conditions, another 20,000 tonnes of capacity could be shut by
year-end. This would reduce the Ghanaian smelter's annual production to
about 80,000 tonnes.
Kaiser, responding to low water levels, trimmed about 30 per cent of the
smelter's output last spring.
A prolonged drought in Ghana has lowered water levels in the Volta Lake
region, and caused the Volta River Authority to notify Kaiser earlier this
month that it would be forced to cut off power to the smelter on September
10. The smelter produces 200,000 tonnes of aluminium a year when operating
at full capacity.
Kaiser appealed against the decision, saying that the action was premature.
The company maintained that lake levels had begun to rise, and that the
country's rainy season had not ended.
'We have agreed to talk with officials at the Volta River Authority in late
October to reassess the situation,' said Mr Scott Lamb, a Kaiser spokesman.
'At that time we will review the rainfall situation, discuss compensation
due the company for the curtailment, and explore other matters related to
the power contract.'
In addition to the smelter, the Volta River Authority must meet the
electricity needs of local residents and small industrial concerns.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Cuba to follow up immigration accord with US: Havana sees
crack in sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PASCAL FLETCHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HAVANA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cuba is quietly intensifying diplomatic efforts to widen what it perceives
as a crack in US sanctions following an immigration accord reached a week
ago with Washington.
'The accord in itself is a blow to the US policy of blockade,' Cuba's chief
negotiator at the immigration talks, Mr Ricardo Alarcon, said on Cuban
television on Thursday night.
Mr Alarcon, president of the island's National Assembly, said the September
9 immigration agreement, which aimed to halt an exodus of illegal refugees
fleeing Cuba by sea to the US, showed the US and Cuba could develop a normal
relationship in at least one area: immigration.
Mr Alarcon said the US had encouraged illegal immigration by Cubans in the
past to try to destabilise President Fidel Castro's government, but had now
agreed to work with Cuba to stop illegal departures, including air and sea
hijacks.
Outlining what else the Cuban government felt it had gained from the talks,
Mr Alarcon said they had generated a groundswell of opinion in the US
calling for a re-think of US policy towards Cuba and renewed dialogue.
He cited editorials to this effect published by leading US newspapers and
public comments by senior congressmen such as Lee Hamilton, President of the
foreign relations committee of the House of Representatives.
Senior US administration officials, however, had repeatedly stressed the
talks would deal with the immigration problem and nothing else. But the
Cuban government, which says its conflict with the US cannot be solved if
the lifting of the US trade embargo is not discussed, is clearly hoping to
capitalise on the publicity generated by the talks to keep attention focused
on the embargo issue.
Mr Alarcon said a fundamental point of disagreement had been the US failure
to lift additional sanctions on Cuba imposed by US President Bill Clinton on
August 20. These placed restrictions on hard currency remittances sent by
Cuban-Americans in the US to relatives in Cuba, as well as reducing flights
between the two countries and visits by family members.
Mr Alarcon said these latest sanctions were intended to appease the
right-wing sector of the Cuban exile community in Miami, which strongly
opposed any direct dialogue. But the measures were hurting Cuban-Americans
in the US as much as Cubans on the island, he said.
Although the outcome of the immigration talks had been encouraging, Mr
Alarcon made clear he did not consider that an end to the US-Cuban dispute
was imminent.
He rejected US demands for Cuba to change its one-party political system,
improve human rights and reform its centrally-run economy.
'We are being generous enough in saying we are willing to discuss the
embargo. It should be lifted. Full stop,' he said.
He cited an existing UN General Assembly resolution condemning the US
embargo against Cuba and calling for it to be lifted.
Under the September 9 immigration accord, Washington said it would allow a
minimum of 20,000 Cubans to migrate legally to the US each year. In return,
Cuba moved to halt illegal departures by Cubans to the US following the
exodus of around 30,000 Cubans by sea over the last six weeks.
The progress of the accord will be reviewed at talks to be held no later
than 45 days after September 9.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Swedish Elections: Social Democrats' lead narrows as poll
looms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's Social Democratic Party appeared yesterday to be heading for a
narrow win in tomorrow's general election, but a victory that once seemed
assured has been thrown into some doubt by a steady fall in its opinion poll
ratings in the past two weeks.
Yesterday, a clutch of polls indicated the balance between the opposition
Social Democrats, the country's largest single party, and prime minister
Carl Bildt's four-party right-centre coalition was finely poised.
SWEDISH ELECTIONS
One poll showed the government parties leading the Social Democrats by 43.9
per cent to 40.4 per cent.
Although the coalition trailed by up to five points in three other polls,
the results were enough to give Mr Bildt some hope of defying the
months-long predictions of a Social Democratic victory.
With pollsters reporting as many as 16 per cent of voters still undecided,
much was thought to depend on the outcome last night of a marathon
three-hour television debate involving the leaders of all eight parties
contesting the election.
However, a tough obstacle facing Mr Bildt in his push for a last-minute
victory was the near certain return to the Riksdag of the Environment party,
which failed to get elected in 1991.
If, as seems likely, the former communist Left party also holds its place in
parliament, the present coalition would be far short of a parliamentary
majority even if it outstrips the Social Democrats.
That makes Mr Ingvar Carlsson, Social Democratic leader, the continued
favourite to form the next government, despite a lacklustre campaign in
which he has appeared alternately complacent, tired and afraid.
He is likely to seek an alliance with the Liberal party, at present part of
Mr Bildt's coalition, to avoid being dependent on the left and the greens
for a majority.
The Social Democrats held an opinion poll rating of more than 50 per cent as
little as three weeks ago, but have been slipping since they unveiled a
SKr61bn package of tax increases and spending cuts to tackle the country's
big budget deficit and fast-growing government debt.
They have lost votes heavily to the Left party and to the Environment party,
apparently among public sector workers anxious about the party's commitment
to cut some welfare spending.
But they have also begun to lose some votes to government parties both over
their plans to raise income taxes and a specific proposal to cut some
benefits to parents taking time off work to look after sick children.

FT  17 SEP 94 / EU action on textiles pact 'a travesty'

<TEXT>
The European Union, the world's largest textiles and clothing importer,
appears set to take only token steps to open its market when it starts
implementing a landmark Uruguay Round accord to liberalise trade in the
products from the start of next year.
Though permissible under the Uruguay Round, the approach currently favoured
in Brussels was described by one European government official yesterday as
'against the spirit of the Gatt.'
The Uruguay Round agreement brings textiles and clothing for the first time
under Gatt rules and commits the body's members to eliminate by 2006 the
Multi-Fibre Arrangements, which tightly restrict the Dollars 240bn (Pounds
154bn) annual world trade in the products.
Under the deal, countries have to subject at least 16 per cent of their
textiles and clothing imports to Gatt disciplines in the next three years.
This is the first of three phases in the planned dismantling of the
20-year-old MFA.
However, the Commission is proposing - with apparent backing from most EU
states - to carry out this commitment in a way which would leave the range
of products covered by MFA quotas virtually unchanged until 1998.
The Commission plans to do this by subjecting to Gatt rules products which
are mostly exempt from MFA quotas. Many will be chosen from a list which
includes items such as hats, umbrellas, car seat belts and parachutes, but
excludes mass-market products such as cotton garments. The EU imported about
Dollars 51bn of textiles and clothing products in 1992, mostly from
developing countries.
The World Development Movement, a Third World lobby group which has analysed
the Commission proposals, estimates they would result in the EU lifting
restrictions on only 0.1 per cent of products on which it imposes quotas. It
said the EU's move was 'a travesty' of the agreement to phase out the MFA.
Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark are pressing for a more
liberal approach but are strongly opposed by southern European EU members,
which have politically powerful textile industry lobbies.
Gatt members must submit final proposals for implementing the accord to the
organisation by October 1. The US, which also has many textiles quotas, has
yet to announce how it plans to meet its Gatt commitment.
But President Bill Clinton has said it will not move quickly to lift curbs,
and many US textiles producers and importers believe his administration will
adopt an approach similar to that of the EU.
Countries which do not remove MFA quotas will nonetheless be required by the
Gatt to gradually lift ceilings on imports covered by the restrictions.
Japan and Switzerland are the only industrialised countries which do not
impose MFA quotas.
Though heavily influenced by domestic political motives, tough EU and US
attitudes are partly intended to press developing countries to open their
textiles and clothing markets. Officials in Geneva say the two trade powers
are co-ordinating their efforts closely.
Under the Uruguay Round, most developing countries are required to lower the
often punitive tariffs they impose on imports. However, India and Pakistan,
two of the world's leading textiles exporters, have so far balked at
liberalising their import regimes.
Producers in the US and Europe believe that they could sell large volumes of
clothing to middle-class consumers in India and Pakistan if they had freer
access to their markets.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Reinsurance row grows with talk of legal action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NCM, the Dutch company which is Britain's largest short-term export credit
insurer, is considering legal action over the European Commission's plans to
tighten curbs on government subsidies to export finance.
The possible action is the latest twist in a UK campaign to secure changes
in the proposed regulations, which, it is feared, would unfairly penalise
British credit insurers and exporters.
Mr Colin Foxall, NCM's managing director, has written to Mr Karel Van Miert,
the European competition commissioner, saying that part of the draft EU
regulations on short-term credit insurance could give rise to a legal
challenge.
NCM is concerned by the assertion that UK government financing of a small
part of the country's reinsurance exposure constitutes a state aid and is
therefore anti-competitive.
Britain and NCM have insisted that the financing, through the Export Credit
Guarantee Department, is available purely on a contingency basis to cushion
against the risk of sudden shortages of reinsurance capacity.
The government also argues that the UK's reforms of its reinsurance market
have brought it closer than any other EU member to the free-market operation
which the commission's proposed rules are intended to encourage.
The UK says the current proposals could lead either to the complete
withdrawal of government support, threatening the stability of the
reinsurance market, or could increase the scope for government subsidy.
Mr Van Miert is sympathetic to these arguments. He agreed last July to delay
publication of the final rules until this autumn while the commission tried
to accommodate the UK's objections.
However, it is understood the commission is still not prepared to do more
than offer the UK a waiver from the rules until 1997.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Heracles mixes politics with the cement: A look at the
political fallout after former prime minister Mitsotakis' indictment for
bribery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The travails of Heracles General Cement, Greece's leading producer and
Europe's largest exporter of cement, have all the makings of a modern Greek
myth.
Thursday's indictment by parliament of Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the former
conservative prime minister, on charges of taking a Dollars 22.5m (Pounds
14.4m) bribe in the sale of the state-controlled cement producer in 1992 to
Calcestruzzi of Italy, underlined the extent to which Heracles has become
entangled in politics over the past decade.
Earlier this year, Mr Michalis Vranopoulos, former governor of the National
Bank and the government's main negotiator in the disposal of Heracles, was
assassinated by November 17, a Greek terrorist group, for his part in the
sale.
The privatisation of Heracles has proved just as controversial as its
nationalisation in 1983 by Greece's first socialist government. At that
time, Mr George Tsatsos, the company's chief executive, fled Greece together
with other family members on the board of directors to avoid facing charges
of criminal fraud that in theory carried the death penalty. Most charges
were dropped.
Now Mr Mitsotakis, an opposition backbencher, faces trial by a special
criminal court. Two other conservative former cabinet ministers involved in
the Heracles disposal, Mr Andreas Andrianopoulos and Mr Ioannis
Paleocrassas, were also indicted by parliament, on breach of trust charges,
and will be tried at the same time.
Mr Andrianopoulos, who as industry minister was the conservative
government's keenest exponent of privatisation, said yesterday: 'The whole
procedure of the parliamentary inquiry has been absurd. This is enough to
drive me out of politics.'
On the Athens stock exchange, shares in Heracles, depressed by a prolonged
recession in the Greek construction industry, picked up 1 per cent as the
indictment procedure neared completion. Nor have the company's results been
affected by political wrangling. Last year Heracles posted a 4.2 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits last year to Dr7.3bn (Pounds 19.8m), while
turnover was up by 11.7 per cent to Dr71bn. It retains a share of around 42
per cent in Greece's increasingly competitive cement market.
The conservatives' view is that Heracles has become a political football as
the governing socialists seek revenge on Mr Mitsotakis for bringing Mr
Andreas Papandreou, then the opposition leader, to trial in 1991 on
corruption charges connected with the Dollars 200m (Pounds 128m) Bank of
Crete embezzlement scandal.
Mr Andrianopoulos rejects an allegation accompanying the indictment, that
Heracles was sold too cheaply, pointing out that at Dollars 425m, the price
was at the high end of a series of valuations carried out by Morgan Stanley,
the investment bank acting as the government's adviser in the sale.
Mr Mitsotakis and his conservative colleagues were also held responsible by
the parliamentary committee investigating the sale for the disappearance of
a number of paintings, part of Heracles's large collection of modern Greek
art, from the boardroom suite.
Yet whatever the shortcomings of the sale, the Greek state managed to hold
on to a substantial stake in the company, as Calcestruzzi formed a joint
venture with the state-controlled National Bank of Greece, Cal-Nat, in order
to acquire Heracles, in which the bank holds a 68 per cent share.
Heracles, founded by the Tsatsos family before the first world war, expanded
rapidly in the late 1970s, opening a second cement quarry and a deep water
port on the island of Euboea and increasing its fleet of bulk carriers to
help boost exports to the Middle East and North Africa.
But the company borrowed heavily to finance its new investments, while
profit margins were shrinking. By the time the Socialists decided to
nationalise Heracles, its share capital to debt ratio was 1 to 15.
Moreover, the Tsatsos family controlled only 20 per cent of the shares,
against 35 per cent for National Bank. A total of Dr27bn in debt was
converted to equity, diluting the Tsatsos holdings still further, and new
management was appointed by the government.
By the late 1980s, however, Heracles was making sizeable profits again. As
the largest and one of only a few healthy companies in the conservatives'
privatisation portfolio, it was an attractive buy.
One local analyst said: 'Calcestruzzi needed a cement supply to back up its
ready-mix and construction equipment leasing business. It had coveted
Heracles for some time, building up a shareholding from the free float well
before the company was put up for sale.'
However, Heracles did not escape being drawn into the Ferruzzi group's own
political troubles, through a series of allegations that the Greek company
was used as a channel for pay-offs made to Italian politicians.
Italian magistrates have been in touch with the Greek judiciary over this
and have questioned several Ferruzzi officials.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Poles clash over price of success: A look at the wrangling
over rising money supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poland's steep growth curve coupled with inflows of foreign capital has the
country's economic managers straining to catch their breath and has led the
government and the NBP, the central bank, into an unprecedented public clash
over how best to deal with the resulting increases in the money supply.
The row comes in the wake of government suggestions that the bank should be
given an advisory council nominated by politicians. The bank's redoubtable
chairman, Ms Hanna Gronkiewicz Waltz, fears that this will lead to a
curtailing of the NBP's independence. The government would also like to see
the bank's supervisory functions hived off into a separate independent body.
Matters came to a head earlier this week when the NBP, concerned about the
growth in reserves, slowed the rate at which the zloty is devalued each
month to keep exports competitive from 1.6 to 1.5 per cent. The move angered
Mr Grzegorz Kolodko, the deputy premier in charge of the economy and finance
minister, as the bank failed to make the 1 per cent cut in its 33 per cent
refinancing rate the government wants to see to lower the cost of servicing
the public debt.
The protagonists later publicly traded arguments in parliament, with the
government charging that the bank had exceeded its prerogatives when it took
the devaluation decision without getting treasury agreement. Ms Gromkiewicz
Waltz replied that inflationary pressures meant action had to be taken
quickly and interest rate cuts would have to wait.
President Lech Walesa, who nominated Ms Gromkiewicz Waltz to the Central
Bank, has also weighed in. 'I'm not an economic expert but I think it is Ms
Gromkiewicz Waltz who is in the right,' he said.
The statement adds a political dimension. The present government, elected
last year, is a coalition of the former communist SLD and the PSL Farmers
Party, once allied to the communists. The president, who shares a Solidarity
background with Ms Gromkiewicz Waltz, faces an election next autumn. 'I hope
that we are dealing with nothing other than a dispute about economics,' said
Mr Kolodko in parliament on Thursday, hinting that opposition to interest
rate cuts could be aimed at slowing growth.
Indeed the coalition desperately needs growth to continue keeping the budget
deficit within the tight parameters pledged to the IMF in return for a
Dollars 800m (Pounds 511m) standby accord. Equally important for the
coalition is the need to bolster its support ahead of the presidential
election.
Happily for the moment the economy is set to grow by 4.5 per cent this year,
with industrial output up by 12.8 per cent in the first eight months. Also
monetary flows and indicators are all on target, which shows that both the
treasury and the NBP are within IMF guidelines.
However, foreign reserves have grown faster than expected to around Dollars
11bn because of receipts from cross-border trade and growing foreign trade.
Exports in the first half of the year are up by 15 per cent to Dollars
7.7bn, with imports in the same period actually falling by 1.4 per cent to
Dollars 9.5bn compared to the same period last year.
This performance owes much to the recovery in neighbouring Germany - which
accounts for a third of Polish sales abroad - and to east Germans shopping
in Poland. The reserves have also been boosted by traders and tourists from
the former Soviet Union buying consumer goods to sell at a profit at home.
It is the swelling reserves and mounting corporate bank balances from
growing sales and productivity gains that are causing the NBP concern and
have provoked the stalemate on interest rates.
Western bankers, who have just signed an accord cutting Poland's Dollars
14bn commercial debt by almost half, remain sanguine. Ironically as the
country struggles with the effect of growing capital inflows, the deal which
reduces Poland's overall indebtedness to Dollars 38bn should lead to foreign
investment worth an additional Dollars 1bn a year.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Major offers Ulster a vote on results of peace talks: Sinn
Fein challenged to end ceasefire doubts as broadcast ban is lifted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday moved to speed up the Northern Ireland peace process
by lifting the government's broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein and challenging
the party to end doubt about the permanence of the IRA's ceasefire.
But the prime minister balanced this with his first unequivocal commitment
to submit the outcome of political talks to a referendum inside the
province.
He also gave his clearest assurance yet to unionists that last month's
ceasefire announcement was not the result of a secret deal, insisting: 'The
cessation of violence has not been bought.'
Separately, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, ordered the
re-opening of 10 Ulster border crossings. Mr Major said this was
'emphatically not a political decision' and was taken on security grounds.
The abolition of the broadcasting ban means the voices of Sinn Fein's
representatives will be heard on Britain's airwaves for the first time in
almost six years.
Mr Major's attempt to regain the initiative follows mounting pressure from
Dublin and Ulster nationalists over the past two weeks for him to respond
more positively to last month's IRA announcement.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, welcomed the moves announced
by Mr Major and indicated a similar referendum would be held in the Irish
Republic.
Speaking in Belfast, Mr Major sought to put the onus for starting the
countdown to Sinn Fein's involvement in the talks process squarely on
republican leaders by making it clear he was still not satisfied the IRA had
renounced violence permanently. Britain has promised to start talks on how
to admit Sinn Fein to the political process within three months of a
permanent end to violence. The government would 'go on scrutinising both
words and actions until . . . we can sensibly make the assumption that the
IRA truly intend to end violence for good', he said.
The date on which the three-month period started was 'in Sinn Fein's hands.
If they are able to say to me tonight, 'We have ended violence not just for
a short time but in all circumstances and for all time', then the clock can
start ticking before midnight'.
But in Londonderry last night, Mr Martin McGuinness, the deputy leader of
Sinn Fein, refused to be drawn into declaring the IRA's ceasefire permanent.
Instead he repeated his earlier comment that the IRA's cease-fire covered
'all circum-stances'.
Describing the lifting of border controls and of the broadcasting ban as a
'healthy development', he said Sinn Fein would take the 'next few weeks'
before deciding its position on a referendum.
However, he warned: 'The conflict will not be resolved until it is resolved
on all-Ireland basis.'
Mr Major emphasised that 'neither we nor the main constitutional parties can
sit down at the table with them to negotiate under even the possibility of a
threat'. In a clear attempt to reassure unionists, Mr Major said his
commitment to a referendum meant it would be for the Ulster electorate to
decide whether to accept any package of proposals emerging from political
talks.
'My commitment means that no one can go behind your backs,' he said. 'It
will be for you to decide.'
Mr Peter Robinson MP, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, said
the prime minister's speech was 'an advance'. However he believed it 'fell
short' in that the prime minister was 'still capable of taking decisions
outside the talks process without the consent of the people'.
The prime minister said the broadcasting restrictions were no longer serving
the purpose for which they were intended.
All paramilitaries now had the opportunity to 'tell us directly . . . that
they are truly committed to peaceful methods only, and to there being no
resumption of violence in future', he said.
In recent months, ministers have come around to the view that the
broadcasting ban had become a weapon for critics of the government, but they
were anxious not to antagonise moderate unionists and Tory backbenchers by
lifting it prematurely.
Yesterday's announcement comes eight months after Dublin lifted its
broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, and a day after the first full meeting of the
British cabinet since the summer.
Mr Reynolds, on a visit to Hong Kong, said the British and Irish governments
were considering the formation of a cross-border tourism organisation.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Lottery money will not replace public spending, PM pledges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The strongest assurance yet was given by the prime minister yesterday that
the billions of pounds to be raised by the National Lottery for good causes
would not replace government spending.
Mr John Major told the English Heritage Conference in London: 'On the
government's side - Treasury, please note - we will make no case-by-case
reductions on conventional public spending programmes to take account of
awards from the lottery.'
The lottery, due to be launched on November 19, could raise Pounds 9bn over
the next six years.
'The money raised by the lottery will not replace existing government
spending,' Mr Major emphasised in response to a long-standing fear.
He envisaged that the lottery, to be run by the Camelot consortium, would
mainly aid capital schemes. 'Projects must benefit primarily the public good
rather than private gain, and must be financially viable,' he said.
He was determined that the whole country would share in the opportunities
once only available to a privileged few. 'I strongly believe man cannot live
by GDP alone,' the prime minister said.
The money raised by the National Lottery will go equally to the arts,
charities, a millennium fund, the national heritage and sports. Mr Major
said the designated distributing bodies would decide where the money would
be spent.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow national heritage secretary, said she was still
worried that some ministers would have few qualms about using lottery
proceeds to replace statutory funding programmes.
At the conference, Mr Major outlined some of the possibilities for the fund
designed to mark the millennium. They could range from engineering and
construction projects to ways to help the environment and equipping village
halls with computers.

<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday sent a top-level mission headed by former
president Jimmy Carter to Haiti for one final attempt to talk the military
junta into leaving before the US launches an invasion.
Mr Carter, who recently served as an intermediary to persuade North Korea to
enter talks with the US on dismantling its nuclear programme, will be joined
by General Colin Powell, the former chairman of the US joint chiefs of
staff, and Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate armed services
committee.
The envoys are expected to meet General Raoul Cedras and other Haitian
military leaders, and try to persuade them to leave.
White House officials said the administration was 'making every conceivable
effort for them to leave peacefully', but insisted that only the manner of
their departure was negotiable.
Earlier Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, said a US-led invasion of
Haiti was 'a matter of days away'.
Mr Clinton, who on Thursday night laid out his justifications for
intervention in a television address to the nation, yesterday cancelled a
political trip to California scheduled for tomorrow.
Mr Perry said US forces would be ready by the weekend and could maintain
that state of readiness for several days.
Washington was alive with rumours that one or more of the Haitian military
junta was pre paring to leave the island. But Gen Cedras, who was
interviewed live on US television after the president had finished speaking,
said he was prepared to die for his country.
Yesterday President Ernesto Perez Balladares of Panama said he would grant
asylum to Gen Cedras if that would avoid an invasion.
Mr Clinton held a White House meeting yesterday with Fr Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, the Haitian president ousted by Gen Cedras in the 1991 coup, and
representatives of more than 20 nations which are contributing to an
international peacekeeping force that will take over after the US invasion.
Fr Aristide, in a signif-icant concession to conservative critics of his
leftwing politics and character, promised to step down when his term of
office ends late next year.
Although the Haitian constitution prevents him from seeking re-election, Fr
Aristide had maintained that the clock should be stopped on his term at the
1991 coup. This would have given him more than four years after he is
restored to power.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Markets fall on fresh US inflation fears

Further signs of inflationary pressures in the US triggered fresh falls in
the world's bond and stock markets yesterday.
US industrial capacity utilisation rose to its highest level for more than
five years at 84.7 per cent in August, threatening production bottlenecks
and higher prices. The new figure renewed fears of further interest rate
rises in the US and other markets.
The US long bond slid 1 1/2 points, dragging European bond prices down
sharply. On stock markets, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 20.53 points
down when New York closed. The UK's FT-SE 100 and Germany's Dax both fell
1.5 per cent.
'It was a collapse waiting to happen,' said Mr Michael Burke, international
bond analyst at Citibank in London. European bond prices, which have found
it difficult to 'de-couple' from the US market following the reversal of the
US interest rate cycle in February, had been under pressure all week,
traders said.
Inflation worries also undermined the dollar, which closed in London at
DM1.5376. It closed at DM1.5445 in New York after trading above DM1.55
earlier in the day. Sterling was a beneficiary of the US currency's
weakness, touching a 16-month high of Dollars 1.587 before slipping to close
at Dollars 1.579 in New York.
The UK gilts market, still digesting Monday's  1/2 point rise in bank base
rates, was hit by news that the August public sector borrowing requirement
reached Pounds 3.2bn, substantially higher than market expectations,
reviving worries about potential funding difficulties.
Meanwhile, interest rate concerns and weak bond markets were seen capping
any potential recovery in share prices.
The Federal Reserve said that US industrial production rose by 0.7 per cent
in August, and announced upwards revisions to production in the three
preceding months. Capacity utilisation is believed to be one of the main
indicators looked at by Fed governors when assessing monetary policy, and
August's higher rate led some economists to argue for an earlier interest
rate move.
'We expect the Fed to tighten short-term rates another 25 basis points in
mid-October,' said Mr Joseph Liro, an economist with investment bankers SG
Warburg in the US.

FT  17 SEP 94 / Arts: Red Adair of ancient monuments - He came to bury
English Heritage, but perversely Jocelyn Stevens is giving it a fuller life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is ten years now since the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission
was put to sleep and the more consumer friendly English Heritage was
created. Yesterday the nation's biggest guns gathered in London to fire
salvos in praise of the heritage.
The Prime Minister supplied his vision of the future, viewed brightly
through National Lottery glasses; Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber was there to do
what he does best, give away money, Pounds 1m of it to help finance the Open
Churches Trust, which aims to keep churches unlocked for visitors; and
sounding off at full blast, Jocelyn Stevens, chairman of English Heritage,
described how he took on the assembled ranks of special pleaders, country
landowners, dreamy academics, entrenched interests, and, worst of all,
archaeologists, and put them to the sword.
Stevens' speech, with some justification, concentrated on the heritage
successes of the past few years. It is hardly a coincidence that he was
appointed chairman in 1992, a self-styled Terminator Three, determined to
shake up a cosy quango.
He is now half-way through his allotted five year span ('I'm too old to do
another term' - he is 62), and it is two years almost to the day that he
announced his personal programme, a programme that caused convulsions inside
English Heritage and beyond. This week in his workmanlike office in Fortress
House, the defiantly bleak HQ of English Heritage, Stevens marked his
performance - and gave himself top marks. 'A hundred per cent of the
strategy has been achieved'.
For a man who saw off the printers in his newspaper days, and the even
tougher cabal of art lecturers during his Rectorship at the Royal College of
Art, English Heritage has turned out to be something of a pushover for
Stevens.
He has trimmed down the staff from 1600 to 1200 and another 200 will go
shortly when English Heritage's workforce of skilled craftsmen, stone
masons, gilders, and the like, is privatised, perhaps through a management
buy out.
He has rid English Heritage of responsibility for 45 of its 400 properties,
most successfully by transferring its Avebury sites to the National Trust,
and he hopes to get rid of another 44 by the end of the year. And he has cut
down to size the London Region by handing on its powers over Grade II listed
buildings to the boroughs. He was able to boast this week that while only
seven London boroughs had so far agreed, with three more ready to sign up,
they accounted for half the listed buildings in the capital.
London has been something of an obsession with Stevens. You might conjecture
that he took on the job to wreak revenge on the London Region experts who so
delayed his plans to add an extension to the Royal College that it pushed up
the cost by Pounds 2m. 'I loathe bureaucracy', he explains. He talks with
horror of friends who needed English Heritage permission to change the door
knobs inside their houses. Presumably he believes that the local councils,
many of whom lack specialist staff, will be less pedantic.
Stevens has dealt with the bureaucracy in English Heritage by being a one
man band, a Red Adair for the heritage, swooping on crises and quickly
resolving them. He takes credit for getting something done at last about the
Albert Memorial. He came up with the short-term cash needed to fix the
Crescent in Buxton, currently the most important building in England
threatened with demolition but now moving safely into local authority
control. 'People say I must be like King Canute. But in my case the water is
coming up over my head'.
His current pre-occupation is the great Ministry of Defence sell off. It
owns over 700 listed buildings, including such historic and costly
structures as the Royal Naval College at Greenwich and the army buildings at
Woolwich. They could suddenly become somebody else's liability, and English
Heritage can hardly dodge its responsibility. It has been here before. By
force-majeure it has already started to care, at a cost of Pounds 90m over
ten years, for the nation's cathedrals and churches which are too much for a
cash-strapped Church of England.
So there is a paradox. With one breath Stevens talks of ridding English
Heritage of all its sites; with the other he enthusiastically takes on new
burdens. He also welcomes direct approaches. The transfer to the London
boroughs of mundane conservation matters in theory makes English Heritage
more strategic; in practice it is Jocelyn Stevens who dictates policy.
When Lord Palumbo finally started this summer to construct his new James
Stirling building on No 1, Poultry, no thought had been given to the
archaeological potential of a site at the heart of Roman London. Crisis:
Stevens summoned Lord Palumbo and after a chat extracted a promise that
archaeologists could have 44 weeks on the plot and, on top, Lord Palumbo
would pay Pounds 2m towards the cost.
This is the role that Jocelyn Stevens loves. He describes English Heritage
as 'a shipyard that takes in wrecks, repairs them, and then hands them to
someone else to sail'. This workmanlike approach even extends to his
flagship site, Stonehenge, which he accepts is 'a national disgrace'. He has
rowed furiously with the Ministry of Transport and the local authorities, to
say nothing of the Druids and the Army, about his plan to create a 3,000
acre national park on Salisbury Plain over which the public can roam and
admire 450 scheduled monuments.
The typical Stevens solution is for the project to be financed from the
receipts of a visitors centre on the far edge of the area. If he can knock
enough heads together, and he seems to be making progress, Jocelyn Stevens
is quite happy to transfer the most important heritage site in the nation to
a local Trust which will administer the Park, with cash coming from a
commercial enterprise running the centre, which could be visited by 750,000
people a year. Stevens sees it as a natural millennium project, ready by
2000.
But while Stevens is frantically patching up his ships and shoving them down
the slipway others need attention. He has just handed over Pounds 1m to a
trust that will cherish Pell Wall Hall, a derelict house in Shropshire
designed by Sir John Soane. He recently discovered a forgotten treasure in
Danson House, Bexley, which needs rapid attention. Despite his ambitions he
will never be able to whittle down his quango to a few strategic sites and
probably would hate the consequences if he did.
For Stevens pays lip service to devolution and deregulation but loves to
interfere. 'Although we have one foot in the past we also have one foot in
the future'. He has made up for the disappointment that the National
Heritage Fund was given the task of distributing lottery cash to the
heritage by taking a keen interest in potential lottery projects. He is
giving Richard Rogers redevelopment of the South Bank arts centre a
supportive push; he has handed the Tate Gallery money to shore up its
planned Museum of Modern Art at Bankside Power station; he is airing an idea
for spending lottery money on smartening up the capital's parks.
Jocelyn Stevens has a romantic view of his mission. 'There used to be the US
cavalry, now there is English Heritage'. Undoubtedly his energy has achieved
much. But as in every cavalry charge there are casualties, and not just the
local gentry who find it harder to get a grant to repair their roofs; or
London's archaeologists, ruthlessly reorganised.
There are the experts who could not stand Stevens' abrasive style and took
their knowledge elsewhere. There are the problems that will not go away,
like the ancient monuments, from Rivaulx Abbey to obscure Bronze Age
barrows, that will never find a new owner to cherish them and must remain
part of English Heritage's fief.
Steven's has proved that the heritage will never become the past. In marked
contrast to his declared aims, through his ambition and drive, he is
constantly adding to the workload of his diminished band. He came to bury
English Heritage; perversely he is giving it a fuller life.

Mayr-Melnhof Karton, the Austrian carton board producer, said a sharp
increase in raw materials costs in May would only be offset by price
increases in June and take full effect in the fourth quarter, Reuters
reports from Zurich.
As a result, full-year results are expected to show only a modest
improvement over the first half. Group net profits are seen at Sch140m and
cash flow at Sch920m.
First-half net profits were Sch105m, while full-year profits for 1993 were
Sch117m. Cash flow in the first six months was Sch511m, and Sch831m for the
full year.
'The unprecedented increase in international used paper prices that began in
May has had immediate and unpleasant consequences for the business year
1994,' the company said.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zurich Insurance, one of the world's largest insurance groups, is acquiring
a Zurich private bank, Rud, Blass &amp; Cie, which operates mainly in securities
broking, from Mr Jurg Blass.
Mr Rolf Hanggi, deputy chief executive of Zurich, said the acquisition is
being made in the context of the liberalisation of Swiss regulations on life
insurance products.
Companies can now offer investment trust-linked life insurance policies. Mr
Hanggi said that meant Zurich would have a need for investment trust
management. It already has investment trust management subsidiaries in
Germany and Italy and hopes to manage some of its new Swiss business through
its acquisition.
Rud, Blass, with total assets of SFr351.4m (Dollars 275m) at the end of last
year, specialises in trading Swiss franc securities and is particularly
strong in bond trading.
Mr Hanggi said Zurich, which maintains about a third of its SFr78.5bn
investments in Swiss francs, generates about SFr3bn a year in transactions
in that currency.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Weatherstone hands over JP Morgan reins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Dennis Weatherstone, chairman and chief executive of JP Morgan, will
retire at the end of this year after five years in which the US institution
has transformed itself into a leading international investment bank.
Sir Dennis' retirement after he turns 64 in November, and the appointment in
his place of Mr Douglas Warner, who is 48, comes a year before most
observers had expected.
However, analysts and rivals said the timing did not appear to be the result
of internal dissent. Mr Warner, who has been the bank's president since the
start of 1990, had been expected to take over.
Sir Dennis, who described the transition as 'boringly uneventful' and
planned for some time, said: 'I am very healthy, very happy. The bank is in
very good shape.'
Sir Dennis yesterday won plaudits from Wall Street for JP Morgan's advances
in investment banking. Mr George Salem, an analyst at Prudential Securities,
said: 'He executed the plan to transform the organisation, from one that was
becoming an anachronism to one that was a leader in global finance. I would
give him very high grades.'
The past year, though, has seen Morgan's reputation sullied by its
entanglement with Banesto, the Spanish bank taken over by the Bank of Spain
at the end of last year. The controversy raised questions about the bank's
ability to expand internationally without diluting its blue-chip customer
base and reputation for quality.
'With the benefit of hindsight it (the Banesto investment) doesn't look too
good,' Sir Dennis said. 'I don't think it was our most glorious moment . . .
But it was a long-term investment, and we realised it was high-risk. We're
not going to go through our business and not make any mistakes, anywhere.'
He added, though, that investors in JP Morgan's Corsair fund, which invested
in Banesto, may yet do 'very nicely' out of the deal.
Sir Dennis also played down the suggestion that profits have become more
volatile under his tenure, as the bank relies more on income from trading in
financial markets. 'It may be that in times of (market) volatility the
earnings will go down,' he conceded, though he added: 'Some of what is seen
as volatility isn't there,' as much of the bank's trading was for customers.
Mr Warner fits the Ivy League mould of JP Morgan executives better than Sir
Dennis, a Briton who left school at the age of 15. Mr Warner, educated at
Yale, has been with the bank throughout his career. He ran the bank's London
operations in the late 1980s and headed its corporate finance business from
New York. In the past five years he has been involved more on internal
matters as chief operating officer.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Almost all open supporters of Haiti's exiled president have gone into
hiding, fearing they will become military targets as the threat of a US-led
invasion intensifies.
Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, yesterday announced the call-up
of 1,700 reservists in preparation for military action to restore
Jean-Bertrand Aristide as president.
President Bill Clinton met senior foreign policy and military advisers ahead
of a televised address to the nation on the crisis last night.
Officials declined to comment on a New York Times report that the president
might call off a fully fledged invasion if the leaders of the military junta
accept an offer of third-country exile and immunity from prosecution.
Mr Emile Jonaissant, de facto president in Haiti's army-backed government,
said neither his administration nor the military would give way. He accused
Mr Clinton of threatening Haiti for domestic political reasons.
The decision by Mr Aristide's supporters to go underground, reported by
diplomats in the capital Port-au-Prince, follows the murder of several of
their number over the past two years. Statements from army officers last
week said 'traitorous' Haitians would 'pay' in the event of an invasion.
There is also growing fear that the country's military may turn its guns on
the slums of Port-au-Prince, in which the ousted president has significant
popular support.
Haiti's ill-equipped and poorly trained army of 7,000 has been expanded by a
rapid recruiting programme, but is not expected to offer much resistance to
an invading force three times larger. However, maverick elements in the
military may hide and begin guerrilla resistance.
The invading forces may have the support, or at least acquiescence, of many
junior officers in the Haitian military who have been meeting in recent
weeks with foreign intelligence services. They have been promised early
amnesty and other unspecified 'rewards' for not resisting the invasion.
The three military leaders - General Raoul Cedras, the commander of the
armed forces, General Philippe Biamby, the chief of staff, and Colonel
Michel Francois, the police chief - would be taken into custody by the
invading forces, partly for their own protection, according to diplomats.
Mr Robert Malval, the prime minister appointed by Mr Aristide last year
under an abortive agreement to resolve the crisis, who was sidelined by the
military, would be reinstated.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Raytheon plant closures in UK spark protests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Raytheon of the US is to close the UK corporate jet business it bought from
British Aerospace and transfer the work to Kansas with the loss of 850
British jobs over the next three years.
The decision provoked a storm of protest in Britain immediately after its
announcement yesterday by the industrial group, which acquired the BAe
business for Pounds 250m (Dollars 387m) last year.
Representatives of the opposition Labour party and trade unions called on Mr
Michael Heseltine, the British trade and industry secretary, to intervene to
stop Raytheon closing its two UK facilities near Chester in northwest
England and Hertfordshire in the south of the country. Raytheon currently
leases both plants from BAe.
The US company, which also announced it was suspending production of the
Hawker 1000 business jet and slowing production of the smaller Hawker 800
jet, said the move reflected difficulties in the recession-hit corporate jet
market.
'The timing of this decision is principally driven by the current weak
market conditions and substantiated by the results of a recently completed
study by Raytheon after it acquired Corporate Jets from British Aerospace,'
the US company said.
As part of the overall rationalisation of its corporate aircraft activities,
Raytheon is also cutting 630 jobs in the US.
The company is merging its Beech Aircraft subsidiary with the former BAe
corporate jet activities into the Raytheon Aircraft Company based in
Wichita, Kansas.
Apart from poor market conditions, Raytheon said its recently completed
study of its aircraft businesses concluded that merging Hawker and Beech
aircraft production would achieve significant cost savings.
Raytheon said final assembly of Hawker jets would start being moved to
Wichita next year. 1997. Engineering activities will also be moved to
Wichita.
It added it was immediately cutting 170 out of 550 jobs in Cheshire, where
Hawker business jets are assembled, and 143 out of 300 jobs at its
Hertfordshire design, engineering and marketing facility.
The remaining jobs at both plants will go by 1997, although several UK
employees will be offered jobs in the US.
Since the sale to Raytheon, former BAe employees had been worried about the
ultimate intentions of the US company and the strong possibility it would
eventually transfer production to the US.
But yesterday's announcement still came as a big shock to staff. Mr Tony
Lloyd, the Labour party's employment spokesman, said it was 'outrageous that
an American company can move in, buy an order book and then close down
forever the plants with the consequences for skilled employment'.

FT  16 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures bounced back strongly yesterday, moving to a premium
against the cash market for the first time in more than a week.
The September contract on the FT-SE 100 opened modestly higher but it took
until lunchtime to break upwards through 3,100, by which time the underlying
cash market was doing most of the pace-making.
At the close the index was at 3,116, with the relationship to the cash
market firmly reversed to a premium of almost 2. Ahead of this morning's
expiration of the September contract, the fair value premium was around
zero.
The market consensus was that the index had been heavily oversold on
Wednesday, and at one time yesterday the premium to the cash market was as
high as 10. Once again the main drive came from independent traders.
Trading volume was substantially down from Wednesday's 23,088 lots at
18,066, about half of which reflected roll-over into the December contract
where volume totalled 10,765.
Activity in traded options moved up strongly to 53,043 contracts, from some
40,000 the previous day. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE option volume accounted for
some three-quarters of this trading. Vodafone (1,182 lots) and BP (1,000)
were the most actively traded individual stock options.

FT  16 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: APV trades heavily
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Engineering group APV was yesterday's most actively traded share, down 35
1/2 to 83p following a halved interim dividend. The half-year statement
plainly caught the market on the hop and the day's turnover topped 13m
shares.
Profits were ahead but the company spoke gloomily about the need to
restructure its liquid food side and the squeeze on non-UK margins. Europe
accounts for some 40 per cent of group sales.
T&amp;N eased 5 to 220p on the news that it had taken a Pounds 100m-plus option
to buy a controlling stake in German car component group Kolbenschmidt.
Market concern centred on the German company's heavy borrowings.
Rolls-Royce shed 1 1/2 to 182 1/2 p, not helped by market talk of knock-on
effect to RR of a Far Eastern airline going slow on payment for a large
airline order.
Unusual trading patterns in Zeneca saw the shares fall 5 to 830p in spite of
announcements that the company had filed a new prostate drug application
with the US Food and Drug Administration and appointed a new chairman
designate, Sir Sydney Lipworth. The shares have outperformed the market
recently, fuelled by bid hopes.
A vaccine tie-up between Medeva and SmithKline Beecham gave a boost to the
former, up 9 at 151p. SmithKline 'A' put on 6 at 434p.
Granada was the outstanding performer in an otherwise lacklustre leisure
sector, with the shares staging a strong recovery after the recent bout of
weakness which earlier this week drove the shares down to their lowest point
since December 1993.
This had been caused by persistent suggestions that Granada was about to
make a substantial acquisition, rumoured to be Gardner Merchant, the
catering group.
In spite of constant assurances from sources close to Granada that a move to
buy Gardner was not about to happen the market remained unconvinced. But
strong support for Granada shares from Hoare Govett, Granada's own broker,
seemed to have allayed those fears yesterday. Granada shares closed 14 1/2
higher at 490 1/2 p after turnover of 2m.
Kwik-Fit, the motor services group, bounced 6 1/2 to 154p following good
interim results which led some securities houses to edge up their full-year
profits forecasts.
Troubled transport group Tiphook dipped 1 to 37p following one of the
stormiest annual meetings of the year involving allegations from the floor.
Against the market trend, British Airways weakened further, dipping 4 to
389p.
Dealers noted persistent support for many of the building materials and
construction shares after the damage inflicted on the sector by this week's
rise in domestic interest rates. Demand was fuelled by a note issued by
Credit Lyonnais Laing, the securities house, which said that 'assuming the
government's pre-emptive rate rise lessens the risk of a rerun of the boom
to bust cycle, we believe it is too early to move underweight in the sectors
and recommend a selective balanced portfolio'.
Mirror Group shed 4 to 131p as analysts downgraded following the
announcement of a sharp setback in interim profits and a warning that the
newspaper price war would hit full-year profits by more than the market had
anticipated. SG Warburg, which remained a buyer, nevertheless downgraded by
Pounds 8.2m to Pounds 71.2m.
Courtaulds Textiles moved ahead 13 to 511p in spite of reporting a fall in
interim profits to Pounds 10.1m from Pounds 13.7m.
Home furnishings group MFI rose 6 1/2 to 142p on announcing that sales for
the first 19 weeks of the current year were 10 per cent above the comparable
period of last year.
United Biscuits shed a penny to 319p on disappointment over half-year
results.
Hawtal Whiting, the motor industry design and engineering consultancy,
leaped 65 to 286p following a 400 per cent rise in first-half profits.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reported comments by HJ Heinz, the US foods group, prompted a flurry of bid
speculation that lifted shares in both Unigate, the dairy and distribution
group, and Hazlewood, the diversified foods manu-facturer.
Chief executive Mr Tony O'Reilly had, according to some press reports,
approved acquisition of a baby foods group in Europe. The market immediately
thought of Nutricia, the Dutch group, in which Unigate has a 34 per cent
stake.
Unigate has long been rumoured to be keen to offload its Nutricia holding
and the possible Heinz move gave a fillip to the story. Conspiracy theorists
decided that Unigate would raise around Pounds 250m from the sale and use
the cash to buy Hazlewood.
Consequently, Unigate rose 13 to 363p, while Hazlewood, up 9 at 139p,
shrugged off the impact of a rather downbeat annual statement. Chairman Mr
Peter Barr said first-half results would show a big drop from the previous
year's after an extremely difficult start to the trading year.
However, Nutricia denied it had received an approach from the US group and
several analysts were sceptical of a link-up between the two UK groups.
Analyst Mr Carl Short of SGST said: 'Unigate would probably not be
interested in bidding for a business as diverse as Hazlewood.'

FT  16 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Market pleased by BP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The oil majors continued to attract heavy two-way activity, with British
Petroleum, as had been expected, delivering all and more of the good
exploration news that the market had been looking for at its meeting with
analysts in London, and Shell Transport satisfying all but the super
optimists with its interim payment.
BP's presentation coincided with news of an exciting gas discovery off the
coast of Vietnam, a story which had been circulating in the market for some
time, and went down very well with analysts.
One of the leading oil sector researchers described the presentation,
delivered by Mr John Browne, head of BP's exploration and production, as the
best he had ever attended and the first time BP 'has ever demonstrated a
credible long term growth plan in exploration; in the past, BP has talked
about managing a decline in its exploration business, today it was full of
information on its expansion plans'.
Another analyst said he was 'well satisfied' with the presentation but added
that he would like to see evidence of renewed US support for BP shares. BP
will deliver the same message to US investors today.
BP ended 3 up at 420 1/2 p on turnover of 9.3m. Shell improved marginally to
722 1/2 p.

FT  16 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Futures lead a good recovery in the
blue chips - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A recovery in government bond prices yesterday, encouraged by better
inflations news on both sides of the Atlantic, helped UK equities recoup a
good part of the losses of the previous session. However, blue chip share
prices were influenced by pressures linked to the expiry this morning of the
September futures contract on the FT-SE 100-share Index. Today also brings
similar futures expiries in New York and Frankfurt and equity strategists
were wary of reading too much into trends in stock markets yesterday.
An early advance in the Footsie was trimmed at one time as investors took
aboard the news of an unexpected fall of 0.3 per cent in August retail sales
in the UK. This was good news for bond prices, however, and at the same time
failed to upset shares in the leading store groups. The Bundesbank's
decision to leave its key interest rates unchanged was no surprise to the
London markets and had little effect on government bonds.
Gains were extended steadily as bonds moved higher, and the final reading of
3,112.7 gave the FT-SE 100 a net gain of 32.9. The recapture of the 3,100
mark was clearly led by the futures market; the September contract must
stand in line with the underlying Footsie reading at the futures expiry just
after 10.00 this morning.
Shares received a further boost in the afternoon when Wall Street put on 14
Dow points in its early response to a sharp fall in the pricing content of
the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's diffusion index. The Philadelphia
Bank ascribed the fall to lower prices for oil and other raw materials,
factors known to rate high on the Federal Reserve's list of inflation
pointers.
This indication of reduced pressures for a further tightening in credit
policy boosted global investment sentiment.
The Footsie was helped by strength in the leading oil issues as Shell
Transport increased the dividend payout and analysts responded very
favourably to a briefing by the directors of British Petroleum.
The recovery spread across the broad range of the stock market, taking the
FT-SE Mid 250 Index ahead by 20.5 to 3,648.9; however, on Wednesday, this
index lost 50 points as second line issues were marked lower in the wake of
the drop by the blue chip sector.
Trading volume, as recorded by the Seaq electronic system, picked up to
589.9m shares, but was still unexciting by recent standards.
Non-Footsie stocks made up a fairly high portion, around 60 per cent, of
total business. On Wednesday, when the Footsie plunged 41.6 following an
unexpected gain in the headline rate of domestic inflation, retail business
in equities was worth only Pounds 1.24bn, suggesting that selling had been
modest.
Retail stocks closed higher on the day as many non-City economists suggested
that the equity market had overreacted to the modest dip in the retail price
index announced in the previous session. Sentiment was not upset by new
comments on competitive pressures in the food industry from United Biscuits.
Bank shares also staged a successful rally from the previous day's losses,
although traders admitted that the outlook for domestic interest rates had
not changed overnight. Market analysts still divide into two camps - those
who believe that this week's half-point rise in base rates will soon be
followed by a further increase as economic recovery strengthens, and those
who maintain that rates will not need to rise again this year.
Fund managers are beginning to position their portfolios ahead of the
closing of investment books on the third quarter of the year. This implies a
greater focus on minor adjustments to portfolio weightings rather than on
new investment directions, according to traders.

FT  16 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow forges ahead on fresh
data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks surged yesterday afternoon after a regional economic survey helped
to dispel the market's worst fears on inflation, writes Frank McGurty in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 58.55 higher at 3,953.88, its best
closing level since February 3, the day before the Federal Reserve's shift
to a more restrictive monetary policy. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 6.01
stronger at 474.81 as advances on the Big Board swamped declines by 1,539 to
604.
New York SE volume was an impressive 281m shares, even though many investors
were sidelined in observance of Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement.
A powerful advance by technology stocks propelled the Nasdaq composite up
10.05, or 1.31 per cent, to 778.66.
The welcome suggestion on inflation was contained in the monthly survey of
business conditions conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
In the report, indices measuring the prices paid and received by
manufacturers showed sharp declines, in a surprising reversal of the trend
which surfaced in the latest survey by the National Association of
Purchasing Management.
The Treasury market seized on the report as a positive indication of the
direction of prices in the coming months. But bonds across the board showed
only moderate improvement, as traders waited for today's data on industrial
production and capacity utilisation before committing themselves.
For equity investors, the Philadelphia report seemed to restore much of the
confidence undermined last week by news of a big upturn in August producer
prices.
Stocks began slowly but steadily built up momentum as the session unfolded.
By late afternoon the market had gained enough forward momentum to trigger a
wave of computer-guided buy programs, sending the Dow to within 25 points of
its record closing high.
Caterpillar, a bellwether cyclical stock, climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars
56 3/4 . In other stocks closely linked to the economic cycle, Deere gained
Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 73 1/4 and International Paper advanced Dollars 1
1/8 to Dollars 76 1/4 .
One of the most active NYSE issues was ITT, which fell Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 80 1/8 on heavy volume of 3.5m shares. The trading followed the
disclosure that the company was planning to sell some of its financial
services businesses to finance a strategic push into media and
entertainment. The prospect of such a move prompted Goldman Sachs to
downgrade the issue.
Tektronix, an electronics manufacturer, jumped Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 38
1/4 . Late on Wednesday the company said net income in its fiscal first
quarter rose 64 per cent on strong sales of colour computer printers.
Parametric Technology, a software designer, climbed Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars
30 15/16 after Salomon Brothers boosted its estimate of the company's 1995
earnings.
Canada
Toronto staged a good advance in fairly heavy trading, with strong
performances seen in paper, forestry, metal and industrial stocks.
The TSE 300 index closed 40.43 up at 4,385.46, with rises outpacing falls by
446 to 319 after volume of 66m shares.
Metal and mineral stocks were said to be on a roll, with a number trading at
or near 52-week highs. Analysts said the stocks are being bid up by
expectations of earnings gains and higher prices for base metals as the
business cycle matures.
Brazil
Shares in Sao Paulo ended 3.4 per cent lower, dragged down by unconfirmed
rumours that Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso's vice-presidential running mate,
Mr Marco Maciel, received illegal funding for his campaign.
The Bovespa index receded 1,889 to 52,875. Volume reached a record RDollars
1.02bn (Dollars 1.19bn), due to huge option operations carried out by a
major investment bank. The option deals, known as 'box' deals, are a
combination of two calls and two puts, and involved power utility Eletrobras
options. The preferred shares dropped 3.6 per cent to RDollars 374.
Brokers said the market was also concerned about a four-day-old
metalworkers' strike, which could threaten the government's anti-inflation
plan.

A mixed pattern was seen among the Continent's bourses.
Merrill Lynch said yesterday that it was recommending a reduction of its
equity holding in preference to cash. It said that it recommended investors
to 'hold a cash position that is three to four times what we would regard as
normal weight at 8 per cent to 12 per cent for equity portfolios and 12 per
cent to 18 per cent for balanced funds'.
Merrill said the chance that markets would be flat to lower during the next
few months suggested that investors should search for an alternative to
equities.
ZURICH saw Roche return to centre stage as Goldman Sachs removed the shares
from its European recommended for purchase list. The SMI index finished 9.1
down at 2,628.6, having recovered from a low of 2,611.9.
Roche certificates closed SFr105 down at SFr6,050 but up from a day's low of
SFr5,940, as Goldman Sachs explained its move, saying that growth in the
pharmaceuticals industry slowed in the first half of 1994 as market forces
in the US and health care cost reforms in Europe took effect. Other factors
included a reduction in the long term growth rates for major divisions, the
impact of the Syntex acquisition, disappointing second-quarter sales, the
Swiss franc's strength, and a decrease in net cash.
Nestle, SFr14 lower in the immediate aftermath of its six months' figures,
which were at the bottom end of expectations, picked up to finish SFr4
easier at SFr1,216.
Against the trend, bargain hunting among cyclicals took BBC bearers SFr18
higher to SFr1,190.
Ascom put on SFr20 at SFr1,620. Merrill Lynch commented that market
expectations were still fairly high and that a number of areas might still
cause disappointment in the market over the next 12 to 18 months.
It was too early to ascertain the success of the company's actions to date,
but from very cautious comments made last week by the finance director, it
was clearly going to be some time before a significant growth in earnings
was seen.
FRANKFURT eased back ahead of today's futures and options expiry. The DAX
index lost 10.14 at 2,113.98, down from an intraday high of 2,129.50. The
Ibis indicated DAX closed at 2,129.36. Turnover came to DM6bn. The
Bundesbank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged came as no surprise.
Lufthansa added 50 pfennigs at DM199 after announcing that its supervisory
board had agreed to a corporate restructuring - the freight, technical and
systems divisions are to start to operate as legally separate units from the
beginning of 1995. The shares improved to DM200.70 in late trading.
MILAN was pulled higher by gains in bonds and some short covering on the
last day of the September account. The Comit index moved forward 6.41 to
661.34.
Insurers again led the market, on expectations that they will benefit from
government reform of the pension system. Generali picked up L700, or 1.7 per
cent, to L42.250, also helped by demand ahead of the start of its one-for-10
rights issue that begins today.
Ras put on L900, or 3.7 per cent, at L24,950 and Fondiaria was L380, or 3.6
per cent, ahead at L11,800.
Banks featured BCI, which bounced L140, or 3.8 per cent, to L3,810 in what
was seen as a delayed reaction to the end of its rights issue last week.
Olivetti, which said it had increased its share of the European personal
computer market, strengthened L75, or 3.7 per cent, to L2,080.
PARIS finished more than 1 per cent higher, helped by a firmer bond market.
The CAC-40 index was finally up 24.36 at 1,977.30, off the session's high of
1,981.60. Turnover was about 3bn.
Saint-Gobain, which released favourable half-year figures after the close,
climbed FFr12 to FFr642.
Chargeurs ended unchanged at FFr1,460 after reporting that it had returned
to profit in the first half.
AMSTERDAM was interested in Nutricia on speculation that it might be a
takeover candidate for Heinz. The stock advanced Fl 2.80 to Fl 88.
The AEX index put on 1.05 at 411.61, after a high of 411.84.
STOCKHOLM was higher in response to lower debt market yields and the
performance of other European markets. The Affarsvarlden index rose 7.5 to
1,461.9 in very high turnover of SKr3.6bn.
Analysts suggested that many investors who expected the Social Democrats to
win Sunday's general election were taking advantage of the current tax rules
to sell. The party has said it will raise tax on share trade gains.
MADRID was boosted by a recovery in the domestic bond market and heavy
buying in banks, and the general index gained 4.07 at 304.44 in moderate
turnover of Pta28.7bn.

FT  16 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region is generally
easier in the absence of Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo was closed yesterday for the Respect for the Aged national holiday.
HONG KONG nudged higher but was unable to erase Wednesday's late losses as
the holiday in Tokyo and Sino-British tensions took their toll.
The Hang Seng index finished 16.24 ahead at 9,862.64, after the 90.61 drop
on Wednesday. Brokers said the mood was cautious ahead of next week's
meeting of the Joint Liaison Group discussing Hong Kong's transition to
Chinese rule, following Beijing's attack this week on Governor Chris Patten
and the Jardine group.
After the close another Jardine group company, Dairy Farm International,
announced that it was cancelling its secondary listing in Hong Kong.
China has ruled out participation of the Jardine group in a consortium to
extend the colony's container port, alleging that the group had won the
right to develop the port because of political favour-itism.
Jardine Matheson ended steady at HKDollars 74.25 while Jardine Strategic
rose 90 cents to HKDollars 33.30 and Dairy Farm gained 10 cents at HKDollars
12.45. Hongkong Land, expected to announce its delisting on Friday, rose 45
cents to HKDollars 20.95.
Property companies found favour late in the session. Cheung Kong put on 10
cents at HKDollars 39.20 and Sun Hung Kai Properties improved 75 cents to
HKDollars 58.75.
China-incorporated shares, which funds have been buying recently, climbed
again in a market that showed patchy interest. The Hang Seng index of 11 H
shares advanced 13.82 to 1,492.51. Tianjin Bohai rose 4 cents to HKDollars
1.53 and Yizheng Chemicals 5 cents to HKDollars 3.24, both the target of
investment from foreign funds.
SINGAPORE saw light selling in several index stocks, and Malaysian shares
traded over the counter (OTC) dominated activity. The Straits Times
Industrial index declined 17.47 to 2,280.84.
Two companies controlled by Loy Heang Heong, MBf Capital and MBf Holdings,
were heavily traded, closing 36 cents up at SDollars 2.04 and 8 cents higher
at SDollars 1.27 respectively amid speculation that MBf Capital might be a
takeover candidate.
KUALA LUMPUR was interested in MBf Capital on rumours of a takeover bid, and
the composite index gained 2.22 at 1,176.06 after an intraday high of
1,179.72.
Reports of a change in ownership sent MBf Capital forward 58 cents, or 20
per cent, to MDollars 3.46 in volume of 31.7m shares. The stock rose 29
cents on Wednesday.
Demand was also seen for holding company MBf Holdings, up 17 cents to
MDollars 2.19 on volume of 9.2m shares.
Golden Plus was strong on suggestions that the company was about to announce
a construction contract. The stock jumped 70 cents to MDollars 15.90 in
volume of 7.2m shares.
SEOUL fell back as many institutional investors unwound shareholdings ahead
of next week's three-day holiday closure.
The composite index shed 10.61, or 1.06 per cent, to 988.75, after setting a
high for the session of 1,005.70.
Brokers said rumours that the government might unveil measures to cool the
market's advance depressed sentiment.
In spite of heavy selling focused on blue chips and large-capitalisation
shares, Samsung Electronics made a record high, climbing Won3,000 to
Won147,700.
TAIPEI fell back after a volatile session, especially in the financial
sector. The weighted index lost 35.21 at 6,989.97 after a day's high of
7,129.07. Turnover was TDollars 105bn.
Investors bought financial stocks as worries abated that the central bank
would restrict liquidity. Electronics issues lost early gains as profits
were taken. However, brokers anticipated further rises, noting that some
stocks had fallen by as much as 15 to 20 per cent since July.
MANILA showed a modest rise on buying of beer group San Miguel and bargain
hunting of second line issues. The composite index edged ahead 1.09 to
2,954.46. Turnover came to 1.9bn pesos in volume of 3.2bn shares. San Miguel
'A' and 'B' shares rose respectively by 0.50 peso to 98.50 pesos and 1 peso
to 136 pesos.
Second line stocks were led by Metro Bank, which moved ahead 5 per cent to
840 pesos.
SYDNEY ended slightly higher after early gains in leading stocks were
stripped away by profit-taking.
The All Ordinaries index finished 0.3 up at 2,050.8 after peaking at 2,060.4
in morning trade. Turnover amounted to ADollars 521.1m.
BHP firmed 6 cents to ADollars 20.28 and News Corp 2 cents to ADollars 8.60,
while Western Mining was steady at ADollars 8.32. Commonwealth Bank of
Australia rose 4 cents to ADollars 7.87.
Gold mines were mostly weaker on the continued decline of the bullion price
in the international market. Newcrest Mining retreated 5 cents to ADollars
6.31, Placer Pacific 10 cents to ADollars 3.65 and Poseidon Gold 2 cents to
ADollars 3.63.
WELLINGTON was lower after heavy buying of Telecom over recent days dried
up. Telecom fell 16 cents to NZDollars 5.22 on turnover of NZDollars 14.06m,
compared to Dollars 43.9m on Wednesday.
The NZSE-40 index relinquished 22.84 at 2,093.20 and turnover was NZDollars
51.46m, down from NZDollars 92m.
Carter Holt Harvey slipped 10 cents to NZDollars 3.80 and Lion Nathan
declined 5 cents to NZDollars 3.18. Fletcher Challenge bucked the trend to
finish 4 cents higher at NZDollars 4.29.
KARACHI rose slightly on short-covering and selective institutional buying
of blue chips. The KSE 100-share index gained 4.51 at 2,216.84, with
declines outscoring advances by 175 to 127. Pakistan State Oil put on Rp5 at
Rp355.

FT  16 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Substantial increase seen in European
equity market trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading in the European equity markets increased substantially in August,
after four months of decline, in a delayed response to rising share prices
as most market indices advanced for the second successive month.
Volumes were up by 10.7 per cent from July, having dropped by 17.9 per cent
in July. Mr James Cornish at NatWest Securities, which compiles the figures,
notes that all the market indices were higher apart from France, Spain and
Italy, and these three markets were also the worst performers in August in
volume terms.
'International investors continued to take their holidays more seriously
than local investors,' Mr Cornish adds. 'Although there were individual
market exceptions, the volume in European stocks traded on Seaq
International in London, as a proportion of volume in Continental domestic
markets, fell to 15.2 per cent in August, the lowest level since January.'
The Netherlands saw the sharpest rise in August volumes, up 29.9 per cent
after a 30.3 per cent fall in July. Belgian trading rose by 29.4 per cent
and German volume was 19.8 per cent higher.
Swiss domestic volume increased by 1.2 per cent, but the 2.4 per cent rise
in the market index was accompanied by a 15.2 per cent decline in the volume
of Swiss shares traded on Seaq International, underlining the disenchantment
of foreign investors towards the market.
By contrast, France, where volume rose by only 1.0 per cent, saw the
proportion of London to domestically traded French shares move up to 42.2
per cent, from 40.3 per cent in July.
Italian volume continued to slide as politics clouded the outlook, while
Spain was the month's biggest loser, with volume down by 29.5 per cent.

FT  16 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Golds see early falls pared
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold stocks were lifted off the day's lows by last-minute buying ahead of
futures expiry, ending with mild losses on the back of a lower bullion
price. Industrials declined on a lack of fresh factors rather than any
mark-down, dealers said.
Shares drifted down from the start as investors took to the sidelines to
ride out the consolidation in the gold price.
Dealers said the market could see more aggressive selling of gold and
mining-related shares if gold dropped below the Dollars 388 an ounce support
level, but the undertone was still bullish on expectations that the metal
would eventually push ahead to Dollars 400.
The gold bullion price was still strong in rand terms and much of the
expected rise had been discounted in recent share price gains.
The overall index lost 32 at 5,840, the industrial index shed 21 to 6,523
and the golds index was 25 off at 2,428.
De Beers slipped 90 cents to R109.25 and Anglos fell R4 to R244. In golds,
Oryx went against the trend to gain 25 cents at R5.50, while Freegold
receded R1.25 to R75.25.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Swiss franc marches on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Swiss franc continued its firm showing on the foreign exchanges
yesterday, touching its highest level against the D-Mark since early 1991,
writes Philip Gawith.
While the Swiss franc finished unchanged in London against the D-Mark at
SFr0.83, the German currency fell as low at one stage as SFr0.8285.
The D-Mark was weaker against most European currencies, in spite of the
Bundesbank council's decision to leave German official rates unchanged. The
central bank also fixed the repo rate at 4.85 per cent for another two
weeks.
The dollar improved modestly, helped by the weaker D-Mark. It closed at
DM1.5467, from DM1.5374, and at Y99.38 from Y98.875. In New York it ended at
DM1.5492 and Y99.45.
Sterling also had a quiet day, with a mild gain against the D-Mark offset by
a loss against the dollar. The trade weighted index was unaltered at 79.2.
Two short term factors buoying the Swiss franc were the Swiss National
Bank's decision to leave rates unchanged - there had been speculation of
lower rates - and unconfirmed reports that Mr Markus Lusser, the Swiss
National Bank president, had told a private gathering that a rise in rates
in the future would be necessary.
A number of other factors, however, are supporting the Swiss currency. The
most obvious is the increased quest for safe haven status, now that there is
heightened concern about the outcome of next month's German election.
A further factor is the increased worry about the level of global stock
markets. This has buoyed the gold price, which traditionally has a good
correlation with the franc.
Analysts argued that with the Swiss economy having been the first out of
recession in Europe, and the SNB having made it clear that rates will
probably not fall further, the differential compared to German interest
rates is likely to narrow further.
Many observers are predicting further strength for the franc. If it reaches
the key technical level of SFr0.825, then there are predictions that it
could go as far as SFr0.79.
This presents an uncomfortable problem for the SNB. While it would like to
help exporters, who are being hurt by the strong exchange rate, it is
doubtful how much it can achieve, given that most factors supporting the
franc are beyond its control.
The dollar paid little attention to the release of minor economic data,
though the bias was towards the upside of recent trading ranges. Mr Robin
Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan in London, said the dollar's
inability to break the down-side of its recent trading range may have
created conditions for an upward squeeze on the currency.
In terms of fundamentals, what the currency needed to move higher was weaker
figures, which would quell inflation fears and help the bond markets, said
Mr Marshall. But recent releases did not provide convincing support for this
picture.
It may be, however, that technical factors will drive the currency up.
'There has certainly been a real loss of momentum with the dollar selling on
the downside,' added Mr Marshall. This had contributed to a change in
sentiment, though he stressed that trading conditions remained thin, with
most longer term investors out of the market.
The possibility of a US invasion of Haiti has started to impinge on markets,
and does not appear to offer any upside for the dollar. Mr David Munro of
High Frequency Economics in New York said that President Clinton's campaign
risked courting further unpopularity, and would 'bomb the markets'.
There were no surprises from the Bundesbank council, whose decision to
maintain the status quo had been widely anticipated. Although some
economists believe one further fall in German rates is still likely, this
optimism is not shared by the futures market.
The Euromark futures strip is currently discounting three-month money at
5.26 per cent in December, and at 6.06 by next June. Three-month money is at
present being offered in German cash markets at around 4.95/5 per cent.
One argument doing the rounds is that the Bundesbank will not lower rates
ahead of the October 16 elections to avoid being accused of favour-itism
towards the Kohl administration.
But Mr Brian Durrant, economist at broker GNI, commented: 'There is no
historical evidence to support the view that proximity to Federal elections
imposes a moratorium on Bundesbank interest rate decisions. In 1987, rates
were cut three days before the election, and in 1990 rates were raised 31
days before the poll.
The Bank of England provided Pounds 568m assistance to UK money markets, at
established rates, after forecasting a Pounds 550m daily shortage. Overnight
money traded between 2 and 5 1/8 per cent. Mr Durrant said efforts to
describe Monday's monetary tightening as reactive, rather than pre-emptive,
were harsh. He said the media remained 'obsessed with past policy mistakes'.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: CAP boosts least efficient UK
farmers, Touche Ross reports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is giving a boost to Britain's
least efficient farmers, according to a survey of 124 producers by chartered
accountants Touche Ross.
The annual sample found that the first year of CAP reform had begun to close
the income gap between the most and least profitable farm businesses.
Touche Ross's sample is grouped according to farm income with the farmers in
the bottom 25 per cent recording losses for the past five years. These
farmers showed a loss of Pounds 44 an acre in the 1992 harvest, but turned
this into a profit of Pounds 17 an acre for last year's harvest.
However, the more profitable farmers in the top quartile of the sample
showed an income boost of just Pounds 7 an acre during the same period -
taking their income from Pounds 155 an acre to Pounds 162 an acre.
'There is no doubt that net farm incomes have risen generally because of the
devaluation of sterling, but the most dramatic benefits have been seen by
those farmers grouped in the bottom 25 per cent of our survey,' said Mr
Vincent Hedley Lewis, senior partner of Touche in Agriculture, the
accountants' farming division.
Touche Ross believes the disparity between the rise in earnings for farmers
at the top of the sample and those at the bottom arises from the European
Union's set-aside policy.
All farmers are required to set aside, or lay fallow, 15 per cent of their
land, but the most profitable farmers who are laying aside high-yielding
land have the most to lose while set-aside payments are the same for all
producers.
'I am concerned that the reforms to date have not done enough for the most
efficient farmers. The EU is moving to a position where its farmers have to
compete on world markets,' said Mr Hedley Lewis.
'This means that minimizing the cost of production is vital, and that is
what the most efficient farmers do best.'
Touche Ross also said that overhead costs in farming continued to rise
despite the reduced area farmed because of set-aside.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India opts for organic cotton -
World demand has dictated the eco-friendly move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Growing international demand for fabrics produced from organic cotton,
rather than environmental purism, has prompted India to grow cotton without
using chemicals.
The federal government with the support of agencies at state level has
identified 1,000 hectares of land in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh for
producing organic cotton on a pilot scale.
Mr S. Sathyam, secretary for textiles, says: 'We hope to be able to prevail
upon a large number of farmers to take to the organic way of growing cotton.
This, however, is not going to be a simple exercise since cotton
productivity, which already is low in India, will fall in the first year of
organic cultivation.'
Apart from the lower initial yield, the labour costs of organic farming are
higher. The growers will also not be getting any premium for their efforts
until the chemical residues in the land fully disappear. But farmers will
not have to spend money on fertilisers and pesticides.
India has nearly 8m hectares, or 5 per cent of the total cropped area, under
cotton. But the cotton crop, which varies annually from 11.5m bales of 170kg
each to 13.5m, accounts for more than 50 per cent of the country's
pesticides consumption. Cotton is, therefore, seen as India's most polluting
crop.
However, in spite of intensive spraying of cotton fields with pesticides,
the standing crop remains vulnerable to attacks by boll worm and white fly
which have developed resistance to chemicals. In many Indian cotton growing
centres, the pesticide use has led to the elimination of insects which used
to keep the pests in check.
The success of the campaign to promote the cultivation of organic cotton
will largely depend on the ability of the agricultural extension officers to
convince the farmers that the non-use of chemicals will not affect the
fertility of land, and on the government offering a package of incentives
for the changeover to the new methods of cultivation.
Cotton growers, who mainly have small holdings, will need financial
assistance to construct compost pits and buy bio-pesticides and sprayers.
Officials say that India, which exported nearly 180m kg of cotton yarn in
the year to March 1994, has been regularly receiving enquiries about yarn
made from organic cotton. As a result, quite a few Indian textile companies
have decided to tell the farmers to produce organic cotton for them.
A start has already been made. Maikaal Fibres has been able to motivate
nearly 570 farmers in Madhya Pradesh to commit about 550 hectares to organic
cotton cultivation. Mr Mrigendra Jalan, the managing-director, says: 'We
have given assurance to the growers that we will be buying the entire
production of organic cotton at a 20 per cent premium over cotton grown by
using chemicals.
'Since organic cotton will give a better return and it is possible to grow
crops like groundnut, soya bean, sorghum and maize alongside organic cotton,
the new experiment should succeed in India. We have been inspired by the
success of the US, Paraguay and Egypt in growing organic cotton.'
Officials believe that it is imperative to have an agency to certify the
'genuineness of organic cotton'. It is also important, they emphasise, that
the mills planning to use organic cotton should arrange to make spot checks
throughout the season to ensure that no chemicals are used. Organic cotton
will be used exclusively to produce yarn for the export market. Quality,
therefore, will be a basic preoccupation.
Mr Sathyam explains that India, encouraged by the success of the US, had
also decided to grow naturally-coloured cotton which fetches a very high
premium in the overseas market.
There has, however, been a setback in the programme since India failed to
get the hybrid seeds and technology from the US to produce cotton in six
distinct shades. The government, therefore, has decided to fund a
biotechnology project so that seeds for naturally-coloured cotton are
locally produced. The coloured cotton makes the dyeing of yarn and fabric
redundant. And that, too, is considered eco-friendly.

FT  16 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices for finer Merinos rose even more rapidly in the earlier Australian
sale days this week, with broader types also rising if more gradually. The
Eastern states market indicator ended at 829c/kg, compared with 780c/kg a
week before. The Western states indicator rose strongly at the first
Fremantle sale but the market was a little erratic at the close, 5 cents
down on the day if still 25 cents higher than at the end of last week. With
prices at least double those a year ago, and for finer Merinos much more
than that, ther is resistance among wool textile manufactures and
particularly UK home market retailers, but a rising market does involve
small-scale but steady support even during the unhappier times.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wood chip shortage threat to BC
pulp mills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A severe shortage of wood chips is threatening the closure of several
British Columbia pulp mills, and has given a further twist to the upward
spiral in pulp and paper prices.
Chip prices on Canada's west coast have doubled since May from CDollars 60
(Pounds 28) to about CDollars 120 per bone-dry unit (BDU), which weighs
about two tonnes. One sign of the shortage is a sharp drop in chip exports,
mainly to Japan.
Mr Tony Jarrett, president of Fibreco Export of Vancouver, estimated that
shipments next year would fall to 185,000 BDUs in 1995 from 400,000 BDUs in
1992.
According to Pulp and Paper Week, a trade publication, two mills in British
Columbia have already closed due to a shortage of chips. BC is the world's
biggest producer of pulp traded on open markets.
Mr David Pineault, an economist at Resource Information Systems, a US
consultancy, said that other mills were considering shutting down to build
up chip stocks.
A number of mills are also said to be investigating the feasibility of
importing chips or of installing their own chipping machines.
Most chips are presently produced by saw mills as a by-product. The fibre
shortage has been caused by a variety of commercial and environmental
pressures.
With lumber prices relatively high over the past 2-3 years, many saw mills
have moved away from chips in favour of low-grade timber products, such as
wooden pallets.
Declining chip production was masked until earlier this year by the deep
slump in the pulp market. However, Canadian pulp mills' operating rates have
climbed from around 80 per cent in mid-1993 to 98 per cent last July,
reflecting a jump in pulp prices from USDollars 390 (Pounds 252) per tonne
to the present level of Dollars 700 per tonne.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US maize set-aside of 5%
expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Faced with a near-record crop and mounting grain stocks, the US Department
of Agriculture is expected to ask farmers to set aside, or lay fallow, 5 per
cent of the land they ordinarily would plant to maize in 1995.
Grain analysts say that, if the current US maize harvest balloons to a
record, the set-aside apportionment could rise to 7.5 per cent by
mid-November.
The USDA is required to announce its preliminary set-aside requirement for
maize by September 30 and can make adjustments until November 15. US farmers
follow set-aside guidelines to be eligible for price support.
US farmers are set to harvest about 9.257m bushels of maize this autumn.
Farmers have known since May that they will not have to set aside any land
for next year's wheat crop, a factor they see tied as much to the US
government's desire to remain competitive in the world wheat markets as to
any domestic supply management needs.
They have not been required to make idle wheat acres under the so-called
Acerage Reduction Program since 1992, when there was a 5 per cent set-aside.
US wheat stocks have risen steadily from 472m bushels in 1991 to a projected
581m bushels this year.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Equatorial and Luksic in
Chilean copper venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chile, which already produces more than 25 per cent of the western world's
copper, looks likely to get another big mining project. Equatorial Mining,
an Australian company, and the Luksic group, one of Chile's biggest
industrial organisations, are considering the joint development of their
neighbouring copper deposits in the El Tesoro area, 150kms from Antofagasta.
Combining Equatorial's Leonor deposit with Luksic's Sorpresa that virtually
surrounds it, would make it possible to develop a mine to produce at least
80,000 tonnes of copper cathode annually for a minimum of 12 years, Mr Peter
McAleer, Equatorial's chief executive, said yesterday.
Talks were taking place with several major copper producers about the the
possibility of bringing another group into the joint development.
The deposits lie on the same geographical fault line as the world's two
biggest copper mines, Chuquicamata and Escondida, and is midway between
them.
Nearly every mining company operating in Chile has staked some land in the
area because the Leonor-Sorpresa copper is 'exotic' - washed there from what
must be a huge, high-grade deposit elsewhere, but probably close by. The big
drawback is that the exotic copper is very difficult to release from the
ore.
The Luksic group, founded by Mr Andronico Luksic, is heavily involved in
Chile's copper business through its London-quoted Antofagasta Holdings,
which produced about 77,000 tonnes of copper in that country last year. The
Sorpresa project is held separately from Antofagasta.
Luksic already has found 100m tonnes of very high-grade - 2 per cent -
copper, enough for a big mine.
Equatorial, having previously failed to convince the Luksic group to join
forces, has been pressing on with its own plans for a mine to produce about
30,000 tonnes of copper a year for 10 years. AMP Society, Australia's
biggest financial services group, owns 19.9 per cent of Equatorial, the
maximum permitted level before a bid is triggered.
Chile's copper output exceeded 2m tonnes for the first time last year and
the total is expected to keep rising to more than 3m tonnes by 2000.
Escondida, jointly owned by BHP of Australia, RTZ of the UK, and a Japanese
consortium, is rapidly being expanded into the world's biggest copper mine
and this year's new mines include Cerro Colorado, in which Rio Algom of
Canada is the main shareholder, and La Candelaria, a joint venture between
Phelps Dodge of the US and Sumitomo of Japan.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries improve on better inflation
data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and ANTONIA SHARPE AND MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds improved yesterday on a regional economic report which
suggested the market may have over-reacted to August inflation data.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  3/8 better
at 98 11/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.635 per cent. At the short end,
the two-year note was up  1/16 at 100 1/32 , to yield 6.248 per cent.
After trading slightly higher in the previous afternoon, bonds across the
board continued to show slow but steady progress yesterday.
The market appeared to be pulling out of the slump triggered at the end of
last week, when the Labor Department revealed a surprising upturn in
producer prices.
The latest news on inflation was decidedly different. The Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia, in its monthly survey of business conditions in the
area, revealed an unexpected drop in the index designed to gauge whether
manufacturers were paying higher or lower prices for raw materials. The
index measuring prices received for finished goods also tumbled.
The trend was especially welcome because such surveys are viewed as reliable
leading indicators, in contrast to the producer and consumer price indices,
which look back at the previous month's inflation levels.
The commodity markets provided more positive reinforcement, as prices for
many goods slumped during the morning.
Amid these favourable developments, the market was able to ignore the
marginally troublesome announcement that initial claims for unemployment
benefit had declined by 3,000 last week.
As the afternoon commenced, traders were beginning to turn their attention
to today's figures on industrial production and capacity utilisation. The
data should provide additional clues on the direction of the economy over
the coming month.
Activity was limited, with many traders sidelined in observance of Yom
Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement.
European government bond markets rallied late in the afternoon on the back
of stronger US Treasuries, which caused dealers to cover their short
positions. However, little genuine buying was detected.
German government bonds were supported by the widely-expected decision by
the Bundesbank to leave its discount and Lombard rates unchanged after its
regular meeting. It also decided to keep the repo rate fixed at 4.85 per
cent for the next two weeks. On Liffe, the December bund future rose 0.60
points to 89.24 while in the cash market, yields on 10-year bunds fell 11
basis points to 7 1/2 per cent.
'If the Bundesbank had cut rates the bund market would have collapsed
because it would not have made sense in domestic or international terms,'
said Mr Stephen Hannah, head of research at IBJ International.
In his view, bunds were still too optimistic about German rates next year
even after their recent fall. 'We are expecting rates to be 50 basis points
higher than the levels which have been priced into the market,' Mr Hannah
said.
Analysts said the tone of the market remained fragile and yields on 10-year
bunds could move up to 7 3/4 per cent if next week's spate of data was above
expectations. German M3 for August is due on Monday while regional cost of
living figures are expected to emerge during the course of next week.
The market is also gearing up to an auction of bunds by the Bundesbank next
week. The new paper is likely to have a 10-year maturity though there is an
outside chance that the Bundesbank will go for a 30-year term.
UK gilts moved ahead by almost a point, buoyed up by rises in overseas bond
markets and the removal of stock which had been hanging over the market.
Two tranches of conventional gilts were exhausted in the morning, which gave
the market confidence to move ahead, said Mr Robert Thomas at NatWest
Markets. He said that a near-term rally was likely because yields were now
near the 9 per cent level. 'In the past, this has enticed people back into
the market,' he said.
The market faces two important events today. In the morning the August PSBR
figures are due and a gilt auction announcement is expected in the
afternoon. Some analysts expect the Bank of England to create a new 10-year
benchmark gilt.
The market shrugged off a larger than expected 0.3 per cent fall in August
retail sales, and Mr Michael Pratten at Kidder Peabody put this reaction
down to the market's continued preoccupation with inflation and what it was
likely to do over the coming year.
The yield spread between gilts and bunds narrowed from around 150 basis
points on Wednesday to around 144 yesterday. On Liffe, the December long
gilt future was at 99 21/32 in late trading, up  13/16 on the day.
Stories of hedge fund buying added to the positive tone in the Italian
government bond market, where the auctions of three-year and five-year
Treasury notes were oversubscribed. On Liffe, the December Italian
government bond future rose 1.24 points to 97.93.
Spanish government bonds were lifted by news that the government might relax
the tax law for domestic bondholders. The yield on the 10-year government
bond fell 31 basis points to 11.14 per cent.

FT  16 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Liffe concedes defeat in
battle of German Bobl
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Liffe has conceded defeat in one of its battles with Germany's Deutsche
Terminborse for dominance of the market in German interest rate products.
The London-based exchange has delisted its future on medium-term German
government bonds, known as the Bobl future, which was not traded in July and
traded only 53 contracts in the whole of August. The exchange sent a notice
to members on September 7.
The DTB has a rival Bobl contract, which recorded an average daily volume of
16,800 contracts in August.
However, Liffe still dominates trading in the two most important German
interest rate futures, the bund (long-term bond) and Euromark (short-term
interest rate) contracts. It currently trades around 115,000 bund contracts
and 93,000 Euromark contracts daily, representing market shares of 70 per
cent and 98 per cent respectively.
According to a Liffe official, the Bobl contract appealed more to domestic
than international investors.
However, the DTB said its success in the Bobl contract was largely due to
having launched the contract first, in October 1991. Liffe did not introduce
its Bobl contract until January 1993, by which time the DTB contract was
already established.
Competition between the two exchanges is unlikely to abate, however, as the
Deutsche Terminborse is seeking to attract more international participants
through its linkage with France's Matif.

FT  16 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Partial privatisation for
Slovenian textile factory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LJUBLANA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Beti Metlika, a Slovenian textile factory, expects to start its
privatisation in November, said Mr Miroslav Stimac, its chief executive,
Reuter reports from Ljubljana.
The factory, which is estimated to be worth about DM33m, will sell about 30
per cent of its shares to employees and 30 per cent to other Slovenian
citizens.
The remaining 40 per cent of the shares will be transferred to state-run
funds.
Beti Metlika is still in 100 per cent social ownership and the privatisation
process has been held up by resolving allocations of shares to people whose
property was nationalised after the second world war. It has now been
decided that they will receive between 2 and 3 per cent of the shares.
Beti will send its privatisation proposal to the Slovenian Privatisation
Agency at the end of this month.
The company exports 80 per cent of its production, mainly to Germany,
Austria, Italy, Netherlands, France and Sweden and makes clothes, underwear
and swimsuits.
Turnover rose to T5.14bn (Dollars 43m) in 1993 from T4.96bn in 1992 and
pre-tax profits to T148.1m from T3.7m a year earlier.

FT  16 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Asset-backed offerings in Canadian
dollars and lire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two asset-backed offerings were launched in the eurobond market yesterday in
an otherwise quiet session which saw a number of small-sized issues mainly
targeted at European retail investors.
European Sovereign Investments, a bond-arbitrage company based in Luxembourg
which issues bonds backed by a pool of European government bonds, launched
its debut offering in the Canadian dollar sector, with a CDollars 125m issue
of bonds due January 1998.
The issue was priced to yield 32 basis points over Canadian government
three-year paper and found demand from institutional investors in the UK and
Belgium and from retail investors, primarily in Switzerland and the Benelux
region, lead manager Wood Gundy said. The spread widened slightly to 34
basis points after the syndicate broke.
In the lira sector, US Guaranteed Finance Corporation, a special-purpose
vehicle which issues bonds backed by the US Export and Import Bank, launched
a L350bn offering of 12-year floating-rate notes. This is the first such
non-US dollar offering and the longest-dated eurolira bond ever issued,
according to joint lead manager Citibank.
Also in the lira sector, Peugeot Finance International tapped the shorter
end of the sector with a L150bn offering of three-year bonds with a coupon
of 12 per cent. Demand for the paper came from Italian institutional and
retail investors and investors in France, Switzerland and the Benelux
countries, lead manager Credito Italiano said.
JP Morgan is arranging a debut eurobond for San Miguel, the Philippines
brewing and food company and the country's largest manufacturing enterprise.
The USDollars 100m, fixed-rate offering will have a maturity of 5 1/2 years
and a semi-annual coupon. It is expected to come to market in the week
beginning September 26, after JP Morgan has completed a series of
representations to key investors.
JP Morgan said the bonds would be priced to give a lower yield than
Philippine government five-year eurobonds, which trade at about 200 basis
points over US Treasuries. The unusual maturity is due to Philippine central
bank regulations, JP Morgan said.

FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Chaebol lead quest for growth -
Korea's industry leaders are investing heavily
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hyundai Motor today will break ground for a new car plant at its Asan
complex in what is part of a rapid expansion of production capacity by
Korean industry this year.
Plant and research investments by the country's 30 biggest conglomerates, or
chaebol, are expected to increase by 55 per cent to an estimated Won24,200bn
(Dollars 30bn) in 1994, according to the ministry of trade and industry.
The Hyundai group is leading the field with Won4,500bn in investments,
followed by Samsung with Won3,700bn and Lucky-Goldstar with Won2,800bn.
The large spending on industrial facilities is in response to a sudden rise
in exports. The weakening of the Korean won against the Japanese yen has
lifted overseas shipments of electronics, cars, steel and ships. Investment
spending is contributing to a recovery of the Korean economy, with GNP
expected to grow 8.3 per cent this year.
Korea's industrial base is impressive. It has the world's second-biggest
shipbuilding industry, and ranks fifth in textile and petrochemical
production and sixth in electronics, cars and steel.
However, analysts warn that Korean industry's quest for greater size is
being conducted at the expense of improvements in product quality, and may
leave companies with excess production capacity if global demand weakens and
the Korean currency appreciates.
'It's either feast or famine for Korea,' said Mr James Oborne, head of
research at WI Carr Securities in Seoul. 'When global demand is good, Korea
has the capacity to cover it quickly. But the downside is that it is left
with surplus capacity when demand falls.'
Moreover, there are doubts whether a production increase is wise when Korea
is beginning to dismantle trade barriers, which have protected its lucrative
domestic market, in preparation for joining the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development in 1996.
The production expansion is being encouraged by the government, which
traditionally paid little regard to market conditions in its ambition to
transform Korea into an industrial powerhouse.
Industrial investments are largely being financed by state-subsidised bank
loans, which enable the chaebol to undertake the large spending, in spite of
their high debt-equity ratios of 200 per cent to 300 per cent.
The new Hyundai car plant, for example, is part of a government programme,
known as X-5, to make Korea the world's fifth largest motor producer by
doubling capacity to 4.65m vehicles by 2000. Korea's other main car
companies, Kia and Daewoo, are increasing capacity, while Ssangyong is
expected to start car production in 1996.
The shipbuilding and petrochemical industries, which suffered losses a few
years ago due to surplus capacity, are expanding production facilities in
anticipation of increased world demand.
However, the OECD recently warned that a plan by Korea's three main
shipbuilders, Hyundai, Daewoo and Samsung, to expand their shipbuilding
yards by 50 per cent could cause a glut in the global industry and lead to a
price-cutting war with Japan and other nations.
Although the production increase has received the approval of the state, the
chaebol are clashing with the government over plans to expand their
sprawling industrial empires into new sectors.
The administration of President Kim Young-sam has adopted a policy of
forcing the chaebol to concentrate on a few of their existing activities, in
an attempt to reduce their economic dominance and prevent them from
spreading their resources too thinly. The government, for example, recently
proposed that the chaebol should cut their stakes in non-group companies to
25 per cent or less by 1998.
The chaebol argue that they must diversify into new industries that offer
high-growth potential. 'Korean companies should concentrate on specialised
or niche industries, but without government guidance on what areas they
should pick,' said Mr Lee Hahn-koo, president of the Daewoo Economic
Research Institute, which is affiliated with Korea's fourth-biggest chaebol.
Samsung and Hyundai are challenging the government on this issue. Samsung
wants to enter the car passenger industry by 1997 through a technical joint
venture with Nissan of Japan. 'We need car production to maintain our
position as a leading producer in the machinery industry,' said one
executive with Samsung Heavy Industry. The government is threatening to
reject Samsung's licence with Nissan in an attempt to block the project.
Hyundai recently said it planned to build a large plant to produce cold- and
hot-rolled steel. 'The project makes sense from Hyundai's perspective since
it would contribute to its integrated industrial strategy. Hyundai is the
largest consumer of steel in Korea and having its own source of steel would
lower production costs for its car and ships,' said Mr Keith Nam, head of
research at HG Asia Securities in Seoul.
Although Korean industry is expressing few qualms about the sudden burst in
capacity leading to excess production, companies in the car and steel
industries are using this argument to support the government efforts to stop
the Samsung and Hyundai projects. They fear the entry of new competitors
will undercut their market share.
For example, state-controlled Pohang Iron and Steel, Korea's largest
steelmaker, would lose its biggest customer if Hyundai proceeds with its
plans. It recently announced an expansion of its steel production in an
attempt to squeeze out Hyundai and maintain its monopoly on cold and
hot-rolled steel.

FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Dairy Farm to cancel HK listing
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dairy Farm International, the food retailing arm of Hong Kong's Jardine
Matheson group, yesterday said it would follow Jardine Matheson and withdraw
its secondary listing from the Hong Kong stock exchange from March 31 of
next year.
The decision, widely anticipated, accompanied a disappointing set of interim
results. First-half net profit grew 59 per cent, to USDollars 108.4m from
USDollars 68.1m in the same period last year. But this was almost wholly
reliant on a USDollars 41.8m exceptional item from the sale of a factory
site in Hong Kong by its joint venture with Nestle, the Swiss foods group.
Turnover rose 11 per cent to USDollars 2.6bn from USDollars 2.4bn, partially
lifted by a 2 per cent movement in exchange rates.
Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, pointed to severe competition and noted: 'While
the overall result for the year will be enhanced by the exceptional gain
recorded in the first half, the operating profit is likely to remain at a
similar level to 1993'.
The interim operating profit was USDollars 63.8m, an increase of 3.7 per
cent on last year's USDollars 61.5m.
Pre-tax and interest earnings from Asia swelled 17 per cent to USDollars
38m, with Taiwan making its first significant contribution, according to
analysts. The group is shortly expected to disclose further ventures in
Asian markets, including Indonesia.
Earnings from Australasia fell 10 per cent, mainly due to increased
operating costs for extended trading hours and start-up costs of the fresh
food chain which will complement Franklins.
In New Zealand, Woolworths maintained market share but suffered from the
industry-wide erosion in margins caused by strong competition.
Simago, the Spanish operation, continued as Dairy Farm's biggest bugbear.
Continued losses from Simago held back European operations which chalked up
a loss of USDollars 7.8m, marginally less than last year's USDollars 8.3m.
Earnings per share before the exceptional item were unchanged at 4 US cents;
including the exceptional gain earnings per share rose 50 per cent to 5.99
US cents.
Directors are proposing a 1.65 US cent dividend, a 6 per cent improvement
over the 1.55 US cents paid out last year.

Thai stakes

<TEXT>
Mr Adnan Khashoggi, the Saudi businessman and arms dealer, is involved in
negotiations to buy stakes worth more than Bt3bn (Dollars 120m) in three
listed Thai companies, according to company announcements and stockbrokers
in Bangkok.
The Stock Exchange of Thailand has suspended trading of shares in the three
companies while the deals are negotiated. The companies are Jalaprathan
Cement, Semiconductor Ventures International (SVI) and Morakot Industries,
which produces and distributes palm oil.
None of the companies is regarded as a blue chip investment and there has
been no immediate comment from the Paris-based Mr Khashoggi on his
intentions. Brokers say the deals are being negotiated by Mr Rakesh Saxena,
a corporate financier and adviser to Bangkok Bank of Commerce.
SVI, an electronic components manufacturer, said large shareholders had
signed a memorandum of understanding to sell Mr Khashoggi 40 per cent of the
company by September 23 in a deal worth Bt640m.
Jalaprathan said its main shareholders planned to sell a quarter of the
company's shares to foreign buyers - said by brokers to be Mr Khashoggi and
his associates - by the same date. At the market price that stake would be
worth Bt1.56bn.
Morakot released no details of the sale of its stock, but brokers said 47
per cent of the company, a stake worth Bt1.13bn, was being offered to Mr
Khashoggi.

<TEXT>
Kellogg, the US cereals company, yesterday launched a campaign to change
breakfast habits in India as its products appeared in Bombay shops.
The company, which has built a Dollars 20m factory at Taloja, near Bombay,
described the move as 'the largest venture that Kellogg has ever entered'.
It first set up a liaison office in New Delhi in 1986, and under the
government's liberalisation measures the company has since established a 100
per cent-owned subsidiary in India.
Kellogg is targeting some 150m middle-class consumers in a country where
breakfast traditionally consists of hot, savoury local food and where cereal
breakfasts are virtually unknown.
Kellogg executives said the company was committed to spending Dollars 60m
over two years in India, and hoped to export to south-east Asian markets.
Ingredients were being sourced locally, said Mrs Damidra Dias, Kellogg
India's finance director, who added that the company had been involving
farmers in Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.
The cereals will gradually be introduced to other cities and the range
expanded.

<TEXT>
Hellenic Bottling Company, the Coca-Cola franchise holder for Greece,
Bulgaria and Northern Ireland, reported a 40.9 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits to Dr12.8bn (Dollars 52m) for the first half, helped by a strong
performance by its fruit juice division.
Turnover rose 24.5 per cent in the same period to Dr68.1bn.
HBC, part of the Cypriot-owned Leventis group which holds the Coca-Cola
franchises for Nigeria and Northern Ireland, said first-half income
generated outside Greece amounted to Dr1.1bn.
The company said sales volume in Greece showed healthy growth, in spite of
increased competition in soft drinks and juices.
HBC has a 65 per cent share of Greece's soft drinks market and about 40 per
cent of the fruit juice market, where its Amita brand has maintained its
position in spite of the arrival of a wide variety of refrigerated juices.
In Bulgaria, where HBC controls five joint ventures with local soft drinks
bottlers, sales of Coca-Cola products rose 40 per cent while pre-tax profits
were up 163 per cent.
HBC said its strong performance in Bulgaria resulted from the launch of
Sprite and Fanta and improvements in distribution.

FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Strong first half for Indosuez

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banque Indosuez, the French investment bank and subsidiary of the Suez
holding company, yesterday announced net profits of FFr412m (Dollars 76.86m)
for the first six months of this year, a 24 per cent increase over half of
its total net profits for last year, when interim results were not
announced.
Mr Gerard Worms, chairman of Indosuez and Suez, described the interim
results as good given that Indosuez, like other French banks, had 'not had
an easy year in the markets, particularly in the bond markets'.
Indosuez had net banking income of FFr6.42bn in the first six months of 1994
against FFr6.59bn, which represents half its 1993 net banking income. Gross
operating profits were FFr1.89bn in the interim period, compared with
FFr2.19bn for half of 1993.
The bank had a tough time in 1993 when it was forced to make heavy
provisions on its exposure to the weak French property market and on
corporate loans, following a steep increase in business failures. These
problems have eased and the level of provisions is expected to fall this
year. It was set at FFr632m for the first half, against FFr1.31bn for half
of 1993.
However, Indosuez - which, like many French banks, benefited from windfall
trading profits during last year's European currency crises - did not fare
so well in its market trading activities during the first half. Income from
trading in equity, interest rate and currency markets was down in the
interim period.
Conversely, the bank fared well in its US capital market activities and in
Asian investment banking. Indosuez yesterday said it planned to extend its
presence in China after receiving permission to open a branch in Guangzhou.
It has a branch in Shanghai and offices in Beijing and Shenzhen.
The Guangzhou opening forms part of the general expansion of the Suez
group's Asian interests following the recent sale of a large part of
Victoire, the French insurance company, to Commercial Union of the UK.

FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Radler faces a Chicago challenge
 -The Hollinger chief's task at a top US newspaper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Radler, who is Conrad Black's right hand man in his international
newspaper empire, sits in the publisher's suite at the Chicago Sun-Times
ticking off his cost-cutting plans for the city's second-largest newspaper.
'Aside from already announced lay-offs and buy-outs there's another Dollars
7m to Dollars 10m of non-salaried expenses which we'll be able to carve
out,' he says.
Mr Radler, chief operating officer of Canadian-based Hollinger Group, hopes
to double the Chicago paper's profit margins to 14 per cent, or about
Dollars 30m, within the next two years. Last year the Sun-Times earned
Dollars 19m, a margin of 7.5 per cent.
He will be helped by a general recovery in the US economy and a cyclical
rise in newspaper advertising lineage.
Squeezing profits out of the Sun-Times, the US's ninth-largest newspaper, is
a key component in Hollinger's expansion strategy. The Chicago newspaper
became Hollinger's long sought-after US flagship in March, when American
Publishing, Hollinger's US subsidiary, bought it and 61 affiliated suburban
Chicago publications from a syndicate of private investors for Dollars 180m.
The Sun-Times acquisition more than doubled American Publishing's revenues,
and puts the group in a key urban US market for the first time.
APC owns more than 340 newspapers, but most of them are small-town dailies
or weeklies scattered across the US. It also controls the Jerusalem Post.
The Chicago paper is perceived as a cash-generating machine that will
finance other US acquisitions.
APC used the purchase to raise Dollars 100m in a public share offering two
months after buying the Sun-Times, being careful to reserve all voting
rights for Hollinger.
But there was nothing specific about the Chicago market that attracted
Hollinger to the Sun-Times. 'We've tried to buy other papers,' Mr Radler
said, referring to Hollinger's widely publicised bid for the New York Daily
News in 1992, 'but we were unsuccessful'.
The dogged search for dispensable expenses has shaken the Sun-Times from the
pressroom to the boardroom.
The paper's general manager, chief financial officer and controller departed
shortly after American Publishing took hold, and the long-time Sun-Times
publisher Mr Sam McKeel retired on July 31.
A new publisher (the equivalent of a chief executive) has not been named,
but Mr Radler, who is based in Vancouver and is looking for an apartment in
Chicago, says he will move into Mr McKeel's old office when he finds the
time.
Among the rank-and-file, more than 50 employees have left or been laid off
since March. Insiders say at least 100 Sun-Times employees will have left by
December.
American Publishing aims to trim the Sun-Times' 1,500-person staff by 200
during its first two years of ownership.
However, cutting costs at the Sun-Times has not been easy.
The syndicate that sold the Sun-Times to the Hollinger group bought it from
Rupert Murdoch in a leveraged buy-out in 1983. That deal left the paper
laden with debt and with little cash for technology improvements, promotion,
or wage increases.
Unlike the London Daily Telegraph, which Hollinger turned around smartly
after buying it in 1987, the Sun-Times is produced by a slim staff (labour
accounts for only 35 per cent of costs) and its 35-cent daily cover price is
already 15 cents below its rival, the Chicago Tribune, limiting
opportunities for a price-based circulation war.
'This is not Fleet Street, not in terms of management or technology,' says
Mr Radler. 'The Telegraph was a 1940s newspaper. The Sun-Times is a 1970s
paper,' he says.
One of Mr Radler's concerns is replacing the Sun-Time's elderly presses with
technology that will print colour advertising supplements and employ fewer
pressmen. The upgrade is expected to cost Dollars 75m to Dollars 80m.
He is also faced with difficult labour talks with the guild representing the
paper's 265 newsroom employees over pay. The current three-year contract
expires on September 31 and negotiations are at a standstill.
Mr Radler shrugs off the possibility of a strike, saying neither side wants
one, while noting that Hollinger readily weathered a 62-day strike at its
Quebec City newspaper last year.
Hollinger's purchase, however, should engender confidence that Chicago will
remain a two-newspaper town. 'Chicago is a good city,' says Mr Radler. 'Its
competitive, but we're confident about doing business here.'

FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: St Gobain reports sharp advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Saint-Gobain, the French glass and building materials group, almost trebled
first half results, lifting net profits from FFr452m in the first six months
of last year to FFr1.26bn (Dollars 239m).
The sharp increase, above most analysts' forecasts, reflected improved
economic conditions in most of the group's markets, lower financial charges
and the positive impact of restructuring measures taken over the past two
years.
The performance was welcome news for the company, whose shares have been hit
over the past few weeks following the investigation of its chairman, Mr
Jean-Louis Beffa, as part of a corruption probe.
The investigation, involving one of the company's subsidiaries, is one of
several to affect leading French industrialists over recent months.
The improved result was achieved on sales of FFr38.04bn in the first half of
1994, compared with a figure of FFr35.74bn in the same period in 1993.
Operating profits rose from FFr2.34bn to FFr3.5bn, while financial charges
fell from FFr930m to FFr735m.
Turnover rose strongly on the American continent, and started to show a
similar revival in Europe, according to the company. Last year, Saint-Gobain
was badly affected by depressed demand in the construction and automobile
sectors.
The company said all of its principal operating divisions had seen a
significant increase in results, with the exception of piping. This activity
saw stable results, reflecting weak demand in the European water sector.
Industry analysts predicted that the strong performance would continue in
the second half of the year. They said that results would be boosted by
exceptional gains of about FFr900m resulting from the sale of its paper and
packaging activities to Jefferson Smurfit of Ireland.
The sale of its Cellulose du Pin division was part of a strategic plan aimed
at focusing the group on its core activities - glass, building materials and
ceramics.
Proceeds of the FFr5.6bn disposal will also combine with a FFr3.6bn capital
increase in March, to sharply reduce Saint-Gobain's debt. This stood at
FFr15bn at the end of last year.

Canadian regulators will release a landmark ruling today which is expected

boundaries between telephone companies, broadcasters and cable-TV operators.
The report by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications
Commission (CRTC) follows several months of hearings at which groups from
all sectors of the telecommunications industry urged a radical overhaul of
the regulatory framework.
The CRTC began its review to accommodate the rapid evolution of telephone
companies into providers of other services, and the increasingly blurred
technologies of the telephone, cable-TV and computer industries.
The phone companies, such as Bell Canada, dominate Canada's telecom markets.
The long-distance telephone market was opened to competition in 1992, but
the phone companies continue to have a monopoly on local services.
Long-distance calls have in the past heavily subsidised local services. But
growing competition in the long-distance market has spurred calls for an
overhaul of local pricing and market entry.
Cable-TV operators are gradually moving towards the local phone market with
the installation of fibre-optic networks equipped with two-way switches.
Canadian homes have one of the world's highest penetrations of cable-TV.
On the other hand, the phone companies have pressed for greater freedom to
enter the cable-TV and multimedia sectors. When it gave notice of the review
in late 1992, the CRTC indicated it wanted to bring down barriers to
competition.
Separately, Rogers Communications, Canada's biggest cable-TV operator, said
it planned to dispose of the non-Canadian publishing operations of Maclean
Hunter, the communications group being acquired by Rogers.

FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Elf Congo to sell oil field
stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Elf Congo, a subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine, the French oil group, is to sell a
22.5 per cent stake in one of its biggest oil fields in the Gulf of Guinea
to Chevron of the US.
Elf said yesterday the sale of the stake in the N'Kossa oil field and the
Haute Mer permit would become effective following approval by the Congolese
authorities. The French company declined to comment on the price to be paid
by Chevron.
The sale of the stake is in line with Elf's strategy of reducing investment
costs and curbing its debt burden. The company is planning to reduce
investment spending by 20 per cent this year to FFr32bn (Dollars 6bn).
The N'Kossa field is due to start production in mid-1996. Elf Congo, 75 per
cent owned by Elf and 25 per cent by the Republic of Congo, will be the
operator on the two permits and will hold a 62.5 per cent stake in them.
Chevron Overseas (Congo) will hold a 22.5 per cent stake and Hydro Congo,
the state oil company, will hold 15 per cent.
Chargeurs, the French diversified industrial group, has swung back into
profit in the first half of this year, agencies report. It posted a net
profit of FFr213m, compared with a loss of FFr209m in the first half of
1993.

FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Minorco jumps 43% after
operational shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Minorco, the Luxembourg-quoted natural resources company controlled by the
Anglo American-De Beers group of South Africa, had been firmly established
as an operating, rather than a holding company, Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson,
chairman, said yesterday.
In spite of relatively weak metals prices for nearly all of the past 12
months, he reported that Minorco's operating earnings jumped by 43 per cent
from USDollars 139.8m to a re-stated Dollars 200.5m.
Earnings before tax for the 12 months to June 30 were lower at Dollars
308.8m, against Dollars 340m, because of reduced financial income and
earnings from equity accounted investments as well as higher exploration
expenditure.
Minorco was finally transformed into an operating company during the past
year by the transaction which merged into it the international, non-diamond
interests of Anglo American and De Beers.
The new assets included a wide range of natural resource and industrial
interests in South America, European paper and packaging interests managed
by Mondi European Holdings, Cleveland Potash, the UK's only potash mine, and
a portfolio of investments based in South East Asia and Australia - most
notably a 19.9 per cent interest in Normandy Poseidon, one of Australia's
biggest gold producers.
The company also bought a 50 per cent interest with Mondi in Aylesford
Newsprint, which has started a Pounds 250m expansion project in the UK,
while its Terra offshoot is to acquire for Dollars 400m the Agricultural
Minerals and Chemicals group, more than doubling Terra's production of
nitrogen fertilisers and establishing it as a major methanol producer.
Minorco, looking to expand its shareholder base and improve its
international profile, has converted its unsponsored American depositary
receipt programme into a sponsored programme by appointing Morgan Guaranty
Trust as sole depositary.
Earnings before extraordinary items were down from Dollars 251.9m to Dollars
221.9m or from Dollars 1.12 a share to 99 cents. Profit after extraordinary
items was Dollars 226.3m, against Dollars 339.7m. Minorco is paying a second
unchanged interim dividend of 38 cents. In order to change to calendar year
accounting, the company is reporting for an 18-month period to end-December.
It intends to pay a final dividend of no less than 38 cents.

<TEXT>
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, yesterday appointed Mr Pedro Luis Uriarte chief
executive and announced that Mr Javier Gurpide, the institution's deputy
chairman, was relinquishing his management responsibilities. This is the
second management shake-up this week by a big Spanish bank,
The development at BBV followed Monday's announcement by Banco Santander
that its chief executive Mr Rodrigo Echenique was stepping down.
His role in the bank is to be be partially filled by Mr Matas Rodrguez
Inciarte, promoted to second vice-president of the banking group, and by Ms
Ana Patricia Botn, the daughter of Santander chairman Mr Emilio Botn, who
was was appointed a general director of the bank and the chief executive of
its brokerage arm.
Although neither of the two rival banks has given reasons for the changes,
both are understood to be broadly linked to the shake-out in Spanish banking
last April when Santander outbid BBV to acquire the Banesto banking group
and established a clear lead over BBV as Spain's premier financial
institution.
Mr Gurpide is viewed as carrying the blame for BBV's failure to acquire
Banesto while Mr Echenique is seen as not having been sufficiently
enthusiastic about Santander's successful bid.
Mr Uriarte, 51, a general director of BBV since 1990, has been entrusted
with the job of lifting morale and renewing the bank's aggressive edge.

FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Fiat sells seat-making unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fiat, the Italian vehicles group, is taking another step to outsource more
motor components with the Dollars 160m sale of its car seat-making
activities to Lear Seating of the US.
Under a preliminary deal announced yesterday, Lear will acquire Fiat's
Italian-based Sepi seat-making subsidiary.
Sepi will continue, under Lear's ownership, to supply Fiat's Italian car
plants.
However, Lear will also use the operations to supply markets in eastern
Europe and Latin America.
The deal is in line with a growing trend by leading car producers to
concentrate on vehicle assembly, leaving many component supplies to
independent producers, which can achieve greater economies of scale by
supplying several other vehicle makers simultaneously.
Two months ago, Fiat in effect disengaged itself from another important
components sector, the constant velocity joints and driveshafts essential to
all front-wheel-drive cars, in a deal with GKN, the UK industrial group.
GKN agreed to invest Pounds 50m (Dollars 77.5m) in a joint venture with Fiat
which will supply the Italian vehicle maker with drive-line components from
a new factory near Florence.
GKN holds 85 per cent and management control of the venture, which has taken
over Fiat's own business which had been making the components.
The Lear-Sepi and GKN ventures provide for non-Fiat customers to be
supplied.
Sepi had 1993 sales of about Dollars 350m and produced seats for more than
1m vehicles. It has about 1,800 employees.
The Sepi agreement is subject to completion of a due-diligence review and
other conditions.
However, when completed the deal 'will increase our global market share and
further strengthen our European position as well as allow us the opportunity
to expand with Fiat in eastern Europe and South America,' said Mr Ken Way,
Lear's chairman and chief executive.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Six French industrial and media groups are set to compete to buy Com-Dev,
the cable television operations of the Caisse des Depots et Consignations,
the state financial institution.
Com-Dev is one of France's largest cable television operators with about
200,000 subscribers and network connections to a total of 400,000 buildings.
However, like most other French cable operators it continues to suffer
losses. Last year it recorded a deficit of FFr480m (Dollars 90.7m), of which
about FFr400m related to the cost of investment in building the network.
The companies interested in buying all or part of the cable business are
thought to include France Telecom, Chargeurs, Lyonnaise Communications, TDF,
Generale des Eaux, and a subsidiary of Electricite de France. Most have
activities in the media or telecommunications sectors. Generale des Eaux,
the construction, utilities and communications group, is France's largest
cable television operator with about 450,000 residences connected to its
networks.
Mr Willy Stricker, president of Com-Dev, declined to comment on the possible
value of the company. He said the cable operator could be sold in separate
tranches, but that a global offer would be preferred. A decision on the
successful candidate, or candidates, is expected by the end of the year.
The Caisse des Depots wants to sell its cable TV operations because they lie
outside its principal financial and investment interests. An attempt last
year to sell Com-Dev drew interest from France Telecom and Generale des
Eaux.
The sale was postponed reportedly because of disagreements on price and the
sensitivity of the issue, following the upheavals at Canal Plus, the pay-TV
station. Mr Andre Rousselet resigned as chairman of Canal Plus this year
following an accord between communications groups.

Flughafen Wien, the partially-privatised Vienna airport authority, has
reported a 19 per cent slide in consolidated net income in the first half,
to Sch202.8m (Dollars 18.6m). It blamed higher financing costs and taxes,
Ian Rodger reports.
However, operating profits were ahead 9.8 per cent to Sch205.9m, on revenues
up 6.7 per cent to Sch1.56bn, reflecting what the group called 'healthy
growth'.
Passenger traffic was up 8 per cent; take-offs and landings rose 8.4 per
cent and maximum take-off weight was up 5.4 per cent.

FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Austria alters course on bank
adviser
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Austrian finance ministry said yesterday it had hired international
consultants Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton to advise it on the sale of part of its
70 per cent voting stake in Creditanstalt, the country's second largest
bank.
Last week, it was reported that the ministry had engaged J. P. Morgan, the
New York investment bank, for the delicate assignment.
This latest twist in the long-running saga over Creditanstalt's
privatisation comes only three days after CS Holding, the Swiss financial
services group built around Credit Suisse, withdrew its offer for a stake in
the bank, citing the increasing politicisation of discussion of the issue.
CS was also thought to be annoyed that JP Morgan, a strong rival of CS's
investment banking subsidiary First Boston, was selected to assess the bids.
Sources close to the government say JP Morgan was never actually engaged, a
posi-tion confirmed by JP Morgan.
The appointment of Booz, which is not in the investment banking business,
may be an attempt by the Austrian finance ministry, which has been
supportive of the CS Holding bid, to bring the Swiss back into the running.
However, CS said yesterday its decision to withdraw was firm.
That leaves only a so-called Austrian consortium, headed by
Italian-controlled Viennese insurance group EA Generali, with a concrete bid
lodged.
The German insurance group Allianz has also expressed an interest, and the
Austrian federation of Raiffaisen bank co-operatives is thought to be
interested. Its merger proposal with Creditanstalt last year was rebuffed by
the finance minister, Mr Ferdinand Lacina.
Mr Franz Vranitzky, the chancellor, expressed his confidence in Mr Lacina
yesterday, saying the minister had 'properly handled' the matter. It was now
a matter of finding more interested parties, which would require more time.

FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Nestle net held back by strength
of Swiss franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nestle, the world's largest foods group, said its first-half net income
edged ahead by 1.7 per cent to SFr1.27bn (Dollars 984m), with growth
depressed mainly by the strength of the Swiss franc.
The currency effect masked what it called 'a number of very positive
trends'. Underlying sales volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and
disposals, grew 3 per cent, compared with only 1 per cent in the first half
of 1993, and trading profit advanced 5.1 per cent to SFr2.8bn.
The total value of sales was unchanged at SFr27.4bn, but up 6.4 per cent in
constant currency terms.
The group forecasts faster net profit growth in the second half. It said
sales could also rise slightly, provided the exchange rates of the principal
currencies 'regain a degree of stability by the end of the year'.
Nestle makes over 98 per cent of its sales outside of Switzerland.
In a period when the Swiss franc rose strongly against the US dollar and all
the main European currencies, the negative effect of translating foreign
currency earnings into francs is substantial.
It also has an impact on the valuation of overseas assets. In the first
half, the group charged SFr338m against net income for the decline in Swiss
franc terms of overseas assets, especially those in hyperinflationary
Brazil.
Sales volumes rose steadily in both North and South America, and
'vigorously' in east Asia. The decline of sales in Europe was halted. The
recent rise in coffee prices has not had a material effect on the group.
Net financing charges were down 17 per cent to SFr362m, reflecting lower
levels of debt and lower interest rates.
At the end of June, the group's net indebtedness stood at SFr8.6bn, compared
with SFr10.4bn a year earlier, mainly as a result of strong cash flow.

FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Lufthansa to spin off businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lufthansa is to spin off its cargo, aircraft maintenance and information
technology services into three independent profit centres with effect from
January 1, Germany's flag-carrier airline said yesterday.
Announcing the final stages of a 'life-saving' re-organisation started three
years ago, the airline said EDS, the General Motors subsidiary, would take a
25 per cent stake in, and share management control of, the information
subsidiary, Lufthansa Systems.
The new business would be launched with a contract worth up to DM300m
(Dollars 194.8m) to supply Lufthansa with all its information technology
resources for at least three years, EDS said.
As with the other new companies, Lufthansa Cargo and Lufthansa Technik, it
would also be expected to develop profit sources outside the group, aiming
to provide 'packaged' services to the travel and transport industries.
As a legally independent company, Lufthansa Technik would have a 'good
chance' to keep its place in a market currently characterised by
over-capacity, newcomers and mergers, according to the airline's internal
newspaper.
Heavy cost pressure could only be offset by more flexibility than allowed
within the group organisation, it added.
The cargo company would absorb all the group's interests in the sector,
including a 25 per cent stake in DHL and a similar holding in the Luxembourg
Cargolux Airlines.
Lufthansa AG, the holding company, will concentrate on mainstream passenger
airline business and provide central management to the group, which also
includes the Condor charter flight and LSG catering businesses.
Yesterday's announcement comes days before subscriptions open on Tuesday for
a rights issue marking the start of an important phase in the airline's
privatisation. The Bonn government, which owns 51.4 per cent of Lufthansa,
will not take up its rights, therefore diluting its stake to little over 40
per cent.
Mr Jurgen Weber, chairman since September 1991 and driving force behind the
restructuring, said the spin-offs were intended to encourage entrepreneurial
behaviour and increase awareness of customers' needs.
He expected group turnover to grow by up to 5 per cent a year until 1997,
and has set his sights on lifting Lufthansa's share of the European market
from 16.7 per cent now to more than 20 per cent.
Meanwhile, there will be further cuts in the workforce, and management is
working on building up its network of alliances. The airline was 'still good
for a few surprises', Mr Weber said.
In a presentation to analysts and press, he claimed productivity had risen
31 per cent in the two years to June this year. The workforce had been cut
17 per cent and unit costs, by 15 per cent.

FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Rival consortia lodge bids for
final piece of SME
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The final dismembering of SME, the state-controlled Italian foods group,
came a step closer yesterday when two rival consortia - one Italian, the
other Italo-Swiss - lodged bids for its supermarket and restaurant
businesses.
The offers should mark the beginning of the end of one of the messiest
sell-offs attempted by Iri, the Italian state holding company, which
promised investors a model privatisation when the break-up and sale of SME
was launched in January 1993.
Official details were not released yesterday, but it is understood that
three companies have joined forces for the bid: La Rinascente, the quoted
Italian retail group; Ferrero, the Italian confectionery company; and
FinComit, the merchant banking arm of Banca Commerciale Italiana.
Their offer is pitted against a joint bid from Pam, another Italian
retailer; Edizione Holding, the Benetton family's holding company; and
Movenpick, the Swiss hotel and restaurant group. This consortium is advised
by Credit Suisse First Boston.
The consortia must first offer to buy 32 per cent of SME from Iri, which
owns a 62 per cent stake. They will then launch a public offer for a further
32 per cent at the same price, and finally buy the rest of Iri's shares.
At yesterday's closing share price of L3,779, SME is valued at just over
L1,700bn (Dollars 1.08bn), but analysts believe the business could be worth
as much as L2,000bn. Members of the winning consortium are expected to split
the GS supermarkets and the Autogrill motorway restaurant operations between
them, possibly bringing in other investors.
Iri broke SME into three parts for the sell-off - Italgel (frozen foods and
sweets), Cirio Bertolli De Rica (oil, canned vegetables and milk), and
GS-Autogrill.
Mr Michele Tedeschi, then Iri chief executive and now its chairman,
predicted in late 1992 that the operation would be completed in six months.
However, the sell-off has been dogged by problems. Italgel was bought by
Nestle of Switzerland in July 1993. Initial attempts to sell CBD and
GS-Autogrill last year had to be abandoned because Iri, advised by
Wasserstein Perella, the US investment banking boutique, said the offers it
received were inadequate.
CBD was eventually acquired by an agricultural co-operative, which sold the
olive oil business to Unilever last November.
Control of the rest of CBD, renamed Cirio, has now passed to Mr Sergio
Cragnotti, the former financier turned agro-industrialist. Mr Cragnotti is
building an agro-foods conglomerate on the back of Cirio's milk and canned
vegetable operations, and will today launch a formal bid for the 32 per cent
of Cirio still quoted on the Italian market.
The Italian government is hoping for a swift conclusion to the GS-Autogrill
saga, so that it can get on with the privatisation of Stet, the telecoms
holding company, and Enel, the electricity generator.

FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Tadpole expected to confirm US contract
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tadpole Technology, the Cambridge-based manufacturer of high-powered
notebook computers, has confirmed that it expected shortly to announce a US
defence-related contract worth millions of dollars over the next few years.
It also said that although its second half results would show significant
increases in revenues compared with both the first half and the same period
last year, the operating loss of Pounds 1.35m in the first half would not be
reversed.
Mr George Grey, chief executive, said the announcement was being made
because of press and other speculation.
Tadpole develops and manufactures portable workstations, personal computers
with the power of mainframe computers in a notebook-sized package.
Tadpole is already manufacturing a notebook based on a microprocessor
developed by Sun Microsystems and it has recently started making a machine
for International Business Machines. Earlier this year, the company
announced a deal with Digital Equipment of the US for notebooks based on the
Alpha microprocessor.
Mr Grey said there would be continued heavy investment in development as the
company prepared for broader markets.
In the six months to March 31 revenue was Pounds 10.6m.

FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Rates rebates help John Lewis to 74%
advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Lewis Partnership, the employee-owned department store and supermarket
group, yesterday provided further evidence of the turnround in its fortunes
with a 74 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 16.4m to Pounds 28.6m
for the half year to July 30.
The increase was flattered by the receipt of rates rebates following
successful appeals against valuations of some stores this year.
Last year's figures were also depressed by exceptional costs relating to the
start-up of a Waitrose distribution centre and an accelerated depreciation
charge on check-out equipment.
John Lewis refused to give figures for the exceptional items, but said that
taking them into account, the underlying increase in pre-tax profits was
about 33 per cent. Trading profits, after pension costs, increased from
Pounds 28.5m to Pounds 40.8m, while interest charges rose slightly from
Pounds 12m to Pounds 12.1m.
Mr Stuart Hampson, chairman, said strong sales increases in the group's 22
department stores and 109 Waitrose supermarkets, as well as in its textile
and furniture manufacturing businesses, coupled with costs held at last
year's level, were responsible for the improved performance. 'We should be
well pleased with the progress made in improving our profit,' he said,
although he advised partners to 'keep their feet firmly on the ground'.
He added that this week's rise in interest rates had not changed his view
that 'national economic conditions look set fair - not too much growth, not
too little', but the rail strike was disrupting sales.
Group sales for the half year increased from Pounds 1.13bn to Pounds 1.19bn.
Sales in the department stores increased by 6.5 per cent to Pounds 567.3m
(Pounds 532.5m). Mr Hampson said the stores had 'weathered the anticipated
storm of the April tax increases' and furniture sales had been particularly
strong.
Sales in the Waitrose supermarket chain increased by 3.8 per cent from
Pounds 577.3m to Pounds 599.3m. Only 0.5 percentage points of the increase
was accounted for by inflation, with one new store opening during the
period.
Mr Hampson said the installation of check-out scanning in many stores had
had a positive impact on sales, and Waitrose would also benefit from the
decision to open stores on Sundays following the partial deregulation of
Sunday opening. Three new stores will open during the second half.
Sales in the wholesaling and manufacturing division increased from Pounds
17.6m to Pounds 21.3m, with sales outside the partnership up 20 per cent.

FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Bakyrchik Gold seeks net Pounds 25m in
placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bakyrchik Gold, which so far has raised Pounds 11m for investment in a gold
mine in Kazakhstan since it was floated in London a year ago, is raising a
further Pounds 25.1m net via a conditional placing and a 3-for-5 open offer
of 9.45m shares.
This is far below the Pounds 70m cash call that Bakyrchik had warned
shareholders was on the way.
Mr David Hooker, chairman, said yesterday that shareholders had indicated
they would prefer some bank debt to be raised for the project. They would
also prefer not to hand over all the required cash at one time.
Mr Hooker thought Bakyrchik might raise debt of between Pounds 35m and
Pounds 40m. Discussions with some banks had started but, although it
appeared money might be available 'on suitable terms,' negotiations were not
likely to be completed until the end of this year.
He said Bakyrchik was likely to ask shareholders for further funds as early
as the middle of 1995.
Bakyrchik was floated at 120p a share. The price has been up to 405p and the
placing is to be at 283p compared with 292p on Wednesday. The shares closed
up 6 3/8 p last night at 297p.
The company wants to develop further the Bakyrchik gold mine in a joint
venture with the Kazakhstan government. The first stage set out to prove
that it was possible to treat the sulphide ore from the mine by the Redox
process.
Mr Hooker said that the Redox plant was still not operating on a continuous
basis because it had experienced 'typical start-up problems'.
Production of 45,000 troy ounces of gold a year (including 30,000 ounces
from the Redox plant) and a start on development of the underground mine
were 'the principal objectives for the next twelve months.'
A feasibility study estimated that annual gold production from Bakyrchik's
sulphide ore would be 265,000 ounces, against 230,000 ounces mentioned in
the 1993 listing particulars. Sulphide reserves are estimated to contain
1.26m ounces of gold compared with 660,000 ounces previously. Gold in
sulphide resources was estimated to be 8.6m ounces against 9.3m ounces.
The estimated cost of the second stage of development is now Dollars 102m
(Pounds 66m) compared with Dollars 109.2m at the time of listing. Cash
production costs are estimated at Dollars 142 an ounce compared with Dollars
147, among the lowest in the world.

FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Associated Newspapers buys Australian radio
stake

<TEXT>
Associated Newspapers, the UK media group whose newspaper interests include
the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, yesterday acquired a 10 per cent stake in
Austereo, the Australian radio group which runs stations in Sydney,
Melbourne, Canberra, Adelaide and Brisbane.
The stake was bought through a placement of 10m new shares at ADollars 1.15,
costing Associated Newspapers ADollars 11.5m (Pounds 5.46m).
The two companies said the investment followed discussions between them
'over recent months', and that they planned a 'long-term business
relationship'.
However, Associated's move comes at a time when bid speculation surrounds
the Australian group. Melbourne-based Village Roadshow, which has radio
interests alongside its larger cinema and theme park operations, has a 14
per cent holding in Austereo, and this week announced plans to raise
ADollars 230m of new funds, ADollars 80m of which was conditional upon an
unspecified 'strategic investment' going ahead.
While Village - in which the UK's Anglia TV and Mr Kerry Packer's Nine
Network hold minority stakes - has declined to detail its plans, there has
been speculation that Austereo could be the target.
Earlier this week, Austereo, which only launched on the stockmarket in July,
reported a loss of ADollars 8.3m for 1993/4. The figure was in line with
prospectus projections, however, and the company has forecast a ADollars
13.9m after-tax profit for the current year.
The managing director of Associated Newspapers' radio division in the UK is
Mr Charlie Cox, an Australian.

FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Logica advances to Pounds 13.5m -
Significant turnround in North America behind 50% improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits before tax at Logica, the computing services company, rose 50 per
cent in the year to June 30, after a significant turnround in North America,
which saw the US operation in profit for the first time since 1989.
The result was ahead of market expectations and the shares rose 14p to 318p.
Mr Martin Read, chief executive, said the improvement was a result of
rationalisation and restructuring, coupled with a powerful focus on key
markets implemented by a new and effective management team.
Pre-tax profits came in at Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 9m). In the UK, where Logica
makes about half its sales, profits rose only marginally to Pounds 9.6m
(Pounds 9.2m). The US, however, turned a Pounds 2.6m loss last time into a
Pounds 300,000 profit.
In continental Europe, profits rose 38 per cent to Pounds 3.6m on strong
underlying growth, but the company has still to improve its performance in
the Asia Pacific region where a Pounds 300,000 loss was repeated.
Revenues grew five per cent to Pounds 228.8m (Pounds 217.4m). Earnings per
share rose 61 per cent to 14p. A final dividend of 3.6p is recommended
making a total of 5p - a 25 per cent rise.
Interest income halved to Pounds 495,000 (Pounds 942,000), a result of lower
interest rates and a decline in average cash balances, which fell to Pounds
15.3m after a number of acquisitions. The tax rate, however, improved as
overseas subsidiaries moved into profit, eliminating unrelieved tax losses.
Operating profits rose 61 per cent to Pounds 13m (Pounds 8m), but Mr Read
said he was still dissatisfied with the 5.9 per cent gross margin. He
believes it possible to improve margins to 10 per cent and above.
In the second half of last year, UK margins rose from 7.4 per cent to 9.5
per cent, as restructuring and tighter operational control had their effect.
Logica is a broadly-based computing services group with its main activities
in the finance, government, energy and telecommunications sectors.
COMMENT
Martin Read has reasons to feel pleased, but not complacent, about his first
18 months at Logica. He has kept his promises, delivering improved growth
and profitability in a steady, unspectacular way. His no-nonsense approach
has proved effective in a company hitherto better known for chutzpah than
tough management. Poorly performing Italian and German operations have been
closed and the black hole of North America stopped at last. The company
culture is changing. Mr Read believes he is half to two thirds of the way
through the transformation. The company has won some significant orders,
notably a key RAF logistics project and the order book is healthy.
Nevertheless, the market remains fragile. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 18m or
18.6p of earnings are expected next year giving a prospective p/e of about
17. Good value, therefore, with an excellent 1996 in prospect if European
and US economies hold steady.

FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Bentalls cuts losses and expects fall in
borrowings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bentalls, the department store operator, reduced pre-tax losses from Pounds
419,000 to Pounds 343,000 after a seven per cent rise in turnover from
Pounds 33.8m to Pounds 36.2m in the six months to July 30.
The group, which operates seven department stores in the south-east of
England, reported an operating profit down from Pounds 480,000 to Pounds
365,000, because of a rebate on uniform business rates last year.
Bentalls expects that further successful appeals against uniform business
rates will result in a credit of Pounds 1.15m in the second-half results.
The company anticipates a material reduction in net borrowings after a
Pounds 4m refund of corporation tax and accrued interest from a capital
allowance claim for the flagship store in Kingston upon Thames in Surrey.
Net interest payable was Pounds 708,000 (Pounds 899,000).
The group plans to spend Pounds 3m over the next 18 months refurbishing its
branch stores to the standard of the Kingston store in the Bentall Centre
development, which opened in November 1992.
The centre's retail space is 87 per cent let, but the company receives a
minimum rental income of Pounds 1.65m a year under an agreement with its
co-developer Norwich Union.
Mr John Ryan, finance and property director, said increased lettings in the
Bentall Centre were now attracting customers away from other shopping
centres in the region.
Despite posting losses per share of 0.55p (0.67p), the group maintained an
interim dividend of 0.6p per share.

Textiles group British Mohair Holdings increased pre-tax profits by 51 per
cent from Pounds 907,000 to Pounds 1.37m in the half year to June 30.
Turnover rose 14 per cent to Pounds 22.6m (Pounds 19.8m) including a UK
contribution of Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 14.8m).
Mr Charles Fenton, chairman, foresaw a similar performance in the second
half as 'interest in mohair as a unique fashion fibre' continued to
increase.
Earnings per share increased to 6.81p (4.48p) while the interim dividend
remained at 1.4p.

FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Nat Express in black with Pounds 0.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long decline in the number of coach travellers has finally been
reversed, according to National Express. The transport group yesterday
announced a return to the black with interim pre-tax profits of Pounds
552,000.
The return, struck on sales up 31 per cent at Pounds 69.6m (Pounds 53.1m),
compared with losses last year of Pounds 407,000.
Mr Adam Mills, deputy chief executive, said passenger numbers had increased
by about 3 per cent throughout the group's network. This was the first rise
for at least two years.
The benefit was being felt from people switching to coach services during
the British rail strike, but the underlying trend was still an improved one,
Mr Mills said.
However, the need to discount fares to meet competition from other coach
operators and rail services meant that increased volumes had little effect
on interim profits. On average, National Express cut fares by about 3 per
cent, mostly in England.
The largest contribution to profits came from the group's newest business -
East Midlands airport.
Purchased for Pounds 27m in August last year, it contributed Pounds 1.5m in
operating profits. There were no comparative figures, although Mr Mills said
much of the savings effected by National Express were being passed on to the
airlines in an attempt to increase the volume of traffic through the
airport. Passenger numbers rose 18 per cent.
The main UK coach business, known as National Express, reduced losses in the
six months to June 30 from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 869,000. The British Rail
strike had little impact on first-half results, but was expected to benefit
the latter part of the year.
The European coach operation benefited from the acquisition of a Dutch
business. Operating profits rose by 16 per cent to Pounds 460,000.
The contribution from airport coach services almost halved from Pounds
182,000 to Pounds 93,000.
The dividend was increased by 8 per cent to 2.7p. Earnings per share of 1p
compared with a loss of 0.5p last time.
COMMENT
The rise in coach passengers might take some pressure off National Express,
but not much. This is not a spectacular growth market, and price increases
are difficult, if not well-nigh impossible. So the move into airports looks
better all the time. Yet the company has found it much more difficult than
it thought to follow its East Midlands success. Local authorities, which own
many of the desirable airports, have been alerted to the potential value and
prices are not cheap. Still, the benefits of East Midlands have not yet been
fully realised and an acquisition is almost certain at some stage. Forecasts
are for about Pounds 11.7m in profits this year, which leaves the shares
trading on a prospective p/e of about 17 times. The premium rating is
well-deserved.

FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: CMG rises 54% to Pounds 6.8m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Computer Management Group, one of Europe's largest privately-held computing
services companies, pushed pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.4m to Pounds 6.8m
at the halfway stage, an improvement of 54 per cent.
Turnover grew 13 per cent from Pounds 61.5m to Pounds 69.7m, while fully
diluted earnings per share rose 59 per cent to 25.3p (15.9p). Operating
margins improved to 9.5 per cent (6.8 per cent) and turnover per employee in
the first six months grew to over Pounds 37,790.
CMG, with staff numbering over 2000, operates principally in the UK and
continental Europe. It is likely to seek a London listing in the spring of
next year, subject to market conditions.
Mr Douglas Gorman, chairman, said the improved results reflected a
continuing demand for computing services throughout Europe.
'The Netherlands continues to be our largest market with 63 per cent of
turnover and is growing strongly'. The company is strong in mobile
telecommunications with projects in Russia, Poland, Germany and Portugal.
Mr Gorman said that trading conditions were improving in the UK, while
banking and consultancy services were developing well in Germany.

FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Rutland at Pounds 4.5m and plans expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rutland Trust, the financial and business services group, boosted pre-tax
profits by 23 per cent for the six months to June 30.
They rose from Pounds 3.64m to Pounds 4.48m on turnover of Pounds 55m
(Pounds 50.5m).
Mr Michael Langdon, chief executive, said the results were on target.
The group has more than Pounds 15m in cash in addition to its 42 per cent
stake in Capital Industries, the laminated paper maker. This is on the books
at Pounds 7.6m, but has a market value of Pounds 22m.
'We have significant financial flexibility with which to take the business
forward,' said Mr Langdon yesterday. The group was actively looking for
acquisitions.
Operating profits from the corporate finance and investment division rose
from Pounds 704,000 to Pounds 1.36m, mainly representing the contribution
from Capital Industries.
The contribution from Ben Shaw's, the Huddersfield soft drinks and water
business, was marginal, but is expected to be better in the second half
following the hot summer.
Earlier this year Rutland sold part of Ben Shaw's Pontefract canning line to
Cott Corporation, a Canadian group which provides own-label colas for
supermarkets. A further exceptional gain of about Pounds 2.7m is expected in
the second half from the sale.
The asset financing division, which is involved in vehicle contract hire,
almost quadrupled profits to Pounds 2.04m (Pounds 536,000) on the back of
new business won and an increase in the value of second-hand cars.
Profits from professional services retreated from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds
1.08m, reflecting a cyclical setback at Ellis &amp; Buckle, the chartered loss
adjuster. However, the group believes Ellis will emerge from the downturn
'as one of the pre-eminent loss adjusters.'
Earnings per share rose from 0.93p to 1.08p. The interim dividend is 0.30p
(0.27p).

FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Increased market share helps Kwik-Fit to
Pounds 15m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A gain from property sales, coupled with a sharply lower interest charge and
higher volume, helped Kwik-Fit Holdings, the tyre, exhaust and brakes
fitter, to increase pre-tax profits by 33 per cent in the half year to
end-August.
On sales ahead 14 per cent at Pounds 150.4m (Pounds 132.1m) the pre-tax
result was Pounds 15.2m (Pounds 11.5m) including Pounds 761,000 (Pounds
207,000) from property disposals.
Net interest payable fell from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 307,000, and
borrowings from Pounds 17m to Pounds 5.6m.
Mr Tom Farmer, chairman, said that marketing initiatives introduced last
year had brought in more customers, leading to further increases in market
share. The board was 'more than satisfied - in fact we are delighted.'
Extra volume fed through to a 20 per cent rise in operating profits from
Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 14.8m. Operating margins rose from 9.3 to 9.8 per
cent.
The UK contributed Pounds 11m (Pounds 9.5m) of operating profits on Pounds
117.4m (Pounds 104.1m) of turnover. More than half the sales were accounted
for by tyres, where the group lifted its market share from 14 to 18 per
cent.
Sales of exhausts in the UK were 4 per cent higher at Pounds 36.8m, while
sales in the new brakes sector almost doubled to Pounds 8m following a
national launch last November. The group is aiming for 10 per cent of the UK
brakes market in the next couple of years.
Sales overseas - in the Netherlands and Belgium - rose by 18 per cent to
Pounds 33m (Pounds 28m), yielding operating profits of Pounds 3.8m (Pounds
2.8m).
Capital expenditure increased from Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 9m, reflecting the
acquisition and development of new properties. Mr John Houston, finance
director, said spending last year had been restrained - 'but now we have
more confidence in the potential of our business.'
At August 31 the group was operating a total of 651 (632) centres. A further
27 were being developed. Mr Farmer said he believed there was room for a
further 200 outlets in the UK, which has 494 centres.
Earnings per share increased from 4.7p to 6.2p, and the interim dividend is
1.7p (1.5p).
COMMENT
Tyres and exhausts might seem unexciting markets, but Kwik-Fit has found the
right formula to make them pay. Its share of both sectors is rising, adding
to its buying power, while there is everything to play for in the new brakes
market. The strong brand name and narrow focus has helped it to survive a
period of intense competition, and it now feels confident enough to speed up
expansion. While plenty of competition remains, it is fragmented. Earnings
are expected to be 11p for the full year and 13p in 1995-96, which puts the
stock at a 10 per cent discount to the market. This looks grudging for a
company behind such a successful retail concept.

FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Whatman hampered by Cyclopore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatman, the manufacturer of filtration and purification products, reported
a drop in profits for the first six months of 1994, primarily attributable
to losses from its recent acquisition, Cyclopore.
However, the company expressed its confidence in future profits growth by
raising the interim dividend by 9 per cent to 3.6p (3.3p).
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 4.56m to Pounds 4.41m, in spite of an 8 per
cent increase in turnover to Pounds 36.5m (Pounds 33.7m), but this was
largely due to the impact of acquisitions.
Cyclopore, a Belgian membrane manufacturer acquired in November, lost Pounds
200,000, while German molecular biology company Biometra, acquired for
Pounds 3.5m last year, achieved only break-even.
The company expected Biometra to produce 'good profits in the second half',
as it has a seasonal business pattern. Cyclopore is not expected to make a
positive contribution until 1996.
Revenues, excluding acquisitions, increased by 4 per cent at constant
exchange rates, with increases coming mainly from North America, where
operating profit rose from Pounds 2.05m to Pounds 2.69m.
The UK International region, mainly continental Europe, suffered from
production problems, which have now been overcome, but this resulted in a
reduction in operating profit to Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 2.66m).
The company is currently working on a rationalisation of its North American
business in order to reduce its cost base, and this will impact on second
half revenues. However, Mr Andrew Smithers, chairman, said: 'We anticipate
that improved second-half trading in both North America and the UK
International region will allow us to absorb the cost of this
reorganisation.'
At the half year stage, the company had net borrowings of Pounds 3m,
representing gearing of only 6 per cent. It intends to make further
acquisitions.
Earnings per share fell from 12.91p to 12.36p.

FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Independent Insurance at Pounds 10m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A good performance from its underwriting business was behind a more than
doubling of pre-tax profits from Independent Insurance Group from Pounds
4.29m to Pounds 10.1m for the first six months of the year.
The general insurer, which floated on the stock market last year, achieved
gross underwriting profits of Pounds 6.4m against a loss of Pounds 2.23m.
The latter figure was depressed by a Pounds 5.2m loss on stop-loss policies
underwritten for Lloyd's Names in 1989 and 1990.
The gross written premium increased by 24 per cent to Pounds 131.3m (Pounds
106.2m), while investment income rose by the same amount from Pounds 3.93m
to Pounds 4.86m.
Earnings per share jumped from 8.7p to 15.4p and the interim dividend is
raised 14 per cent to 4p (3.5p).
The company said that a combination of new products and more efficient
systems had contributed towards the improvement.
In its general insurance business, gross premium income in the commercial
division rose 31 per cent to Pounds 52.1m (Pounds 39.7m), resulting in an
underwriting profit of Pounds 1.5m compared with Pounds 300,000.
Mr Michael Bright, chief executive, said the company was taking precautions
against potential problems associated with employers liabilities.
The home insurance market produced an underwriting profit 53 per cent ahead
at Pounds 2m (Pounds 1.3m).
Motor insurance business experienced competitive conditions and the gross
written premium slipped from Pounds 18.7m to Pounds 18.2m, although profits
almost quadrupled from Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 1.9m.
Mr Bright added that the encouraging trends seen in the first half were
continuing to have a beneficial effect on current trading.

FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Proudfoot names new chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The restructuring and rationalisation measures at Proudfoot, the management
consultancy chaired by Lord Stevens, yesterday claimed the job of Mr John
Prosser, the chief executive.
He is stepping down from that post and will head the group's European sales
operations. Mr Malcolm Hughes, the former managing director of Vernons
Group, will take over as chief executive.
Previous cost-cutting moves helped the group report a 16 per cent rise in
first-half pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.5m to Pounds 6.4m from continuing
operations. Overall first-half losses last time totalled Pounds 14m,
including a restructuring provision of Pounds 18.3m.
However, in the six months to June 30, tough conditions in the European side
of the business, together with the withdrawal from some markets, saw
turnover fall 26 per cent to Pounds 60.5m (Pounds 81.7m).
Mr David Gill, finance director, said that, following the completion of
changes to the group, the challenge was to achieve revenue growth from new
and existing business. 'We have put everything in place, we now have to
prove we can do it.'
Mr Gill admitted that the problem in the European operations was due partly
to organisational difficulties. 'John Prosser is going to do a job in which
he excelled during the 1980s and early 1990s.'
The core Proudfoot consultancy business continued to be the main source of
revenue, even though operating profits fell by 30 per cent to Pounds 5.34m
(Pounds 7.66m). Operations in the US and Mexico performed well; the
consultancy achieved a tripling of billings in the US. However, Canada and
Brazil were weak.
Mr Gill said Proudfoot would continue to pull in its horns from peripheral
markets and concentrate on its core North American businesses.
A turnround was achieved in the Crosby teaching-based consultancy, which
turned a Pounds 1.5m loss into a Pounds 1.2m operating profit.
However, the group said current trading in the division was 'disappointing.'
It added: 'The realignment of the cost structure of the business should
mitigate this impact, though the decreased revenue will reduce second-half
profitability.'
Earnings per share slipped 0.1p to 5.2p, while the dividend was maintained
at 2p.

Mr Jim Hodkinson, former managing director of the B&amp;Q DIY chain, has
resigned from a consultant's position with Home Depot, the US DIY giant,
after only two months, writes Neil Buckley.
He was taken on in July to explore international expansion opportunities for
Home Depot.
The company announced yesterday he had resigned 'due to family reasons that
require him to return to England'.
Home Depot refused to say what the reasons were and Mr Hodkinson was not
available for comment.

FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Defence uncertainties catch up with Meggitt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A slowdown in defence and aerospace-related businesses were behind a drop in
interim pre-tax profits and sales at Meggitt, the Dorset-based engineering
company.
Pre-tax profits in the half-year to June 30 fell from Pounds 10.77m to
Pounds 8.58m while turnover dropped 10 per cent from Pounds 179.3m to Pounds
161.7m.
The aerospace division saw a drop in sales from Pounds 64.9m to Pounds 60m
and controls from Pounds 61.1m to Pounds 50.3m. Only electronics increased,
from Pounds 30.8m to Pounds 31.6m.
The sales decline was due to 'continuing slowing of orders for the defence
and aerospace-related businesses and fewer major contract completions', Mr
Ken Coates, executive chairman, said.
The aerospace division continued to suffer because of fundamental changes in
the defence sector and a highly competitive commercial market.
But he predicted a return to growth in 1995 provided that trading conditions
continued to improve. Orders for the first half of 1994 were up 15 per cent
on the second half of last year, and the Asia Pacific market saw a 60 per
cent rise in overall sales from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 16m.
Mr Coates said he expected growth in the next year to be driven by the
electronics division, with the component companies showing the most notable
improvement.
The rationalisation programme continued with a further 3 per cent reduction
in numbers employed to just under 6,000 and the amalgamation of five small
businesses with larger ones.
A disposal programme would realise cash in excess of Pounds 20m. Gearing had
been reduced from 31 per cent to 29 per cent.
Earnings per share fell from 3.3p to 2.5p and an interim dividend of 1.3p is
maintained.
COMMENT
There had to come a point when problems in the aerospace industry finally
caught up with Meggitt. The moment has arrived, although the severity of the
impact had not been anticipated. The company will be able to achieve some
earnings progress through the energy and electronics divisions, but they are
small and it is unlikely to be enough to excite investors. Even a
well-intentioned restructuring programme will be unable to overcome the
problems of a declining military aerospace sector and a civilian sector
unlikely to pick up before the end of 1996. The market could take some
convincing with a forecast of Pounds 18m for 1994 and a prospective p/e of
14.7.

FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: BP emerges from retrenchment era - Output
predicted to show steady increase into the next century
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Petroleum yesterday disclosed details of its future exploration and
production strategy, in a move which reinforced its recent message that it
has now emerged from a protracted period of retrenchment.
In an upbeat and wide-ranging briefing to industry analysts in London, Mr
John Browne, managing director of BP Exploration, said the company was set
to expand annual oil and gas production by two and six per cent respectively
into the next century.
The steady rise in output would result from improved recovery rates from
fields in Alaska and the North Sea - the current focus of BP operations -
and the development of new projects, many of them in the developing world.
Mr Browne used the occasion to announce the discovery of two big natural gas
fields off south Vietnam, the latest in a series of gas finds which will
reduce the company's dependence on oil.
Recoverable gas reserves from the offshore Nam Con Son basin were 2 trn
cubic feet. That is large enough for the discovery to 'play a key role in
supplying Vietnam's emerging gas market,' said Mr Browne.
Mr Browne said gas would form a growing part of BP's business. In addition
to Vietnam, it has recently found a large gas field in Colombia, where
demand has been rising by 10 per cent a year.
The company is also negotiating with Sonatrach, the Algerian state energy
company, on a project to develop a gas field which would be linked by
pipeline to southern Europe.
BP also had 'significant' undeveloped gas reserves in Papua New Guinea which
might justify a costly liquified natural gas project.
Mr Browne said BP would have to develop local or regional gas markets to
exploit its growing gas reserves. That would require it to enter new
businesses, such as power generation. But Mr Browne said it would only do so
with experienced partners.
The projected growth in oil production was likely to be accompanied by
further cuts in costs. Over the past five years finding costs have fallen
from about Dollars 5 a barrel to Dollars 2, and development costs from
Dollars 10 a barrel to between Dollars 4 and Dollars 5.
Mr Browne expressed satisfaction with the portfolio of assets and potential
projects outlined yesterday, and said it was the culmination of five years
of effort.
Since 1989 annual exploration budgets have fallen by a third to Dollars
600m. But spending has been focused on new areas, which could account for
300,000-400,000 barrels a day of new production within five years.
Although many of the new areas are in countries with higher political risk
profiles, Mr Browne said developed OECD countries would still account for 75
per cent of the company's output in 2004.
He stressed that BP, which was forced into retrenchment two years ago
because of an over-ambitions expansion and investment programme, had adopted
a new strategy to avoid making similar mistakes in future.
It will now split upstream development projects into phases to reduce risk
and to avoid the bunching of large-scale capital commitments.
'Not all these projects will work out,' he said. 'And we won't make choices
until we have to, when we will take into account a number of factors,
including the economics of the time and moves by the competition.'

FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Andrews Sykes splits advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Independent directors of Andrews Sykes, the specialist industrial services
group, yesterday issued split advice to shareholders over a buy-out bid from
Mr Jacques Murray, the chairman.
The two non-executive directors, Mr Michael Gailer and Mr Michael Haines,
advised shareholders to reject the bid of 50p per ordinary share if they
have confidence in the group's potential.
However, they added that risk-averse shareholders should consider selling in
the market.
Holders of preference shares are recommended to reject outright a bid of 12p
per share in the formal offer document which was posted yesterday.
Ordinary shares closed down 2p at 74p yesterday, while preference shares
remained unchanged at 43p.
The offer, which values the company at Pounds 8.24m, was triggered under the
City takeover code in mid-August when European Fire Protection Holdings'
stake in the group passed the 29.9 per cent threshold.
Since then European Fire, a private Netherlands-based company owned by Mr
Murray, has increased its holding to 42.1 per cent of the ordinary shares
and 8.3 per cent of preference shares.
Andrews Sykes is in the midst of a reorganisation to refocus on its core
activities of pumping, heating, air conditioning and its UK-based hire
business.
The company's UK bankers have demanded that the group, whose gearing stood
at 256 per cent on March 31, reduces borrowings from about Pounds 16m to
Pounds 9.9m by January 31, 1995.
The company has not yet paid the dividend on preference shares due on June
1. Distributable reserves stood at just Pounds 11,000 on March 31.
The group holds its annual meeting today.

An improving order intake helped Beauford return to profit in the six months
to June 30.
On sales of Pounds 15.7m (Pounds 13.4m) from continuing operations, the
engineering and ceramics group achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 851,000
(Pounds 3.06m loss) including an exceptional credit from the sale of the
Clayton stake of Pounds 362,000. But interest took Pounds 313,000 (Pounds

FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: French purchase cuts Courtaulds Textiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Entering the competitive French hosiery market has cost Courtaulds Textiles,
the clothing and fabrics group, Pounds 7.4m in the half year to June 30 and
helped to depress pre-tax profits by 26 per cent from Pounds 13.7m to Pounds
10.1m.
Mr Noel Jervis, chief executive, said that in spite of the losses incurred
by businesses acquired from Hartstone in March, including Cogetex of France,
he was pleased with their progress.
'They have performed in line with our expectations,' he said. 'The recent
hosiery acquisition is highly seasonal and the loss incurred was as
anticipated.'
The months consolidated by Courtaulds were the French businesses' worst
trading period, he said. From March to June, they achieved on average just
12 per cent of annual sales, whereas the bulk arose in the autumn and winter
months. 'It's a bit like selling fireworks and Christmas cards,' he said.
The heavy second half bias meant that predicting the outcome for the year at
this stage was difficult, although the businesses were expected to
contribute a profit. Courtaulds said it would update shareholders in
December when trading patterns would be clearer.
Excluding the effects of acquisitions, disposals and other one-off charges,
profits on a like-for-like basis rose by 22 per cent to Pounds 14.6m. The
profits improvement was largely due to lower interest costs relating to the
underlying businesses, and reduced reorganisation charges.
Like-for-like operating profits before reorganisation costs were 1 per cent
down at Pounds 16.9m.
Sales rose 10 per cent at Pounds 463m, including Pounds 15.3m from
acquisitions, against Pounds 422.5m, including Pounds 600,000 from
discontinued activities.
All divisions returned improved profits before interest charges, with the
exception of branded clothing which fell into loss. This included the
Hartstone businesses as well as Aristoc, which was affected by problems at a
factory and Georges Rech, which suffered from difficult trading.
Mr Jervis said the problems with Aristoc were now 'well over' and it was
expected to make a 'respectable profit in the second half. Georges Rech had
been restructured, but trading continued difficult.
The dividend was increased by 4.25 per cent to 4.9p (4.7p) although earnings
fell by 33 per cent to 7p (10.4p).
COMMENT
Courtaulds may be optimistic about its future in Europe but the market is
not going to take any chances until that December trading statement. While
encouraged by noises that Sara Lee may be retreating on its aggressive price
cutting campaign, there are a few too many burnt fingers out there after
last years profits warning. The biggest factor in Courtaulds' favour, for
the short-term, anyway, is its management. They have done well in recession
and the Hartstone purchase does have considerable recovery potential.
Forecasts this year are for about Pounds 45m, putting the shares on a
prospective p/e of about 17. This premium appears justified given the
opportunities for recovery in Europe.

FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Mirror Group restores dividend - Montgomery
confirms joint venture for subscription cable channel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Mirror Group announced yesterday that it was paying its first dividend
since the days of the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
Even though the payment is only 1p it was being seen as a significant
development since the publisher of the Daily and Sunday Mirror was returning
to normality and even respectability.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 34.7m for the six months to July 3. The previous
figure of Pounds 69.9m included an exceptional credit of Pounds 36.1m,
mainly representing the release of pension fund provisions.
The modest increase in profits before exceptionals, against the background
of a price war in the industry, was matched by underlying growth in earnings
per share from 6.4p to 6.6p. Advertising revenue rose from Pounds 83.4m to
Pounds 84m.
Turnover fell from Pounds 237.2m to Pounds 230.6m. However, operating costs
were reduced by Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 176m and interest payable fell to
Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 15.8m). The group said a Pounds 350m restructuring of
debt had been arranged in principle on much improved terms.
Mr John Attwood, finance director, accepted that in any other industry the
performance would be considered flat. But 'in the context at least of the
newspaper industry at the moment they (the results) are exceptionally
strong.'
Mr David Montgomery, chief executive of Mirror Group, also confirmed
yesterday that heads of agreement had been signed to form a joint venture
with five of the largest cable and telephone companies in the world to
provide a national subscription channel on cable.
The channel, to be called Live TV, will be distributed to more than 500,000
homes from the outset and will focus mainly on live events.
Heads of agreement have also been signed with Midland Independent
Newspapers, publisher of the Birmingham Post and Evening Mail to develop
Birmingham Live, a local version of Live TV.
Mr Montgomery said sales of the Mirror had remained about 2.5m a day, which
with sales of the Daily Record took the total to 3.2m.
Mr Montgomery also warned that the reduction in the price of The
Independent, in response to cuts at The Times and the Daily Telegraph, would
have a damaging effect on revenues and losses for the year.
Losses at Newspaper Publishing, publisher of The Independent, are likely to
be larger than expected, although Mr Montgomery declined to say what current
trading losses were.
The Mirror Group's 28 per cent stake in Newspaper Publishing, purchased in
March, cost Pounds 1.4m over the four months since acquisition.
COMMENT
The shareholders of Mirror Group are not exactly going to respond with three
cheers to yesterday's results. But the modest restoration of dividends,
reduced operating costs, the prospect of better margins on debt are all
signs that the Mirror is becoming a normal company again. There are also
welcome signs of future thinking through an involvement in cable television
and signs of some circulation growth, particularly on Sunday. Profit growth
is likely to remain modest, with about Pounds 70m likely for the full year.
Mr Derek Terrington at Kleinwort Benson is forecasting only Pounds 82m for
next year - assuming the price wars continue - which would give a
prospective p/e ratio of nine. The share price fell 4p to 131p.

FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 234m so far for B&amp;C creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Creditors to British &amp; Commonwealth, the collapsed financial services group,
are to receive interim payments of Pounds 95m, the administrators said
yesterday.
Creditors to British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings will receive a dividend of 5p
in the pound, bringing their total received so far to 20p or Pounds 234m.
Creditors to B&amp;C Group Finance, a subsidiary, will get 2p in the pound,
bringing their total to 30p or Pounds 223m. Creditors to Group Finance will
receive a further 3p in the pound or Pounds 22m from the sale earlier this
week of shares in Celltech, a biotechnology company in which it had a stake.
Other dividends have come through the sale of the shares of Exco, the
group's money-broking subsidiary which was floated in July.
The details came in a report circulated to creditors by Stephen Adamson,
Nigel Hamilton and Gareth Hughes, the administrators from accountants Ernst
&amp; Young.
The administrators have not changed their estimate that total dividends will
be about Pounds 1bn. There was no mention of progress on a number of
threatened and current legal actions designed to gather additional money for
credit-ors.
Directors and advisers were subject to strong criticism in a Department of
Trade &amp; Industry inspectors' report published last month.

FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Liberty Mutual to invest in Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Liberty Mutual, a US insurance company, is to invest in Lloyd's of London,
signalling continuing interest by corporate investors in the market.
The news coincided with the publication by Lloyd's of new rules which allow
corporate members greater room for manoeuvre. The market, which won some
Pounds 800m in corporate investment last year, is hoping to attract a
further Pounds 125m to Pounds 250m in 1995.
Liberty, a Boston-based group, said its investment would allow Cater Allen
Syndicate Management, an agency part of Cater Allen Holdings, to provide an
extra Pounds 40m in capacity to Syndicate 190, increasing its potential
premium income to more than Pounds 70m next year.
Management of the syndicate, will switch to a new agency next year, although
this is dependent on the approval of the regulatory authorities at Lloyd's.
'These arrangements reflect both Lloyd's stated aims of broadening the
market's capital base and the recent trend towards corporate capital at
Lloyd's being provided on a dedicated basis to selected syndicates,' said Mr
Robin Gilkes, chairman of Cater Allen Syndicate Management.
Separately Lloyd's announced that corporate syndicates - ones which contain
one member whose sole business is writing on that syndicate - will be
permitted next year. So-called 'parallel syndicates', which will underwrite
business alongside existing syndicates, will also be permitted.
Other changes will allow corporate members to own up to 25 per cent of the
agents which administer syndicates. New rules governing the conditions under
which corporate member groups can acquire up to 100 per cent of managing
agents will be published by the middle of next year.
Lloyd's also said that it would slow the planned introduction of
'assignment', a principle allowing Names to trade or transfer their
participations on syndicates. The only form of assignment likely to be
introduced in 1995 will be for Names re-arranging their affairs through
Mapas, a kind of Lloyd's unit trust, or a new kind of limited liability
corporate vehicle, which is under consideration at the market.
Existing rules, which limit corporate member groups to 50 per cent of a
single syndicate's capacity, and any one corporate member to no more than 25
per cent, will be waived 'only if managing agents demonstrate that
individual members' pre-emption and other rights have not been ignored'.

FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Bond and equity losses leave Legal &amp; Gen
lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An investment loss of Pounds 53m from the bond and equity markets left
pre-tax profits at Legal &amp; General Group, the life and general insurer,
lower at Pounds 58m for the first half of 1994, compared with Pounds 75m.
However if L&amp;G had adopted the same accounting method for such gains and
losses used by Prudential Corporation, it would have shown an increase to
Pounds 114.9m (Pounds 74.7m). The interim dividend rose by 6.9 per cent to
6.95p (6.5p).
Pre-tax profit in its core UK life and pensions business rose slightly to
Pounds 63m (Pounds 59.7m), but this was primarily related to business
already in force, where profits increased by Pounds 5.4m, rather than to new
business acquired.
Pre-tax profit from overseas life and pensions business totalled Pounds 19m
(Pounds 18.4m).
Mr David Prosser, chief executive, said he saw little prospect of short-term
improvement in the testing conditions of the UK market, and predicted
increased competition and narrower margins next year from the new regime
requiring insurers to volunteer more information about products and charges
to customers.
L&amp;G has already cut the number of its sales agents, who are self-employed
and paid by commission, from 2,300 at the start of the year to about 1,800
now. It expects this to fall to about 1,000 by the end of next year.
At the same time, it plans to expand its 100-strong employed and salaried
sales force to about 300, and strengthen its ability to sell through
independent financial advisers.
Mr Prosser said L&amp;G could halve the number of its self-employed sales force
and that this might reduce the amount of new business by only 15 per cent.
He insisted, however, that there was still a role for commission-based
advice.
While forecasting some rationalisation within the sector, he said that L&amp;G's
size and range of distribution methods left it well-placed for the future,
including opportunities to absorb smaller companies.
The UK general insurance business saw a turnround from an underwriting loss
of Pounds 17.7m to a profit of Pounds 23m. Mr Prosser said the business had
benefited from the decision to focus on personal lines as a key area.
He added, however, that there was some anecdotal evidence of price-cutting
in premium rates, and emphasised the need to ensure that policies were
priced to reflect exposure to risk.

FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Improved cash flow lets Booker edge to
Pounds 30.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Improved cash generation allowed Booker, the food group, to lift its interim
pre-tax profits and dividend yesterday despite difficult trading conditions
in the UK and US.
Pre-tax profits edged ahead from Pounds 29.9m to Pounds 30.5m, thanks to
interest costs falling from Pounds 8.4m to Pounds 6.3m.
Net debt was cut to Pounds 149.1m (Pounds 202.4m) by proceeds from disposals
and tighter control of working capital. Gearing fell to 79 per cent (123 per
cent).
Against City expectations, the interim payout was raised to 7.7p from 7.5p.
'We aim to increase the dividend at least in line with inflation,' said Mr
Charles Bowen, who joined the the group as chief executive 15 months ago.
Mr Bowen said this year should see the sale of the last few small businesses
earmarked for disposal and an improved performance from the recently
reorganised food service division.
Distribution margins remained under severe pressure and products such as
cigarettes could be adversely affected by the November Budget.
The group's operating profits fell to Pounds 36.8m (Pounds 38.3m) in the 24
weeks to June 18. The biggest problem was Booker's US agribusiness, where
profits dropped 60 per cent to Pounds 2m. Arbor Acres, a chicken breeder,
suffered a fall in market share and higher research and development
expenses. No pick-up is expected before 1996, Mr Bowen said. The UK
agribusiness was ahead by Pounds 0.6m at Pounds 4.7m.
Fish processing profits fell to Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 3.9m), mainly reflecting
a lower fish catch and thus higher prices which the company was unable to
pass on.
Booker's biggest business, food wholesaling, pushed up sales by 9.6 per cent
to Pounds 1.04bn but profits were flat at Pounds 13.7m. This was because of
the the change in Budget date from April to November, the company said.
Earnings per share were 9.8p (10.25p) including a 0.04p exceptional gain
against a 0.26p exceptional loss.
COMMENT
Mr Bowen has delivered the first part of what he promised when he joined
Booker: better management and cashflow and a tighter focus to its
businesses. In some ways, part two is harder. He wants to build and buy
businesses in notoriously difficult sectors. Cash and carry will always bear
the brunt of retail price wars as independent grocers struggle to compete.
Booker would like to land another big fish operation but there are good
economic reasons why targets might come up for sale. Given difficult trading
conditions and the long horizon for phase two, Booker will be lucky this
year to better the Pounds 89.7m pre-tax before exceptionals of last year. On
a prospective p/e of 16, the shares are carrying an over-optimistic view of
earnings growth.

FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Sirdar hit by worldwide slump in
hand-knitting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp increase in operating losses in hand-knitting yarns restrained
pre-tax profits at Sirdar, the textiles group, in the year to June 30.
At the pre-tax level, they slipped 3 per cent to Pounds 5.57m (Pounds
5.73m), though it was pointed out that, without the additional pension cost
of about Pounds 350,000 arising from the latest actuarial valuation, profits
would have risen 3 per cent.
Mr Gerry Lumb, chairman and managing director, said he was 'disappointed'
with the result. He said that hand-knitting as a pastime had slumped
worldwide in less than a generation. This decline in knitters in turn led to
fewer shops selling yarns.
As a result, Sirdar has invested Pounds 3m - mostly in working capital,
though some on machinery - to expand Tilsa Yarns into the production of
lower-margin Repco yarns for supply to knitwear makers. These
machine-knitting yarns now account for two-thirds of the division's output.
Operating losses in the division were Pounds 1.11m (Pounds 93,000) on
turnover of Pounds 20m (Pounds 20.4m).
Profits in the other textile products division grew to Pounds 6.74m (Pounds
6.08m) on turnover up at Pounds 34.2m (Pounds 31.5m). Burmatex , the carpet
business, lifted sales and profits by about 6 per cent, while Eversure,
which makes curtains, raised turnover 10 per cent and profits 30 per cent.
The Tilsa investment lifted borrowings to Pounds 5.5m for 'modest' gearing
of 17 per cent. Earnings edged ahead, after a lower tax charge, to 6.9p
(6.89p) per share and the final dividend is held at 3.7p for a higher total
of 5.42p (5.35p).

FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: German stake to cost T&amp;N Pounds 118m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T&amp;N, the UK automotive components group, said yesterday that it would pay up
to DM282.6m (Pounds 117.7m) to acquire a 52.5 per cent stake in
Kolbenschmidt, a leading German motor components producer.
The deal must be approved by the competition authorities in the US, Germany,
France and the UK.
If it goes ahead, it will make T&amp;N one of the world's leading producers of
engine pistons, vying for the number one position with Mahle of Germany.
In bearings it will rival Federal Mogul of the US for world leadership.
According to the terms of the deal disclosed yesterday the UK group has
acquired options to purchase up to 1.413m shares in Kolbenschmidt
representing 52.5 per cent of the equity.
T&amp;N said that a 24.99 per cent stake in Kolbenschmidt had been acquired by
Commerzbank on its behalf for DM124.4m.
This stake will be held by the German bank at T&amp;N's risk with the UK group
taking any loss or gain, if the holding has to be sold in the event of the
deal not going ahead.
Metallgesellschaft, the troubled German metals, mining and engineering
group, is selling its 47 per cent holding in Kolbenschmidt, while Magna
International, the Canadian automotive components group, is reducing its
stake from 12.5 to 2.5 per cent.
German institutional investors will take over 32 per cent of the
Kolbenschmidt shares, with T&amp;N holding options on the majority of this stake
representing 25.01 per cent of the Kolbenschmidt equity. It addition it has
an option to take over Magna's remaining 2.5 per cent.
Mr Colin Hope, T&amp;N chairman and chief executive, said the acquisition of a
majority holding in Kolbenschmidt would make T&amp;N into 'the most innovative
and competitive supplier of automotive pistons and bearings in the world'.
It would greatly strengthen the group's position in the pistons market in
Germany, the biggest vehicle-producing country in Europe and where T&amp;N had
been weak, and it would take it for the first time into the Brazilian
market, which has been growing rapidly in the last two years.
Kolbenschmidt designs and manufactures a wide range of diesel and petrol
engine pistons, plain bearings and bushes. It also produces oil and water
pumps and aluminium castings.
In the year to the end of September 1993 it made a pre-tax loss of DM124m on
a turnover, excluding businesses since sold, of DM1.2bn.
Mr Hope said that T&amp;N group turnover next year would exceed Pounds 2.5bn, if
the deal goes ahead as planned by January.

FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hazlewood Foods chooses chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hazlewood Foods, which in June reported severe problems with four of its
plants, has promoted Mr John Simons, its finance director, to UK chief
executive, writes Roderick Oram.
He replaces Mr Chris Ball who resigned when the company revealed that the
four acquired, newly built or reorganised plants were running up losses. Mr
Simons is succeeded as finance director by Mr Kevin Higginson, the financial
controller.
Progress had been made with the plants during the summer, Mr Peter Barr,
chairman, told the annual meeting yesterday. Two should become profitable
next month, a third during the second half and the fourth was sold last
month.
Hazlewood would continue to dispose of non-core businesses, he added.
As a result of the problems flagged in June, profits for the first half to
September 30 would show 'a very significant shortfall' from a year earlier,
he said.
The shares rose 9p to 139p.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Weatherstone hands over Morgan reins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Dennis Weatherstone, chairman and chief executive of JP Morgan, will
retire at the end of this year after five years in which the US institution
has transformed itself into a leading international investment bank.
Sir Dennis' retirement after he turns 64 in November, and the appointment in
his place of Mr Douglas Warner, who is 48, comes a year earlier than
expected. Analysts and rivals said the timing did not appear to be the
result of internal dissent. Mr Warner, who has been the bank's president
since the start of 1990, had been expected to take over.
The transition, which Sir Dennis described as 'boringly uneventful', had
been planned for some time. He added: 'I am very healthy, very happy. The
bank is in very good shape.'
Wall Street yesterday complimented Sir Dennis for JP Morgan's advances in
investment banking. The past year, though, has seen Morgan's reputation
sullied by its entanglement with Banesto, the Spanish bank taken over by the
Bank of Spain last year.
'With the benefit of hindsight it (the Banesto investment) doesn't look too
good,' Sir Dennis said. 'I don't think it was our most glorious moment . . .
But it was a long-term investment, and we realised it was high-risk. We're
not going to go through our business and not make any mistakes, anywhere.'
He said investors in Morgan's Corsair fund, which invested in Banesto, may
yet do 'very nicely' out of the deal.
Mr Warner fits the Ivy League mould of Morgan executives better than Sir
Dennis, a Briton who left school at the age of 15. Mr Warner, educated at
Yale, has been with the bank throughout his career. He ran the bank's London
operations in the late 1980s. In the past five years he has been involved
more on internal matters as chief operating officer.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Bankruptcy threat to Tiphook's Montague
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bankruptcy petition has been issued against Mr Robert Montague, founder
and chief executive of Tiphook, less than a month after it was revealed he
would get total payments of Pounds 1.34m for a year when Tiphook lost Pounds
331.1m. It is understood the petition concerns a Pounds 2.2m loan facility
from a leading UK bank.
The news emerged during a raucous annual general meeting, at which
shareholders complained bitterly about the Pounds 6.4m of payments to
directors of the troubled transport leasing group.
The Lord Chancellor's office confirmed that a bankruptcy petition was issued
yesterday by Oxford County Court to Alsop Wilkinson, the legal
representatives of the petitioner, after consideration by a district judge.
The petition has not yet been served on Mr Montague, but it is listed for a
court hearing on October 28. Tiphook said: 'it is a matter entirely for Mr
Montague'. Alsop Wilkinson would not comment. Mr Montague denied that he
faced any financial difficulties.
During the AGM, shareholders in Tiphook focused on their own financial
problems, as their company retains more than Pounds 1bn of debt after
selling its container business, and it retains two loss-making businesses.
Mr Rupert Hambro, the outgoing chairman, admitted that the Pounds 6.4m of
directors' payments for last year was wrong. 'There is no justification for
this', he said. But he claimed that Tiphook was striving to redress its
notorious cost base, which included a 139ft yacht.
Shareholders, including proxy votes, supported him by approving all the AGM
resolutions on a poll, although a potentially embarrassing show of hands was
avoided.
Mr Montague evaded the press by arriving early at the Royal Automobile Club,
but shareholders caught up with him with a vengeance. One said: 'Kingsley
Amis coined the great British phrase 'Sod the general public', but this
company seems to be following the phrase 'Sod the shareholder''. The
directors were congratulated for a report described as 'a detailed record of
their incompetence'.
Mr Montague was questioned about his financial health by Mr Paul Snook, of
accountants Buchler Phillips, representing a Lehman Brothers' shareholding.
Mr Snook described the bankruptcy petition as a serious issue for a company
which has said Mr Montague was vital to its future.

FT  16 SEP 94 / United Biscuits up 12% despite price pressures in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Biscuits (Holdings) yesterday reported a 12 per cent rise in
underlying interim profits with better performances in the US, Europe and
Asia Pacific more than covering a downturn in the fiercely competitive UK
market for biscuits and snacks.
Pre-tax profits before exceptional gains for the 28 weeks to July 16 rose
from Pounds 71.4m to Pounds 80.1m. On an FRS3 basis, the year earlier
pre-tax profits were Pounds 134.1m after the Pounds 62.7m gain on the sale
of Terry's, the chocolate maker. The profits beat most City forecasts by a
small margin but the shares eased 1p to 319p after UB disappointed some
analysts by failing to raise its dividend from 5.5p a share.
'No dividend increase was prudent,' said Mr John Warren, finance director.
The company was conserving cash to invest in promising countries such as
China and to improve productivity. It was also rebuilding dividend cover
from about 1.7 times to about 2 although this would not preclude dividend
increases.
UK operations were affected by price deflation. McVitie's, the leading
biscuit brand, saw volume grow 2 per cent without any value increase. The
division's UK sales rose 1 per cent to Pounds 312.3m but operating profits
fell 10 per cent to Pounds 32.5m.
But McVitie's overseas profits rose 20 per cent to Pounds 10.4m on sales up
13 per cent to Pounds 168.8m.
KP snacks saw the UK market volume rise 1 per cent but fall 0.5 per cent in
value. KP's sales rose 4 per cent to Pounds 207.8m with a strong
contribution from the Phileas Fogg brand. Profits were slightly ahead at
Pounds 15m.
A strong Asia Pacific performance and a flat result in continental Europe
left KP division profits up 2 per cent at Pounds 26.6m on sales up 3 per
cent at Pounds 454m.
Heavy restructuring and brisk growth of specialist brands at Ross Young's,
the UK frozen foods business, helped lift profit by Pounds 0.9m to Pounds
16m on flat sales.
Keebler, the troubled US cookie and snack maker, showed the first signs of a
turnround. Profits rose from Pounds 16.4m to Pounds 19m on sales up from
Pounds 585.7m to Pounds 622.6m. Snack sales fell by one-third after Keebler
ended deeply discounted promotions. Net debt rose from Pounds 454.9m to
Pounds 466.8m, and gearing from 55 to 61 per cent. Earnings per share were
10.7p against 17.1p including the Terry's gain and 9.6p without.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Paddling upstream to avoid the falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors' alarmed reaction to BTR's recent warning of pressures on profit
margins boiled down to a simple fear: if giants such as the UK-based
industrial conglomerate are suffering, how much worse might things be for
smaller companies, with weaker market positions?
Such forebodings were speedily fulfilled by APV, which has been trying to
restructure in a period of depressed order books and increased competition.
APV yesterday blamed its latest margins setback on the aggressive entry into
the food equipment business of GEA, the German company which has previously
concentrated on industrial products.
Unlike BTR, APV said higher raw material prices were not a big factor in the
equation: APV spends only about Pounds 10m per year on stainless steel, a
chief component in its products.
APV did say, however, that the threat to its own margins has been increased
by the pressure which retailers in Europe and the US are currently putting
on the group's main customers, the leading food processors.
APV has been restructuring since an an acquisitive binge in the 1980s. After
escaping a hostile Pounds 220m bid from Siebe in 1986, the group doubled its
turnover in three years by a series of purchases, but did little to
integrate the various businesses. When recession started, profits melted
away - last year the group made pre-tax profits of only Pounds 13.4m on
sales of Pounds 834m. That compared with a pre-tax profits peak of Pounds
60m achieved in 1989 on a similar level of sales.
Mr Clive Strowger, a former finance director at Grand Metropolitan, was
appointed chief executive in 1992. Since the departure of his acquisitive
predecessor, Mr Fred Smith, at the end of 1989, APV has cut its workforce
from 14,300 to 9,300 and cut the number of operating units from more than 75
to fewer than 50. Sales per employee have increased from below Pounds 65,000
to Pounds 88,000.
Mr Strowger said the proposed restructuring of APV's liquid-food equipment
side would only represent an acceleration of his existing strategy. That is
to move 'upstream' from low-margin manufacturing and contracting work, and
to focus on developing specific products and processes for important
customers. Engineering and products are being standardised and APV now does
a minimum amount of manufacturing.
That policy had begun to pay off in the group's continuing dry goods
business, which in the first half of the year swung back into profit. The
group claims a two-year lead in applying microwave technology to commercial
baking ovens, and has invested heavily in ohmic heating systems, which
produce food capable of long storage without refrigeration.
The aggressive entry of GEA into the food business could hardly come at a
worse time for APV. It has been restructuring while assuming no underlying
market growth - particularly in continental Europe, which accounts for 40
per cent of sales.
APV has been the subject of recurring bid speculation. In 1992, it emerged
that GEA had quietly built up a 2.8 per cent stake, but that holding has now
fallen to 1 per cent.
Mr Strowger has held discussions with GEA about swapping businesses, but
said the possibility of a full bid for APV by the German group had never
been broached. The group's other big competitor is Tetra Laval, the Swedish
food packaging and equipment group, but any bid from that quarter would face
formidable regulatory obstacles.
The chief executive said: 'We know it will be a long, hard haul - but we are
all absolutely committed to the strategy. There is no alternative.'

FT  16 SEP 94 / APV shares plunge after margins warning: Food equipment
manufacturer halves interim dividend and cites competition from German rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in APV fell by 30 per cent, from 118 1/2 p to 83p, yesterday after
the UK-based food processing equipment specialist cut its interim dividend
and warned that it was facing increasing pressure on profit margins.
APV blamed increasing competition on a recent push by GEA, a German
manufacturer, into the liquid food equipment market long dominated by APV
and Tetra Laval, the Swedish food packaging and equipment group. Sir Peter
Cazalet, chairman, said: 'It is clear to us that GEA has been extremely
aggressive and is trying to elbow its way into the industry. This is not a
happy scene in terms of margins.'
APV reported an increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.4m to Pounds 5.8m
in the six months to June 30 but said it would take an unspecified charge in
the second half to cover further restructuring of its liquid foods division.
Sir Peter said: 'We remain committed to improving the group's profitability
and consequently we will further attack our cost base and improve
efficiencies.'
Analysts could only guess at the size of the restructuring charge, but they
certainly expect it to exceed forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 15m and
push the group into a substantial loss.
The group has raised about Pounds 100m from disposals in recent years, but
there is little scope for further sales. Although gearing has been cut to 33
per cent, the decision to cut the interim dividend from 2p to 1p is a tacit
admission that the year-end charge will strain APV's banking covenants.
Sir Peter said that over the past few years APV had made real progress in
rationalising capacity, improving efficiency, divesting non-core businesses
and focusing on target markets.
But he added: 'Competition in most of our major markets has recently become
much more intense, and this is undermining prices at which orders are
currently being won. We believe that competitive pressures are unlikely to
ease in the near future.' Orders on hand at the end of June were 18 per cent
higher than a year earlier and the value of orders received in July and
August was significantly higher than in the same two months of 1993,
although at lower margins.
Sales from continuing operations rose 1.7 per cent to Pounds 381.3m.
Earnings per share doubled from 0.5p to 1p.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Russian bosses get rich as workers go unpaid: Labour
Ministry report likely to fuel tension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Heads of Russian private and state enterprises are raking in huge salaries
even where factories are technically bankrupt and workers are not being
paid, government research shows.
A report by the country's Labour Ministry, the Institute of Labour and a
department of the presidential staff, shows that directors in a range of
corporations are receiving multi-million rouble monthly salaries while their
workers take home much less than the average wage or are sent on involuntary
'holidays' because of the enterprises' debts or lack of orders.
The factories cited include:
The Izchesmash engineering plant in Ivanovo, north-east of Moscow, which
paid its workers Rbs77,000 (Pounds 22) a month - but accorded its director
Rbs881,000. In summer it sent the workers home without pay for two months,
but the director was given Rbs4.7m to see him through the same period.
The Novosibirskenergo enterprise in Novosibirsk, central Russia, has debts
of Rbs5.3bn, and stopped paying many of its workers. Its director's monthly
salary, however, remained at Rbs2.65m. A pipe factory in Volgograd in the
south paid its workers Rbs200,000 a month but its director Rbs2.22m. Its
debts stand at about Rbs4.5bn.
The research coincides with findings that the old nomenklatura - those
appointed to top jobs in the communist period - have continued to occupy
leading positions in society after the fall of communism, though their
privileges are now measured in money rather than access to scarce goods as
before.
The findings are certain to fuel tension caused by cuts in support to
industry and fears of bankruptcies and unemployment in the coming year. Mr
Victor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, and Mr Alexander Shokhin, economics
minister, have both warned that problems will mount as budget cuts and
non-payment of wages increase while tax revenues and industrial output
decline.
Mr Victor Gerashchenko, chairman of the central bank, said yesterday that
industrial output would fall by 15 per cent next year and gross domestic
product by nearly 5 per cent. He told bankers in St Petersburg that 1995
would see a 'stabilisation, at a crisis level'.
The labour report analysed pay in plants of different forms of ownership.
Some were fully private, others had state holdings of between 20 and 57 per
cent. 'But, characteristically, in both state and non-state enterprises
there were huge disproportions between the pay received by the directors,
which was 10 or more times that of the average pay of the workers,' it said.
While the differential in earnings may be unremarkable in the west, it is
large compared with Russia's recent past. Directors' pay was, in communist
times, governed by a Lenin decree that heads of enterprises should not earn
more than three times the average skilled worker's wage.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Lloyd's pursues Names for Pounds 1.3bn of debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London yesterday unveiled details of a new tough commercial
approach designed to recover more than Pounds 1.3bn in debt owed by its
lossmaking Names, the individuals whose assets support the insurance market.
The initiative was announced last month following the news - in line with
Lloyd's three year accounting system - of losses of some Pounds 2bn for
1991, the fourth successive year of loss.
A new financial recovery department will handle negotiations with more than
14,000 Names who owe money. Names unable to pay their debts will still be
offered financial support by Lloyd's, under so-called hardship arrangements.
But the hardship committee, chaired by Lady Archer, is to be abolished at
the end of the year and its functions assumed by the new department. Under
hardship, Names who could otherwise face bankruptcy resign from the market
but are allowed to retain a modest home (valued up to about Pounds 150,000
in London) and an income, typically in the region of some Pounds 17,500 a
year for a couple.
Although the market is now trading profitably, losses since 1988 amount to
more than Pounds 7bn.
'Lloyd's duty to all its members, especially to those who have promptly
settled their debts, is fairly but firmly to pursue those who have not,'
said Mr David Rowland, chairman of Lloyd's.
Lloyd's has collected about Pounds 1bn over the past three months, mostly
from some 17,000 Names who continue to underwrite, reducing the amount of
outstanding debt from Pounds 2.3bn to Pounds 1.3bn. Separately the market
has additional declared losses of some Pounds 2bn, which Lloyd's has still
to 'call' from Names.
The new approach was condemned by lossmakers as 'a switch to pressure
tactics and deals'.
'The object is to extract as much cash from names as they can be persuaded
to part with as quickly as possible,' said Mr Christopher Stockwell,
chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations' Working Party, an alliance of
hard-hit Names.
Mr Philip Holden, a partner with solicitors Dibb Lupton Broomhead, who will
head the financial recovery department, said Lloyd's wanted to 'open a
dialogue' with debtors and would deal on a case by case basis. The approach
would be more flexible, he hinted.
Mr Rowland said Lloyd's had had to take into account the value of some
Pounds 290m in central assets, including its headquarters, to pass one of
the annual solvency tests which assesses its ability to continue trading.

<TEXT>
APV's troubles have hit the company just when economic recovery should have
been restoring margins. In that sense, the disappointment is similar to that
engendered by BTR last week. Clearly the climate in engineering is such as
to leave companies vulnerable to margin erosion, but the APV case has quite
specific origins. Its German competitor GEA is determined to win market
share in liquid food processing machinery and no one knows how long it will
keep up the pressure.
If APV can be faulted for not latching on to the risk sooner, yesterday's
measures seem a reasonable response. The sharp cut in the dividend will
conserve cash. APV has no choice but to restructure the liquid food business
if it is to compete with GEA's prices. It is a daunting task just the same.
While APV has been paying an uncovered dividend for the last four years, it
has been able to maintain its stated net worth by realising goodwill through
disposals. There is not much of that hidden value left to exploit, so the
restructuring provision will eat into reserves. With interest cover a mere
2.9 times in the first half, APV will struggle to stay within its banking
covenants.
Perhaps the sensible solution would be to solicit a bid. Arguably a market
value including debt of less than Pounds 300m is low for a company with
turnover of Pounds 900m. Although a bidder from within the industry might
fall foul of competition regulations, an outsider might find APV's
industrial businesses attractive. But it would be a daring buy while the
pressure on liquid food margins continues.

United Biscuits' acquisition of Dalgety's Dutch snacks business this week
highlighted the group's steady progress in building up its presence in
continental Europe. However the overwhelming majority of turnover still
derives from the UK and the US, markets facing big medium-term problems, as
the candidly pessimistic prognosis from UB's management underscored
yesterday.
In the UK, UB's McVitie's brand commands 45 per cent of the biscuit market,
but the generous margins enjoyed in the past are falling, as the company is
squeezed between price deflation and the need to step up marketing
expenditure. In the US, the belated measures being taken to straighten out
Keebler - number two in biscuits behind Nabisco - are unlikely to achieve
the desired doubling of margins or regeneration of cash flow before 1996.
Against this background, the shares have understandably underperformed the
market by a third since their latest peak in May last year.
Sentiment has been soured further because gearing and cash-flow have
suffered from the combined impact of rationalisation, increased marketing
expenditure and acquisitions. The group's financial situation casts doubt
over its long-term ability to nourish its core businesses with investment.
But the shares are supported by a yield of 6 per cent. And if the stock
market is unwilling to look beyond the uninspiring earnings outlook for this
year and next, perhaps a predator will place a higher value on the group's
portfolio of brands.

L&amp;G's results yesterday were not as bad as they looked. The 22 per cent fall
in pre-tax profits was caused by the group's disconcerting practice of
including unrealised investment losses. Excluding these, earnings growth was
61 per cent, although the figures were flattered by clement weather, which
reduced claims on property insurance, and an absence of IRA bombs in the
City.
Nevertheless, the clouds are gathering. The general insurance business,
which posted good results, will suffer as the premium cycle turns. More
worrying are the prospects in UK life and pensions. The imposition of
commission disclosure next year looks set to depress overall demand. A
further obligation to give details about expenses will favour those with the
lowest overheads. L&amp;G is battening down the hatches for the post-disclosure
squall, cutting costs and increasing productivity.
The long-term growth prospects for the UK market are nevertheless promising.
Ageing baby-boomers will increasingly be attracted by savings products; the
state's ability to fund adequate pension provision must be questioned, in
which case the private sector will step in; and a low-inflation environment
encourages savings. With L&amp;G's shares at an 18 per cent discount to net
assets - including the embedded value of the life fund - the market has
already recognised the scale of the short-term difficulties to come.

FT  16 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: BP explores growth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BP yesterday signalled that it was ready to move from retrenchment to
growth. The switch in thinking was not spelt out in so many words. The
phrasing, in a briefing to analysts, was rather that the group's exploration
and production division now had options. Under a conservative scenario,
production - which fell from 1.7m barrels a day in 1988 to 1.4m last year -
would grow at 2 per cent a year. But BP also produced a chart showing
production, under a more ambitious scenario, growing at up to 7 per cent.
The subtext was clear. The exploration and production division, at any rate,
wants to expand.
It is understandable why BP is talking in a coded way. The last time it
embarked on an investment splurge in the late 1980s, it fell flat on its
face. Gearing rose to 100 per cent, its chairman had to resign and the
dividend was halved. If shareholders are not to take fright, they will need
reassurance that a new expansion plan will not suffer the same fate.
Matters may be different this time. First, BP has vigorously cut costs.
Second, its investment plans are judged on the assumption that crude prices
will fall to Dollars 14 rather than rise to Dollars 25. Third, the group has
become strongly cash-generative so it should be able to increase capital
spending, while still raising its dividend by 20 per cent a year and paying
down debt. Yesterday's presentation marks a first attempt to win investors
round to such a plan. But shareholders will be right to withhold their
judgment until an expansion strategy is spelt out in greater detail.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Pitching for the market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is an odd kind of labour dispute. On one side is a strong union,
insisting that its members' salaries be set by market forces. Their bosses
say wages must be capped, so that profitable employers can subsidise
loss-making ones. Meanwhile, pundits muse that resolving the strike would
save the presidency.
For millions of US baseball fans, the six-week-old major league baseball
strike is certainly different. It ruined this year's regular playing season.
Now it has put paid to one of the high points of the American sporting year,
the World Series, cancelled on Wednesday for the first time since 1904. But
non-enthusiasts should also take note. The wrangle over top players' pay is
a good example of how market forces work in the modern labour market. The
team owners are essentially an old-fashioned cartel trying to tilt the
system back in their fav-our.
At first glance, it is the players' side that looks outdated. In a country
in which only about 12 per cent of private sector workers are unionised, the
Major League Baseball Players Association's ability to bring the industry to
its knees sounds more like the 'big labor' of the 1950s and 1960s than the
'flexible' US labour market of the 1990s.
But the players' strong bargaining position does not come from membership of
the union. In the US, unlike many other countries, employers may hire
permanent replacements for striking employees. A bill which would have
banned this failed to pass Congress earlier this year. Quite apart from the
probable public reaction, however, the owners cannot do this because many of
the players are all but irreplaceable.
In effect, the team owners are facing a dilemma common to many US and UK
shareholders. Greater labour market deregulation helps to push down the cost
of unskilled workers. At the same time, however, a core group of highly
skilled employees in each firm is able to demand a lot more.
Baseball players, once little more than a team's indentured servants after
signing their first contract, won more individual rights in the courts in
the 1970s. Salaries have risen ever since: from an average of Dollars
400,000 to over Dollars 1.2m in the past five years. Wages now account for
58 per cent of total industry revenues.
The teams argue that the cost of bidding for the best players is driving the
smaller, less popular, teams in the league out of business. They would like
to see the overall wage bill capped at only 50 per cent of revenues. They
say that the resulting extra profits would be used to bail out the teams
that are in trouble.
It is not up to the players to allow the companies to be so collectively
minded. Even if it were, one cannot judge whether such cross-subsidisation
is even necessary, since all of the teams' finances are shrouded in secrecy.
In fact, since the owners are possibly the only US businessmen to be
entirely exempt from anti-trust provisions, they may make any agreement they
like, without outside interference. On Wednesday evening, President Clinton
rightly suggested that this cosy cartel should be reconsidered. The baseball
strike is a market failure, which stems from the cartel and not from the
players.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A licence to exist, if not to print money. Yesterday the Independent
Television Commission announced that it would readvertise the frequency
allotted to Britain's fifth terrestrial television channel. The long-awaited
statement gives investors a second chance to bid for the licence, although
it makes it no easier to judge its value.
The ITC's statement follows the disarray of its last auction for Channel 5
two years ago. Then, it turned down the only bidder on doubts about
shareholders' financial commitment to the consortium. Nonetheless, several
groups still express interest; Pearson, the international media group which
owns the Financial Times, has indicated it may join one.
The government is right to give investors - and viewers - the opportunity.
The form of the channel's programming is left open, but judging by the plans
of potential bidders, Channel 5 could provide city-based television, in
addition to the regional services of ITV and the British Broadcasting
Corporation. Regional stations are a powerful flavour in the US programming
mix, and one that would enrich British television.
The channel will also give regional and national advertisers another route
besides ITV to reach audiences, helping curb inflation in the cost of
airtime.
Ministers have rightly not succumbed to fears that, if Channel 5 were
successful, it could jeopardise ITV franchises, some of which remain
financially stretched. ITV companies were directed, in bidding for their own
licences, to assume that a new fifth channel would bite into their
advertising and audiences. So far, they have been spared this competition,
although recession bit more deeply into revenues than they predicted. But
unexpected consequences of the ITV auction should not block the birth of a
rival channel.
However, the government is misguided in withholding from Channel 5 one of
the two frequencies advertised last time. In deciding to reserve one
frequency for digital television, it risks adding to its long record of
promoting high-technology projects of questionable commercial potential.
The consequence is to handicap Channel 5, which may now reach as little as
52 per cent of the country, compared with the 74 per cent achievable with
both frequencies. Uncertainty about its coverage is one reason why its
viability is currently hard to assess. The potential liability for retuning
video recorders, which share the same frequency, is also unknown.
Even when these points are clarified, bidders will have a tough job deciding
if Channel 5 is a prize worth having, and the price worth paying to secure
it. But at least they now have another chance.

<TEXT>
What do the following have in common: North Atlantic Treaty Organisation,
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, World Trade
Organisation? Answer: all three are intergovernmental bodies (though the
third technically does not exist yet) currently in search of a chief
executive. In all three cases the choice will be made by the governments of
the member states. That in turn means it will be decided through political
negotiation, as opposed to the kind of selection procedures whereby senior
posts in other organisations are normally filled.
Purists deplore this, but it could not really be otherwise. Such jobs are
not purely managerial or technical. They have a political content, greater
in some cases than others, and governments must be expected to have an eye
to their national interests in arguing for one sort of candidate rather than
another.
But where many governments go wrong is in assuming that national interest is
best served by securing such posts for their own nationals. This is
insulting to the candidates in question, since the terms of reference
invariably require the holder of the post to act as the servant of the
organisation as a whole, and to forswear partiality towards their own
country. On the whole this requirement is taken seriously, and it is not
unknown for such people, once in office, to cause their own governments
considerable irritation.
It would not matter if governments simply vied with each other to put up the
best candidate. But in many cases they seem determined to get the job for
'their' man (or woman) irrespective of merit. That leads to unseemly
horse-trading, and to the notion that countries disappointed in one race are
entitled to 'compensation' in another - a pretension which becomes offensive
and ridiculous when the bodies in question have quite different memberships
and purposes. Thus Canada, Iceland, Norway, Turkey and the US, none of them
members of the EU, are expected to accept a Belgian secretary-general of
Nato, with little or no experience of defence policy, because the Belgian
prime minister was denied the presidency of the European Commission.
At least in Nato's case there is some sense in the tradition of having a
European as secretary-general, since the supreme allied commander in Europe
is always an American. It is far less obvious why the tradition of having a
European secretary-general of Gatt should be carried forward into the WTO;
let alone why non-Europeans should be expected to accept whatever candidate
the EU chooses, especially when that choice itself is dictated by a
trade-off in the contest for a quite different post.
In each case the effectiveness of the organisation is being sacrificed, and
the internationalist spirit it is supposed to embody is being ignored.

So Lloyd's thinks that someone somewhere could come up with a better stamp

company will be one of the biggest reinsurers in the world, alongside Munich
Re and Swiss Re. As part of its plan to have the operation ready for DTI
authorisation next year, Lloyd's has held a competition among staff to come
up with a more fitting moniker. One unkind suggestion doing the rounds at
the reinsurers' Monte Carlo rendezvous last week was Pen-u-Re.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Observer: Chairman talk
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There seems to be a bit of a shortage of chairmen of Britain's
pharmaceutical companies. SmithKline Beecham did not have too much trouble
persuading Sir Peter Walters to take its chair in April, but Zeneca seems to
have taken its time to find a replacement for Sir Denys Henderson, and
Fisons and Glaxo are both looking for figureheads.
Fison's Patrick Egan wants to be gone within the year and Glaxo's Sir Paul
Girolami quits in November. Of the two jobs, that at Glaxo is far and away
the most appetising. So why the delay in filling the slot? Sir Sydney
Lipworth, the former chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, has
ruled himself out by taking Zeneca; Lord Kingsdown, the former governor of
the Bank of England and Glaxo director, is a bit too old and Sir Peter
Holmes, 61, the former boss of Shell, doesn't sound like he is interested.
Pity the general election is a good two years away, because there would be
no shortage of ex-Tory politicians looking for a safe berth. Of course,
there is always that hardy old perennial Sir John Cuckney, a vice-chairman
of Glaxo. But then he is even older than the outgoing Sir Paul.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Neil Kinnock, former UK Labour party leader, has lost little time in
stamping something of his personality on to his new job of European
commissioner, which he takes up next January.
For starters, he's beguiled Philip Lowe into becoming his chief of staff. A
47-year-old Yorkshireman, Lowe combines a wicked sense of humour with more
than 20 years' experience of the Brussels bureaucracy. Lowe's current job is
director of the Merger Task Force, vetting Europe-wide mergers and takeovers
on competition grounds. That might easily have led on to Lowe's becoming
director general; clearly, Kinnock has lost none of his persuasive powers.
Moreover, Kinnock has also insisted on having his own press spokesman.
Polite suggestions that the new, expanded 21-member Commission might have to
restrict the number of porte paroles was met with a characteristically Welsh
riposte: if Sir Leon Brittan, the senior UK commissioner, is going to have
his own spokesman, then so too, dammit, is the Right Honourable Neil Gordon
Kinnock.

The revanchist Independent newspaper, now under the helm of the FT's former
deputy editor, can anticipate some big UK political scoops, if its new
deputy editor, Martin Jacques, can work on his tennis game with his regular
partner - Labour's Tony Blair.
Jacques has never shied away from experimenting with his political game.
Former editor of Marxism Today - RIP 1991 - he teamed up with Rupert
Murdoch's Sunday Times because he liked the paper's anti-establishment
attitude; the enemy of my enemy is my friend being a familiar motto to
communists since Lenin onwards.
Aficionado of formula one motor racing, Jacques left the British Communist
party in 1991, when the party was anyway all but dead. These days, Jacques
is chairman of his own seeker after the Holy Grail, a think-tank called
Demos, launched in 1993. He says Demos is 'neither left nor right in any
traditional sense . . . radical, not centrist'. Its forte is the generation
of ideas obviously headed for the filing cabinet labelled 'ignore', such as
establishing 'juries' of 20 randomly chosen people to debate national
childcare provisions.

<TEXT>
Peter Wallenberg, overlord of the mighty Wallenberg industrial empire, is
probably rueing his decision to abandon his family motto Esse Non Vidare -
To be, not to be seen.
Wallenberg is worried at the rocky state of Sweden's economy. So he wrote a
newspaper article and gave a highly unusual hour-long television interview,
ahead of Sunday's general election.
Grasping the media tiger by the tail is a dangerous exercise. For
Wallenberg's message - that the new government must slash the budget deficit
 -has been drowned in a welter of negative headlines, some perhaps
justifiable, others obviously not.
The really hot water came via Wallenberg's reference to South Africa. He
referred to svartingar - roughly translatable as 'blackies' - as not being
able to manage without the whites. Phew] This, within a country which was
for years one of the leading backers of the African National Congress. 'I
expressed myself inconsiderately and wish to apologise,' said the
68-year-old Wallenberg. But ill fortune hunts in packs. Yesterday, the
tabloid newspaper Expressen carried an alarming headline - 'Wallenberg
threatens to leave Sweden if we vote the wrong way'.
Sensational stuff, given that Wallenberg companies dominate Swedish industry
and the family has always been intensely patriotic.
The Wallenberg camp has now hastily disclaimed any such notion; what he
really said was that some companies would be under pressure to shift their
HQs overseas if Sweden's credit rating was lowered.
Lowered credit ratings all round, perhaps.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Personal View: A German message Europe must heed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAN G. VAN DER TAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week at Leyden university, Britain's prime minister, John Major, did
Europe a service by rejecting the proposals for a two-tier European Union in
the recent discussion paper from Germany's Christian Democrats. The idea of
formalising a supposed 'hard core' of EU member states, placing the UK and
others in the second division of the European league, was ill-judged.
However, Mr Major should not lose sight of one essential fact. The CDU paper
outlined the German need to build on and deepen 40 years of success at
integrating Europe with Germany at its heart. In view of this, Mr Major was
perhaps ill-advised in saying Europe is 'outgrowing the concept of the
original founders of the European Union'.
Germany itself is stressing the necessity of reforming, and above all
reinforcing, the institutional framework of European co-operation as a
precondition for enlarging Europe to the east. As the CDU paper points out,
tragic past experience has demonstrated the dangers that can ensue from
Germany's position in the centre of Europe. The rest of the continent needs
to respond positively to Germany's request to be bound irreversibly to a
politically and economically integrated continent.
This was the main message in the CDU paper - even though the 'two-tier'
proposals gained the most publicity. Fortunately, an immediate rebuff came
from the German foreign minister and his EU colleagues, as well as from
French President Francois Mitterrand.
It was objectionable enough for a large number of member states to be
relegated, albeit temporarily, to the status of second-class Europeans. But
it was no less absurd for the Benelux countries, founder members of the
European Community, to be told that 'they must be more involved in
Franco-German co-operation'. Was this a bad joke - or just clumsiness?
As for the French, Le Monde published its commentary on the CDU paper under
the heading 'Rudesse allemande'. Although the document upholds the theory of
the privileged Franco-German partnership, it shows Germany's irritation with
some French attitudes can match its well-known disappointment about
Britain's European policies.
It is historically inaccurate to say that European integration depends on
the success of the Franco-German axis. In fact, the European Community was
formed in 1957 partly to stabilise the Franco-German relationship.
This is not to say that bilateral relationships do not have any importance
for economic and monetary union. If Emu is to succeed, it will have to take
place at different speeds, according to the Maastricht criteria. This is
not, however, the same as postulating a 'two-tier' approach for integration
in general.
Another condition for Emu, as rightly stated in the CDU paper, is that it
must be embedded in a political union. This requires not only joint policies
in foreign affairs and defence, but also more democratic structures for
European decision-making.
The CDU paper underlines the necessity of strengthening the EU's capacity to
act. Among other things, it proposes an effective federal division of powers
between different levels of decision-making. It also suggests defining the
EU's fundamental values in a quasi-constitutional document. These ideas are
hard to stomach for British Euro-sceptics, or even for the average
'Euro-convert'. And yet the desire of the Germans and other Europeans to
drive on with this agenda must not be underestimated.
When a year ago a 'German National Foundation' was founded by eminent
personalities such as President Richard von Weizsacker and ex-Chancellor
Helmut Schmidt, they stated that a new German identity had to be based on
the will to advance European unification. Chancellor Helmut Kohl said
exactly the same when unification took place in October 1990. Such remarks
might seem odd for citizens of long-established nation states such as the UK
and the Netherlands. However, Germany, as a 'belated nation' in the middle
of Europe, feels it has specific internal and external sources of
vulnerability that need to be taken into account.
The week in which we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Battle of
Arnhem is a fitting time to remind ourselves not to repeat the mistakes
Europe made in dealing with the German question earlier this century. Even
if we are confident that the federal republic will never again follow a
'special path' outside the European mainstream, we would ignore at our peril
Germany's call for European solidarity and integration.

FT  16 SEP 94 / The battle for the forecourt: European carmakers fear the
consequences if their exclusive dealer networks are reformed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European carmakers go to the barricades next week in a last-ditch effort to
protect their privileged exclusive dealer networks across Europe.
For several months they have been locked in a lobbying battle in Brussels
against the plans of the European Commission's competition directorate for
liberalising the continental car market.
At stake is reform of the so-called block exemption, which was granted to
the European motor industry for 10 years in 1985, and which allows carmakers
to operate selective and exclusive distribution systems in contravention of
European competition rules. The exemption expires at the end of June 1995,
and next week the 17 European commissioners are due to decide how radical a
dose of reform should be imposed on the carmakers.
Behind the issue are sharply contrasting visions of how cars should be sold
and serviced in Europe. Is the consumer best served by the dedicated
exclusive dealerships allowed under the present system? Or should the dealer
networks be exposed to another order of competition, with multi-franchising
 -the sale of competing brands on the same site? This could offer customers
a wider choice in one location, while independent service garages would gain
access to the carmakers' closely guarded technical information and exclusive
parts business.
A firm proposal for the new motor industry regime will be published shortly
after next week's meeting of the Commission. Following consultation with
governments and the opposing ranks of the car producers and European
consumer organisations, the terms of a new block exemption should be set
before the end of the year.
Battle has already raged on this issue in Brussels for several months: the
competition directorate's first draft for a new block exemption was leaked
to the motoring press in May.
The competition mandarins did not pull their punches. In an 'explanatory
note' they claimed that 'the experience acquired over the last 10 years
shows that this regulation has not contributed in any significant way to
either the opening up of national markets or the development of flexible and
efficient structures in the distribution of cars and spares'. The block
exemption had to be revised in order to 'remedy these defects and stimulate
competition'.
The competition directorate led by Mr Karel van Miert suggested reforms to
ensure that dealers - in the main small and medium-sized businesses  - have
greater commercial independence from the manufacturers. Big publicly quoted
dealer groups such as those familiar in the UK are virtually unknown in
continental Europe.
Access for independent producers and distributors of spare parts to the
carmakers' dealer outlets should be facilitated, and the consumer's position
improved, said the draft.
The carmakers were incensed by the proposed reforms. They argue that the
present regulation, far from stifling competition, guarantees it; and that
what the industry needs above all is stability as it fights to restructure
and regain world competitiveness against Japanese and newly resurgent US
rivals.
'There are those who wish, in particular within the Commission, to subject
this industry to an unprecedented and arbitrary experiment . . . (and)
undermine the whole foundation of automobile distribution in Europe,' says
Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, chief operating officer of the Fiat group and president
of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (Acea).
The campaign for reform has been led by consumer groups. Mr Jim Murray,
director of the Bureau Europeen des Unions de Consommateurs (Beuc), says the
block exemption has been 'an unmitigated disaster for consumers.'
Beuc accepts the need for competent, trained personnel to carry out garage
servicing - the notion of 'selectivity' allowed in the current regulation.
But it claims there is 'no basis whatsoever' for allowing manufacturers to
operate 'exclusive' as well as selective distribution systems - that is, to
limit the number of outlets on a geographic basis, and to restrict those
outlets from stocking more than one brand.
'Why shouldn't new car buyers have the chance to compare different brands at
a single outlet?' asks Mr Murray. 'This is the sort of consumer-friendly
distribution we would like to see in place after 1995.' The consumer lobby
argues that the exclusive system shields dealerships from competition and is
not needed to maintain standards.
'We accept that standards should be set for safety, for technical expertise,
training and solvency, but we don't need exclusivity to set these
standards,' says Mr Murray. 'Standards should be set for all motor dealers
and there should then be free competition between all dealers who meet these
standards.'
Beuc also complains that the block exemption as currently operated
interferes with the single market. It points out that the original
regulation of 1985 was granted on condition that new car prices across
Europe should not diverge beyond a range of 12 per cent in the long term and
18 per cent for periods of less than one year, and that individual consumers
in one member state should be free to buy cars from another. On both counts
the block exemption has failed, it claims.
The most recent car price study by the Commission, published this summer,
showed that 22.5 per cent of the models produced by European manufacturers
had price differentials of more than 20 per cent. As far as cross-border
car-buying is concerned, Beuc claims that consumers who try to buy cars
abroad meet with enormous difficulties, both from dealers and carmakers and
from institutional barriers.
It is a long catalogue of woes, but the carmakers have mounted a heavy
lobbying effort to counter the consumers' arguments, with the industry
directorate headed by Mr Martin Bangemann acting as a willing ally inside
the Commission.
The defence offered by Acea centres on the theme that cars cannot be
distributed like washing machines or food. The carmakers claim that the
competition directorate has provided 'no factual evidence whatsoever' to
support the case for radical reforms.
Competition has increased greatly during the last 10 years, says Mr Rudolf
Beger, Acea executive secretary. Between 1986 and 1993 the number of car
brands sold on the German market jumped by 50 per cent from 44 to 66. The
number of models and versions sold in France has risen by 47 per cent from
515 in 1986 to 758 in 1993.
In the after-sales and service market, competition has also grown
significantly with independent chains for easy repairs such as Speedy, Midas
and Kwik-Fit. According to BMW, the German executive and luxury carmaker,
independent repairers already control 48 per cent of the BMW service market
in Germany and 52 per cent in Italy.
Acea claims that its independent research shows that customer satisfaction
in the automobile industry has reached a very high level. German car owners,
for example, are said to be among the most satisfied consumers - well ahead
of users of airlines, travel agents, hi-fi shops, hospitals or television
stations. What is more, surveys in the US show that customer satisfaction
with conventional one-make dealers is consistently higher than with
dealerships selling various brands, says Mr Beger.
The carmakers argue that prices for consumer goods for which there is no
selective distribution differ often by more than 100 per cent from one
European country to another - much more than car prices. In any case,
exchange rate fluctuations are the biggest cause of diverging car prices,
not selective distribution, they say.
As for cross-border car-buying, Acea says that it is already happening.
Following the devaluation of the Italian lira, Acea estimates that 150,000
to 200,000 cars were re-exported from Italy last year.
The argument over block exemption is strident, but there is much at stake.
Over the next 10 years a typical volume carmaker will invest around Ecu6bn
(Pounds 4.7bn) in its distribution system. With most new cars reaching the
same high standards of quality and reliability, service at the dealership is
increasingly being seen by carmakers as the new frontier for competition.
The question the Commission must answer in the coming weeks is what rules
will apply on the forecourt for the next 10 years.

FT  16 SEP 94 / It can only get better: Change in Cuba is irreversible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PASCAL FLETCHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HAVANA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three hundred pesos, or three dollars, will buy a cooking stove made from a
vegetable oil can, once donated as aid, in Havana's Parque El Curita street
market. With a week's guarantee included, they are selling fast.
Piped cooking gas has been in short supply in the Cuban capital for weeks,
thanks to breakdowns at the gas factory. This additional misery for Cubans,
already coping with shortages of everything from washing powder to meat, is
encouraging a return to Cuba's streets of the vendors who were cleared away
in a 'revolutionary offensive' in the late 1960s.
Most operate legally - licensed under economic reforms designed to loosen
the state's grip on Cuba's recession-hit economy, which has shrunk by half
in five years.
The economy was devastated by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the loss
of the communist bloc countries with which it carried on 85 per cent of its
trade, on highly favourable terms. It is being further squeezed by a recent
tightening of the US economic embargo.
In talks with the Clinton administration last week about stemming the flow
of illegal immigrants to the US from Cuba's shores, the Cubans sought a
commitment from Washington to discuss the 32-year-old embargo.
But most independent observers believe that domestic economic reform is what
is needed to solve Cuba's economic problems.
The Cuban government has moved slowly on reform, despite calls for more
haste from outsiders such as Mr Carlos Solchaga, the former Spanish finance
minister. Cuba has begun to welcome foreign investors in some sectors, and
last year it made the US dollar legal tender. But there have been few
indications of what the next step might be.
Some are satisfied with the modest changes made so far. 'The good thing is
that you can use your imagination to make things,' says 30-year-old Pedro
Raurell, who sells mugs, pots, ladles and plates made from old soft-drink
cans and aluminium sheeting.
On a good day, Mr Raurell says, he can make 300 pesos. Not bad for a country
where the average wage for a state worker is between 100 and 200 pesos a
month.
But, while legalising some self-employment has helped a number of Cubans, it
has by no means solved the severe economic squeeze faced by the majority.
Resolver - a popular word in the Cuban vocabulary, which means obtaining
things or just 'getting by' in general - remains the order of the day.
Most Cubans say the subsidised food and consumer goods provided by the state
rationing system each month do not even come close to feeding an average
family. The black market, a mainstay of daily existence since Soviet trade
and aid dried up, is booming despite a recent government crackdown, while
the lifting of the ban on dollars seems to have encouraged it.
Only the dollar has real buying power. The black market rate for the dollar
hovers between 80 and 100 pesos. Holders of dollars, obtained legally or
illegally, can buy almost anything - either on the black market or in the
dozens of new dollar stores for Cubans opened by the government over the
past year. These sell food, clothes and prized consumer items, such as
televisions and domestic appliances.
Those with dollars can also eat and drink at state-owned restaurants and
snack-bars, now open to Cubans as well as foreigners - and at illegal eating
houses that have sprung up all over Havana. Getting by without dollars and
on a small monthly salary of Cuban pesos is much harder, and for some
impossible.
And a striking novelty in today's Cuba is that people are no longer afraid -
as they were even a few months ago - to speak their minds about the
country's state of decay.
After a restless, sweltering August which saw serious street disturbances in
Havana and an exodus by sea of several thousand refugees, public discontent
has become a tangible force in homes and on the streets.
Old-style revolutionary fervour, still trumpeted by bright propaganda
billboards, has been eroded by the economic crisis, the influence of a
tourist industry serving mostly western visitors and by the government's own
signals that it is moving slowly towards a limited market economy.
Instead of extolling the virtues of the revolution and Cuba's one-party
political system, Cubans are more likely to complain about food shortages,
electricity blackouts, the collapse of public transport and other daily
economic hardships. Behind the Cubans' natural cheerfulness and sardonic
sense of humour, there is a sense of brooding frustration.
The more than 30,000 balseros, or rafters, who have left Cuba since early
August in flimsy, home-made boats bound for the US, symbolise this
disenchantment. Until the Cuban authorities reimposed a ban on illegal
departures under a new immigration accord agreed with the US on September 9,
the young, mostly male rafters were outspoken critics of Cuba's current
plight.
In response to any inquiry, they directed a stream of rage and frustration
against the economy, the political system and the figure of Cuba's
68-year-old president, Mr Fidel Castro. 'People are leaving because of a
lack of freedom. Lack of freedom to do things, grow things, create things,
invent things,' said 32-year-old Hector from the Havana suburb of San Miguel
de Padron, as he helped friends prepare a raft at Brisas del Mar, some 18
miles east of Havana.
Mr Castro publicly admits a segment of the population is disenchanted with
socialism, but insists the vast majority of Cubans still remains loyal.
It is even possible that he allowed the rafters to leave in an effort to
defuse the discontent whose reality he acknowledges. It is also possible
that the exodus was aimed at putting pressure on the US to lift its embargo,
rather than at cooling domestic tensions.
Either way, things have quietened down following the departure of so many.
And for the more than 10m Cubans who did not leave after August 5, there is
an air of expectancy: the future will somehow - must somehow - be better
than the present. Even Cuba's tightly controlled state media, whose output
normally ranges from euphoric praise for the Revolution to staid ideological
conformity, acknowledges the moment is one of change. 'Things which didn't
work in the past, even when we had resources, can't be expected to work now.
The country is changing rapidly,' the trade union weekly, Trabajadores, said
this month.
The question for the Castro government is whether it will be able to
influence this change, or merely be carried along - or perhaps swept away -
by the tide of events.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: RTZ support in Rio Algom deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr C A MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to your report, 'Rio Algom to boost copper at Cerro Colorado by
50 per cent' (September 7). Part of that report might be seen as implying
that RTZ had attempted to take over Rio Algom's Cerro Colorado mine in Chile
at the time of the RTZ sale of its 41 per cent interest in Rio Algom.
In fact, RTZ made no such attempt. Rather it provided valuable assistance to
Rio Algom in the development of the Chilean project, both before and after
the sale of its interest in the Canadian company. The successful
commissioning of Cerro Colorado, a year and a half after the sale of that
interest, was due in no small part to RTZ's continued support of the
project.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Poland's privatisation plans are
feasible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JERZY THIEME
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ms Swiatkowski Cannon's Personal View (September 9), contained many
misunderstandings and mis-representations about Poland's mass privatisation
programme (MPP).
As an adviser to successive Polish governments in helping to establish and
implement the programme, I would like to put the record straight. The author
argues that the programme is centralised and bureaucratic. Inevitably,
governments are always involved in the early stages of privatisation as it
is state assets which are being disposed.
The approach we have evolved is to give substantial responsibility for the
actual restructuring of companies in the programme to national investment
funds (NIFs). They will have substantial autonomy, operating at arm's length
from the government, deciding how best to restructure the companies under
their managements prior to public flotation. These funds will be managed by
qualified professional firms, selected after competitive tender. Quality
investment banks, fund managers and consulting firms have already been
shortlisted for this purpose.
Several international institutions - European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, World Bank, British Know-How Fund and the European Union -
support the programme through the provision of funding and technical
assistance. Maybe this is a minor point but it shows the confidence which
the international community has in the privatisation programme.
The author says that the programme is too limited, in that only some 400
companies are intended to be covered by the programme. Again this
misunderstands the position. The MPP is only one element of a multi-track
approach to Polish privatisation. The principal objective within the MPP is
that the companies included should have the potential after restructuring to
be strong and viable, with good growth prospects. We have to date identified
about 400 such comp-anies.
The suggestion that the programme cannot satisfy popular demand for equity
and participation in reforms is also not true. Potentially, all 27m adult
Polish citizens will be able to participate in the programme, acquiring, for
a small registration fee, a security which is likely to have a substantial
market value, and will be traded on the Warsaw Stock Exchange - one of the
best regulated stock exchanges in Europe.
We are sure that the MPP specifically meets the need for mass participation
in the restructuring of Polish enterprises and, regardless of the political
environment, is feasible.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Choreography of peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dancing on eggs, the one to a quick-step the other to a slow, the prime
ministers of Ireland and Britain may win an enduring peace in Ulster. Keep
your fingers crossed. It is never prudent to assume that the murdering will
end. Anything can happen between saying as much and the next day's news. Yet
in the fortnight since the IRA announced a complete ceasefire some of the
scepticism initially expressed in both London and unionist Belfast has begun
to be replaced by hope that the 25 years of troubles really are ending.
This was doubtless intimated by Sir Patrick Mayhew when he reported to the
British cabinet yesterday. The dossiers prepared by officials for the
Northern Ireland secretary will have reinforced the quiet optimism that he
has quietly expressed since last December. He has always believed that the
joint declaration of principle issued before Christmas by the two heads of
government would draw the IRA into normal politics, and away from the 'armed
struggle'. Assessments by the security service supported his view. The
spooks have been vindicated by events, so far. Yet in the private political
discussions that followed yesterday's formal meeting of the cabinet the
assembled ministers endorsed the government's cool response to the
ceasefire.
They could do no less. Any echo of the embrace of Mr Gerry Adams by Irish
and American politicians would be a disaster in London or parts of Ulster.
The choreography that determines the movements of Mr Albert Reynolds could
never be the same as that which directs Mr John Major. Both know this; each
understands the other. It would not be surprising if the leader of Sinn Fein
was aware of this complicated script. Perhaps he reads drafts on his visits
to Dublin. It would be amazing if Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster
Unionist party, was not in on the secret, briefed in Downing Street.
Yet the pressure from Irish nationalists, and US politicians who freeload
upon their cause, has been all one way. Mr Major is urged to make a
'gesture' towards Ulster's Republican community. Recognise that the
ceasefire will endure, in spite of the IRA's refusal to call it permanent.
Lift the prohibition on broadcasting the voices of members of Sinn Fein.
Throw that card away at once. Confine the troops to barracks, as a prelude
to bringing them home. Publish constitutional proposals that inject an Irish
dimension into the affairs of the island's north-eastern provinces. Free the
IRA prisoners . . .
Stop right there. Public opinion will need much preconditioning for all of
this, but most particularly if the government is to release some of the men
responsible for IRA terrorist outrages. The government view is that these
are not political prisoners, but criminals. Merely moving a few of them from
mainland prisons back to Northern Ireland has already caused a political
furore. It is true that comparable releases of ANC and PLO cadres were
eventually agreed, but the IRA is not equivalent to those organisations,
neither of which had open recourse to the ballot box. Anyhow, the British
electorate is as yet unprepared.
Most of the items on the above list of nationalist demands will, however,
eventually be met - even prisoner paroles. Yet as Mr Reynolds clearly
appreciates, to respond to any one of them with greater haste than
mainstream unionist opinion could endure might blow the entire process
apart. Even the broadcasting ban, which Sir Patrick knows is a nonsense,
should be removed only when it is expedient to do so. This does not mean
appeasing all unionists all the time. Mr Major's curt dismissal of Mr Ian
Paisley last week was delightful to behold. The leader of the Democratic
Unionists may be a hero to his electorate, but he is part of the problem.
If there is a solution, it will be dictated by political tactics, some of
them grubby. The Conservatives who attend next month's party conference in
Bournemouth are overwhelmingly sympathetic to the unionists. Many
resolutions to that effect, some of them casting doubt on the government's
integrity, have been sifted at Tory headquarters. Any democratic politician
would be advised to hold out for a few weeks while the IRA is repeatedly
asked to append the word 'permanent' to its notification of an end to
hostilities. Mr Major is not strongly placed to resist such a temptation.
The argument about this troublesome word 'permanent' might disappear in
December. By then the IRA armistice, if it holds, will have done so for the
full three months envisaged in last year's Irish-British declaration.
Before that, but perhaps after the Tory conference, it may pay to lift the
broadcasting ban. Perhaps British army patrols in Catholic areas might be
curtailed. The expressions of British anguish at the prospect of another US
visa being granted to Mr Adams might be muted, at least if the president of
Sinn Fein is not to meet President Bill Clinton. The latter piece of theatre
might win a few Irish-American votes in the mid-term elections, but it would
be the grubbiest political act of all. Mr Major is wise to dampen
expectations of British government acquiescence in any such thing. Meanwhile
a question pops up. Is there a trade-off between British support for Mr
Clinton in Haiti and US agreement to go easy on rolling out the red carpet
for Mr Adams?
Nothing can easily be done about 'loyalist' terrorism, which still
continues. This is the lethal work of several groups, none of them as
disciplined as the IRA. The peace process depends on a cessation of activity
by 'loyalist' murderers, although that is easier said than brought about.
The greater the level of suspicion in unionist areas, the wider the seas in
which these gangs can swim. This is not an argument for pandering to the
Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Freedom Fighters, but it does add to
the case for moving at a pace unionist democrats can accept.
Whatever his shortcomings in other areas, Mr Major has shown since he signed
the joint declaration with Mr Reynolds that he understands the unionists, at
least as much as Mr John Hume, who signed a preparatory article of faith
with Mr Adams, understands the nationalists. The ungenerous will say that Mr
Major is displaying cool leadership in Ulster because he has no choice. If
he and Mr Reynolds achieve peace, history will be kinder than that.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Stereotyping Arab women
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms NADIA HIJAB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was taken aback by Bronwen Maddox's piece, 'Cairo women worlds apart
from UN ideologues' (September 10). Her decision to visit two Cairo hair
salons to cull opinion about women's reactions to the population conference
gave her the same narrow view that she would have had in London or New York
had she sought out women with 'coral-coloured nails' to match their coral
dresses. This is not to say that personal appearance is unimportant, but
surely we have moved beyond this stereotype by now?
Egyptian women's participation in public life since the turn of the century
and in the modern workforce for some 150 years is well-documented. Had she
wished, she could have, as I have on my visits to Egypt, visited a
university to meet women professors and department heads, a newspaper office
to meet women journalists and editors, a farm to meet women agricultural
labourers and owners, a factory to meet women workers, many companies to
meet businesswomen and chief executives, and any government or UN office to
meet national and international civil servants.
Bronwen Maddox would not necessarily have found consensus about the
population conference. But with all of these women she could have engaged in
intelligent debate on the issues facing men and women in Egypt today, rather
than imposing a one-dimensional view of women on herself and her readers.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sectors need regulation - not
industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID SOUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Who regulates?' (September 14), substantially
misrepresents the proposals in the Institute for Public Policy Research's
new report, 'Regulating Our Utilities', of which I am one of the authors.
You say that we want to replace individual regulators with 'regulatory
commissions representing 'stakeholders' such as suppliers and employees',
and that this would weaken regulation by opening it up to lobbying by
special interest groups.
If we were proposing that, no doubt it would; but we are not. We argue for
regulatory bodies for sectors such as energy and and communications rather
then industries such as gas and electricity, or telecoms and posts - because
of the need for a coherent approach to these areas. The role which separate
regulation played in last year's coal crisis illustrates this need.
We argue for regulatory commissions rather than individuals because sectoral
regulation demands a range of expertise and because the personalisation of
regulation has undermined the quality of decision-making.
Nowhere do we suggest that such commissions should include representatives
of vested interests. On the contrary, we think that would be wrong. We
suggest it 'might be possible to include individuals with other relevant
public policy expertise, for example of having represented consumers in the
industries concerned, though they should not be currently involved in doing
so'. We want expertise added to the process, not lobbyists.
Utility regulation is vitally important to the UK's infrastructure and to
citizens' lives. Our proposals aim to improve the quality of regulation -
distinguishing ministers' responsibility for medium-term policy in sectors
such as energy, communications and transport, while strengthening
regulators' executive independence in achieving these democratically
determined objectives.

Sir, Contrary to the claims made by Nigel Griffiths, the Labour spokesman on
consumer affairs ('Wrong number. . .', September 7), no changes have been
agreed between the Department of Trade and Industry and the British
Standards Institution to reduce the volume level of telephones.
BSI was asked by the DTI to look at ways of utilising, to the benefit of
users, the improvements in the transmission efficiency of the public network
due to digitalisation.
This investigation was carried out by a BSI technical committee on which 20
UK trade, regulatory, network provider and consumer protection bodies are
represented and which had knowledge of the work and sight of all papers
throughout the investigation.
A range of options has now been forwarded to the DTI. These do not include
reducing the volume level by 25 per cent, as Mr Griffiths claims. These
suggestions have not been incorporated into any British Standard or any
amendment to a British Standard.
Any proposals to so would be subjected to scrutiny by the relevant BSI
committee and published as draft for public comment, as is the case with all
British Standards.
BSI does not produce or amend British Standards in secret but facilitates
the creation of standards in a process that is transparent and dependent on
consensus.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Arts: Insurrection at the Bolshoi - The world's greatest
ballet company is in crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The news from the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow has an oddly second-hand air, as
confrontation and argument wing round the handsome head of Yury Grigorovich,
director of the Ballet. Allegations and counter-allegations have been
exchanged during the summer between Grigorovich and the theatre's general
director, Vladimir Kokonin, with dancers adding their two-kopek's worth.
These are the high-lights of a very real crisis, the worst for many years in
the Moscow ballet's history.
They are, though, par for the course when considering Grigorovich's 30 year
tenure as absolute master of the ballet-troupe. There have been in the past
equally tense confrontations, equally vehement allegations of autocracy,
favouritism, and almost any other artistic crime that came conveniently to
hand. Maya Plisetskaya, for decades the troupe's most illustrious ballerina,
has long inveighed against Grigorovich, as has Vladimir Vasiliev, one of the
greatest of Bolshoi stars. Seven years ago, an insurrection was started by
Bolshoi dancers dissatisfied with Grigorovich's policies and the dominance
of his ballets in the repertory, with much coverage of the struggle in the
newspapers. I was in Moscow at the time, and one of the ballerinas told me
of the alignments of forces, pro and anti, adding 'I am one of Yury
Grigorovich's soldiers'. Her career depended on this fact.
Yury Grigorovich has been autocratic in his direction of the company. He
said to me once: 'I have 250 dancers, and that is 250 temperaments]' His
view, and in the context of the Soviet society in which he worked it is
wholly understandable, was that his decisions must be firm and unchallenged.
The pre-Grigorovich Bolshoi, which we saw on its first London visit in 1956,
was a marvel, brimming with great dancers, but it was stylistically dated
and looked ponderous. Grigorovich, who took command in 1964 at the age of
37, had already produced a series of successful ballets in his native
Leningrad. (The first Kirov Ballet season in London in 1961 had shown his
stripped-down, innovative Stone Flower). As director and chief choreographer
at the Bolshoi, such ballets as Spartacus, Ivan the Terrible, The Golden Age
and his re-stagings of the 19th century classics, gave the company a leaner,
more modern look.
For three decades Grigorovich's Bolshoi triumphed wherever it played, the
flag-ship of Soviet culture. And through the Brezhnev years of 'stagnation'
and artistic inertia, Grigorovich kept the blood pulsing through the veins
of this monolithic organisation. His services to the company, his
achievements in the context of Soviet policies towards the arts, cannot be
denied - though his detractors (in the West as well as in Russia) have had a
merry and mindless time trying to do so.
But with the crumbling of the old order, with the arrival of market forces
and the intoxications of free speech and free travel, Grigorovich's
absolutism has seemed more like a relic of bad old days. His company
haemorrhaged stars: such wonderful artists as Maximova and Vasiliev,
Semenyaka and Mukhamedov, Ananiashvili, Posokhov, Fedotov, Liepa, have left,
and return to their mother stage rarely if at all.
The desperate need to earn foreign currency has sent the troupe on more and
more tours, expensive to undertake and prohibitive to watch - and brought
the alarming failure of a proposed British visit this summer.
The Bolshoi Ballet, which has just gone into rehearsal for the new season in
Moscow, is still Russia's pride, and an example of the highest aspirations
of classic dancing, but it is undeniably shaken by events that it seems
barely able to comprehend let alone master.
In an intriguing parallel with the dramas now playing at the Opera Bastille
in Paris, Vladimir Kokonin, the Bolshoi's general director, is seeking to
establish control of the theatre's activities through a contractual system
which will engage both administrative and performing personnel on a yearly
basis. And so serious and urgent is the situation that President Yeltsin is
issuing decrees concerning the future running of the theatre, its opera and
ballet troupes. The old autocracy is under threat, and with it Grigorovich's
power.
What has not gone, and it forms a tragic parallel with so much else in the
new Russia, is the other huge problem for the Bolshoi: the lamentable state
of the theatre's fabric.
Reports have spoken for years of the subsidence of the building. (There was
talk in the mid-80s that the theatre was to be closed for a long period of
reconstruction.) The electric wiring is known to be antique and fallible. A
Moscow friend tells me that it is now thought unwise to go under the stage.
Last summer Yevgeny Rodionov, Russian vice-minister for culture, and
Vladimir Kokonin went to Paris to discuss with Unesco the best means of
saving the theatre. Thus far we have heard of no immediate remedies for the
situation.
The picture for those who love the Bolshoi Theatre and everything it means
in ballet and opera, and in Russia's artistic life, is distressing. It seems
symbolic of the state of Russia as it sets about rebuilding itself. And,
ironically, what the ballet company needs now is the Grigorovich of 1964:
gifted, passionately committed to his art, and able to shape the company for
the future.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Arts: 'Tosca' without tears - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Puccini's opera is newly produced at the English National Opera by Keith
Warner and the American designer John Conklin, not to mention the
lighting-man Alan Burrett. 'For whom?' might be the question; and the answer
might be, 'For post-modernists who prefer to have their withers left
unwrung.'
This is a very cool, knowing production, to the point where the end of each
act is graced, guyed or sabotaged (take your pick) by a campy graffito. At
the climax of the Act 1 'Te Deum', the Madonna statue comes to life as the
Tosca of Scarpia's lustful fantasies; after she murders him in Act 2, the
candles she places eerily about his corpse are taken from the footlights of
the little theatre glimpsed earlier at stage rear (nudge, nudge); and far
from leaping from the Castello's parapets to her death in Act 3, she freezes
before a soldier's rifle - but behind her a balletic double is seen falling,
falling, falling in slow motion.
Each of these Producers' Ideas dampens any sympathetic, suspended-disbelief
response pretty smartly. I imagine they were meant to - and by all three of
the men responsible, since their respective contributions merge
unidentifiably at the crucial moments. Elsewhere they go their own ways:
Warner directs the action in robust, cartoon-realistic style, Conklin
festoons it with a calculated jumble of icons from the Renaissance to De
Chirico, and Burrett laces it with hallucinatory lighting, lurid and abrupt.
The principal singers found their ways through this minefield with all due
caution. As the luckless hero Cavaradossi, David Rendall did that with
special disarmingness: though our indulgence had been begged for his
allergy-ridden throat, the missing degree of volume could not have added
much to his seasoned, lyrically heartfelt warmth and despair.
Rosalind Plowright's heroine was more problematic. Her forceful soprano,
with its characteristic rasping edge, is right for much of the monstre
sacree role, and her nervy volatility too - and she delivered a creditable
'Vissi d'arte'; but Tosca also needs frank passion and a touch of
self-mockery which do not lie within Miss Plowright's English-cool, even
English-prissy range.
Much the most striking of the leads was the Scarpia of Henk Smit, a Dutch
import. It is essentially a comic creation, properly monstrous from time to
time but undercut by the eager, dapper, schoolmasterly quick-march that
regularly takes him from point A to point B. The whole performance is so
sardonically knowing as to place it between permanent inverted commas; we
relish his act, but are never seriously frightened.
Smit's English is excellent to a fault, reminding us that our language -
into which Warner and his wife Emma (or sister? the programme-book is coy
about that point) have translated Illica's text crisply and colloquially -
just does have bumpier, more intrusive consonants than Italian in all the
longer words. Smit barks through the bumps, not minding them; Miss Plowright
does her best to sail past them; Rendall manages somehow to assimilate them
smoothly into his fervent lines.
Too long unheard in London, Sir Alexander Gibson conducts the score to
expert effect, with scrupulous, self-effacing deference to his singers.
(Noel Davies takes over from October 18.) Among the secondary roles we have
a decently haunted Angelotti - the fugitive who sparks the action  - from
Andrew Greenan, a conventionally twittery Sacristan solidly characterised by
Andrew Shore (as is his wont), a tuneless but intriguing Spoletta from
Edward Byles, and Richard Angas's crusty, humane Gaoler.
Does it work? I might guess better if I had any confident grasp of current
audience-sensibilities. I think Tosca a nasty, cleverly calculated piece
which offers melodious riches to good Italian singers; I do not know what to
say about the general appeal of this version. Certainly the production is
aimed to curdle any weepy indulgence - but may that not deprive Puccini of a
central motive? Certainly too, it throws the time-honoured love-and-death
motifs into historico-critical, self-conscious relief: excellent fodder for
writing reviews like this one. If you want to see a self-reviewing opera
production, this provides an excellent opportunity.
A co-production with Houston Grand Opera, supported by Friends of ENO; in
repertory until October 27

FT  16 SEP 94 / Arts: The Hostage - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just as we all were hoping that poor Ireland might find a way out of its
troubles, along comes the Royal Shakespeare Company and disturbs the peace
with Michael Bogdanov's maladroit new production of Brendan Behan's awkward
farcico-serio-weirdo 1958 IRA play The Hostage. Bogdanov and Behan is a
marriage made in Hell anyway; for heaven's sake everyone make sure Ian
Paisley goes nowhere near the Barbican for the next few months.
And, by the way, don't you loathe the notion of 'topical' revivals? You can
just see how some grim spark around the RSC at the time of the Downing
Street Declaration must have thought 'Oh goody] - now we can revive Behan's
flawed old Hostage - OK, it's flawed, but it'll be relevant.'
We sit for the worse part of three hours in the Barbican, looking at a
Dublin brothel that IRA activists take over with their 18-year-old British
soldier hostage. The non-IRA characters sit around, they entertain a motley
crew of customers, they drink, they sing songs, they waffle on about
religion and the British and the troubles, they even dance. The IRA guys are
as feckless as everyone else, and they leave their hostage alive just long
enough for him to form an attachment to an 18-year-old girl called Teresa.
All of which is meant to set us reflecting about the terrible futility of
the troubles, and the topicality of a 1958 play.
Not, however, in my case; I just sit and fume about the guys who waste my
time with a clumsy revival of a clumsy text of a minor and imperfect play.
Behan wrote more than one version of The Hostage; it looks as if Bogdanov
and the RSC chose the least pithy. Bogdanov has made the Dublin
boarding-house-cum-brothel as deranged a place as he can, and has encouraged
some (but not all) the cast to perform it all as if urging us not to believe
that this house might be real or that these Irish characters are worthy of
being taken seriously for a moment.
Some of this farce potential is there in Behan's play, to be sure. But Behan
did not imagine that his Dublin tenement might be tipped forwards and
sideways by 30 degrees, as by Kendra Ullyart's decor here. You take one look
as this skew-whiff set and you feel seasick before the action starts.
You feel a whole lot more seasick as you try to piece together the life of
this boarding-house, in which characters keep popping in and out of nine
different doorways like rabbits. There is the transvestite navvy Rio Rita
and his black boxer boyfriend Princess Grace, the whore Colette and her
drunken client (a Russian sailor who travels bisexually round half the cast,
seldom exiting with the same person twice, and who then turns out to be an
undercover agent . . . ). Not to mention the musicians who appear
sporadically.
Slightly more important are the kilted old Anglo-Irish (but anti-British)
Monsewer, with his Gaelic (terrible) and his bagpipes (worse); and the crazy
religious spinster Miss Gilchrist. Central are Pat, the caretaker and an
ageing IRA fighter, and his consort Meg; and the skivvy Teresa.
There are some excellent performances: notably from Dermot Crowley and
Dearbhla Molloy as weary Pat and brassy Meg. 'Go on, abuse me,' he tells
her, 'your own husband, that took you off the streets on a Sunday morning
when there wasn't a pub open in the city.' You want to see actors like this
in a production that makes a stage world real; it is too bad of Bogdanov to
waste their time as well as ours. Alison McKenna is touching as Teresa, and
John Woodvine makes the eccentric Monsewer amusing if not convincing.
Of the actors who encourage one not to trust the play, the worst is Jenny
Quayle as Miss Gilchrist. As in Bogdanov's (generally otherwise hilarious)
RSC version of Goldoni's The Venetian Twins, she overdoes every actorly
touch, with special vocal effects in mid-sentence. (The way her voice dips
to add a louche connotation to 'so much more satisfactory than medical
students' is an object lesson in bad theatrical camp.) But she is the
actress most perfectly in tune with Bogdanov's messy and half-surreal
account of this sprawling version of a nutty play.
In my review of the Birmingham Rep Tempest, I inadvertently cited Andy
Hockley as playing both Stephano and Caliban. The latter role was in fact
played by Richard McCabe. My apologies to both.

Those who thought that John Betjeman was a rather ducky little poet chiefly
concerned with exulting in the glories of trolley buses and Bourne and
Hollingsworth, will have realised their mistake if they have been watching
The Lost Betjemans on C4. He was, no doubt, fascinated by middle-class
gentility and old-worldliness. But the streak of misanthropy and depression
(about as wide as Balham High Street) which was so close below the surface
of his work has been unmistakable here. Tonight's programme records his
visits to Weston-super-
Mare and Bath in 1962 (8.00). My candidate for the murderer in 'Master Of
The Moor', ITV's Ruth Rendell Mystery, is Stephen's old Dadda. So how do I
explain the sinister figure in the cloak? Probably the detective, Manciple,
acting out some mad obsession. Or, since it is always referred to as 'he'
but is hooded, a woman. Do I really care? Not much, but enough to watch this
final episode (9.00). The commentary in the first part of The Longest Walk
was so set upon emphasising the faults of round-the-world walker Ffyona
Campbell that everyone must be rooting for her. Perhaps that was the idea
(9.30 BBC2).

FT  16 SEP 94 / Arts: The RPO plays a different tune - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Charles Mackerras is conducting it is advisable to expect the
unexpected. To open the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra's London season he
paired two choral masterpieces, Mozart's Requiem and Janacek's Glagolitic
Mass, but typically neither was performed in the version we usually hear.
Even the National Anthem came in an arrangement by Mackerras himself.
It says a lot about how things have changed at the RPO that Mackerras's
brand of adventurousness has found favour there. Not so long ago years would
pass by without it seeming necessary to visit a single concert for anybody
interested in what was musically important in London. But now there is a new
vital spark: Mackerras as principal guest conductor, the Maryinsky-Kirov
link with Valery Gergiev, a dash of new music, and more than a dash of
imagination in the programming.
The RPO has traditionally been the most popular-minded of the capital's four
commercial orchestras and there is every sign that it is keen to widen its
appeal further through its involvement with Classic FM radio and a big,
mass-market recording project. The question is whether the orchestra can
raise its game in the programming of its own concerts and still hold on to
this popular audience.
For its opening concert of the season on Wednesday it had a well-filled
Royal Festival Hall, which was a promising start. How many in the audience
noticed that they were hearing a different version of Mozart's Requiem from
usual? Probably not many: the Beyer edition makes few major changes from the
score as finished by Sussmayr after Mozart's death and this was in any case
a lacklustre performance of it - difficult to believe that Mackerras was in
charge.
The Janacek, however, was another matter. With apparent precision the
programme described what was to be performed as 'a reconstruction of the
original version', though that begs a few questions when applied to a work
put together in various stages. Suffice to say that the reconstruction is
even more wildly original than what we usually hear. At the Crucifixion
climax of the 'Veruju', where the solo organ bursts out, there was now also
extra music for three thunderous timpani, as though the heavens were raining
down in fury.
All the performers, so somnolent in the Mozart, came urgently to life. This
performance did not quite equal the electrifying account of the Mass that
Mackerras gave a couple of years ago at the Edinburgh Festival, but the RPO
played well for him and the Brighton Festival Chorus has never sounded more
decisive. The four soloists were Helen Field, Jean Rigby, Philip Langridge
and David Thomas, who almost sounded relieved to be freed from their
constraints as a Mozartian quartet.
The RPO claims this performance to have been a UK professional premiere,
which is a small feather in its cap. Nor will it be the last in the
orchestra's 'Choral classics' series: anybody who thinks he knows Verdi's
Requiem is in for a big surprise when the RPO plays that next spring.

Monsanto, the US chemicals group, is offering Dollars 1m to scientists who
can devise a successful method of separating and recovering ammonia from
waste streams containing organic chemicals.
Monsanto said the problem was 'one of the industry's most vexing
environmental questions'. Although the mixtures of ammonia and organic
chemicals are not necessarily highly toxic, they comprise some of the
largest volumes of Monsanto's industrial waste.
Monsanto plans to provide Dollars 500,000 to fund the development of the
research proposals that meet the company's criteria in the most
cost-effective and commercially practicable manner.
A second Dollars 500,000 will be paid if the research yields a successful
process. Proposals must be submitted by the end of the year.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scientists working for the Medical Research Council's cellular immunology
unit in Oxford have found that the interactions between proteins on cell
surfaces of the immune system are far weaker than had been assumed.
The research team has been examining proteins, known as adhesion molecules,
which are distributed on the T lymphocyte, a white blood cell which patrols
the bloodstream looking for viruses, bacteria and foreign materials, known
as antigens.
The findings, which were disclosed in this week's Trends in Biochemical
Sciences, are expected to be important in the design of drugs based on
inhibiting adhesion molecules, in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis
where the immune system mistakes the body's cells for antigens.

<TEXT>
Anyone tired of waking up to scratchy music on the radio alarm clock will
welcome a new product by Bose, the Boston-based sound system manufacturer,
writes Victoria Griffiths.
The clock radio, the first to make use of 'wave' technology, sounds better
than most stereo sets. Wave technology filters the sound through a twisted
plastic tube and has inspired the miniaturisation of high-quality speakers.
The product was launched in Europe this week, at a cost of about Dollars 500
(Pounds 322.50).

recorder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Arguments over clashing television schedules could be eased by the
development of a multiplexer unit for home videos that allows two television
channels to be recorded simultaneously. The unit, which combines 3D
recording techniques and computer memory chips, allows the user to record
over an existing programme without erasing it.
The technology, which was devised by 3D Video Plus, a Kent-based recording
technology company, is being marketed by Foxmark International, a Tokyo
consultancy.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Technology: Pick of a rich software crop - Software at Work
/ A package that lets accountants take quick stock of client billing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Discard the image of the insular chartered accountant so mocked by Monty
Python comic John Cleese. Accountants, among others, are achieving a
judicious mix of the personal touch and advanced technology with the help of
new 'groupware' communications software.
Levy Gee, the London-based accountancy firm, is less conventional than most.
It was the first accountancy practice to advertise on the radio, the first
to automate timesheets and billing and, it claims, the only one with more
personal computers than people. Founded in 1969, the firm employs 260 staff,
including 36 partners, served by 300 computers at home and in the office.
Connecting people and computers became a priority once Levy Gee had
assembled several software building blocks dedicated to different functions.
These included a billing system developed in-house, a packaged accounts
system, an in-house system to assess work-in-progress and bills outstanding,
plus an 'executive information system' to give senior partners screen-based
snapshots of the business.
'In many respects the English professions have suffered from the prejudice
against computers,' says Ross Mullinger, head of Levy Gee's information
technology consultancy. 'We saw that there was an increasing IT input, and
that our firm had to be more IT aware and, at the same time, distributed as
widely as possible.'
There had to be easy communication between all of its six UK offices, and
between its UK base and its partners in the US. Many staff work from home
and they needed to have as much immediate access to information as anyone
working in the office.
The firm's main client base consists of small, typically family businesses.
In the years of recession, its insolvency and consultancy arm has grown and
now contributes 30 to 40 per cent of the bread-and-butter income. As well as
this 'hand-holding' service for companies in trouble, it has extended its
activities to risk investigation on behalf of banks and corporate investors.
Other activities include offshore services, financial services, a training
company and a computer training division.
Levy Gee practised what it preached in the acquisition of a new accounting
system, investigating its risks and assessing its functions. But it is the
wider environment in which Levy Gee has embedded its accounting which makes
it unusual. At the time of choosing its accounting software, the firm was
also ready to upgrade its hardware.
While many firms were buying systems (usually the Unix multi-user standard)
with a central processor supporting a number of terminals, Levy Gee decided
on a PC-based local area network (Lan), linking its partners in the UK and
abroad. This was to prove more flexible and expandable, because extra PCs
could be tagged on to the system without having a significant upgrade.
It does, however, need expert management. The IT operation is run with six
people, supporting six offices linked by high-quality ISDN (integrated
services digital network) telephone lines.
Levy Gee's structure was also a factor in choosing an accounts package. Each
partner runs a separate 'department', typically of 20 people or so, and is
responsible for the billing and profits of the business. 'Each partner has
his own fee ledger and manages the costs against it,' explains Jonathon
Teller, the partner responsible for information technology and finance.
From the moment of recording the time worked to the putting out of an
invoice, nothing goes on to paper. Clients get a breakdown of where time and
costs are incurred. Time is billed in six-minute units and partners can
inspect every detail of each itemised invoice.
The work-in-progress system, written as a companion to time billing, enables
Teller's department to see exactly how much work-in-progress is unbilled.
Unlike payables, receivables are managed centrally: 'It means you get a feel
for the cash flow.' A monthly debtors list goes round to the partners.
Bills still not sent out after 45 days are frowned upon, and only rarely
would work still be unbilled after six months.
Levy Gee used to rely on handwritten timesheets, like most other firms. Now
part of the assessment of performance is how well a partner and his
department keeps up with billing, says Mullinger. 'I think we were among the
first to have a system in which every fee-earner input his own time into the
system to raise his own billing.'
The firm chose the components of its system by first assessing a shortlist
of accounting packages which included Tetra, Systems Union, Pegasus,
Multisoft and Sky. Flexibility and ease of use were important, with such a
wide user base. But the firm says the main criterion was ease of data import
and export, and it was on these grounds that the SunSystems package of
integrated ledgers from Systems Union won the contract.
Levy Gee became the first user of the Lan-based version of SunSystems, with
the SQL version - which allows it to upgrade from the smallest PCs up to
large computers without changing software. With SQL, the daily bank balance
report that used to take 40 minutes now takes 40 seconds.
The package is portable in that it can run on a variety of PCs. At Levy Gee,
it integrates with the Microsoft Office word processing package, Excel
spreadsheet, Forest and Trees executive information system (published by ESP
of Maidenhead), and the in-house software built for time-recording and
billing.
The system operates on Lotus Notes - the communications framework
integrating the voice mail system and all textual exchanges between users:
forms, letters, E-Mail notes, extracts of accounts, even press cuttings. The
company is working towards putting clients and other colleagues on to its
own Lotus network. Lotus Notes is 'the ideal glue to connect the systems
together', says Mark Iwaszko, technical director.
It is clear that anyone joining Levy Gee who is not already familiar with
computers must have a hard few weeks getting to grips with everything from
Lotus Notes to the voice-messaging system. Notes has become the lingua
franca of the company, used for everything from integrating data from the
work-in-progress and accounting ledgers, to customising letters.
Notes has provided a discussion platform for ideas and is used to
co-ordinate everyday work, such as auditing (audit files are replicated on
Notebook computers so that staff working from remote offices can keep in
touch with managers, and use the central database for reference and
case-history). It acts as a meeting-place for minds and US colleagues use it
as 'a noticeboard' for clippings from the US information technology press.
Leon Nahon, a senior partner, also often works at home. Logging on, he is
faced with a simple menu offering work-in-progress, time recording, work
schedule, electronic mail and voice-messaging.
'The first thing I do is run through the messages and delete what's
unimportant, then I check my schedule and get on with it.'
As Nahon points out, one of the problems of such a rich choice is that he
will never know every function, despite extensive training programmes. 'I
only send a fax every three weeks or so, and although I know I can do it
from my screen, it's quicker for me to ask someone else to send it for me,'
he admits.
Training staff to use the equipment effectively was one of the hidden costs.
The three switchboard staff, for example, have to be as comfortable with a
PC as they are with the telephone and the voicemail system. They take
incoming calls personally and only then offer the option of voicemail or
computer messaging. Clients can choose to dial straight into the voicemail
computer.
Levy Gee says its investment of more than Pounds 1m in the IT infrastructure
during the past three years has been more than offset by the returns in
administrative and staff savings.
However, Mullinger insists that cost is the least important aspect of the IT
initiative. 'The systems make our staff more effective,' he says. 'But we
didn't do it just to save on costs. We did it to prepare ourselves for the
21st century. Its real value has been in our competitive positioning.'

FT  16 SEP 94 / People: MFI builds its boardroom table
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MFI, the furniture retailer floated on the stock exchange two years ago, is
shaking up its senior management and appointing its first female finance
director.
The announcement was made at yesterday's annual meeting, where MFI gave a
very positive statement on current trading. It said that although sales were
less buoyant in July, strong turnover in August and September meant sales
for the first 19 weeks of the current year were 10 per cent ahead of last
year.
Derek Hunt is relinquishing the role of chief executive but remains
executive chairman. He will have more time for strategy, for example, on
investigating opportunities in France, where the 52nd store was opened this
week.
Hunt joined MFI in 1972, and in 1973, as branch operations controller,
earned notoriety during the miners' strike by delivering generators to all
MFI stores. He became group managing director in 1981, before moving to Asda
after the merger with the supermarket group in 1985. He returned to MFI in
1987 to head the Pounds 780m management buy-out.
Responsibility for day-to-day management of the business passes to John
Randall (far left), promoted from finance director to group managing
director.
Randall is to be replaced as group finance director by Sue Murphy (left),
for the past six years finance director of the retail division.
Randall, 48, trained as an accountant at Spillers before joining MFI in
1978. He became finance director of the retail business in 1982, and group
finance director in 1987 at the time of the management buy-out.
Murphy, 37, worked previously at Rank Xerox, Overseas Containers, and IBM.
She joined MFI in 1984 as a management accountant and in 1985 became chief
accountant. She was appointed retail finance director in 1987.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Property: Better luck next time - Simon London on whether
banks will fuel the property cycle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The boom-to-bust property cycle of the past decade was - like the wider UK
economic roller-coaster - fuelled by debt. Bank lending to property
companies peaked in May 1991 at Pounds 41bn, or nearly 13 per cent of all
commercial lending, which left the industry more highly geared than ever
before.
The reasons for this debt explosion are complex. The reluctance of pension
funds and insurance companies to invest in property meant that equity
funding was scarce. The development boom of the late 1980s meant that the
industry's thirst for finance was great. Encouraged by the high margins
which could be earned in property lending, banks were only too willing to
fill the funding gap.
Yet the experience of the past four years underlines that excessive reliance
on debt makes an already cyclical business truly vicious. As capital values
fell there was simply not enough equity in the industry's funding mix to
take the strain. Receiverships were the inevitable outcome.
The questions, then, are whether banks will be asked to finance the property
cycle this time around and whether they will be prepared to do so on terms
that companies find acceptable.
There is certainly no reason to expect domestic investment institutions to
suddenly regain their enthusiasm for property. The recent flow of
institutional funds into property looks more like a tactical response to
rising asset values than the start of a long-term trend. While overseas
institutions have been high-profile investors in UK property throughout the
downturn, their interest waxes and wanes.
The London Stock Market has already done its bit: property companies have
raised almost Pounds 3bn in rights issues and flotations in the past 18
months, which explains why demand for bank finance is currently weak. But
this infusion of equity will not last for long.
All this suggests that banks will, before long, find property companies
queueing for loans. Initially, at least, many of these potential borrowers
will not be welcomed with open arms.
The overhang of debt remains a problem. By the spring of this year banks had
reduced their property lending to Pounds 33.5bn, or 10 per cent of all
commercial loans. But many of the biggest lenders still feel over-exposed.
Barclays, the most enthusiastic of the clearing banks in lending to property
in the late 1980s, had Pounds 6.3bn loans outstanding to UK property and
construction companies at the end of its last financial year. That was
equivalent to 9 per cent of total UK assets - personal as well as commercial
loans. With lending elsewhere in the economy still weak, property loans will
clearly have to be rationed if that percentage is going to fall.
None of this implies that clearing banks are unwilling to lend to the right
customers on the right terms.
'We are active lenders into the sector but in a more selective way,
concentrating on relationships where we can do more than provide plain
'vanilla' (no frills) loans,' said Mr Ian Marcus, director at Natwest
Markets.
Overseas banks - led by the German mortgage banks - took advantage of the
clearers' caution to carve valuable niches for themselves. The number of
foreign banks in London lending to property companies has increased further
over the past year. Lending margins have already narrowed as a result.
But there is no sign of margins sliding as banks compete aggressively for
business. For the moment, at least, the lessons of recession are still
fresh.
Bankers now recognise that they need to earn a decent return on capital,'
said Mr Mark Burton of United Bank of Kuwait. 'If a bank is taking
equity-style risks it should insist on an equity return.'
That points to more differential pricing, with riskier property companies
paying much higher margins than their more established peers.
The cautious attitude of banks towards development finance is also likely to
favour the bigger borrowers. While most banks have a blanket ban on funding
speculative developments, they are happy to support such schemes through
their general-purpose loans to the big quoted property groups.
The rise of relationship banking is part of the reason. Big property
companies will buy other services, such as corporate finance advice or
treasury management products, helping the bank to earn its all-important
return on capital.
This attitude is in marked contrast to the late 1980s, when banks were happy
to back the rise of small, entrepreneurial developers such as Rosehaugh and
Stanhope.
How long this mood of caution prevails depends on whether the lessons of the
slump are enduring. With the benefit of hindsight it is clear that many
banks did not understand the risk they were taking.
'A margin of 2 per cent over interbank rates looked terrific back in 1989
because the returns on other types of lending were so low,' said Mr Richard
Lovell, head of property at Industrial Bank of Japan. 'But banks lending 80
per cent of value at the peak of the market were providing risk capital as
well as senior debt.'
One test will be whether loan-to-value ratios of 60-70 per cent - the norm
for investment deals struck over the past year - creep higher. Given the
highly cyclical nature of the asset it would probably make more sense for
loan-to-value ratios to fall as property prices rise.
Greater understanding between valuers and bankers would probably help avoid
the worst excesses of the last cycle. Valuation Guidance Note 12 - produced
earlier this year by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the
British Bankers Association - replaces 'open-market valuation' with a
forward-looking 'estimated realisation price' (the price that might be
achieved if the property was put on the market immediately).
More important, the guidance note suggests that the valuer comments on
trends which could effect the realisation price - which should surely
include an opinion on whether the market is heading for a fall.
If that provides banks with timely reminders of where they are in the cycle,
the wider property market will surely benefit.

Michael Beckett, 58, a former managing director of Consolidated Gold Fields,
has added to his reputation as a bit of a trouble-shooter by taking on the
chairmanship of Greycoat, the property developer which was rescued from the
brink of collapse last November.
The company, which completed its financial restructuring earlier this year,
has been looking for a new chairman for several months. Geoffrey Wilson, who
founded the company and turned it into one of London's most ambitious
property developers, retired in April and was replaced on an interim basis
by George Constantinidi who has been a director since 1982 and will remain
on the board.
Beckett has a history of joining boards of troubled companies, often at the
behest of the institutional investors. However, sources close to Greycoat
suggested that the institutions had not played any role in Beckett's latest
appointment. He is already chairman of Watts Blake Bearne, Horace Clarkson
and Monarch Resources and sits on the boards of several other companies
including Queens Moat Houses, Amstrad and Ashanti Goldfields.

FT  16 SEP 94 / People: Sir Sydney Lipworth to be chairman of Zeneca
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceutical company Zeneca has ended a long search for a chairman to
replace Sir Denys Henderson when he retires at the company's annual meeting
next May. His successor is Sir Sydney Lipworth (above), the former chairman
of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Zeneca was demerged from chemicals company ICI last year and yesterday's
appointment increases the difference between the two. Sir Denys, currently
chairman of both and an ICI man all his working life, is replaced at ICI by
Ronnie Hampel, also a company man. South African-born Sir Sydney has been a
director of at least six companies, ranging from BAT Industries to J.
Rothschild Holdings.
Furthermore, Sir Sydney will be a part-time and non-executive chairman, with
Zeneca chief executive David Barnes solely in command.
Sir Sydney, 63, is already a non-executive director of Carlton
Communications, deputy chairman of National Westminster Bank and chairman of
the Financial Reporting Council.
He graduated from the University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg and
practised as a barrister before moving to the UK in 1964. He was a director
of Abbey Life Assurance group before he co-founded Allied Dunbar, now one of
the UK's biggest insurance companies.
Sir Denys is 62 next month, the normal retirement age for Zeneca. He said in
January that he would take over the chairmanship of the Rank Organisation
when he left ICI and Zeneca.

FT  16 SEP 94 / People: Leaving the ship of state
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
P&amp;O, the international shipping company, has acquired a senior civil servant
as its new director of corporate affairs in the shape of Peter Smith,
principal private secretary to Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary since April 1992.
Lord Sterling, chairman of P&amp;O, has long-standing connections with the DTI,
having acted for many years as an adviser to the department, and has known
Smith for many years.
Smith, 42, will join P&amp;O on September 26 to fill the gap left earlier this
year when his predecessor Peter Thomas retired to his native Australia. Lord
Sterling is maintaining the link through his senior PR man because Smith,
while born in the UK, was brought up in Australia.
In his new role, Smith could well find himself exchanging words with his
former employer. British shipowners have been vociferous in their
condemnation of what they see as the government's neglect of the Red Ensign
and are continuing to press for tax breaks.
Smith studied philosophy and mathematics at the Australian National
University before going on to complete a PhD in philosophy at the University
of St Andrews. He has been at the DTI since 1978, working in the fields of
overseas trade promotion, industrial policy and company law.
In 1989 he took over responsibility for telecommunications policy and
prepared the government's white paper on telecoms in the 1990s.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Management: Miner changes - The post-privatisation shake-up
in the coal industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kevin Duncalf, underground locomotive driver and loader at Hem Heath
colliery, Staffordshire, recalls with frustration his employment at British
Coal. 'For half the shift I was doing nothing. I used to die of boredom,' he
says.
Today his work keeps him fully occupied. 'I am doing three jobs each day,
whereas previously I worked on just one,' he says. He is working at the same
pit, but with a different employer - Coal Investments, a company which has
taken over five former British Coal mines.
Managers say Duncalf is working twice as hard as he used to. While not
everyone at the pit has been able to double their productivity, every worker
has made some progress, says Coal Investments. The company, in common with
most bidders for mining assets, sees fundamental changes in working
practices as essential to future success.
The leasings by Coal Investments and others, at a total of nine mines, are
seen as the prelude to full privatisation later this year, when the
government will sell off British Coal's remaining 16 deep mines. From a peak
of about 1m workers at the turn of the century, just 10,000 underground
workers will remain in the industry.
It is inevitable that those remaining miners will be asked to work more
effectively and, in some cases, for less pay. Demarcation lines between
workers will be eroded and the role of unions will change. Coal Investments'
changes in working methods, therefore, may provide an indication of things
to come.
The company is by no means anti-union: it has submitted a joint bid with the
Union of Democratic Mineworkers to buy two British Coal regions in the full
privatisation. But it has not negotiated with unions over pay rates at its
existing pits and has no plans to do so.
Unions will still be allowed to represent their members, but John Warwick,
company production director, argues that the need for unions is limited.
'The strength of unions comes from management abnegating its responsibility.
If management is doing its job there is no need for unions,' he says.
There are new attempts within the company to build a partnership. Miners are
now on Christian-name terms with their bosses, and there is no segregation
in the showers, as there used to be, between different ranks of workers.
Improved communications are aimed at further reducing the perceived
management-worker divide. Although there are no formalised team briefings,
managers are expected to tell the men about share price, unit costs,
production figures and development targets, and even the prices of raw
materials.
Mitch Lysek, who works on coal-face cutting machinery at Silverdale pit,
also in Staffordshire, says: 'When I worked for British Coal, I had no idea
what the price of materials was. Now I know how much each nut and bolt costs
and how much steel is in stock.'
With access to this information, managers argue that workers are less likely
to waste materials. Says Lysek: 'If Coal Investments does not make money
then nor do we. British Coal was different because it was a government
concern.'
The comments come from a man who is no fan of privatisation. But Lysek is
learning to live with the new regime. Like locomotive driver Duncalf,
boredom is now less of a problem. 'Because we have to be more flexible the
day goes quicker,' says Lysek.
Flexibility also makes it possible for Duncalf and a colleague to perform
duties previously carried out by seven men (although the loads handled are
smaller). In British Coal days, Duncalf did each of the three types of task,
but was able to do just one on each shift. Now, with demarcation lines
eroded he can do all three in a single shift and it is easier for workers to
call on each other and supervisors for assistance.
But in contrast to the experiences of Duncalf and Lysek are some workers who
claim that their work has changed little. 'We were already working hard for
British Coal. We could scarcely work harder,' says one miner.
And some changes have yet to fulfil their potential. In the Silverdale pit,
a group of three workers operates a tunnelling machine that previously
occupied five men. Managers want them to increase tunnelling speed from 3m a
shift to 4m.
A few operators appear disgruntled that they are being asked to be more
productive for less pay than they earned with British Coal and this could be
a potential problem for Coal Investments.
Indeed, miners' money is so far substantially less: Warwick says that some
British Coal employees can take home more than Pounds 500 a week after
overtime and bonus pay. At Coal Investments, which has rationalised 14
British Coal pay rates to four, the gross maximum for miners working a
six-day week is about Pounds 282.
The company expects to bridge the earnings gap through an employee share
ownership plan, profit-related pay and, when full production starts next
year, productivity bonuses. These promises of plenty appear to satisfy most
employees who are, anyway, grateful for the chance to be working down a mine
again after a spell outside the industry.
Management-friendly comments are predictable at a young company enjoying a
honeymoon with its workforce. The real test of the culture transformation
claims will come if the company runs into production or marketing
difficulties and has to disappoint its workers' expectations of high
rewards.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Management: Getting to grips with a killer disease - The
incidence of testicular cancer has doubled over the last 20 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROL COOPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When asked to name the commonest cancer in men under 45, most people get it
wrong, I concluded at a recent dinner party. My question killed the
conversation dead, but it highlighted the importance of testicular cancer.
One man in 450 will develop this cancer before the age of 50 and more than
1,400 new cases are diagnosed in the UK every year. The incidence is even
higher in other northern European countries, notably Denmark, Germany,
Switzerland, Ireland and Luxembourg.
Testicular cancer is generally treated with a combination of surgery and
chemotherapy, with great success. (Sterility is the rule for a year or two
after treatment, but the long-term outlook is excellent.) Around 95 per cent
recover completely and many father children. Unfortunately, results are less
good when the disease is advanced. In 1992, this cancer killed 123 men in
England and Wales.
Few men examine themselves regularly - only 3 per cent, according to an
Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) study. As for breast disease, the value
of self-examination is disputed, but many authorities now recommend it on
the basis that it is important to be familiar with one's own anatomy.
Signs to be taken seriously include swelling of one testicle, or a lump on
the front or side. Sometimes there is real pain, but often there are only
vague symptoms such as dull ache, heaviness, or change in feel.
Unfortunately, men are reluctant to go to the doctor and may have to be
propelled into the surgery by wife or girlfriend. Many men, perhaps
believing that the symptoms will go away, leave things too late - over half
of all those with testicular cancer seek help after the tumour has spread.
This cancer does not spread to the easily felt lymph glands in the groin,
but to those around the aorta, deep within the abdomen. This is entirely
logical given that the testicle originates embryologically from that area.
In the past 20 years, the incidence of testicular cancer has doubled. It is
rising, especially in younger white men and in higher social classes, for
reasons which are unclear. Nobody knows the cause of testicular cancer, but
risk factors are coming to light.
Until recently, an undescended or partly descended testis was one of the few
known causal factors. If left surgically uncorrected beyond the age of 10 or
so, this condition roughly trebles the risk of testicular cancer - even on
the side which appears normal.
Heredity appears to be even more important and a history of this cancer in a
close relative calls for extra vigilance. Sons of men with the disease are
four times as likely to develop it, while brothers of those affected are
nearly 10 times as likely to do so.
In the hope of finding a gene for it, a research project is now being
carried out into families with two or more members with testicular cancer.
Sixty such families have been identified so far in Britain and the Cancer
Research Campaign (CRC) and ICRF are on the lookout for more.
Over the years, there have been worries about the possible effect of mumps,
vasectomy, injury and heat (especially in the form of tight trousers, hot
baths and central heating).
A leading study from the UK Testicular Cancer Study Group looked into the
medical and social histories of nearly 800 men with the disease in nine
British health regions. The findings were reported in May in the British
Medical Journal and this month in the British Journal of Cancer.
There seems to be no association between testicular cancer and either heat
or mumps (even after puberty, when orchitis, as it is known, is more
likely). But a history of any sexually transmitted disease appears to double
the risk of this cancer. There is also some relation between infertility and
testicular cancer, but it is not yet clear whether this is cause-and-effect.
Men contemplating vasectomy, however, should be reassured - there is no
evidence of a link.
The study suggests that regular exercise could have a protective effect  -
men who exercise for 15 or more hours a week had a substantially lower
incidence. But injury to the testis can double the risk. This could be
significant in some sports, although there are not yet enough data on which
to base firm advice.
Finally, there is some suggestion that an early puberty is an important risk
factor. This ties in with the theory that high levels of gonadotrophin
hormones from the pituitary gland may stimulate cells in such a way as to
promote cancerous change. And since puberty is occurring earlier these days,
often well before the standard age of 14 in boys, it is also consistent with
the rising trend in testicular cancer. However, there is unlikely to be a
single cause for this cancer or, put another way, one remains to be
discovered.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Rivers body warns over grant cuts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Further cuts in government grants for the National Rivers Authority would
cause it 'severe difficulties', Lord Crickhowell, the chairman, said
yesterday.
His comments came as he presented the NRA's annual review, which said that
it was covering more of its costs by charging for services. But some
activities had to be funded by government, for example fishery conservation
and prevention of poaching.
Mr Ed Gallagher, chief executive, said the government grant had fallen from
Pounds 70m last year to Pounds 68m this year. There were indications that it
would be cut to Pounds 60m next year. He said: 'This is about as far as we
can go. If it went any lower it would affect our ability to do our work.'

FT  16 SEP 94 / Unisys offshoot to handle Co-op Bank's payment processing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Co-operative Bank has entered into an agreement with Unisys, the US
computer manufacturer, to split off its payment processing function into a
wholly owned Unisys sub-sidiary.
Unisys plans to invest in new computer systems for the company, which will
be made up of the 200 Co-op staff who handle payment processing. The initial
investment could total between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m.
Co-op already handles paper payment processing for several other financial
organisations including Post Office Counters and some building societies.
The new company will make a priority of seeking to expand its third-party
business, including the processing of transactions involving paper other
than cheques, such as invoices.
The marketing effort will target other, non-financial, organisations such as
local authorities and charities, which may have to deal with a large number
of paper transactions.
The move comes against a background of declining use of personal cheques, as
people switch to making greater use of debit cards.
Co-op has about 8 per cent of the paper processing market, dealing with
about 300m pieces of paper each year.
Including the Bank of England, there are 13 banks and other organisations
which are members of the cheque and credit clearing committee. Some of these
 -such as Co-op Bank - have relatively small shares of the market, and may
seek similar deals.
Mr Iain Davidson, head of financial services at Unisys, said he expected the
number of clearers to fall to about five or six by the year 2000.
Mr Terry Thomas, Co-op Bank managing director, said the new venture
represented a way of being able to stabilise unit costs by increasing the
volumes of paper processed.
Mr Thomas said pressure on unit costs was such that for the next three or
four years, even with increased volumes, it would be necessary to hold
prices to third parties near existing levels. Only after that might it be
possible to reduce prices.
The initial contract between Co-op Bank and Unisys is for 10 years. The
switch to the new operation is likely to take place in November.
The change should not have any direct impact on customers, and Co-op Bank
will still be a member of the clearing system.

FT  16 SEP 94 / South Wales region attracts most pit bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal's south Wales region emerged yesterday as its most popular bid
target as government advisers announced that 18 companies had submitted
tenders for the corporation's mining assets to be privatised later this
year.
Although NM Rothschild, which is advising the government, would not reveal
the identity or targets of the bidders, seven companies said they had
submitted tenders for south Wales. Bids had to be in by Wednesday afternoon
to be considered. Four companies said they had bid for the central north
region and three each for the north-east and central south regions of
England and Scotland.
The number of bidders for each region may be higher, however. Five of the 18
companies which have bid have not made their intentions public.
Aberthaw Mining, a company created by former BP Coal managers, emerged
yesterday as one of the few bidders whose identity had previously been
undisclosed.
It said it had tendered for south Wales.
The 18 bidders come from a group of 25 which 'pre-qualified' to bid this
summer. Potential bidders which have decided against submitting tenders
include RTZ, the mining conglomerate; National Power and PowerGen, the
electricity generators; Banks and Law Mining, both coal companies; and AMEC,
the construction company.
Two pre-qualifiers, CP Holdings and Taylor Woodrow, confirmed yesterday that
they had made bids. Kier Mining and Rackwood, both coal companies which
pre-qualified, were not available for comment.
Some of the bidders have put in tenders for one or more of the seven pits
closed by British Coal this year and offered for sale separately. Caledonian
Mining has put in a tender for Tower pit in south Wales, which is not part
of the package on offer.
Dr Keith Palmer, a managing director of Rothschild, said he had expected
strong interest for the regions and collieries and this had been confirmed.
He said: 'The quality as well as the number of bids is very positive.' The
intention was to announce preferred bidders next month and to complete sales
later this year.
The confirmed bidders are:
South Wales: Aberthaw Mining, Caledonian Mining, NSM, RJB Mining, Celtic
Coal, Ryan Group and Wimpey/Powell Duffryn.
Central North: Coal Investments/UDM, Northern Coal, RJB and English Coal.
Central South: Coal Investments/UDM, RJB and English Coal.
North East England: RJB, Ryan/Alcan and English Coal.
Scotland: Mining (Scotland), RJB and ScotCoal.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Blair ignores attack by Heseltine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, launched a
wide-ranging attack on Mr Tony Blair's inexperience yesterday, only to be
ignored by the Labour leader.
As politicians on all sides pondered opinion poll findings that Labour's
popularity is declining, Mr Heseltine dismissed Mr Blair as 'irresponsible,
young and inexperienced'.
Speaking on BBC radio Mr Heseltine added: 'Why should you believe a man who
has got all the major judgments wrong in the first half of his life, when he
tells you he is going to get them all right in the second half of his life?'
He listed adherence to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and opposition
to union reform, privatisation, low taxes and low inflation among Blair
misjudgements.
Labour said that Mr Blair was aware of the attack but had 'not mentioned it
to anyone'.
Mr Blair yesterday told the first full shadow cabinet meeting since his
election in June that private polling for the party supported an ICM poll in
the Guardian showing Labour only 12 points ahead of the Conservatives,
compared with 21 points in early August.
He said the polling evidence reinforced his view that Labour would have to
work hard to convert Tory unpopularity into Labour votes at the next
election. 'We have a great opportunity to win that election, but we cannot
rely on the Tories to win that election for us,' he said. 'We will win by
offering the country a clear message, and in particular a clear economic
alternative.'
Ironically, Mr Heseltine's attack was followed by a cabinet decision to
concentrate on positive presentation of government policies rather than
attacks on the opposition.
After a detailed discussion of its political strategy the cabinet agreed
that the focus of this month's party conference should be on promoting the
government's achievements and setting out its agenda for the second half of
the parliament.
Ministers said that the fundamental objective was to restore a sense of
stability after two years of almost permanent political turmoil.

FT  16 SEP 94 / M-way toll trials soon: 'Enormous' contract triggers
responses from 29 consortia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty-nine consortia representing more than 70 companies from around the
world have responded to the government's call for proposals for an
electronic tolling system for Britain's motorways.
Most proposals would involve gantries to read units fitted in vehicles.
Others would depend on the satellite tracking of vehicle movements, Mr John
Watts, roads minister, said yesterday.
The government hopes to introduce tolls on the 1,900-mile motorway network
by 1998. Charging cars 1.5p a mile and trucks 4.5p would raise Pounds 700m a
year for road improvements.
The proposed systems will be evaluated in the next four months with the aim
of running trials on a test track and on motorways next year. The government
will then draw up a technical specification of the system it wants and put
the contract out to tender in spring 1996.
Mr Watts said: 'Any contract we let would be enormous. We want to develop a
specification which can be sold around the world.'
It is likely that the contract would be let to more than one consortium
because of its size. One option under consideration is for the winning
companies not to be paid on completion but for them to recoup their outlay
from tolls.
Mr Watts denied that the government had ignored criticisms in a report by
the Conservative-dominated Commons transport committee which was published
last month.
The MPs said the government's arguments for tolls were unconvincing and
suggested an increase in fuel duty would be easier and cheaper to collect.
Mr Watts said the government was considering its response but had to
continue with its preparations.
Proposals had come from companies in Europe, the Far East and North America,
but nearly all of the consortia had a British member. Well over half of the
consortia had a strong base in the UK, sometimes through foreign ownership
of British companies.
Twenty-four of the systems proposed would involve a monitor mounted on a
gantry identifying and charging vehicles passing underneath. Most of these
systems depend on microwave links, but two use infra-red and one a laser.
These systems could debit a 'smart card' or record a vehicle for billing
later.
Three companies have proposed satellite-based systems which would debit a
smart card and would not require roadside gantries.
Among companies which have put forward proposals are Unipass, a UK company;
a group comprising News Datacom (UK) and CSEE Peage of France; and a
consortium consisting of British Telecommunications and AT/Comm, a US
manufacturer. Racal Radio, part of Racal Electronics, has devised a
number-plate recognition system.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Labour woos small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday stepped up its drive to win the support of small business
with the release of a comprehensive package of financing and development
proposals.
The launch of the proposals at Westminster reflects growing contacts between
Labour and small business as the party seeks to exploit dis-illusionment
with the government.
It follows an initiative begun under former leader John Smith and a regional
tour last year by Labour's trade and industry team led by Mr Robin Cook.
Mr Derek Fatchett, industry spokesman, said the Conservatives had taken the
traditional loyalty of small business for granted.
He said: 'The last five years have seen over 200,000 businesses driven into
bankruptcy, debt levels rise to record levels, good new ideas starved of
financial support and thousands of dreams shattered.
'It is little wonder that support for the Conservatives among the small
business community is lower than at any other point and has more than halved
in the last 10 years.'
The package of policies includes the establishment of a business development
bank to provide long-term finance for small businesses, pressure on large
companies and public agencies to pay debts more quickly, and a legal right
to interest on late payments.
The party promises a moratorium law to give financially troubled small
companies a breathing space before bankruptcy action, and tax changes to
encourage greater reinvestment of profits.
There would be a network of regional development agencies for small
companies, and public procurement policies would be reviewed to encourage
the development of high-tech small and medium-size enterprises.
The proposals, most of which have been aired by Labour in the past 18
months, were given a cautious welcome by Mr Ian Handford, policy unit
chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses.
Mr Handford said small-business people were not 'natural Labour voters'. He
said Labour was 'looking at a sector which they haven't looked at before'.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Sizewell B gains loading approval
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nuclear Electric, the state-owned generator, was yesterday given approval by
the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate to load uranium fuel into Sizewell B,
Britain's first pressurised-water reactor nuclear power station. Permission
was granted by the inspectorate after safety checks.
Loading of fuel into the plant, which was built within its Pounds 2.03bn
budget, is expected to start today and be completed by the end of next week.
Start-up of the reactor is unlikely before December, however, because of
delay in obtaining an authorisation to discharge radioactivity into the
environment from the Inspectorate of Pollution.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Penalty on BCCI loss ruled out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The two Western Isles council officials who were held responsible for losing
Pounds 24m in the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International in
1991 are not to be surcharged, Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, has decided.
He ruled that surcharging the two men - making them pay a financial penalty
for their errors - would not be appropriate.
The two officials are Mr Donald MacLeod, who was director of finance for the
council, and his deputy Mr Brian Lawrie. Mr MacLeod was dismissed by the
council and Mr Lawrie left it shortly before the BCCI crash to become
director of finance at North East Fife district council.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Loans chief convicted of fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The former chairman of Castlegate Securities, a Reading-based loan
management company, was yesterday convicted of fraudulently mishandling the
funds of investors who lost Pounds 35m, John Mason writes.
A jury at Oxford crown court found Mr Roy Wharton guilty of two charges of
fraudulent trading after a three-month trial brought by the Serious Fraud
Office.
The court heard how Castlegate grew from a small unsecured lending business
into a group of companies managing secured loans totalling almost Pounds 44m
by the time they were liquidated in December 1990.
Institutional and private investors provided the backing for the group, but
it was the private investors, mainly retired and elderly people, who bore
the brunt of the Pounds 35m losses when Castlegate collapsed. Many lost
their savings and some their homes.
Investors had been assured that Castlegate would make up any shortfall
suffered by one of its subsidiaries. But all assurances from the company
proved false. Mr Wharton's speculative lending strategy meant that the
companies bore the brunt of the risk while he reaped the financial benefits.
The prosecution at his trial described his method as 'a sophisticated game
of pass-the-parcel'.
To keep Castlegate afloat Mr Wharton falsely inflated the values of
properties under his control to expand his lending. He was remanded in
custody until sentencing on October 7.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Improved GMTV avoids sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Television Commission decided yesterday not to impose
sanctions on GMTV, the commercial television breakfast station, because
there had been a 'demonstrable improvement' in its service.
The ITC had warned that unless there was an improvement by this month formal
sanctions might be imposed, which could include fines.
As part of its review of GMTV's first year on air the ITC had judged its
performance to have been unsatisfactory. The commission said there had been
significant shortfalls in the required amount of news, current affairs and
children's information. There was also concern about the quality of some
programming.
GMTV is owned by Granada, Carlton Communications, the Guardian Media Group,
Scottish Television and the Walt Disney Company.
Following the introduction in February of an early morning news programme
produced by Reuters and the addition of other current affairs output, the
ITC said yesterday it was satisfied that the company was meeting licence
requirements.
It added: 'Despite these improvements, the commission will be looking for
further evidence of sustained quality in GMTV's children's programmes during
the remainder of the year.'

Her statement, made in evidence to the School Teachers' Review Body, the

The traditionally moderate Association of Teachers and Lecturers also

The department's evidence made no recommendations on the overall level of

points.
Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the ATL, which called for a 6 per cent

FT  16 SEP 94 / Workers' benefits at risk, says union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thousands of building industry workers face losing personal pension tax
benefits as a result of an Inland Revenue ruling, the GMB general union said
yesterday.
It has asked the Revenue to drop its insistence that one aspect of a scheme
set up to enable itinerant construction workers to secure paid holidays
amounts to a pension scheme.
The Revenue stance means that personal pensions contracts taken out by
members of the holiday scheme are invalid.
This is because the holidays scheme also makes a small lump sum payment on
retirement. Last year 8,200 retiring workers received Pounds 1,637 each. The
Revenue is classifying these payments as primary occupational pensions.
One member, Mr Thomas Healey, had his personal pension plan with Legal and
General cancelled and his contributions returned with no accumulated
interest and a tax demand for Pounds 1,637. He had paid Pounds 4,500 into
the L&amp;G plan since taking it out in 1988.
Mr Paul Kenny, the GMB's London regional secretary, said: 'Thousands of
people are blissfully unaware that they are caught in this trap.'
Mr Reg Steer, the scheme company secretary, said it had informed employers
of the position, most recently in July after a number of people had run into
problems.
He said: 'We do ask the employers to pass on the information to the
employees and as far as I'm aware nearly all of them do but there must be
some that don't'
Legal and General said last night that it would investigate Mr Healey's
case.
The Inland Revenue said that there had been no sudden ruling on the matter.
'The people that were running the scheme have always known the position we
take on the payment,' it said.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Engineering industry shows surge in output and orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Engineering is showing a strong upward trend in output levels, new orders
and capital investment although employment levels remain flat, the
Engineering Employers' Federation said yesterday.
The federation warns in its Budget submission, however, that in spite of the
recovery, the industry still needs policy support. The federation recommends
changes to the rules on corporation and capital gains taxes in order to
boost investment.
In a new business trends survey of 1,700 of the federation's members
throughout its 13 regional associations, the EEF aims to give a 'quick and
up-to-date' picture of the industry's fortunes to complement the
government's more detailed statistics.
In the three months to September the federation found growth rates in output
and new orders were comparable to those last seen in 1987 and 1988. Just
more than half of respondents said output had risen in the three months,
while 13 per cent said it had fallen. On new orders, 52 per cent of
companies reported an increase while 18 per cent reported a decrease.
The bulk of the companies surveyed - 61 per cent - reported unchanged
capital investment plans. But 31 per cent reported plans to increase
investment while only 8 per cent expected cuts.
The survey found 49 per cent of companies were not changing their employment
levels, with 32 per cent indicating an increase of employees, and 19 per
cent reporting a decrease.
However, the federation said companies reducing employment were primarily
bigger ones while companies that were increasing staff were mainly small
businesses.
In its Budget submission the federation asks for an inflation indexation of
existing capital allowances for plant and machinery, and 100 per cent
capital allowances for the initial annual Pounds 200,000 of plant and
machinery investment.
It is also requesting a tapered rate of capital gains tax and a low rate of
taxation on capital gains on assets held for six years or longer.

FT  16 SEP 94 / The spirit of glasnost reaches the Highlands: Local
Enterprise Companies are trying a policy of openness in handing out grants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The West Highland Free Press, a weekly newspaper, reported recently that Mrs
Jean Threlfall of Ardvasar in Skye had been given a grant of Pounds 400 for
her business breeding Skye terriers. The money was spent on new kennels.
Last month the paper recorded that the fish processor Johnston Seafayre of
Stornoway, Lewis, had been granted Pounds 42,000 for working capital, and
that Lady Clare Macdonald, the Skye hotelier and cookery writer, had been
given Pounds 4,500 to expand her cookery demonstration business.
These and countless other modest pieces of news have been appearing
regularly in newspapers in northern Scotland since April, when the 10 Local
Enterprise Companies (Lecs) which have been operating in the area for three
years adopted a policy of almost total disclosure of their activities.
No longer can the Highland Lecs, the employer-led economic development
bodies, cite 'commercial confidentiality' as a reason for keeping most
transactions secret, unless the release of information would harm a
company's competitive position.
Each month the Lecs produce a list of businesses and people to whom they
have given grants, even down to individuals receiving training grants, and
newspapers are free to publish it.
The policy, called 'accountability through openness', was introduced by the
Lecs and their parent body, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, in response to
criticism that the Lecs were unaccountable to the people they served.
The same claim is made about the Lecs reporting to Scottish Enterprise in
the Lowlands, as well as about the Training and Enterprise Councils, which
deliver government training schemes in England and Wales and have a
development role.
Critics, notably in the Labour party, argue that none of the people on the
boards of Lecs or Tecs has had to face democratic election, and that they
use the 'figleaf' of commercial confidentiality to conceal what they are
doing.
In Scotland there is a widespread perception that the Lecs, with their
boards largely composed of businessmen, are a kind of old boy's club,
occasionally handing out public money in grants and loans to businesses
which involve the directors themselves. Lecs certainly do have dealings with
companies run by their directors, but such transactions are governed by
strict rules.
However, the problem of conflicts of interest is particularly acute in the
Highlands because most Lecs cover areas with only a few thousand
inhabitants.
High-profile local businessmen sit on the boards of their Lecs and some also
have commercial dealings with them, although these must be arranged at arm's
length and declared in the Lec's annual report.
HIE acknowledges that 'it has taken time to gain local support for the
Lecs', but points out that the network has suffered 'no instance whatsoever
of misdealing involving Lec directors'.
As it is unable to do anything about its structure, which is accountable to
parliament through the Scottish secretary, it is trying to achieve broader
accountability by being open about its activities.
Caithness and Sutherland Enterprise started its own glasnost six months
before the policy was adopted by the rest of the network. It produces a
10-page monthly overview and a full list of grants.
Mr Neil Money, deputy chief executive, said: 'What we wanted was make people
aware of what we do. We tell people when they apply for grants their names
will be published, though we say we'll withhold them for a time if it's
commercially sensitive.
'There's no evidence that people have been put off from applying. In fact
the reverse is the case. People have come to us because they have discovered
grants are available.'
Mr Iain Robertson, chief executive of HIE, believes that the openness policy
is assisting economic development. He said: 'People look at the lists and
they read what's going on in their areas, they get ideas and they come to us
for help. It's opening up the Highlands.'
But although Mr Henry McLeish, deputy shadow Scottish secretary, says that
'in principle' he would favour the same openness policy being adopted by
Lecs in the Lowlands, Scottish Enterprise says the idea is 'not
appropriate'.
It points out that a large part of the activity of the Highland Lecs
consists of handing out relatively small grants, many of them only available
to people and businesses in the region because of its special needs.
This type of activity, they say, makes up only a tiny fraction of the
activity of Lecs in lowland Scotland, which are mainly involved in
large-scale training, and in striking agreements with private-sector
companies in areas such as property development, the creation of new
products, and attracting investors. In those cases it believes commercial
confidentiality is usually essential.
Mr Des Bonnar, chief executive of Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise, said:
'It's a question of balancing transparency with effectiveness and acting as
reliable partners of private sector companies.
'Would you do a deal with a company which told you that the transaction
would automatically be in the public domain by the end of the month?'
For Mr McLeish, the attitude of Scottish Enterprise typifies 'a culture of
secrecy which is bringing it more criticism than it actually deserves'.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Warning on repossession of homes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many of the 300,000-plus households with arrears of six months or more on
their mortgages are running up increasing debts which could lead to a rise
in the number of homes being repossessed, according to a study published
today, Alison Smith writes.
The paper, which comes from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, suggests that
the concessionary payment schemes which were offered to a higher proportion
of borrowers during the early 1990s can mean that repossession is postponed
rather than avoided.
It says the levels of repossession among borrowers who are taking part in
concessionary schemes may rise if they cannot increase the amount they are
paying in a way that satisfies mortgage lenders.
Possessions have dropped from a peak of 75,450 in 1991 to about 25,000 in
the first half of this year.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Food sales outstrip other sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain is enjoying a well-fed economic recovery.
Yesterday's announcement of a surprise 0.3 per cent fall in retail sales
volumes between July and August attracted attention in financial markets.
But more detailed, seasonally adjusted figures from the Central Statistical
Office showed mixed fortunes among different categories of retail outlet.
On the basis of three-month figures, which the government considers a better
guide to trends, sales by food retailers far outstripped those of other
types of retailer and the retail sector as a whole.
The Central Statistical Office reported that food retailers increased their
sales volumes by a seasonally adjusted 1.5 per cent between June and August
compared with the previous three months. Sales volumes of mixed businesses
such as department stores and mail order houses were 0.3 per cent higher and
specialist non-food retailers 0.1 per cent lower.
Compared with June to August last year volume sales rose 5.4 per cent in the
case of food retailers, more than twice the 2.5 per cent year-on-year growth
of mixed retail businesses and three times the 1.8 per cent annual sales
growth of non-food retailers.
Clothing and footwear merchants fared best among the non-food retailers,
boosting their volume sales 1.1 per cent in the latest three months compared
with March to May and 4.8 per cent compared with June to August last year.
Retailers of household goods reported a 0.1 per cent fall in volume sales in
the latest three months but growth of 3.4 per cent over the year. The CSO
said that other non-food retailers such as jewellers, chemists, tobacconists
and booksellers suffered an overall fall of 0.9 per cent in sales volumes in
the latest three months and a 1.9 per cent fall compared with June to August
last year.
The retail sector as a whole expanded its volume sales by 0.6 per cent
between June and August compared with March to May and 3.3 per cent compared
with the three months to the end of August last year.
The Retail Consortium, which says it represents 90 per cent of the retail
industry, reported strong year-on-year growth in sales of fresh produce,
poultry and fish in August.

the one hand the government demands more effort from already overloaded
teachers, while on the other hand there is no reward for hard work and

Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said:
'By refusing to consider ways of reducing teachers' workload the government
is undermining its own stated aim of improved pupil performance.'

The public-sector pay bill for this year is likely to rise by at least 2 per
cent in spite of the government's desire for a freeze, says a leading pay
analyst.
Mr Chris Trinder, research director of the Public Finance Foundation, said
large areas of the public sector, particularly education, were likely to
have significant overruns.
His comments follow confirmation by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, of
the government's desire for a further year's freezing of the public-sector
pay bill.
Mr Clarke, in his written submission to the pay review bodies, which cover
about 1.4m of the 5m public-sector workers, indirectly criticised last
year's relatively high pay review body settlements. He said: 'The government
remains concerned that cumulatively over the years review body settlements
have more than matched most other public-sector groups.'
Yet the submission also stressed flexibility. 'Recommendations should take
account of the particular circumstances of each group and the need to
promote the development of performance pay and other flexibilities as
appropriate,' he said.
Mr Trinder said yesterday that the public-sector pay bill rose 1 per cent
last year in spite of the fact that pay rises were limited to 1.5 per cent
and 327,000 jobs were shed.
This year the average pay rise in the public sector is likely to be about
2.5 per cent and job losses are likely to be considerably below last year's
figure. Mr Trinder said: 'That means it is almost certain that the increase
in the pay bill will be well above last year's'
The government has relaxed its original ban on cross-subsidising pay bill
increases from general running costs, which means that the pay bill overrun
is likely to hit services. About 58 per cent of public-sector running costs
are wages.
Mr Trinder said the public-sector pay bill freeze appeared to be becoming
more rather than less flexible. He also warned that a growing divergence
between public and private-sector pay could create recruitment problems in
the public sector. Last year, when the public-sector pay bill rose only 1
per cent, the private-sector pay bill rose 3.9 per cent.
Real wage growth - on top of inflation - averaged 1.4 per cent during the
1993-94 pay round, covering both the public and private sector. That was
lower than the 2.2 per cent for 1992-1993 but higher than the 1.25 per cent
average of the previous three years.
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, yesterday
accused the government of picking on public-sector workers.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Machine tool sales rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of machine tools in the UK in the three months to July rose 12.1 per
cent from the previous quarter, according to Central Statistical Office
figures, Andrew Baxter writes.
Most of this year's steady rise in sales has been due to exports, but
yesterday's figures show a strengthening home market.
Total sales rose 14.1 per cent
with exports up 17.5 per cent according to figures, which are seasonally
adjusted and based on constant 1990 prices.
On an unadjusted basis, at current prices, total sales rose 22.5 per cent
from last year to a monthly average of Pounds 82.4m and UK sales rose 29.2
per cent. Total orders are down 23.2 per cent on last year at about Pounds
214m, but new orders are rising.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Penalty over BCCI loss ruled out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The two Western Isles council officials who were held responsible for losing
Pounds 24m in the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International in
1991 are not to be surcharged, Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, has decided.
He ruled that surcharging the two men - making them pay a financial penalty
for their errors - would not be appropriate in the particular circumstances
of the case.
The two officials are Mr Donald MacLeod, who was director of finance for the
council, and his deputy Mr Brian Lawrie. Mr MacLeod was dismissed by the
council while Mr Lawrie left it shortly before the BCCI crash to become
director of finance at North East Fife district council.
The Commission for Local Authority Accounts, the equivalent in Scotland of
the Audit Commission, recommended that they pay the council 'an amount
considered to be appropriate recognising that any sum to be paid can
represent only a nominal proportion of the loss'.
Mr Lawrie, who was subsequently sacked by North East Fife district council
and then reinstated, had sought judicial review of the commission's decision
but the case was dismissed last month.

Thousands of highly-paid jobs in the information technology sector are
proving difficult to fill following a surge in IT investment by UK
companies, says Visit, a leading recruitment agency.
Visit, which is organising a recruitment event at Olympia, west London, says
exhibitors are seeking to fill more than 1,500 vacancies for jobs paying
between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 50,000.
It says that the recruitment position has changed quite suddenly in the past
three months and is radically different from last year.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Company chiefs on shorter contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The service contracts of chief executives are getting shorter, according to
a survey of senior managers' pay and conditions, Vanessa Houlder writes.
Monks Partnership, the remumeration advisers, found that the percentage of
chief executives of parent companies with contracts of three years or longer
had fallen from 63 per cent to 55 per cent in the past year. At subsidiary
board level fewer than 10 per cent of managing directors or general managers
had three-year contracts.
The shorter-term nature of the contracts reflects criticism of long-term
contracts by institutional investors.
The total earnings of UK directors rose an average 8 per cent this year
compared with 5.8 per cent last year. Much of the increase was the result of
larger bonuses.

FT  16 SEP 94 / ITC to readvertise licence for Channel 5
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Television Commission yesterday took a formal decision to
readvertise a licence for Channel 5, a new terrestrial television channel.
A number of corporations have expressed interest in bidding for what some
see as the last important broadcasting opportunity using existing technology
in a large European market.
The commission said it could not give precise figures for Channel 5's
population coverage since the government had decided to reserve channel 35 -
one of two channels designated for Channel 5 - to the further development of
digital terrestrial television.
The effect of the government decision was to reduce the minimum coverage for
Channel 5 from 74 per cent to 52 per cent of the population.
However, with additional frequencies identified by ITC engineers this could
rise to a maximum of about 70 per cent. The new frequencies will need
national and international clearances. In addition digital simultaneous
broadcasting could increase coverage further to between 80 per cent and 95
per cent. Applicants will have to submit a business plan for the maximum
potential coverage. They will then have to provide plans for lower possible
coverage - 60 per cent or even 52 per cent.
Possible applicants are CanWest, which is backed by large quoted British
companies, the Virgin Group, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees television, NBC and a group
linking Time Warner, MAI and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times.
The licence, to be awarded by competitive tender, will be advertised on
November 1 with a closing date six months later. This would imply that
Channel 5 would not launch until well into 1996.
When the ITC first advertised the licence in April 1992 there was little
interest and the one applicant - a Thames Television consortium - was
rejected mainly because of poor investor commitment.

FT  16 SEP 94 / MoD advertises for merchant bank help on homes sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence has advertised for a merchant bank to help overcome
problems dogging its scheme to transfer servicemen's quarters to the private
sector.
The MoD faces a Pounds 500m gap in its 1995-96 budget unless the 68,000
homes can be transferred to a non-profit housing trust next year. The
advertisement, which appears in the Official Journal of the European
Communities, admits for the first time that the scheme has fallen behind
schedule.
Only a week is given for submission of applications to be on the tender
list, an abnormally short deadline under European Union public procurement
rules. The advertisement says: 'Urgency, consequential upon a change in
project direction, has rendered impractical the standard timescale.'
Yesterday the MoD said that, while the scheme had 'hit some snags', it
expected to achieve the objectives of raising cash from the transfer and
improving the quarters within the original timescale.
Under the scheme the married quarters were to have been transferred to a
trust under 30-year leases. The trust would be independent of the MoD, but
would contract to provide it with accommodation and improve its quality.
Capital for the deal would be raised in the City secured against future
rent.
Although potential investors have expressed interest in the scheme, there
have been concerns about details. These include worries about the location
of many of the homes away from towns and in secure areas, which would make
it hard to sell or rent them if they were not needed by the armed forces.
The Treasury has objected to the scheme as little more than creative
accounting. It wants the trust to be more independent of the MoD and to own
the homes outright, borrowing against the security of the property in the
same way as other housing associations.
The advertisement says that the MoD is considering a trade sale as well as a
long lease.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Small firms targeted by new BT rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Energis, the UK's third long-distance telecommunications network, will
target small and medium-sized businesses when it launches later this month,
promising to undercut British Telecommunication's prices and provide a new
range of services.
The company, a subsidiary of National Grid, has built a network of 3,500 km
using the grid's pylons. It claims its network is more modern, and its
overheads far lower, than those of the two existing long-distance operators
 -BT and Mercury.
The launch of Energis will greatly intensify competition in UK
telecommunications, particularly at the lower end of the business market
where Mercury has made far less headway against BT than in the large
corporate sector. Users with as few as four lines will be approached by the
Energis sales force.
Energis intends to guarantee a saving of 10 per cent over BT prices -
including volume discounts - to all users. Mercury also trades on lower
prices than BT's, but its differential in parts of the business market is
well below 10 per cent.
Energis has signed a preferred supplier agreement with Colt, a US-owned
telecoms operator building a network in central London, which will give it
access to large businesses in the City. Colt, which already connects 170
City sites, will use Energis for most of its long-distance traffic, while
Energis will use Colt for its City traffic.
Energis will offer customers an innovative 'telecoms management' service,
giving them a month-by-month breakdown of calls made to their premises,
including the proportion of calls unanswered and the average time before
calls are answered, broken down into periods of the day.
It says that no such service is available in the UK, and believes it will
prove popular with organisations keen to track their efficiency in dealing
with telephone queries.
Mr David Dey, Energis chief executive and formerly a senior BT executive,
said: 'Obviously we have to trade on price, but we will also be offering a
range of new services.'
In the residential sector Energis will focus on users with quarterly bills
of more than Pounds 100, offering subscribers a 'smart socket' enabling them
to use the Energis network without changing their phone or dialling a
prefix. Subscribers will pay an annual fee of Pounds 12.
Mr Dey said BT, which has an 85 per cent share of the UK telecoms market,
was Energis's main target. But it would also be competing strongly with
Mercury.

FT  16 SEP 94 / No. 10 remains wary of ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday said it needed more evidence that the IRA ceasefire
was permanent but acknowledged that it had been encouraged by progress in
the two weeks since the ceasefire was declared.
As pressure continued to mount on London to depart from its cautious stance,
Downing Street said that there was a continuing need to 'be clear that the
IRA's violence had ended for good'. It said ministers would 'keep the
situation under close review'.
The comments followed the first full meeting of the cabinet since July, at
which ministers were briefed on the Ulster situation by Sir Patrick Mayhew,
Northern Ireland secretary. Mr John Major is expected to visit the province
soon.
Meanwhile Mr Andrew Hunter, the pro-unionist chairman of the Tory backbench
Northern Ireland committee, last night fuelled speculation that the
six-year-old broadcasting ban on representatives of Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing, might be lifted. He said: 'The time may soon come when it is
right to lift the ban.' Ministers are thought to have agreed in principle
that the ban should go.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, urged London to accept the IRA
ceasefire as permanent 'as soon as they can', warning that any delay might
be used by loyalist paramilitaries as an excuse for violence. But he
accepted that the timing of the decision had to be taken by London 'and they
have to bring the unionist population with them'.
Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, accused Mr Major of 'trawling around
for excuses not to get involved'.
Britain has promised to start talks on how to admit Sinn Fein into the
political process within three months of a permanent end to violence.
A poll for The Guardian by ICM published today showed that only 13 per cent
of those questioned believed the violence would cease for good.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Latin American trade gap to widen further this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Latin America's trade deficit will widen further this year as growth of
imports outpaces export expansion, the UN Economic Commission for Latin
America and the Caribbean (Eclac) says today.
Publishing preliminary estimates of the performance of Latin American
economies, Eclac said it expected the region's exports to grow by 9 per cent
this year, with growth mainly due to the recovery in prices of primary
exports, which had fallen for five successive years.
However, the recent tendency for imports to grow at a faster rate continued:
this year imports are expected to grow by 12 per cent, leaving a widening
trade deficit.
Higher US interest rates have also increased the sums paid out by Latin
countries in interest and profit remittances.
These payments are expected to rise from Dollars 31bn to Dollars 34bn, which
will produce a regional current account deficit likely to widen from last
year's Dollars 45bn to around Dollars 53bn (Pounds 34bn) this year.
However, amounts of foreign capital approaching the record levels of the
previous two years - an estimated Dollars 55bn - will continue to flow into
the region to finance this deficit.
Although the number of Latin bond issues has fallen this year because of
political instability, other types of capital inflow - in particular, direct
investment and foreign share issues - should nearly compensate, the agency
said.
Foreign debt for the region is likely to rise in nominal terms by 4-5 per
cent from last year's Dollars 497bn. However, because of export expansion,
the ratio of debt to exports should drop from 300 per cent in 1993 to 285
per cent this year.
The region will continue to grow 'moderately' in 1994, with average growth
rates of just above 3 per cent, the preliminary estimates suggest. To judge
from first-half data, Peru is expected to be the most dynamic regional
economy this year, with growth of about 8 per cent, followed by Argentina at
6-7 per cent. Bolivia, Chile, Colombia and Costa Rica are all expected to
boost gross domestic product by between 4 and 5 per cent.
Regional laggards include Honduras and Haiti, both expected to record
negative growth. Venezuela, which is battling a financial crisis, is singled
out as the worst performer, with a likely fall in GDP of 4.5 per cent.
Although Mexican GDP is expected to rise by only 2 per cent this year, the
result is seen as positive in view of last year's near-zero growth. The
start-up of the tripartite North American Trade Agreement, the improvement
of the US economy and the depreciation of the peso are noted as contributing
to the improved performance.
In spite of the generally encouraging regional performance, Eclac cautions
that 'in the majority of countries, investment ratios are not sufficient to
sustain faster growth in the long term'. Chile, with an investment rate
above 27 per cent, is one of the principal exceptions.
Eclac points out that, because of expanding populations, per capita growth
throughout Latin America will average only 1 per cent.
The first half also saw 'new progress' in the reduction of inflation, which
Eclac describes as 'one of the most important achievements in Latin America
of the last decade'. Regional inflation, which averaged 49 per cent in 1991,
was down to 16.5 per cent for the 12 months to August. Argentina, Bolivia,
El Salvador, Mexico and Panama are all expected to record single-digit
inflation this year.
The fate of Brazilian inflation, which reached 2,500 per cent last year,
hinges on the success or otherwise of the recently introduced Real currency.
Venezuela is again seen as going in the wrong direction - the 12-month
inflation rate to August was 68 per cent, compared with 46 per cent at the
end of 1993.

The Cayman Islands is facing a crisis over the British colony's inability to

territory's stability could be harmed by refugees' reaction to a plan to
repatriate them, according to government officials, Canute James reports
from Kingston.
Britain has sent hundreds of camp beds to the islands, where the
administration is awaiting security assistance from the US to deal with the
refugees. The leader of a Cuban-American group is asking the British

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US business inventories grew more slowly in July than expected, offering
some evidence that the economy may be moving to a slower pace of growth
without an abrupt downturn in output, George Graham writes from Washington.
The Commerce Department said inventories rose by 0.3 per cent in July, the
fourth month of increase in succession but a much slower rate than the
average 0.7 per cent a month recorded in the second quarter. Most financial
market economists had predicted they would continue at that rate.
Although businesses have been increasing stockpiles this year,
inventory-to-sales ratios have been very low. In July, inventories rose to
represent 1.42 months of sales, still a level at which retail sales would be
expected to feed through into new orders.
At the same time, a regional survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia showed manufacturing activity continuing to expand this month,
despite some signs of weakening in shorter delivery times and lower unfilled
orders.

An important barrier between Peru and its commercial banking creditors may
be lifted soon. A congressional commission investigating a long-standing
government debt with Chemical Bank and American Express Bank has recommended
it should be recognised and, by implication, settled.
The controversial debt is small in money terms - some Dollars 36m principal,
now worth perhaps twice that with unpaid interest - but large in political
significance. It arose in 1981 when the state shipping line CPV bought two
cargo ships which proved virtually unusuable. Chemical and American Express
financed the purchase under a leasing agreement.
Alleging irregularities, President Alan Garcia's 1985-90 government refused
to recognise the debt, a position initially assumed by current President
Alberto Fujimori. But the Citibank-led advisory committee which represents
some of the biggest of Peru's more than 200 commercial banking creditors,
has insisted the debt be settled before negotiations are opened.
The commission found 'no evidence that the entities which financed the
operation acted irregularly'. Blame was laid at the doors of CPV officials
and former ministers.
Peru's congress still has to ratify the commission's recommendation. But,
assuming the government majority has its way and the administration then
accepts the decision to pay, long-delayed renegotiations over Peru's Dollars
7bn debt with the commercial banks should soon be under way.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Mexicans plan talks on political reforms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Mexican government and the country's main political parties are close to
starting talks aimed at further political reform and paving the way for a
smooth transition to power by Mr Ernesto Zedillo, victor in last month's
presidential elections.
Legislators from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI),
National Action party (PAN) and Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD) agreed
yesterday that 'the time has come for the reign of mistrust to be
transformed into serious and open political negotiations.'
In a separate meeting, Mr Jorge Carpizo, the interior minister, and the six
'citizen representatives' who control the Federal Electoral Institute
resolved to push for a 'definitive' political reform that would include new
rules for elections as well as changes in the relationship between the
government and the PRI.
These moves follow statements by outgoing President Carlos Salinas welcoming
a call by the leftist PRD for a national dialogue before the country's
electoral college meets in the last two weeks in October to ratify Mr
Zedillo's electoral victory.
A government official said issues such as making the electoral authority
independent of the presidency and setting new rules for campaign spending
and media access were relatively easy to resolve and that the sticking point
was 'how to get the parties to the table'.
Setting his conditions for dialogue, Mr Zedillo said yesterday that if his
party agreed to a sweeping political reform, the opposition parties must
reciprocate by legitimising his victory in the electoral college. Mr Zedillo
hopes the PRD will recognise his victory so that after he becomes president
in December he can avoid the antagonism that has persisted between Mr
Salinas and the opposition.
The PAN and the PRD want ruling party victories in some local elections to
be overturned, notably the mayoral race in Monterrey and the gubernatorial
race in the state of Chiapas. This would be a sign that the government is
serious about political change, the parties say.
In addition, the PRD wants a clear sign that concrete mechanisms to separate
the ruling party from the state will be discussed.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Aristide backers hide as invasion looms

<TEXT>
Almost all open supporters of Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the exiled
president of Haiti, have gone into hiding, fearing they will be targets of
the country's military as the threat of a US-led military invasion to
restore the president intensifies.
The growing threat has been met with defiance by Haiti's army-backed
government. Mr Emile Jonaissant, de facto president, said late on Wednesday
neither his administration nor the military would give way. He accused
President Bill Clinton of threatening Haiti for domestic political reasons.
Mr Clinton met senior foreign policy and military advisers yesterday ahead
of his televised address to the nation over the crisis, as the weight of
much political comment continued to advise him not to take the fateful step
of authorising US troops to move in.
Officials declined comment on a New York Times report that the president
might still call off a full invasion if the leaders of the military junta
accepted a US offer of comfortable third-country exile and immunity from
prosecution.
The decision of Mr Aristide's more prominent supporters to go underground,
reported yesterday by diplomats in Port-au-Prince, the capital, follows the
murder of several in the past two years. It was encouraged by statements
from army officers last week that 'traitorous' Haitians would 'pay' in the
event of an invasion.
There is also growing fear in Port-au-Prince that the military, which
overthrew Mr Aristide three years ago, may turn its guns on the slums, in
which he has significant popular support.
Although Haiti's poorly equipped and poorly trained army of 7,000 has been
expanded by a rapid recruiting programme, it is not expected to offer much
resistance to an invading force three times larger. However, maverick
elements in the military are considered likely to hide in the slums or
countryside and begin guerrilla resistance.
The invading forces may well have the support, or at least acquiescence, of
many junior officers in the Haitian military who have in recent weeks been
meeting representatives of foreign intelligences services, mainly from the
US. They have been promised early amnesty and other unspecified 'rewards'
for not resisting the invasion.
The three leaders of the military - General Raoul Cedras, the commander of
the armed forces, General Philippe Biamby, the chief of staff, and Colonel
Michel Francois, the police chief - will be taken into custody by the
invading forces, partly for their own protection, diplomats say.
Mr Robert Malval, the prime minister who was appointed by Mr Aristide last
year under an abortive agreement to resolve the political crisis but was
sidelined by the military, will be reinstated after the invasion, and will
start preparations for the president's return.
The timing of Mr Aristide's return to Haiti will depend on the success of
'the efforts at pacification and the degree of political calm' in Haiti,
according to the envoys. Besides an increase in the frequency of military
patrols on the streets of the capital, and the use of cement-filled drums to
block roads around the military headquarters, there are few signs that the
military is preparing to defend the country against an invading force.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Wilder quits US Senate race: Decision may hit Oliver North's
hopes and let Democrat in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Wilder yesterday abruptly dropped out of the US senate race in
Virginia, thus probably reducing the chances of victory for Mr Oliver North,
the Republican candidate.
The former Democratic governor, who was running as an independent, declined
to endorse Senator Charles Robb, his long-time rival, in the November 8
election.
But his departure from the race leaves Virginia's Democrats with the
alternative of voting for Mr Robb or not at all. Had Mr Wilder stayed in,
recent polls have suggested that Democratic divisions might have been enough
to hand the race to Mr North, in spite of the presence of a second
independent candidate, Mr Marshall Coleman, a former Republican state office
holder.
Mr Wilder's decision will come as an enormous relief to the White House and
the national Democratic party, which is threatened with loss of control of
the Senate. Virginia was among the 8 to 10 endangered seats that have
threatened its 56-44 majority.
Senior Republicans, including Senator Robert Dole, have begun to rally
behind Mr North, setting aside reservations about his criminal conviction,
overturned on a legal technicality, in the Iran-Contra affair while serving
on President Ronald Reagan's national security council.
Mr Wilder's statement, quoting a well known song, said: 'I know when to hold
'em and I know when to fold 'em.' It said, in effect, that he had concluded
he could not win and that his low standing in the polls made it difficult to
generate finances for his campaign.
Two local polls this week underlined his problem. The first gave Mr Robb 33
per cent, Mr North 28 per cent, Mr Coleman 15 per cent and Mr Wilder 12 per
cent, with the balance undecided. The second had Mr North in the lead with
34 per cent, followed by Mr Robb at 31 per cent, Mr Wilder 13 per cent and
Mr Coleman 10 per cent.
There may now be some pressure on Mr Coleman to withdraw to clear the field
for the two main candidates. But his principal sponsor is Mr John Warner,
Virginia's Republican senator, whose contempt for Mr North and his
right-wing supporters is such that he persuaded Mr Coleman to run.
The Robb-Wilder feud, a feature of Virginia politics for years, was behind
Mr Wilder's decision to enter the Senate race shortly after his term as
governor expired in January. It reached fever pitch two years ago when it
was disclosed that the senator's aides had been bugging the governor's car
telephone. Subsequent admissions by Mr Robb of sexual indiscretion did
little to help his image.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain has signalled strong official encouragement for UK businesses to
invest in Cuba with an investment promotion and protection agreement. The
agreement was initialled on Wednesday by Britain's trade and technology
minister, Mr Ian Taylor. Mr Taylor yesterday referred to Cuba as 'a very
exciting market' at the end of a three-day visit, the first by a British
minister to the island in almost 20 years.
'Clearly, the potential here is very considerable,' Mr Taylor said. 'The
agreement will give confidence that Cuba is a market with which British
businesses can deal.' He had led a British business delegation in talks on
investment opportunities in air transport, construction, Cuba's sugar sector
and insurance.
Mr Taylor, clearly distancing British government policy from the US trade
and financial embargo against the island, underlined the fact that Britain
had never cut its trade links with Cuba. British exports for the first half
of this year were up 180 per cent over last year. The 1993 export total was
Pounds 14m, which was 50 per cent down from 1992. But he said many British
companies had found it difficult to do business in the past because of
Cuba's centrally-managed and highly regulated state economy.
Cuba was moving to reform its economy to adapt to world trading conditions
after the collapse of the Soviet Union, its main trading partner. 'I made it
clear that British companies would find dealing with Cuba easier the further
the reform process goes,' said Mr Taylor, who had talks with President Fidel
Castro. He said that while Cuban reforms were at an early stage, he was
assured by Mr Castro they would continue.
He noted that British companies were already operating in Cuba in oil
exploration and oil services, agrochemicals, lubricants, soap and detergent
manufacture, citrus, financial services and the sugar industry.

FT  16 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Trade in weapons harder to regulate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trade in highly sophisticated conventional weapons is increasing and
becoming harder to regulate, according to a paper published this month by
the International Institute of Strategic Studies.
The paper, written by a Canadian scholar, Mr David Mussington, says the old
restraints on the transfer of militarily sensitive technology are breaking
down, and new ones are difficult to impose.
The decline in domestic arms procurement in both the West and the former
Soviet Union after the end of the Cold War has made arms producers more
dependent on other export markets, while weakening the political case for
co-ordinated restraint, the study says.
Heightened commercial pressures mean policy-makers in the US and the main
Nato allies are becoming less likely to worry about the effects of arms
deliveries on regional stability, preferring to focus on the preservation of
a defence technology base, and the related employment issues.
The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), in its 1994
journal, said a decline in the volume of conventional arms imports is
continuing among industrialised countries but has bottomed out in the
developing world (see graphic).
However, the picture may be even more alarming than the SIPRI figures
suggest. The data understate the extent of technology transfer in the
international arms trade, Mr Mussington argues, because they fail to take
account of offsets and local production under license.
The arms industry as a whole has becoming harder to police thanks to the
emergence of a 'second tier' of producers, capable of producing intermediate
versions of the advanced countries' weapon systems. Such producers range
from traditional customers of Western arms companies, such as Turkey and
Israel, to 'rogue nations' like North Korea, whose arms exports were viewed
by the West as highly destabilising.
The second-tier producers improved their position by supplying to both Iran
and Iraq during their 10-year war, although they had to give ground in
Middle Eastern markets to the leading Western companies in the aftermath of
the 1991 Gulf conflict.
Western efforts to persuade Russia to practise self-restraint are likely to
be countered by accusations of hypocrisy, when the West is engaged in a
vigorous export drive of its own.
Heavy-handed discrimination might simply force middle-ranking countries to
develop weapon systems that were outside any international system of
regulation, the study maintains, citing the examples of South Africa and
India. It calls for second-tier producers to be drawn into a new system of
controls on the export of 'weapon-specific' technologies, which do not block
their chances of industrial development, or their access to a reasonable
supply of weaponry.

FT  16 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Japan car companies seek to make it abroad
 -High yen and trade rows spur overseas production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese vehicle manufacturing facilities in North America are regarded in
some US quarters as Trojan horses bent on promoting Japan's industrial
predominance at the expense of their US counterparts.
For their part, Japanese car makers, restrained by their natural caution and
concern for their treasured relationships at home, have at times seemed
hesitant about moving overseas.
But the announcement this week that Toyota will raise North American vehicle
output by 50 per cent in the next two years and double its engine production
there, which followed Honda's earlier revelation that it would spend Dollars
310m more on its North American operations, provides strong evidence that
the Japanese car industry wants further to expand its production abroad.
'There is no doubt that globalisation has to go on in order to keep these
guys in business and there is no doubt that plants (in Japan) will have to
be closed down,' although not immediately, says Mr Andrew Blair-Smith,
industry analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities in Tokyo.
The US, for political and economic reasons, is an obvious target for
increased Japanese manufacturing.
Not only is it a huge market that provided demand for nearly 1.4m Japanese
vehicles last year, the growing need to meet specific regional market
demands, the yen's strong rise against the dollar, mounting trade friction
and protectionist tendencies in the US all provide strong arguments for
increasing local manufacturing in North America.
The yen's appreciation has forced Japanese car makers to raise the prices of
exports to the US, making them more expensive than US-made cars. While
Japanese companies have tried to alleviate the impact of the yen's rise
through aggressive leasing programmes, their share of the US market has come
under pressure while profitability has suffered.
In announcing its annual results in the year to the end of June, Toyota
revealed that the yen's rise against the dollar had the effect of wiping off
Y160bn (Dollars 1.61bn) from operating profits.
Meanwhile, as bilateral negotiations aimed at opening Japan's market further
to foreign cars and parts remain stalled, protectionist tendencies could
gather momentum, particularly when the strength of demand in the US begins
to taper off.
On the immediate horizon is a law to be introduced in October requiring
labelling on the vehicle of the origin of parts. US negotiators have been
pressing the Japanese authorities to see to it that the Japanese industry
increases a voluntary plan to purchase more foreign car parts, and presents
a programme for increasing the number of manufacturer-affiliated dealers
willing to sell US cars in Japan.
The US has been dangling the threat of trade sanctions if no progress is
made either in vehicle or other priority trade issues by the end of this
month.
'The Japanese acceleration of US production is an attempt to get the foot
firmly in the door before the market tops out,' says Mr Blair-Smith.
At the same time, local production in the US will increase as Japanese car
makers increasingly concentrate the manufacturing of specific cars in one
global manufacturing base.
Honda, for example, only manufactures the Accord Wagon in the US, the market
for which it was intended, and imports the car back into Japan. Overall,
Japanese reverse imports from the US have increased from about 5,400 units
in 1988 to 35,000 last year, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers
Association.
The US is by no means the only region slated for greater Japanese local
production. Toyota, for example, is setting up production of passenger cars
in Turkey while Honda is expanding production in the UK.
'Japanese globalisation is going to accelerate much more rapidly in Europe
and Asia than in the US,' Mr Blair-Smith says. 'In the US they are trying to
replace exports with local production but in Europe they are trying to
increase market share.'
The greatest impact of all this expansion will be felt in Japan. Toyota
stresses it will not reduce employment in Japan even though exports from
Japan will fall 28 per cent as a result of increased North American
production.
However, vehicle exports from Japan have already fallen by more than a
quarter from a peak of 6.7m units in 1985 to just more than 5m units last
year. Domestic production, meanwhile, has fallen 17 per cent from a peak of
13.5m in 1990 to 11.2m last year.
The challenge for Japanese car makers, says Mr Yutaka Kume, chairman of
Nissan, the country's second largest vehicle maker, 'is how to re-position
Japan as a production centre in the world'.

FT  16 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Seeking (nearly) free labour with fair
trade - Washington's quest for middle ground on workers' rights abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a rare official of the Clinton Administration who does not declare
some measure of commitment to the promotion of worker rights abroad.
But courting US business and backing its export drive, particularly in
emerging markets, has recently seemed the higher priority, particularly
since President Bill Clinton 'de-linked' China's human rights policies from
the annual US renewal of its Most Favoured Nation trade status.
In setting out its position on workers' rights, the administration has
searched for middle ground. Mr Robert Reich, the US labour secretary who is
perhaps its most eloquent spokesman on the issue, told a congressional
sub-committee in June that 'as economies become increasingly interwoven with
each other, we must either actively accept some share of responsibility for
how our economic partners conduct their affairs, or else passively accept
complicity'.
Some labour practices, such as prison or slave labour and some forms of
child labour, 'simply place countries outside the community of civilised
nations', he said. While he rejected poverty as a valid pretext for
restricting union activity, he also insisted that 'it is neither fair nor
realistic to insist that labour standards within developing countries must
be identical to those in richer countries'.
The administration has pushed hard for the inclusion of labour rights in
trade negotiations. But it has earned criticism internationally,
particularly from developing countries, and scorn from both sides of the
political spectrum at home, which see the administration as trying to occupy
an unprincipled and ineffective centre.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative and a former lawyer for
migrant farm workers, pushed hard to get labour rights on the agenda of the
new World Trade Organisation, successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, but he has only won agreements to debate the issue. Republicans
and the business lobby forced him to drop labour rights from the
administration's proposed fast-track negotiating authority for future trade
negotiations. When several outraged Democrats protested, the administration
was forced to abandon the entire battle for fast-track. It was a defeat for
key foreign policy and trade initiatives in Asia and Latin America.
While the focus has been on trade and labour rights, congressional Democrats
succeeded in getting legislation passed which requires US executive
directors of the multilateral development banks to push labour's goals
through their lending. Mr Jerome Levinson, former general counsel of the
Inter-American Development Bank, has been a leading advocate of the policy.
In a recent report by the Labour-backed Economic Policy Institute, Mr
Levinson called for the elevation of worker rights to the same order of
priority as investment incentives.
The policies of the developments banks are 'indifferent at best to abuses of
worker rights in the borrowing countries', he said. 'The World Bank seems to
have a positive aversion to independent trade unions that can bargain
aggressively for their members.'
Administration officials are much milder in their endorsement of worker
rights as a lending condition. It is thought that they will not take 'a
heavy hand' on worker rights but will try to persuade borrower countries to
move towards 'normally accepted standards'.
They believe development banks can narrow the gap between rich and poor by
increasingly concentrating their efforts on social investment.
They are proud the IADB will now commit 50 per cent of its new loans to
health, education, worker retraining and other social programmes, and the
Asia Development Bank has committed 40 per cent.
But US officials are also pushing for milder lending conditions than those
that forced poor countries to throw open their import markets and slash
their spending on, among other things, health and welfare programmes.
'We know austerity isn't a substitute for adjustment,' said one official.
'We've learned that the quality of deficit reduction matters.'
The official said it would be 'terrible if the banks supported the bad guys,
the anti-union side, when a little more union power ought to be good'. He
said that unions have been 'a positive force' in the industrialised
countries but 'there are obviously dangers of labour rights being used as a
pretext for protectionism'.
Mr Levinson sees the administration's efforts as 'window dressing'. These
initiatives will not get to the core of the problem, which is economic
policies which widen the gap between rich and poor and frown on 'direct
government measures to redress poverty and income equalities'.
As far as Congress liberals are concerned the thrusting of worker rights on
to the development bank agenda is their 'opening shot' on behalf of labour.
Congressman Barney Frank, chairman of the House subcommittee which oversees
the development banks, is inviting to Washington in November key members of
parliaments from around the world. The agenda will be further reform of the
big multilateral lending institutions.

British foreign secretary Douglas Hurd wound up a 24-hour visit to Vietnam
yesterday by signing a Pounds 50m (Dollars 77.5m) mixed credit package
designed to spur British business in a country where he acknowledged British
investment had lagged behind.
'Everyone who comes here can see that Vietnam is moving very fast and we are
determined to move fast alongside Vietnam,' said Mr Hurd, the first British
foreign secretary to visit Vietnam. He singled out oil and gas, air
transport and banking as particularly promising areas.
The credit deal commits Britain to almost three times the total aid it gave
Vietnam from 1990 to 1993.
Although he admitted that France, the US, Russia and Japan were ahead in
providing Vietnam with much of its infrastructure, Mr Hurd suggested that
'historical reasons' explained much of this. He added: 'In that sense
Britain came late, but is now coming fast'.
Britain is the ninth largest investor in Vietnam, with 17 projects worth a
total of Dollars 402m. Most of the money is in the oil and gas sector.
Mr Michael Turner, chairman of Commercial Aerospace at British Aerospace and
one of eight business people accompanying Mr Hurd on the four-nation Asian
tour, said Vietnamese air traffic was growing at 36 per cent and that the
agreement would help finance the growth of Vietnam's air fleet.
He said he expected to see the delivery of 10 to 15 Airbus A320s to Vietnam
in the next 18 months. BAe, a 20 per cent shareholder in Airbus Industrie
which produces Airbus aircraft, hoped to sell smaller jets and turbo-props
for Vietnam's domestic routes, now serviced by ageing Sovet-era Tupolevs.
The nation's flag carrier, Victor Airlines, has said it needs 60 to 80 new
aircraft over the next decade, and has indicated it will buy rather than
lease them. Under the mixed credit deal, signed in principle at the Paris
Club donors' conference in December 1993, 35 per cent of the value of
British goods and services would be made available to the Vietnamese
government as a grant of aid.
The remaining 65 per cent would be financed by export credit loans
guaranteed by the Export Credit Guarantee Department (ECGD).
Although no contracts were signed by any of the eight businessmen, Hong Kong
and Shanghai Bank on Wednesday received agreement in principle to open a

Samsung, South Korea's leading electronics company, plans to produce
semiconductors and home appliances in a Dollars 500m project in China.
The Samsung electronics plants will be located at an industrial park in
Suzhou, China's fifth largest industrial city. The park itself is being
built by Samsung Engineering and Construction in a joint venture with the
state-owned Keppel Group of Singapore.
The announcement is the latest in a number of investment projects in China
by Korea's big conglomerates, designed to take advantage of low cost Chinese
labour. China has become the largest overseas investment area for Korea
since relations were normalised in 1992, with total investments growing from
Dollars 200m in 1991 to Dollars 1.3bn by the end of June this year. Total
Korean corporate investments, however, account for only 0.5 per cent of
total foreign investment in China.
While Korean investment in China has largely been dominated by small
textile, footwear and leather companies, this year has seen an upsurge in
investments by the conglomerates. Samsung will begin the manufacture of
low-end application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), air conditioners,
refrigerators and microwave ovens in the Suzhou complex in late 1995.
The Suzhou operations will complement production of other Samsung home
appliances in north-eastern China. Other chaebol with recently announced
investment plans in China include Daewoo Motor, seeking to build a car
components factory, and Hyundai Motor, wanting to make commercial vans.

<TEXT>
Clinton administration efforts to improve workers' conditions in Indonesia
by threatening to withdraw trade benefits have failed to produce promised
reforms, according to US human rights activists, Nancy Dunne reports from
Washington.
This week's Human Rights Watch/Asia report concludes that labour unrest in
Indonesia has been exacerbated by government failure to allow freedom of
association and the right to organise unions independent of government
control.
Under US law, a country must take steps to meet international labour norms
to be eligible for the US Generalised System of Preferences, which allows
many products from developing countries to enter the US duty-free.
The Clinton administration has other goals in Indonesia competing for the
President's attention. It is one of the US Commerce Department's Ten
Emerging Markets and one in which the US hopes to make import trade gains.
Jakarta is to host the annual meeting of the Asian Pacific Economic
Co-operation forum, and President Clinton is meet President Suharto on
November 16.

North Korea wants several billion dollars compensation if it agrees to

yesterday, Reuter reports from Berlin.
That compensation would be in addition to international financing for a US

North Korea's delegation leader, Mr Kim Jong-u, speaking after five days'

'Details of that will be discussed at higher-level talks,' he said. Talks
are to resume in Geneva on September 23.
'There are two types of compensation,' Mr Kim said. One would be for buying
new light-water reactors, and the other would be 'compensation for electric
losses and investment after 30 years' of nuclear research and power
generation.
Asked how much North Korea wanted for its investment costs, Mr Kim said:
'Several billion US dollars.'
The US has divulged nothing about the negotiations, billed as 'technical'
talks as a branch of the main Geneva negotiations on ending a nuclear
dispute between the two countries.
Washington wants communist North Korea to switch from its graphite-moderated
nuclear technology to light-water reactors that would be financed and
supplied by a US-led international consortium.
Mr Kim said his country wanted to increase its reactor capacity to 1,550MW
by 2002. But he repeated Pyongyang's rejection of light-water models offered
by South Korea, saying they were not advanced enough. The North Koreans are
interested in technology from Russia or Germany.

Sri Lanka's new government is making a concerted effort to end the civil war
that has plagued the country since the mid-1980s, the coalition's newly
appointed chief economic adviser said yesterday.
'We have to end this war. The prime minister is absolutely right in tackling
that problem first,' said Mr Lal Jayawardena, who this week joined Premier
Chandrika Kumaratunga's administration.
Mrs Chandrika has offered to negotiate a peace settlement with the
separatist Tamil 'Tiger' guerrillas fighting for an independent homeland for
ethnic Tamils.
Mr Jayawardena said Sri Lanka was spending about Rs20bn (Pounds 262m) a year
on the war, the equivalent of 4 per cent of GDP, plus a further Rs3bn on
war-related problems. The peace dividend could be substantial.
A former treasury secretary, hedismissed suggestions that left-wing members
of Mrs Kumaratunga's centre-left coalition could force adoption of socialist
policies. The government would not change the previous conservative
administration's labour policies, nor would there be any nationalisation or
expropriation of private property. The government was committed to
export-led growth including export-oriented services, he added.

<TEXT>
African peacekeeping troops in Liberia ended a day-long siege of the
capital's seat of government yesterday when they overran rebels who took
over the building before dawn in an attempted coup, Reuter reports from
Monrovia.
After pounding the building with mortar bombs, cannon and fire from gunboats
offshore, the troops stormed the executive mansion, claiming to have
suffered only three men wounded. The African force said rebel casualties
were still being counted.
The coup attempt - the latest violent turn in Liberia's long civil war  -
was staged by a military faction led by General Charles Julue, who was a
commander in the defeated army of slain dictator Samuel Doe and who fled
Liberia in 1990.
The fighting erupted three days after Liberia's three main warring factions
signed a peace agreement. The accord caused dismay in Monrovia as it
provided for replacement of the interim government.
The eight-nation African peacekeeping force tried at first to persuade the
rebel soldiers to surrender. But Gen Julue declared he was prepared to
resist attempts to dislodge him from the mansion, formerly a presidential
palace but now an administrative building.
The peacekeepers then opened fire from three gunboats and some tanks around
the building, a four-storey fortress on the Atlantic ocean.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Opposition to nuclear treaty grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An indefinite extension of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, desired by
most western nations and four of the five nuclear powers, has run into
stronger-than-expected Third World opposition.
Mr Isaac Ayewah of Nigeria, chairman of a meeting in Geneva to prepare for
the NPT extension conference next spring said yesterday that a majority of
states appeared to favour only a limited extension of the treaty,
accompanied by clear moves by the five declared nuclear-weapons states
towards nuclear disarmament.
This was later refuted by Mr Thomas Graham, head of the US delegation, who
said about 60 countries were committed to making the NPT permanent while the
remainder of the treaty's 164 members had yet to make up their minds.
However, he admitted that the prospects of indefinite extension, while
'reasonably good', were 'not assured.
Among the nuclear powers the US, Russia, France and Britain support
indefinite extension. China has not declared its position.
A decision to extend the NPT requires a simple majority of treaty members
and can be taken only once. The options are an indefinite extension, or
extension for one or more fixed periods after which the treaty lapses.
The West argues that the NPT has been crucial in curbing nuclear
proliferation. Opponents of indefinite extension say the treaty unfairly
discriminates against non-nuclear weapons states and does not provide
adequate means to tackle new proliferation concerns.
Critics single out what they see as the failure of the nuclear powers to
abide by their NPT obligations to enter 'good faith' negotiations to end the
nuclear arms race and work for eventual elimination of nuclear weapons.
A number of developing nations this week called for a strengthening of the
non-proliferation regime, to include a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty
(CTBT), a prohibition on production of fissile materials for weapons
purposes and a dismantling of stockpiles, guarantees to non-nuclear weapon
states that nuclear weapons will never be used against them, and a
commitment by the nuclear powers to negotiate the elimination of nuclear
arms within a fixed time-frame.
A CTBT is being negotiated in Geneva under the auspices of the United
Nations disarmament conference, but is unlikely to be ready in time for the
NPT extension conference.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Kyrgyz fear their tiny nation will fall into iron hands:
MPs' warnings of democratic developments at least threatened, at worst
crushed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the development of democracy in Kyrgyzstan has been threatened by the
president's taking almost complete control over the country, the chances of
its taking hold in the other former Soviet states of Central Asia are
remote, and the 'realists' who increasingly claim it is not on offer
anywhere in the post-Soviet world will add another scalp to their belts.
Kyrgyzstan, whose population is small, natural resources minor and weight in
the world negligible, had the highest of hopes, mainly because in President
Askar Akayev it had a head of state who encouraged these ambitions.
In a series of speeches, he established the image of an administration
which, in contrast to the other four states in the region, was determined to
embed the rule of law, to ensure press freedom and establish a fully
functioning civil society.
Largely for these reasons, the international financial institutions have
committed more funds per head to Kyrgyzstan, in the form of support of the
currency, assistance for restructuring the agrarian and industrial sectors
and humanitarian aid, than to any other of the post-Soviet states.
Thus, the country largely owes its present living standard and future
success in restructuring its economy, and its abiding commitment to
democratic development to foreign support. But on Tuesday the Kyrgyz
parliament heard speaker after speaker warn that democratic development was
at least threatened, at worst crushed.
The cause was a series of moves either by Mr Akayev or attributed to him.
First, the parliament was inquorate: only 125 deputies out of 323 were
present. The rest, it was said, had been induced to stay away until a new
parliament was created. Anticipating such a result, the president had asked
the government to resign, arguing it had to do so because the constitution
specified it could not outlast the parliament. He had called elections for a
new parliament on December 24.
This would be preceded by a referendum on October 22 to pass a
constitutional amendment specifying a bi-cameral parliament of less than 100
full-time MPs. The session was the last futile meeting of a doomed
institution.
Further, the deputies argued that the president or his administration were
afraid of allegations which would have been made of corruption, and, that
since the legislature had been suppressed, the constitutional court not been
appointed, and the executive under his control, President Akayev was on his
way to being an autocrat.
Further, three of Bishkek's newspapers did not appear that day. Svobodny
Gori (Free Hills) had been suppressed some weeks before by order of the
procurator after an appeal to him by the president. The other two, Politika
and Res Publica, were more recent casualties.
Bishkek is in the midst of its latest wrenching change, having been carved
out of tribal societies by Soviet power in the 1920s. Its industrial output
has fallen since the Soviet Union collapsed, dragging gross domestic product
down by 19 per cent in 1992 and 16 per cent in 1993, with a similar fall
expected this year. 'We supported democratic reform,' said a caller to a
television phone-in to President Akayev. 'But give us the elementary
conditions for living. Pay wages and pensions on time'.
The small diplomatic community in Bishkek is concerned. For the envoys
there, who have persuaded their governments that this was an oasis of open
development, a wobble by Mr Akayev is a serious matter. They can find no
good reason why he has forced a parliamentary crisis now, when parliament
would have been dissolved next March. They fear a turn towards the
authoritarian rule evident in neighbouring Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.
In an interview, Mr Akayev repeated his continuing dedication to democratic
development.
The economy was showing real signs of recovery, he said. Inflation was the
lowest in the Commonwealth of Independent States, at 1.7 per cent a month;
the som, introduced in May last year, is the most stable currency, at 10.7
to the dollar.
Farm reform had gone farthest, with most state and collective farms probably
liquidated and private farms showing signs of higher output. Most small
businesses were also private. Real incomes were rising and foreign investor
confidence increasing.
Until the end of the year, President Akayev will indeed be the only figure
of authority. His claim that democracy is not just being preserved but
deepened cannot be judged until the referendum and the elections have
happened, and properly.
On that depends his economy, his reputation, and the hope that Central Asia
is not doomed to be ruled by iron hands.

'Whether South Korea is to finance the project or not we are not concerned,'
Mr Kim said.
In parallel with the Berlin talks, the two countries were discussing in
Pyongyang the establishment of liaison offices in their respective capitals.
In talks with the US in Geneva last month, North Korea agreed to suspend its
nuclear programme while the two sides negotiated.

An estimated 55 US marines flew by helicopter from the US liaison office in

Mombasa, Kenya.
The subdued departure contrasted with the troops high profile landing on the
beaches of Mogadishu in December 1992. As the US prepares for a possible
Haiti invasion Somalia remains in chaos under clan warlords.
US intervention came unstuck in an undeclared war last year against militias

FT  16 SEP 94 / Nigeria surveys the wreckage: The end of the oil strike has
lifted a cloud, but what is revealed are the conditions for continued
economic gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria's economy is quick to bounce back from adversity, but while business
is back to normal after a two-month oil strike, few captains of industry are
celebrating and most are bracing themselves for more shocks.
The end of the strike has lifted a cloud only to reveal the wreckage.
Big manufacturers estimate that they lost the equivalent of six weeks
business to the strike, which brought together industrial, ethnic and
political grievances in a trial of strength between a military government
dominated by northern interests and the economically dominant south. UAC,
Nigeria's leading conglomerate, posted half-year results 17 per cent below
forecast.
'Economic policies here are going in the opposite direction to the rest of
the world. Unless there are changes we are heading for economic calamity,'
says Mr Christopher Kolade, chairman of Cadbury Nigeria, a leading food
manufacturer.
'Even though people are back at work, business needs to regain a basic level
of confidence that the situation is settled,' says Mr Kolade.
While the ports and the banks were closed during July and August,
manufacturers could not clear goods through the ports and imports had to be
unloaded in neighbouring Benin or Ivory Coast
The delays and added costs of imports are hitting hard in the depressed
consumer industries. Breweries and soft drinks manufacturers estimate that
sales are still 25 per cent below levels in June and are relying on a good
pre-Christmas season.
Structural problems of the past four years - high government deficits,
reliance on oil for nearly all foreign currency and industry's dependence on
imported supplies - are compounded by harmful economic policies and an
unstable political outlook.
Nine months after the military government re-introduced state controls on
the private sector, industry faces a period of low demand, low investment
and high inflation.
Nigeria's economic policies have brought the censure of the World Bank and
indifference from bilateral creditors, but no prospect of badly needed aid
or debt relief.
General Sani Abacha's regime overcame the recent challenge by opponents of
military rule not by persuasion but through a show of force, leaving deep
dissent and ethnic divisions. He has won Round One in the struggle to stay
in power but few analysts doubt that Round Two is coming. If the regime is
dismissive of political opposition, it seems deaf to criticisms of its
economic policies.
After regulations fixing foreign exchange rates in the January budget, the
formal private sector pinned its hopes on a policy reversal; when a mid-year
budget review produced no changes and the political crisis brought the
economy nearly to a standstill, business leaders wrote off 1994 as a bad
year.
Among the big companies, the fittest will survive but, outside the oil
sector, the political and economic risks in Nigeria offer more incentives to
short-term traders and speculators than to long-term investment.
'What we wanted to see from the budget review was firstly a more liberal
foreign exchange and interest rate policy,' says Mr Bassey Ndiokho, chairman
of UAC Nigeria. 'Fixing exchange and interest rates without any control over
the demand was unwise.'
Electricity supply is unreliable so companies uses diesel generators. During
the oil strike fuel costs went up between 300 per cent and 500 per cent.
The outlook for the oil industry is better but the government's failure to
pay its 60 per cent share of the industry's costs has led to
under-investment and job losses.
Even after cutting their 1994 budgets, the multinational oil companies which
operate the joint ventures in Nigeria have been owed at least Dollars 800m
by the state this year.
Nigeria's lack of access to new capital is holding up some big projects. A
Dollars 550m investment to produce gas which is currently wasted at
Chevron's Escravos fields is in doubt because Nigeria depends for its
majority share of the funding on the World Bank, which is critical of
Nigeria's economic management.
A Dollars 4bn investment, the much-delayed Liquefied Natural Gas project at
Bonny, hangs in the balance as Nigeria tries to convince export credit
agencies such as the US Eximbank that it is an acceptable country risk.
Nigeria will need all the help it can get from oil exports. The government
promised in January a balanced 1994 budget, but then announced for the first
half of the year a budget deficit of Dollars 1.4bn.
Western economists believe this figure was on the low side and are
forecasting a deficit heading towards last year's figure of more than
Dollars 4bn or 17.5 per cent of gross domestic product. Inflation is nearly
70 per cent and accelerating while economists predict negative GDP growth of
around 1 per cent by the end of the year.

FT  16 SEP 94 / HK polls, here today, gone tomorrow: Sunday's local
elections are under death sentence by China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Cheung Yuk Ming, a 42-year-old accountant, is standing at the corner of
Nelson and Reclamation streets in central Mong Kok, Kowloon. It is early in
the morning and he is reciting his election pitch into a microphone
connected to an amplifier and speakers in a wire shopping trolley.
Few passers-by stop to listen to him as he speaks about the poor public
hygiene in Mong Kok, its inadequate water supply, and the prevalence of
crime in the neighbourhood. Yet, like other candidates in Sunday's local
elections throughout Hong Kong, Mr Cheung tells the voters that he can make
a difference to their lives.
The election is the first fully-democratic poll in Hong Kong since Britain
colonised this tiny corner of southern China 150 years ago. It is also
likely to be among the last. Sunday's poll is being held against China's
expressed wish and under sentence of annulment, come the Chinese takeover on
July 1, 1997.
Beijing demonstrated graphically earlier this week its power to hold up the
development of Hong Kong's port (the world's busiest) simply by calling for
the ejection of the Jardine group, the British trading house, from a
consortium building the facility. Yet its promise to overturn the result of
Sunday's poll has had surprisingly little impact on people wanting to stand
for election or, if opinion polls are reliable, on the voters as well.
In all, 756 candidates are contesting 346 seats in the colony's 18 district
boards, including many supporters of Beijing. The DBs, as they are known,
are like a secular parish council advising a 'district officer' who holds
all local decision-making power. This has not, however, made the DBs
irrelevant. It has simply meant that the role of members is more social
worker than political leader, although a stint in the local district is seen
as a proving-ground for higher elective office.
In spite of Beijing's threats, Mr Wong Che Ming, a lawyer, sees no conflict
in his role as an appointed adviser to China on local affairs, and as a
candidate for Mong Kok in Sunday's poll. 'We can't stand still simply
because someone has threatened to demolish the whole system,' he says. 'I
still have something to do, to achieve. Two years is a long time in a place
like Hong Kong.'
Mong Kok is not the sort of place western tourists frequent. It has the
distinction of being the world's most densely populated urban area. It
houses 96,650 people per square kilometre, against the average for Hong Kong
of 5,380 a sq km. With that population density go all the problems of crime
and social deprivation which Mr Wong, Mr Cheung and Mr Ng Wing Fai,
candidate for the avowedly pro-democracy United Democrats, tell the voters
they can ameliorate.
The building housing Mr Ng's campaign HQ, on the corner of Shanghai and
Arran Streets (the Scots presence in the colony not being confined solely to
Jardine's and the upper echelons of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank), is a
microcosm of the community. Within its walls are a Baptist church, a karaoke
bar, a sauna and various trading companies.
Mr Ng, an earnest town planner seeking election for the first time, explains
that the building is relatively safe, mainly because the triads, the Chinese
version of the Mafia, run the Kara-OK Bar. 'With the triads running the bar,
we have no robberies in this building,' he says.
A short walk from his office is a 16-storey apartment block. A 400 sq ft
flat in the building sells for about HKDollars 1.5m (Pounds 126,000), but
that is the least of the occupants' problems. Some 100 people live on the
roof in what the Hong Kong government calls 'illegal structures' which house
mainly mainland Chinese immigrants who do not qualify for public housing and
which sell for about HKDollars 150,000 each.
Mr Ng says his task is to intercede on behalf of these people with the
building's management company and the government. The water and electricity
used by the 30 or so families living on the roof is illegally siphoned off
the supply to the building. Poor plumbing has already caused the failure of
one lift because of seepage into the elevator shaft.
Intercession, with government or landlord, is also one of the main tasks Mr
Wong has performed since he was first elected to the Mong Kok district board
in 1985. He also spends a lot of time advising people how do things, such as
organising a tender for repair works to an apartment building and
supervising the work. 'You can actually achieve something,' he says.
In his campaign literature, Mr Wong makes a point of the fact that he is an
elected member of the Mong Kok district board. This raises the question,
given his status as a China adviser and Beijing's preference for the
appointment, why it is worth drawing attention to.
'It would help my campaign to point out that I had been elected,' he says.
'People will take note. It would mean I had not come by my position easily,
but from hard work.'
But as if to underline the irrelevance of Sunday's vote, Beijing let it be
known a week ago that it will shortly appoint a further 200 local advisers
to keep it abreast of the concerns of people at the grass roots.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Spanish markets worried over budget: Concern grows over
pension and wage pledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Unexpectedly high prices in Spain coupled with a government promise to index
pensions and civil servants' wages to inflation have raised doubts in
financial markets over Madrid's ability to reduce the public deficit when it
delivers the 1995 budget this month.
The market has pushed long-term interest rates above 11.4 per cent this
week, the highest level since February last year and one that represents a
spread of some 400 basis points against Germany.
'Spain is under suspicion,' said Mr Henrick Lumboldt, head of fixed income
research at Madrid securities house FG. 'If there is a market sell-off,
Spain is going to be sold more aggressively.'
Mr Pedro Solbes, the economy minister, echoing a more sombre mood about the
domestic economy, was reported yesterday as saying a reduction in interest
rates was 'now more difficult' and he 'hoped they will not have to rise'.
Only a week ago Mr Solbes had forecast lower interest rates - the benchmark
intervention rate set by the Bank of Spain has stood at 7.35 per cent since
early August - before the end of the year. The minister's changed
predictions came after an unexpectedly high 0.6 per cent rise in August's
consumer price index, which put year-on-year inflation at 4.8 per cent and
accumulated 1994 inflation at 3.2 per cent, just short of the 3.5 per cent
target for the year's end.
Although the Economy Ministry, which is due to deliver its 1995 budget this
month, is officially sticking to a restrictive policy that will reduce the
public deficit by a full point to represent 5.9 per cent of gross domestic
product, the market appears to already be discounting a loosening of the
professed tight monetary guidelines.
The market perceptions are likely to be heightened following guidelines
announced this week on pensions and civil servants' pay. Prime minister
Felipe Gonzalez said in parliament that Spain's nearly 7m pensioners, whose
retirement pay this year has been based on the 3.5 per cent CPI rise
projection, would be fully compensated for what now seems likely to be an
inflation rate of around 4.3 per cent at the end of the year.
The government has also agreed to link salary increases for Spain's 2m civil
servants to inflation over the next three years starting in 1995. The
agreement with unions includes an undertaking to make up for a wage freeze
on civil servants' pay over the past two years with increased pay awards in
1996-1997.
The open-handed policy to both pensioners and civil servants has prompted
speculation that Mr Gonzalez, re-elected in 1993 for a four-year term just
as Spain dipped steeply into recession, could be laying the groundwork for a
snap election next year, when the economy is forecast to recover rapidly and
grow by as much as 2.5 per cent.
'The government looks as if it is throwing caution to the winds and risking
a 'stop-go' economy,' said Mr Lorenzo Bernaldo de Quiros of Madrid economic
consultants Global Research. 'There are a lot of inflationary tensions and
restrictive policies should be kept in place longer.'

FT  16 SEP 94 / Crimean parliament seeks government resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The parliament of the autonomous Crimean peninsula in Ukraine has called for
the resignation of the regional government, Matthew Kaminski and agencies
report. Before the no-confidence vote Mr Yevgeny Saburov, deputy prime
minister and acting head of government, tendered his resignation, saying he
did not 'see the possibility of working further in a constructive way if
this situation continues'. President Yuri Meshkov refused to accept the
resignation.
'Saburov's still the government chief,' said Mr Sergei Nikolsky, agriculture
minister. 'But the way things are going we will all be out of a job quite
soon.'
The no-confidence vote follows a confrontation over the parliament's
decision to strip President Meshkov of many of his powers. The president,
elected on a populist ticket in January, announced on Sunday he was
disbanding parliament and introducing presidential rule. But the president's
gesture of reopening parliament two days later encouraged MPs to demand the
dismissal of the government before it would begin talks over the president's
powers.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Revenge of the Armenian diaspora: A decisive force in the
long territorial war with Azerbaijan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until a year ago, two Californian men cut among the boldest images to be
seen in Armenia's long separatist war with Azerbaijan, careening around the
battlefield in a jeep with 'Crusaders' emblazoned across the doors and
fighting harder than many local comrades.
The pair was there as the Armenians penetrated deep into neighbouring
Azerbaijan, grabbing a towering advantage over the enemy. One of them, an
import-export trader named Mr Garo Kakhejian, was even suspected by the FBI
of running guns to the homeland to buttress the Armenians' effort.
Now, with a tense ceasefire holding since July, the Armenians seem poised to
gain suzerainty over the patch of Azerbaijan for which they have fought
since 1988; Azerbaijan, which has lost more than a fifth of its territory
and been pushed to the brink of disintegration, appears ready to offer
Armenia a political settlement in peace talks that have narrowed to one or
two differences.
But only one of the Californians will be around to savour the apparent
triumph; Mr Kakhejian, 31, was killed by a sniper in June 1993.
Now his buddy fights on alone.
'I'm not a Rambo, I'm not a trained specialist, but I do my best,' says Mr
Chahe Ajamian, 32, at his friend's grave. . . . We have one slogan: 'Death
or Freedom'.'
If the Armenians do ultimately carve out an independent region of Azerbaijan
for themselves, as seems probable, it will be largely a result of the
efforts of zealous diaspora Armenians such as the California pair. The
world's 8m-strong Armenian diaspora community, concentrated in the US cities
of Boston, Fresno and Los Angeles, and in Paris, Beirut and Damascus, has
been the war's key private backer.
Responding to the Armenians' demand for independence in a tiny,
kidney-shaped Azerbaijan region called Nagorno-Karabakh, diaspora groups
have raised millions of dollars a year in telethons, political fund-raising
drives and individual donations. In one California telethon alone in
February, the radical, Athens-based Armenian Revolutionary Federation raised
Dollars 1.5m, according to a group spokesman.
The donations have helped break an Azerbaijan blockade of Armenia, financing
food and clothing, but also arms, ammunition, communications and other
equipment. The result has been to underpin Armenia's dramatic shift from a
rear-guard defence of Nagorno-Karabakh two years ago to its vast advantage
today.
The success of the Armenian diaspora illustrates an outgrowth of Europe's
post-cold war rash of nationalist wars. This has been an increase in the
power of diaspora groups - especially from eastern Europe and former Soviet
bloc nations such as Ukraine and the Baltics - to influence politics in the
western countries where they live, and in the nations from which they
emigrated.
A decade ago, Armenian diaspora organisations were near political pariahs in
Europe and the US, as Armenian extremists went on a 10-year terrorist streak
in which 41 Turkish diplomats around the world were slain.
Now, groups such as the Armenian Assembly of America and the Armenian
Revolutionary Federation, known as 'Dashnak', operating in the US Congress,
the United Nations and the Elysee, are among the world's most sophisticated
political lobbyists, according to western political analysts and diplomats.
Their influence has almost entirely overshadowed Azerbaijan's thus-far
feeble efforts in Washington.
Nagorno-Karabakh has been a binding glue for the diaspora, which grew up
after the 1915 massacre of up to 1m Armenians in Ottoman Turkey.
Armenian groups, for example, have claimed credit for the US Congress's
decision to single out Azerbaijan for Washington's only sanctions in the
ex-Soviet Union; the 1992 Freedom Support Act bars all but humanitarian aid
to Azerbaijan because of its blockade of Armenia. Meanwhile, Armenia was
allocated Dollars 195m in 1993 US aid, second only to Russia among ex-Soviet
states.
Analysts say the lobby has been especially skilfull in targeting campaign
contributions. One of its strongest supporters, the Democratic congressman
Mr Joseph Kennedy II, for example, received more than 10 per cent of his
1994 individual campaign donations from Armenian contributors, according to
public records in Washington.
'There is a real sense in the (US government) agencies that Armenia
absolutely must not be slighted,' says Mr Corbin Lyday, of the
Stanford-Berkeley Department of Soviet and post-Soviet Studies.
The war has its roots in Josef Stalin's divide-and-rule tactic of shifting
entire ethnic populations on to others' lands, or awarding one people
political control over land populated by a rival nationality. In 1923,
Stalin laid the seeds for today's war by placing the Nagorno-Karabakh
Armenians under Azeri control.
In 1988, the Armenian population openly rebelled, alleging decades of
discrimination against its language and culture, and the fighting has
escalated steadily since. In July, Moscow brokered a truce, and has proposed
that Russian troops form a cordon between the two sides.
Peace talks have narrowed to two questions - who will control a strategic
corridor between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia proper called Lachin, and a
town called Shusha, to which both sides claim a sentimental attachment. The
Armenians now control both and, since Azerbaijan has few bargaining chips
aside from hoped-for leverage from Moscow, the chances are that the Azeris
will not regain control over either.
The diaspora's most important assistance has come on the battlefield itself.
The Armenians' weapons and ammunition caches far outstrip their obvious
resources; diaspora groups are responsible for supplying a significant part
of the materiel, and Moscow the remainder, western analysts say.
A puzzling feature of the diaspora support, however, has been a relative
dearth of army volunteers. Just four to five dozen diaspora Armenians have
fought at any one time, say local and western sources. Almost all these
volunteers have been from Lebanon and Syria.
One of them is Mr Mike Melkonian, 41, who until recently operated a
jewellery store in Montibello, California.
Wounded in the back earlier this year, Mr Melkonian was interviewed on his
return to Montibello to recuperate. 'I'm going to spend two or three days in
the jacuzzi,' he said, lounging on an airliner from Yerevan. 'But then I'm
coming back. Not everyone can fight.'

FT  16 SEP 94 / Kiev ministers poised to clinch deal with IMF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ukraine is on the verge of reaching its first agreement with the
International Monetary Fund, a step which could unlock the Dollars 4bn
(Pounds 2.5bn) in aid promised by the Group of Seven leading industrial
nations, senior Ukrainian and western officials said this week.
Ukrainian cabinet ministers said they believed the country could reach a
preliminary agreement with the IMF on an initial Dollars 700m loan to
stabilise the economy by the end of the month. An agreement with the IMF
would be the strongest signal so far that Ukraine, one of the weakest
economies in the region, is about to attempt a radical economic
transformation.
'We have a plan that will meet IMF conditions,' said Mr Roman Shpek, the
reform-minded economy minister who is spearheading Kiev's negotiations with
the Fund. 'There is now enough political will in Ukraine.'
Western diplomats said Ukraine could reach the preliminary agreement with
the Fund as soon as next Tuesday. Final approval would come at the IMF's
summit in Madrid next month.
To meet IMF conditions Ukraine, which has one of the least reformed
economies in the region, must liberalise prices, reform the currency,
overhaul its restrictive taxation and trade policies and slash its budget
deficit from its current high of 20 per cent of GDP to 10-12 per cent.
But if Kiev takes these difficult steps, the talks with the IMF and parallel
negotiations with the World Bank to release a Dollars 400m rehabilitation
loan could be the beginning of the first serious attempt to implement market
reforms since Ukraine became independent nearly four years ago.
Some western politicians and economists, many of whom had dismissed Ukraine
as an economic basket case, have begun to argue that if Ukraine chooses to
reform it should be supported with substantial western assistance. The
Dollars 4bn, pledged at the G7 summit in Naples in July, was the first
concrete move in this direction.
'I just can't believe that the west would miss this chance,' said Mr Jeffrey
Sachs, the Harvard economist who advised Poland when it pioneered 'shock
therapy' reforms nearly five years ago. 'You have a classic situation in
Ukraine where you could have a very good programme or the opportunity could
be lost. But they need a push from President Clinton and Chancellor Kohl.'
However, if President Leonid Kuchma's administration chooses to push for
radical economic reforms it could face tough opposition from Ukraine's
communist-dominated parliament, where MPs from the rust-belt in the east of
the country have a powerful voice.
Although Mr Kuchma has already demonstrated a greater willingness to
over-rule parliament by exercising the president's right to issue decrees,
he is expected next Tuesday to ask the legislature to lift its moratorium on
privatisation. Within the next few days his advisers say he will also
present a comprehensive economic reform plan to the parliament.
Moreover, Prime Minister Vitaly Masol, an appointee of the previous
president, has openly opposed reforms. But some western observers believe
that Mr Kuchma, who has been quietly moving his own, more reformist, allies
into the cabinet, may be trying to isolate and eventually sack Mr Masol.
These political uncertainties, and lingering doubts about Mr Kuchma's own
commitment to reforms, have prompted some leading Ukrainian politicians to
urge the west not to give aid to Ukraine until it acts on its reformist
promises.
'Ukraine is like an alcoholic asking for a loan to buy more vodka,' Mr
Viktor Pynzenyk, one of the leading advocates of radical reforms in the
parliament, said. Before giving Ukraine financial assistance, he warned
senior World Bank officials at a meeting last week, they must be confident
that the government had 'kicked the state out of the economy'.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Resignation rocks Crimea's government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Crimea's vice-prime minister, Mr Yevgeny Saburov, yesterday resigned in the
wake of a confrontation between President Yuri Meshkov and the parliament of
the autonomous Ukrainian peninsula, dealing a further blow to the president,
writes Matthew Kaminski. Mr Saburov, a former Russian economics minister,
said he did not 'see the possibility of working further in a constructive
way if this situation continues'.
Mr Saburov's appointment, along with other 'Moscow experts', to head the
contested region's government was, ironically, resented by parliament, a
pro-Russian chamber dedicated to breaking from Ukraine. Mr Meshkov appointed
Mr Saburov to revive economic links with Russia, although stopping short of
complete independence from Ukraine.
Mr Meshkov, his position uncertain, told the Interfax news agency he would
defend the Saburov government against parliament. Last Sunday he suspended
parliament but ended the lock-out two days later. Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma's special envoy, Mr Yevgeny Marchuk, arrived in Simferopol yesterday
to try to settle the dispute.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Wallenberg in call to slash state spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Wallenberg, Sweden's most powerful industrialist, yesterday called
for deep spending cuts to tackle the country's mounting state debt, saying
further deterioration could 'in the worst case' lead to pressure on
Wallenberg companies to move their headquarters overseas.
Mr Wallenberg's warning, in a newspaper interview, came three days before a
general election in which the main issue has been the extent of spending
cuts needed in the country's extensive welfare system. These are required to
curb the budget deficit and control a public debt running at close to 100
per cent of gross national product.
His call followed a similar intervention earlier this week by the chiefs of
Volvo, Ericsson, Stora and the Swedish division of ABB, the country's four
biggest exporters.
They warned that new investments of up to SKr50bn (Pounds 4.2bn) a year were
at risk if higher tax levels made Sweden less competitive. Ericsson, Stora
and ABB all fall within the Wallenberg sphere of influence.
Mr Wallenberg said if the deficit was not controlled there was a risk that
Sweden's credit rating would be lowered. In that case, Swedish companies
would be under pressure to relocate to secure lower interest rates on the
funding they required.
'It can in the worst case make it difficult for us to stay in Sweden,' he
told Expressen newspaper. He said the government needed to take 'a
motor-saw' to state spending. 'I am genuinely worried for Sweden,' he added.
'If the politicians do not take the situation seriously, with substantial
measures against the budget deficit, things will go badly.'
The highly unusual interventions in the election campaign by the top
industrialists are widely seen as being aimed at the opposition Social
Democratic party, which is expected to lead the new government, although
latest polls have shown a shift towards the right-centre coalition of Mr
Carl Bildt, prime minister.
Business leaders have criticised the SDP's emphasis on tax increases to
match spending cuts as a way to cut the deficit.
But it is not clear to what extent the industrialists' interventions have
been responsible for the tilt towards Mr Bildt's coalition. The Social
Democrats believe they the business leaders may have irritated many voters
instead.
Yesterday, Mr Wallenberg's advisers denied were at pains to deny that he had
intended any threat to voters about how they should vote - or that he was
suggesting the whole Wallenberg empire might move abroad.
They protested strongly to the tabloid newspaper Expressen over a front page
headline suggesting this.
Mr Wallenberg's hitherto high public standing was also under unprecedented
fire yesterday over remarks he made on television denigrating the abilities
of black people in South Africa. 'There are a few well-educated blackies' in
South Africa, he said, but blacks did not have the competence to run South
Africa without help from the white minority. He later apologised fpr the
remarks.

<TEXT>
Banking activity throughout Italy is expected to be paralysed by a day-long
strike today of 330,000 employees protesting at the failure to renew a wage
and work conditions contract that expired in December 1992. Several other
groups of workers are also in the process of renewing their contracts after
suffering effective loss of earnings over the past two years of recession.
Yesterday 140,000 workers employed in local transport staged a 24-hour
stoppage over the failure to renew a contract that lapsed at the end of
1991. In both instances the strikes are centred less on wage increases and
more on improving conditions of employment and ensuring new investments. The
bank employees are resisting employers' demands for more flexible working
hours and a shake-up in promotion procedures, which employers have linked to
higher pay.

The German government yesterday said it would create a DM500m (Pounds 207m)
fund to provide subsidised, long-term loans to eastern German companies. It
also presented new tax incentives designed to encourage investment in
eastern Germany. Companies selling stakes in German companies would not have
to pay tax on their profits if they reinvested the money in eastern Germany,
said Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, after industrialists and trade
unions met Chancellor Helmut Kohl to discuss the state of the eastern German
economy. While Mr Kohl insisted there were signs of the 'flourishing
landscape' which he promised to create in the five eastern Lander, the
opposition Social Democratic party accused the chancellor of 'resounding
complacency' and of destroying eastern Germany's industrial base - which now
produced around a third of what it did in 1989.

Pilots at Air France have suspended a strike planned for today and tomorrow
and will continue to negotiate with management at the loss-making
state-owned airline about ways to reach productivity targets. Air France
said that all flights would consequently operate normally. The SNPL, SPAC
and SOMAC pilots' unions at the airline said they had agreed to re-enter
discussions on contested proposals to achieve a 30 per cent productivity
increase by 1997. The unions had accepted the productivity targets but
rejected management proposals to achieve them. In particular, they opposed a
reduction in flight bonuses. The productivity targets are part of a rescue
package being implemented by Mr Christian Blanc, the airline's chairman. He
says they are a central element in curbing losses at the company, which
reached FFr8.48bn (Pounds 1.03bn) last year.

The leader of the breakaway Russian republic of Chechnya, Mr Dzhokhar
Dudayev, signed a decree yesterday imposing martial law, blaming the
'continuous provocations on the part of Russian government forces' and
activities of the Chechen opposition, the Interfax news agency reported. It
is unclear to what extent Mr Dudayev, facing rebellion from several armed
groups inside his tiny territory, will be able to enforce the ruling, due to
take effect at midnight. The official Russian Itar-Tass news agency also
reported that Russia's southern regional army would hold manoeuvres next
week near the borders of Chechnya, which declared independence from Moscow
in 1991. The last time Russia announced big troop movements near Chechnya,
in November 1992, Mr Dudayev threatened to declare war on Moscow unless its
forces pulled back.

<TEXT>
Italian workers are rushing to take early retirement because of fears of
sharp cuts in pension benefits in the 1995 budget. State pensions bodies
have so far this year received retirement requests totalling 460,000, nearly
double the number in the whole of 1993. The conservative government of prime
minister Silvio Berlusconi, which has pledged to take action to reduce state
spending and debts, has focused on the generous and much-abused pensions
system. The government, which must present its 1995 budget to parliament
before the end of this month, plans deficit cuts of at least L45,000bn
(Pounds 18.5bn), including up to L9,000bn from pensions. Italians can retire
on up to 80 per cent of their final salary. Italy has some 20m pensioners,
just over one in three of the total population, with over a third of the
state's total annual expenditure used to cover the cost, and payments far
exceeding contributions.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Greek deputies vote to indict former premier: Mitsotakis
faces bribe charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Greek parliament voted last night to indict Mr Constantine Mitsotakis,
the former conservative prime minister, on charges of accepting a bribe and
breach of trust in the sale of Heracles General Cement to Calcestruzzi of
Italy in 1992.
Mr Mitsotakis, now a backbencher, is accused of taking a Dollars 22.5m
(Pounds 14.5m) bribe to expedite the sale of the company to Cal-Nat, a joint
venture of National Bank of Greece and Calcestruzzi, the construction arm of
the Ferruzzi group.
The joint venture paid Dollars 225m to acquire Heracles, the largest cement
exporter in Europe, in the only big privatisation deal to proceed while the
conservatives were in power.
In a secret ballot held at midnight, 160 of the 300 deputies voted in favour
of indicting Mr Mitsotakis. Deputies from the conservative New Democracy did
not take part in the vote.
The former prime minister will be tried by a special criminal court
consisting of 13 senior judges.
Two other former conservative cabinet ministers, Mr Andreas Andrianopoulos,
who as industry minister headed the government's privatisation programme,
and Mr Ioannis Paleocrassas, the ex-finance minister, were also indicted on
breach of trust charges in the Heracles sale.
Mr Mitsotakis denied the charges in parliament, saying the governing
socialists' decision to investigate the Heracles sale 'was motivated by
purely political reasons.'
The case is widely seen as an attempt by the socialists to take revenge on
Mr Mitsotakis and his New Democracy party for taking Mr Andreas Papandreou,
then opposition leader, to court in 1991 on corruption charges arising from
a Dollars 200m embezzlement scandal at the Bank of Crete. Mr Papandreou, who
refused to attend proceedings, was acquitted by a special court.
The case against Mr Mitsotakis and his former cabinet ministers has
triggered a crisis in the New Democracy party, which was divided over
whether to support the former prime minister at yesterday's debate on the
charges.
Privatisation was a contentious issue for New Democracy while it was in
power. It was opposed by the party's present leader, Mr Miltiades Evert, and
contributed to New Democracy's fall from power last year, when a group of
conservative MPs opposed to the planned disposal of OTE, the state telecoms
company, defected.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Swedish Elections: Small parties hold the key to Swedish
political fortunes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
With opinion polls showing Sweden's Social Democratic party slipping well
below the level of support it needs to win a majority in Sunday's general
election, the shape of the new government is likely to depend on the
performance of half a dozen small parties, writes Hugh Carnegy in Stockholm.
The Social Democrats, rulers of Sweden for all but six years in the last six
decades, look set to rebound from their performance in the 1991 general
election, when they won only 37.7 per cent of the vote (latest polls
indicate their support is now 43-47 per cent), while the conservative
Moderate party of Prime Minister Carl Bildt, even if they do better than in
1991, are unlikely to reach 25 per cent.
Mr Ingvar Carlsson, Social Democratic leader, is therefore favourite to form
the next government. But the final outcome will be dictated by the strengths
of six other parties, particularly by whichever of them succeeds in
overcoming the barrier of 4 per cent national support required to enter the
Riksdag (parliament).
Mr Bildt is hoping that signs of a last-minute tilt to the right in two
polls this week - and pollsters say many voters have yet to make up their
minds - will be sufficient to cancel out an earlier strong leftward trend
and enable him to reform his right-centre minority coalition with the Folk
party (known in English as the Liberals), the Centre party and the Christian
Democrats.
However, the polls suggest the Christian Democrats, elected to parliament
for the first time in 1991, may not get back in. Furthermore, all the
indications are that the populist right-wing group New Democracy - which has
given the government a vital cushion of support - will also be excluded from
the Riksdag after suffering a fierce internecine war.
Instead, the Environment party, which fell out of parliament in 1991,
appears set to return and is pledged to try to block any new Bildt-led
government.
The odds, therefore, remain against Mr Bildt, barring a late, powerful swing
to the right. But the outlook is still worrying for Mr Carlsson. Although
Social Democratic governments have, for most of the past 40 years, depended
on the left for a parliamentary majority, he is reluctant to do so this
time, chiefly because of hostility within the left and Environment parties
towards the tough economic policies now needed to close the gaping budget
deficit and calm financial markets.
Both the left and Environment parties are also strongly against Sweden's
attempt to join the European Union, which the Social Democrats support and
which will be voted on in a referendum in November. Mr Bildt seemed to
strike a chord with voters when he called the prospect of a Social
Democrat-Left-Environment alliance 'a red-green mess that would be black for
Sweden'.
Hence, Mr Carlsson has raised the possibility of an alliance with the
Liberals, or perhaps the Centre party. On the face of it this would provide
a stable government likely to produce an economic package sufficient to
reassure the markets.
Both the Liberal and the Centre parties have in the past co-operated on
economic policies with the Social Democrats. But a formal coalition of that
type would be a new departure.
Mr Bengt Westerberg, the Liberal leader, has indicated he would be ready for
such a coalition, but many in his party are sceptical. Among them is Mrs
Anne Wibble, the finance minister, whose father, Mr Bertil Ohlin, fought
many long and bitter battles with the Social Democrats when he was Liberal
party leader.
It may therefore not be immediately clear after results are declared on
Sunday night exactly what shape the new government will take. If that is the
case, the markets will be braced for another burst of turbulence on Monday
to follow the interest rate rises and currency slides that pre-election
uncertainty has prompted over the past two months.

<TEXT>
Russia's economic decline will slow significantly next year, although the
country still will be in a 'depression phase', according to Mr Victor
Gerashchenko, chairman of the Central Bank. He predicted that gross domestic
product would contract 4.7 per cent next year, much less than the 19 per
cent decline expected for 1994, the Interfax news agency reported.
Industrial production would fall 15 per cent in 1995, after a decline of
about 25 per cent this year. Mr Gerashchenko noted that inflation would
continue its gradual decline next year, falling from 5-6 per cent a month
early in 1995 to 3-4 per cent by the end of the year. In August, inflation
fell to a record low of 4 per cent a month, but the government still is
targeting 7-8 per cent for the end of 1994. Mr Gerashchenko, who was
speaking at a banking conference in St Petersburg, said that the budget
deficit this year would amount to about 8 per cent of gross domestic
product. Last year, the deficit was 9.8 per cent of GDP.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dutch non-seasonally adjusted unemployment rose to an average 470,000 people
in June-August from 465,000 in May-July, the Central Bureau of Statistics
announced. The bureau said the increase in the number of registered
unemployed was normal for the time of year, because of the entry of
graduates into the labour market. The quarterly totals have been increasing
at a slower rate since hitting a nine-year peak of 520,000 people in the
first quarter of 1994.
Sweden's consumer price index was unchanged in August from July. Monthly
figures brought the year-on-year inflation rate to 2.7 per cent in August,
down from 2.9 per cent in July.
Finland's underlying rate of inflation rose to 1.4 per cent year-on-year in
July from 0.9 per cent in June.
Polish consumer prices rose 1.7 per cent in August after a 1.5 per cent rise
in July, but year-on-year inflation fell to 32.2 per cent from 32.8 per
cent.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Single market still to find full harmony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's single market will remain incomplete without a new round of
harmonisation legislation, a report said yesterday. The European Union's
Economic and Social Committee identified 62 obstructions to the free
movement of goods, services, people and capital in a report on the
functioning of the internal market, concluding that a 'vigorous programme be
adopted to eliminate all remaining obstacles'.
Of the obstacles identified, half related to the free movement of goods, 15
to the movement of private services, 13 to the free movement of people and
two to the free movement of capital. The failure of member states mutually
to recognise each other's standards in those areas where no EU legislation
exists remains the biggest block to the free movement of goods, according to
the 200 responses from industry, consumers and trades unions.
Areas such as food additives, nutritional labelling, electrical goods and
the weights and dimensions of vehicles were particularly problematic, the
report said.
It also pointed out that product safety markings were interpreted
differently between member states, while varying testing requirements made
additional tests necessary on certain imported goods.
The committee also recommended greater harmonisation of environmental
standards to avoid the problem of 'environmental nationalism'. The report
found that environmental regulations were frequently acting as non-tariff
barriers, particularly in the chemical and packaging industries.
Many of the survey's respondents argued for greater regulation in financial
services, particularly in the granting of mortgages where the taxation rules
of certain member states effectively prevented cross border transactions.
For example, the report recounted the case of one person taking out a
mortgage with a company in another member state and not being allowed to
offset the interest payments against taxation, which would have been
possible if the mortgage had been taken out in the home state.
Another problem area is insurance, an area opened up just two months ago.
The survey found that huge discrepancies remained in the taxes levied on
insurance policies.
The report also found significant obstacles to the free movement of people,
in particular the failure of states to recognise each other's professional
qualifications. Differing social security regimes are also an impediment.
The biggest complaint regarding the free movement of capital was that cross
border payments take too long and are too expensive.

The vanguard of a 135-strong group of international observers is to begin
operations today to ensure that Serbia's embargo of Serb-held territory in
Bosnia is being maintained.
If the team confirms that the blockade, imposed at the beginning of August,
is genuine then the UN Security Council will almost certainly respond by
easing sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro.
The team, led by retired Swedish general Bo Pellnas, met Serbian officials
for talks in Belgrade yesterday which focused on where the inspectors would
be placed and the nature of their powers.
Speaking in Geneva on Wednesday, the international mediator, Lord Owen, said
the team - not officially termed 'observers' or 'monitors' in deference to
Serbian sensibilities - would keep a low profile.
'We don't want them to be terribly visible,' Lord Owen said, adding it would
be up to Serbian and Montenegrin officials to carry out physical checks.
There would be no challenges to trucks crossing the border into Bosnia
without the co-operation of local officials. 'Otherwise, we are putting
their lives at risk,' Lord Owen said.
Despite the restrictions, Lord Owen told reporters: 'We are satisfied (the
mission) will be able to make sure that only humanitarian supplies are going
across.'
He warned that the team would be withdrawn if there were any doubts that the
Serbian authorities were complying but stressed that they had every interest
in co-operating. 'If everyone is satisfied, it is agreed there should be a
relaxation of sanctions,' he added.
'We would very much appreciate to do our work without the world media on our
back,' said Gen Pellnas after the Belgrade talks. He refused to say where
his men would be stationed.
The state-controlled media in Belgrade describes the mission as 'a group of
humanitarian civilians' to assist in the improved provision of aid to the
people of Bosnia-Hercegovina. The fact that the group's real purpose is to
monitor observance of an embargo against the Bosnian Serbs is conveniently
ignored.
Opposition leaders have attacked Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic for
agreeing to allow inspection of a border which, they argue, merely divides
fellow Serbs.
There are no great hopes that the blockade, or its inspection, will cause
Bosnian Serbs to reverse their opposition to the peace plan proposed by the
five-member international Contact Group. Lord Owen said the mission was not
trying to force an immediate 'change of heart' among the Bosnian Serbs.
Efforts have meanwhile been made to shore up a shaky alliance between
Bosnia's Moslems and Croats.
Croat and Moslem leaders, meeting in Zagreb on Wednesday, agreed to open a
key road between the two republics and to establish joint authorities in
parts of the Moslem-Croat federation.
The federation was formed in March, but the two erstwhile enemies have yet
to implement much of the agreement. Observers fear that rising tensions
among Croats and Moslems could degenerate into another round of hostilities.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Raytheon's UK jet plants set to close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Raytheon of the US is to close the corporate jet business it bought from
British Aerospace and transfer work to the US with the loss of 850 UK jobs
over the next three years.
The decision provoked strong protests yesterday after its announcement by
the US industrial group which acquired the BAe business for Pounds 250m last
year.
Union and Labour party representatives called on Mr Michael Heseltine, the
trade and industry secretary, to intervene to stop Raytheon closing its
facilities at Broughton, near Chester, and Hatfield, Hertfordshire. Raytheon
currently leases both plants from BAe.
The US company, which is also suspending production of the Hawker 1000
business jet and slowing production of the smaller Hawker 800 jet, said the
move reflected difficulties in the recession-hit corporate jet market.
'The timing of this decision is principally driven by the current weak
market conditions and substantiated by the results of a recently completed
study by Raytheon after it acquired Corporate Jets from British Aerospace,'
the US company said. It added it was immediately cutting 170 out of 550 jobs
at Broughton, where Hawker business jets are assembled, and 143 out of 300
jobs at its Hatfield design, engineering and marketing facility. The
remaining jobs at both plants will go by 1997, although several UK employees
will be offered jobs in the US.
Raytheon is also cutting 630 jobs in the US as part of the overall
rationalisation of its corporate aircraft activities. The company is merging
its Beech Aircraft subsidiary with the former BAe corporate jet activities
it acquired last year into the Raytheon Aircraft Company based in Wichita,
Kansas.
Raytheon said final assembly of Hawker jets would start being moved from
Broughton to Wichita next year and be completed in 1997.
There were fears yesterday that the decision could also have repercussions
on jobs at BAe's Airbus division at Chester, which supplies wings and
fuselage sections for Hawker jets. About 470 BAe Airbus staff are employed
on Hawker activities.
Apart from poor market conditions, Raytheon said its study of its aircraft
businesses concluded that merging Hawker and Beech aircraft production would
achieve significant cost savings.
The company is suspending production of the Hawker 1000 to improve the model
and boost its sales prospects. Raytheon renamed the BAe corporate jets
Hawker when it took over the company.
Since the sale, former BAe employees had worried that Raytheon would
transfer production to the US. But the announcement still came as a shock to
staff. Mr Tony Lloyd, Labour's employment spokesman, said it was 'outrageous
that an American company can move in, buy an order book and then close down
forever the plants with the consequences for skilled employment'.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Asian TVs may face EU dumping duties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Provisional anti-dumping duties on colour television sets from five Asian
countries and Turkey are likely to be announced shortly by the European
Commission, in a move that threatens to raise prices for European consumers.
The decision follows an investigation launched almost two years ago into
small and portable television sets from Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and
Turkey, and big screen sets from those countries plus China and South Korea.
Industry officials say the level of anti-dumping duty could range from
around 20 per cent for certain sets from Malaysia and South Korea to 30 per
cent for sets from China and Thailand. The companies affected are the
Japanese-owned Hitachi, Funai and Sanyo and the Korean-owned Goldstar and
Samsung.
The UK vigorously opposed the move, saying it was not in the interests of
Europe's consumers. However, the European Commission can take a provisional
decision on the issue without a vote by member states.
The investigation was triggered by complaints from Philips of the
Netherlands and Thomson of France, Europe's largest consumer electronics
companies. They believed the manufacturers from the five Asian countries had
increased EU market shares by pricing sets below the levels charged in their
home markets.
The commission has four months to complete its investigation from the moment
it imposes provisional anti-dumping duties, though it may request a further
two months if necessary.
It must then either close the investigation or - if it decides dumping has
occurred - ask the Council of Ministers to authorise definitive anti-dumping
duties.
These may vary from the provisional duties and may be applied
retrospectively. Offending exporters may settle anti-dumping cases by
agreeing to raise prices voluntarily.
The council's voting rules were changed this year to require only a simple
majority vote to impose dumping duties, instead of a qualified majority
vote.
The change was made at the insistence of France, which believed it would
make it easier to protect European industries against low-priced imports.
Critics of anti-dumping policies have alleged that the methods used to
compare prices in the EU and in exporters' home markets are opaque and
arbitrary, allowing wide scope to determine that dumping has taken place and
injuring local manufacturers.
According to Electronics Times, the trade magazine, the provisional duties
on television sets will affect most of the countries under investigation.
However, some companies will be exempt, including those which co-operated
with the Commission's inquiries.
European-owned manufacturers of television sets still dominate the EU
market, though Philips and Thomson produce sets in Asia as well as in
Europe.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Clinton warns Haiti, 'Time is up': Invasion force gathers as
junta hopes talks may prevent bloodshed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton signalled last night that the US was ready to invade
Haiti, warning the military junta: 'Your time is up. Leave now or we will
force you from power.'
His blunt threat came as Washington intensified preparations for a US-led
force to go ashore in the Caribbean republic to restore to power the exiled
president, Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
The Haiti strongman, General Raoul Cedras, last night declared an intention
to 'defend my country' and warned of a 'massacre'. But in a sign that his
junta might be wavering, he added that he hoped talks would prevent
bloodshed.
Mr Clinton, in a televised address, said the US had exhausted diplomacy and
now must act to protect its interests in the region and to stop brutal
atrocities in Haiti.
While the US could not and should not be the 'world's policeman', it had a
responsibility to act when 'brutality occurs close to its shores', even
though there were 'risks'. Mindful of post-Vietnam concern in the US to
avoid lengthy military operations abroad, he pledged that the 'vast
majority' of US troops would return home 'within months, not years'. Mr
Clinton warned Americans they could face a fresh wave of refugees from Haiti
if nothing was done to force the country's military rulers from power.
He attempted to disarm critics of Mr Aristide by disclosing that fresh
elections would be held in Haiti next year and the exiled president would
hand over to a successor early in 1996.
Mr Clinton set no deadline for the junta to leave, nor did he set any date
for an invasion.
The military tempo built up, however, as the navy command ship Mount Whitney
set sail yesterday from Norfolk, Virginia. It will direct a gathering armada
of at least 18 US warships, including two aircraft carriers, as well as 14
military cargo transport vessels. All warships are expected to be on
station, ready for action, by Sunday. The US also announced the call-up of
1,600 reservists for back-up roles such as logistics, medical support and
policing.
The United Nations Security Council has already authorised a multi-national
force to use 'all necessary means to facilitate the departure from Haiti of
the military leadership' which seized power from Mr Aristide in 1991.
Senior administration officials said the US assumed that American-led troops
would have to make a 'forced entry' into Haiti, but Washington still hoped
the junta would realise 'their best alternative is to leave and not to try
to resist this force'. Mr Clinton's speech was partly designed to gain US
public support for a military action that currently is unpopular. Recent
opinion polls showed 66 per cent or more of those questioned opposed an
invasion. Republicans and many Democratic members of Congress have urged the
president to seek congressional authorisation for military action - a vote
he would be unlikely to win.
In Haiti, almost all open supporters of Mr Aristide have gone into hiding -
fearing they will be targets of the country's military.
Their decision to go underground follows the murder of several of his
prominent supporters in the past two years. It was encouraged by statements
from army officers last week that 'traitorous' Haitians would 'pay' if there
was an invasion.
There is growing fear in the capital, Port-au-Prince, that the country's
military may turn its guns on the slums, where Mr Aristide has significant
popular support.
Although Haiti's poorly equipped and poorly trained army of 7,000 has been
expanded by a recruitment programme, it is not expected to offer much
resistance to an invading force expected to be three times larger. But
maverick elements in the military are considered likely to hide in the slums
or countryside and begin guerrilla resistance.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Retail sales dip prompts doubts on timing of rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retail sales dipped last month, prompting some commentators to ask whether
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, had acted prematurely when he raised bank
base rates by a half percentage point this week to scotch incipient
inflation.
Sales volumes fell an estimated, seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent between
July and August, confounding City expectations of a 0.2 per cent rise, the
Central Statistical Office reported.
Compared with August last year there was a 2.9 per cent rise, a sharp
slowdown compared with July's 3.8 per cent year-on-year growth. It was the
second lowest annual growth rate this year.
Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of
Commerce and an outspoken critic of Monday's interest rate rise, said the
sales data 'confirmed the BCC's concerns about the fragility of consumer
demand' and underlined the difficulties faced by retailers.
The British Retail Consortium, which represents more than 90 per cent of the
UK retail sector, said the figures confirmed 'an even more cautious approach
to spending' among consumers after many months of modest and steady sales
growth. Mr James May, the consortium's director-general, warned of an
'inevitable adverse impact on consumer confidence' from the base rate rise.
In the City, Mr Don Smith, an economist with Midland Global Markets, said
the drop in sales provided 'clear evidence' that the tax increases decided
in last year's two budgets were taking effect. The figures 'resonate
strongly with other evidence pointing to weakening consumer demand, such as
car registrations, housing sales and consumer credit', he said.
But Mr John Marsland, an analyst with UBS, said three months growth rates,
which showed volume retail sales advancing at 3.3 per cent compared with the
year before, 'remained very favourable'.
The Treasury, while admitting that high street activity slackened a little
last month, said retail sales volumes were continuing a steady upward trend.
One official suggested that the flattening of sales in August could be a
sign that growth was becoming better balanced, with exports and investment
playing a bigger part in the recovery.
Non-seasonally adjusted figures put the average weekly value of retail sales
in August at Pounds 2.85bn, in line with the weekly average in recent months
and 3.4 per cent higher than in August 1993.
The figures helped ease fears of inflationary pressures in financial
markets.
Prices of government gilt-edged stocks rose, helped by the better tone of US
and German bond markets, and the removal of some stock overhanging the
market. On the Liffe futures exchange, the December long gilt future was at
99 21/32 in late trading, up  13/16 on the day.
The FT-SE 100 index gained 32.9 points to close at 3,112.7, after seven
consecutive days of decline. Trade, however, was mostly technically driven.
Sterling recorded gains against the D-Mark, off-setting losses against the
dollar and leaving its trade weighted index unchanged at 79.2.

FT  16 SEP 94 / ITT to raise Dollars 4bn by sale of financial subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITT, the US conglomerate cited as a possible buyer of General Electric's NBC
television network, is planning to raise up to Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) by
selling its financial services subsidiary.
Although ITT refused to comment publicly, it is believed that the company
has decided to fund a big push into the leisure and entertainment industry
by selling ITT Financial, a middle-ranking US finance company.
ITT hopes the sale will bring in between Dollars 3bn and Dollars 4bn. That
would go a long way towards matching the sum of nearly Dollars 5bn that Walt
Disney, the US entertainment group, is reported to have offered GE for NBC.
Alternatively, ITT could offer GE its financial services division in part
exchange for NBC. GE might be interested because its financial services arm,
GE Capital, is in some of the same business areas as ITT Financial.
ITT Financial offers a range of financial services to businesses and
individuals, including commercial equipment and real estate loans, small
business loans, home mortgages, consumer loans and related insurance
products. Last year it made net profits of Dollars 205m on revenues of
Dollars 1.44bn.
The parent company is understood to be selling ITT Financial because it
wants to achieve a more even balance between its financial services
operations - also comprising the Hartford insurance group, which is not
being sold - and its other two main activities: leisure and entertainment,
including the Sheraton hotels group, and manufacturing, including an auto
parts business.
ITT's reported interest in NBC follows a series of moves aimed at expanding
the group's leisure and entertainment interests.
Last month, in partnership with Cablevision Systems, a US cable television
company, it bought the Madison Square Garden sports and entertainment
complex for Dollars 1.1bn, and the company is in the process of taking over
Ciga, the Italian luxury hotels group.
Other recent moves include the unveiling of plans earlier this year for a
Dollars 750m, 3,500-room casino and hotel complex called the Desert Kingdom
in Las Vegas.
ITT is one of a number of suitors reported to be interested in buying NBC
following the recent disclosure that GE had had talks with Time Warner, the
US information and entertainment group, about a possible sale of all or part
of the television network.

FT  16 SEP 94 / Haitian leaders defiant as invasion threat grows
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Haitian paramilitary recruits train in front of the presidential palace in
Port-au-Prince as the threat of a US-led invasion to restore President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide intensified.
Leaders of the country's military junta warned yesterday that they would not
give way to US threats but their ill-equipped and poorly trained army is not
expected to offer much resistance to an invading force.
In the US, defence secretary William Perry announced the call-up of about
1,700 reservists and President Bill Clinton met senior foreign policy and
military advisers ahead of a televised address to the nation. Many political
commentators urged him not to authorise the invasion.

FT  16 SEP 94 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: S&amp;U up 15% to Pounds 2.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 17th September 1994) appended to this article.
S&amp;U, the consumer credit group, reported interim pre-tax profits up 15 per
cent at Pounds 2.61m for the half year to July 31, against Pounds 2.27m last
time.
Mr Derek Prosser, chairman, said the general upturn in the financial
services industry, together with its own organic expansion, had been behind
the rise. 'We have seen a strong rise in demand from consumers which we have
been able to respond to,' he said.
Earnings per share increased 15 per cent to 14.24p (12.33p), while the
dividend is raised from an adjusted 2.36p to 3p. Turnover improved 13 per
cent to Pounds 28.69m (Pounds 25.3m).
Mr Prosser said current trading was also encouraging and he was 'reasonably
optimistic' about prospects for the full year.
The Birmingham-based company is involved in selling financial services,
predominantly small unsecured loans, to a customer base of 120,000, serviced
largely by an army of door-to-door part-time sales staff. It is also
involved in selling insurance and merchandise.
CORRECTION
Mr Derek Coombs, chairman of S&amp;U, was incorrectly named in a report on the
consumer credit company's results published yesterday.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Amnesty in plea to Brazil on human rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Amnesty International yesterday called on candidates in next month's
Brazilian elections to make human rights a priority for the next government.
In a report highlighting several recent cases of human rights abuse in
Brazil, Amnesty also made several recommendations for improving the judicial
system as well as the police, who have been implicated in several of the
worst abuses.
'The killings and torture can only be stopped if the people elected to
government give a high enough priority to actively promoting and protecting
human rights,' said the report.
The report contained a summary of some of Brazil's recent highly publicised
human rights cases. These include the 1992 prison massacre at Carandiru in
Sao Paulo, when 111 prisoners were killed by police, and last year's murder
of eight street children in Rio de Janeiro.
Amnesty also highlighted the problems faced by Brazil's overcrowded prison
system and the alleged involvement of off-duty police in 'death squads'
hired to kill petty criminals or drug rivals.
Brazil has tended to accept, sometimes grudgingly, human rights criticism.
Complaints about the Sao Paulo police following the Carandiru massacre led
to a sharp fall in the number of civilians killed by the police, from more
than 100 a month to about 20 a month.
Amnesty said Brazil's police needed 'radical change' in its organisational
culture and operations. At present, members of the police are tried in
military courts, a hangover from Brazil's 1964-85 military rule. According
to Amnesty, such cases should be transferred to civilian courts because
military courts fail to convict police in human rights cases.
Amnesty is due to meet the two frontrunners in the presidential elections,
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, tomorrow.

FT  15 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Inchcape weak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JEFFREY BROWN, STEVE THOMPSON and RAMRAJ GOGNA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inchcape, the vehicle distributor, continued to slide, the shares losing 17
to close at 415p. The long-term strength of the yen, which has driven up
Japanese import prices, has hit Inchcape sales. Analysts forecast that the
results due on September 26 will be below last year's. One leading analyst
forecast pre-tax profits for the first half of Pounds 115m, down from last
year's Pounds 130m, and there is City sentiment that the group may have to
regain a good deal of ground in the second half.
Prudential shares performed well, closing a penny up on balance at 314p
after good turnover of 5.6m. The interim figures came in above most
estimates and there was satisfaction with the 9 per cent increase in the
dividend. Legal &amp; General lost 8 to 453p ahead of this morning's interims.
P&amp;O retreated 14 to 660p on profit-taking in thin volume.
Better than expected half-year profits from Associated British Ports pushed
the shares up 9 to 272p.
Airports group BAA put on 2 at 495p as traders digested August's strong
passenger flows which, showing a rise of 6.4 per cent, have further
underlined the trend to weakening market share at British Airways, where
passenger volume could only gain 5.2 per cent for last month. BA dipped 4 to
393p.
Eurotunnel slipped a penny to 270p, perilously near to the 265p price of
May's rights issue.
Shell Transport moved in the opposite direction to BP, the shares slipping
11 to 722p, with dealers noting renewed switching out of the stock and into
BP, in spite of the prospect of a good interim dividend increase being
announced this afternoon.
Most analysts are looking for Shell to lift the interim payment by around 10
per cent.
Calor Group came in for good support after revealing better than expected
first-half figures. Dealers are looking for a healthy increase in the
group's final dividend and the shares moved up 7 to 294p. 'A yield premium
of 45 per cent is just about right for Calor, which is not a growth stock,'
said one analyst.
There were no shocks with Lasmo's interims, and the shares dipped 4 to 155p.
British Gas failed to hold on to an early modest rise, easing to close a net
4 off at 290p ahead of tomorrow's analysts trip to Hinckley.
Biotech group Celltech held steady at 206p as a huge overhang of stock was
removed after the administrators of residual shareholder British &amp;
Commonwealth offloaded most of its stake into the market. Celltech announced
that Cazenove had placed 12.5m shares in the market at 200p each, 11m of
which came from the B&amp;C administrators and took their stake down to 4.3 per
cent from 19.9 per cent.
Blenheim, Europe's largest conference organiser, dropped 28 to 215p after
warning that tough trading in its key French market meant full-year profits
would come in below budget.
Media and communications group Aegis declined 2 to 30p on disappointing
interims.
Retailer Marks and Spencer recovered from a day's low of 402p to end a net 1
1/2 higher at 406p after bargain hunters were encouraged by elements of the
latest UK inflation data.
Some analysts pointed out that a 2.2 per cent gain in clothing and footwear
would benefit the high street chain. They said M&amp;S had avoided much of the
increase in raw materials prices by buying forward.
Half-time figures from sausage skin manufacturer Devro International failed
to please and the shares dropped 19 to 230p.
British Aerospace stood out among a number of sharp engineering share price
movements, sliding 16 to 478p in nervous trading ahead of next week's
half-year results.
British Steel edged ahead a half-penny to 149p against the market trend.
Trading volume was a heavy 11m, with the shares acquiring something of a
refuge stock tag.
There were steep declines in some of the smaller market capitalisations,
notably Ransomes, best known for its lawn mowers and down 7 at 57p, and
controls and compressed air specialist Siebe, 15 weaker at 536p for a drop
this week of 29.

FT  15 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Carlton optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JEFFREY BROWN, STEVE THOMPSON and RAMRAJ GOGNA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Media group Carlton Communications stood out as the principal bright spot in
the London market as the shares responded to reports of growing advertising
revenue, as well as company presentations to analysts.
Latest industry research shows that forward booking for advertising slots in
October has increased by 6 per cent. The pressure is thought to have come
from the emergence of some big advertisers such as Eurotunnel - ahead of the
opening to the public of the Channel tunnel - and the National Lottery.
There is also the traditional pre-Christmas pick-up.
Analysts pointed out that as there is no need for production costs to rise
the increased demand would translate directly into bottom line profits.
Carlton is the UK's leading independent television group and the stock
received additional support from company presentations ahead of the group's
September year-end. The shares jumped 19 to 875p with turnover higher than
average at 2.2m.

FT  15 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: BP firm against the trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JEFFREY BROWN, STEVE THOMPSON and RAMRAJ GOGNA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A reiteration of NatWest Securities' positive stance, plus a profits upgrade
and expectations of good news from today's presentation to analysts, helped
British Petroleum shares extend their recent outperformance against the rest
of the stock market.
The share price, which set an all-time high of 430p last week, ended the
session a penny firmer at 417 1/2 p after heavy turnover of 13m shares.
NatWest, in a buy note published yesterday, said BP shares have outperformed
the UK market by 50 per cent since July 1992 and argued that 'steps taken to
improve the competitiveness of its upstream business could boost earnings by
some Pounds 440m, or 8p a share, at any given level of oil prices'.
NatWest's oil team, adopting a conservative line on a new 'federal'
structure in BP's upstream businesses which it said will drive the new
competitiveness, increased its 1996 earnings per share forecast by 10 per
cent to 40.4p and for 1997 by the same figure to 42.7p.
The presentation to analysts, to be given by BP's exploration director Mr
John Browne, is expected to include more good news from BP's operations
across the globe, but especially from Colombia, Vietnam and west of the
Shetland Islands.

FT  15 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures took a beating yesterday, hit first by the release of
disappointing UK inflation data and tumbling further in mid-afternoon when
the cash market came under heavy selling pressure, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The September contract on the FT-SE 100 got under way at 3,120 but
deteriorated almost from the opening. It closed at 3,064, with the discount
to the cash market standing at 16 and a fair value premium of slightly under
one point.
The retreat was mostly led by independent traders - locals - who continued
to dominate business, but at least one leading institutional marketmaker was
said to be active on a day when volume was broadly in line with the previous
day.
Trading volume totalled 21,874 lots, with up to 8,000 of this reflecting
roll-over into the December contract, where turnover was just short of
10,000. The September contract expires tomorrow morning.
Activity in traded options tailed off, falling slightly below 40,000,
against 56,282 on Tuesday. FT-SE option volume just topped 20,000, making
24,948 with the inclusion of the Euro FT-SE option trade.
Barclays (2,082 lots) and Glaxo (1,704) were the most actively traded
individual stock options, with British Petroleum and HSBC Holdings not far
behind.

FT  15 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares fall heavily after August
inflation data - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market suffered its largest one-day drop for nearly four months
yesterday after an unexpected jump in the August retail price index raised
concern that this week's rise in base rates might soon be followed by
another. Led by selling from the futures markets, the FT-SE 100-share Index
fell 41.6 points, breaking through an important support level, to finish at
3,079.8.
The 0.5 per cent rise in headline inflation in August was worse than
expected and served to explain the factors behind Monday's  1/2 percentage
point increase in Bank of England lending rate - one agency reporting that
Treasury ministers had seen the preliminary headline figures last week.
Average earnings statistics remained steady but a dip in the August
unemployment rate was seen as indicating strengthening economic recovery.
Equities opened firmly, benefiting from overnight strength on Wall Street,
but were quickly overwhelmed by the RPI figures and the consequent setback
in UK government bonds. Attempts to rally proved unsuccessful and the
Footsie was already down by 41 points at midsession.
The mood was not helped in the afternoon by negative comments on German
interest rate prospects from the deputy president of the Bundesbank, ahead
of today's meeting of the central bank's policy committee; a survey of
analysts voted heavily against the likelihood of a rate cut today by the
Bundesbank.
The Footsie teetered on the 3,080 mark for some time, as UK equity chartists
warned that a move below this level would leave the index vulnerable down to
3,050 and then, perhaps, all the way to 2,970. But the late afternoon saw
further weakness, with the September futures contract on the Footsie traded
down to 3,067.
London paid no heed to the New York market, where the Dow Industrial Average
was two points off in UK hours following the announcement of the latest US
wholesale price statistics.
Although trading volume was not greatly different from recent daily levels,
there was no doubting the waves of red on the trading screens as
marketmakers lowered their prices in the face of determined selling. At
least one large selling programme was identified, said to be from a London
trading house noted for its astute dealing instincts.
The setback spared no sectors of the market. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, taking
in a range of non-Footsie stocks, dropped by 50.7 points to 3,628.4. There
were substantial losses among the consumer and leisure stocks. Building and
construction shares suffered more modest losses, but only because they had
already reacted sharply when base rates were raised at the beginning of the
week.
Bank shares reacted badly to worries that their customers might slide back
into the bad debtor category if domestic interest rates continue to rise.
Even the utility sectors, which have been seen as defensive areas in a
nervous market, proved unable to resist the general trend.
The speed of the market's reaction restrained the would-be sellers, who saw
prices tumbling before they could reach their telephones. The day's Seaq
total declined to 539.6m shares from the 587.2m recorded on Tuesday, when
retail business was worth Pounds 1.16bn.
The stock market went home in a thoroughly chastened mood, with traders
awaiting the further economic data due this week from both sides of the
Atlantic. Today brings the UK retail sales figures for last month, which
analysts believe will show a slowdown from the 0.4 per cent growth of the
preceding month.
The latest UK Public Sector Borrowing estimates are due tomorrow, when
markets also face the August production figures from the US.

FT  15 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Perplexing economic data
ignored by Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices made some progress yesterday afternoon in spite of mixed
economic news and a lethargic bond market, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 15.47 higher at 3,895.33, thanks
in part to computer-guided buy programs which lifted some blue chips late in
the session. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.28 ahead at 468.80 and the
Nasdaq composite added 2.77 at 768.60. NYSE volume was 296m shares.
During the morning, the thin activity suggested that investors were
perplexed about the current state of the economy. The day's economic news
may have served to compound the uncertainty.
The Commerce Department announced a 0.8 per cent increase in August retail
sales, a weaker result than the 1.0 per cent gain which had been forecast.
But in spite of the recent anxiety over inflation, the market could gain
little comfort from the report. Retail sales, excluding cars, came in at 0.7
per cent, against expectations of a 0.4 per cent gain. This indicated that
activity was stronger than suggested by the headline figure.
Stocks held steady on the release of the data, with the bond market offering
no guidance whatsoever. With Treasuries showing no change, share prices
meandered within a narrow range throughout the morning.
The release of the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report on economic
conditions at midday elicited a muted reaction, too. In finding that the
economy continued to grow at a moderate pace, the Fed told a story with
which Wall Street was already familiar.
Still, the Dow industrials built up some momentum during the afternoon.
Caterpillar rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 55 1/8 , Coca-Cola Dollars 1 1/8
to Dollars 47 1/8 and United Technology Dollars 1 to Dollars 64 1/4.
American Express put on Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 31 7/8 , buoyed no doubt by
its recent moves in the travel and credit card businesses.
Heightened speculation on the future of the NBC broadcasting network
influenced the share prices of the companies involved.
Walt Disney, which was reported to be in talks on acquiring NBC from General
Electric, slipped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 41 1/4 . GE rose Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 50 1/4 . Time Warner, also said to be discussing a possible deal,
edged down Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 36.
Following Kohlberg Kravis Roberts' Dollars 2bn bid for Borden, Quaker Oats
inspired early buying from those who consider the food group as a likely
target. The stock had been up Dollars 2 3/4 by midday, but receded later to
Dollars 79 1/2 for a gain of Dollars 3/8.
CompUSA, an electronics retailer, jumped Dollars 2 1/4, or 24 per cent, to
Dollars 12 amid reports of insider buying and a strong sales outlook.
Canada
Toronto sought fresh impetus in the aftermath of the Quebec election as the
market also awaited a speech later in the day in which Quebec's president
elect Jacques Parizeau was expected to lay out his sovereignty plans.
In spite of a 0.9 per cent decline in the heavily weighted gold shares
sub-index, the TSE 300 composite index was a slight 0.81 of a point firmer
at the close at 4,345.03, while gaining issues outnumbered losers by 371 to
360. Volume came to a moderate 56.1m shares.
Brazil
Equities in Sao Paulo, after early firmness, closed a net 0.63 per cent down
in heavy trade, rattled by unconfirmed rumours late in the session that some
small financial institutions and a state-owned bank faced liquidity
difficulties. The Bovespa index was finally off 346 points at 54,764.
'Shares dropped on rumours that a major state bank was having problems in
squaring its position at the central bank,' a broker at a leading commercial
bank said. 'If that is true, other small banks would be affected as well.'
Analysts said recent central bank action, aimed at squeezing the market's
liquidity, was the cause of the rumours. Chart analysts said investors could
also have used the rumours as an excuse to cash profits after stocks had
risen 86 per cent so far this year.
The market was also keeping a close eye on Telebras' performance after a
federal judge's ruling that cancelled a 1990 Telebras share subscription.
The ruling has to be ratified by a second judge next week. Telebras
preferred fell 1.5 per cent to RDollars 52.

FT  15 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Goldman Sachs has this week increased its asset allocation in the emerging
markets of Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong and Mexico, at the expense of
exposure to Europe and Japan. The US investment bank noted that emerging
markets would benefit most from US investment flows resulting from the
slowdown in the US economy 'as the degree of risk aversion falls in rising
equity markets; more importantly, the emerging markets retain a significant
advantage in that they are trading at p/e to growth ratios that are well
below those prevailing in the G5 countries'.
As far as Mexico is concerned, Baring Securities, in its latest monthly
strategy update on the country, reports that the stock market has not fully
discounted the new political environment for the short and medium term, and
at a 1995 price/earnings ratio of 13.8 Mexico is rated last among the six
top Latin American markets. Baring forecasts, in its most likely scenario,
index targets of 3,180 for end-1994 and 4,177 for end-1995.

FT  15 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Weak bonds leave bourses
trading lower
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses fell back in the afternoon as bonds weakened.
AMSTERDAM retreated slightly in line with the performance on neighbouring
markets. The AEX index slipped 2.13 to 410.56.
DSM continued to move ahead, helped by reports of brokers' upgrades, with
the shares rising at one stage to an all-time high of Fl 156.50, before
falling off at the close to finish Fl 2.80 higher at Fl 152.00.
Hoare Govett has put a buy recommendation on the stock and forecast that the
chemical's group would continue to show a sharp increase in profits in the
next few years, helped particularly by the rise in plastics prices. The
broker raised its estimates for 1994 and 1995 earnings per share to Fl 13
from Fl 10 and to Fl 19 from Fl 15 respectively.
The other main story of the day concerned KLM, which said it had bought the
stake held by Foster's, the Australian brewer, in Northwest, lifting its
holding from 20 per cent to 25 per cent.
KLM said it would use part of the proceeds from its share issue earlier this
year to fund the purchase, estimated at some Fl 180m. KLM closed 10 cents up
at Fl 49.40.
FRANKFURT increased its losses in the post-bourse, after a negative earlier
session, as the market came under pressure from bunds. The Dax index ended
official hours off 11.97 at 2,124.12, and in the Ibis retreated to 2,118.08.
Turnover remained low at DM6.8bn.
Brokers do not expect the market to receive a lift from the meeting of the
Bundesbank today, with no movement on interest rates expected.
The expiration of options tomorrow has also unsettled investors this week.
ZURICH extended losses during the afternoon, with lower bond futures and the
weak dollar depressing the mood. The SMI index lost 21.1 at 2,637.7.
Mr Michael Clark at Robert Fleming Securities commented that relative to the
rest of Europe, the performance of the Swiss market had been volatile over
the summer, suffering as the key sectors in the market - the financials,
chemicals and drugs, and foods - had been out of favour.
Although sentiment towards these stocks had changed somewhat in the past few
weeks, he said, it did not appear to be enough to generate any further
significant recovery in the prices of stocks such as Nestle and the drug
issues, except possibly Roche, for the time being.
Among chemicals, Roche certificates declined SFr70 to SFr6,155 and the
Sandoz bearer shares finished SFr8 cheaper at SFr692.
CS Holding, upgraded to a buy by James Capel following its decision to
withdraw its bid for Austria's Creditanstalt-Bankverein, slipped SFr3 to
SFr564, while UBS retreated SFr8 to SFr1,212.
Nestle weakened SFr16 to SFr1,220 as investors sold holdings ahead of
today's half-year figures.
Cyclicals put in a firmer performance, with BBC bearers SFr3 higher at
SFr1,172 and Sulzer registered SFr11 ahead at SFr692.
PARIS was upset by pressure in the matif, sending the CAC-40 index down
16.42 to 1,952.94. The index moved in a range between 1,968 and 1,949 as
turnover reached FFr2.8bn.
Peugeot was hit by the news of the imminent Renault privatisation, its
shares falling FFr29 to FFr796.
Better news came to the assistance of Bancaire, up FFr34.20 at FFr487.50, as
it reported good first-half figures.
MILAN remained on the upward track in technically driven trade ahead of
today's end of the September account. The Comit index rose 6.74, or 1 per
cent, to 654.93.
Insurers led the market's advance, with Generali rising L750, or 1.8 per
cent, to L41,550 ahead of the bonus one-for-10 rights issue which begins
tomorrow.
Mediobanca put on L200 at L13,900 after the merchant bank said that its
capital increase, postponed because of poor market conditions in June, would
be discussed at a shareholders meeting on October 28.
The FT-SE Eurotrack Indices committee has approved the quarterly changes to
the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 and 200 indices. The following constituent changes
will be made on September 19: for inclusion, KPN, INA and Philips
Electronics; for exclusion, Fomento de Construcciones, Banca Commerciale
Italiana and Stet. On the indicative reserve list: Telecom Italia,
Schneider, Volkswagen (Reg), Investor 'B', Zurich Insurance (Reg) and Akzo
Nobel.

posts intraday record

<TEXT>
Speculative sales, corporate profit-taking and index-led selling by
arbitrageurs pushed the Nikkei 225 average lower, agencies report from
Toyko.
However, many investors remained absent ahead of today's national holiday.
The Nikkei 225 was down 126.38 at 19,919.38 after a day's high of 20,040.71
and low of 19,906.08.
With public funds quiet, the market was weighed down by domestic
corporations engaged in last-minute profit-taking on short-term tokkin
funds, index-led selling by arbitrageurs, and investors taking short
positions on speculative shares. Foreign investors were mostly inactive.
Volume on the first section was estimated at 270m shares, down from
Tuesday's 339.2m. Retreating stocks outnumbered rises by 743 to 227, with
207 issues unchanged. The Nikkei 300 slipped 1.52 to 289.24 and the Topix
index shed 8.55 to 1,583.96. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was off 0.70
at 1,294.37.
Turnover on the second section was estimated at 7m shares, little changed
from the previous day's 6.6m.
Tsumura, a Chinese medicine manufacturer, became the target of speculative
selling, falling Y120 to Y1,050 on the day's third biggest volume of 6.2m
shares. Newspapers reported that the company faced business and management
difficulties.
Magara Construction dropped Y65 to Y905 on turnover of 2.4m shares, while
Sanrio declined Y180 to Y1,430.
After the market closed, Hanwa, a steel trading company, announced that it
expected a large net loss for the first fiscal half - likely to total
Y175bn.
The share price of Hino Motor jumped Y21 to Y959 following its announcement
that it expected to see pre-tax profits rise by 2.2 times in the current
fiscal year. Nissan Motor, following Tuesday's advance, receded Y8 to Y785
on turnover of 2.7m shares.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone moved forward Y6,000 to Y894,000 and DDI
improved Y2,000 to Y886,000, but the newly listed Japan Telecom finished
Y50,000 weaker at Y4.15m, unable to sustain a morning rally.
Roundup
Some regional markets moved sharply higher.
SEOUL continued its advance, in spite of Won25bn of sales by the stock
market stabilisation fund, which stepped in shortly after the composite
index hit a record high of 1,007.98. The index ended 3.98 up at 999.36 amid
speculation that securities regulators would meet tomorrow to discuss
overseas listing by primary blue chips.
Samsung Electronics renewed its record peak, gaining Won3,000 at Won144,700.
BANGKOK rallied throughout the day, led by recently weak banks, and the SET
index closed 28.41, or 1.9 per cent, better at 1,536.14. Turnover rose to
Bt12.7bn from Bt7.09bn.
TAIPEI was propelled 1 per cent higher by a late surge in financial stocks,
which took the weighted index above 7,000.
Demand for the Big Three commercial banks, fuelled by the lifting of a
three-day routine ban on margin trading a month before shareholder meetings
by Chang Hwa and Hua Nan, pushed the market up 70.16 to 7,025. Turnover was
an active TDollars 69.79bn.
Chang Hwa climbed TDollars 13 to TDollars 206, Hwa Nan TDollars 14 to
TDollars 229 and First Commercial, which still has two days of its three-day
ban to run, TDollars 12 to TDollars 194.
MANILA rose on renewed buying of blue chips and some second liners. The
composite index finished 28.35 ahead at 2,981.59 as investors positioned
themselves in anticipation of the announcement of a new basket of shares in
the index, expected later in the day.
Metro Bank surged 10.3 per cent to 800 pesos amid reports that it will be
included in the index. The newly listed Mondragon jumped 7.81 per cent to
7.50 pesos.
HONG KONG encountered selling of property and finance shares from London
which wiped out earlier gains, and the Hang Seng index closed 90.61 down at
9,846.40.
Some brokers said the late selling followed allegations by the
Beijing-controlled China News Agency that the colonial government had given
Jardine Matheson a container terminal contract in return for its support for
Governor Chris Patten's political reform programme. But there was little
impact on the Jardine shares, Jardine Matheson easing 50 cents to HKDollars
74.25 and Jardine Strategic 40 cents to HKDollars 32.40.
The Hang Seng index of 11 H shares shot up 46.48, or 3.2 per cent, to a
day's high of 1,518.37 before profit-takers dragged it back to finish at
1,478.69, up just 6.80.
SINGAPORE drifted lower in drab dealings, while Malaysian stocks traded over
the counter fell back from intraday highs. The Straits Times Industrial
index eased 1.35 to 2,298.31.
KUALA LUMPUR ended well off the day's high after profit-taking took its toll
of a market still driven by rotational play of speculative stocks. The
composite index closed 4.73 up at 1,173.84 after touching 1,182.29.
KARACHI was supported by hopes that foreign interest in an offering of
Pakistan Telecommunications Corporation vouchers abroad would boost
confidence in the domestic market. The KSE 100-share index climbed 23.56, or
1.1 per cent, to 2,212.33. Brokers said yesterday the PTC issue could be
heavily oversubscribed.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Gains for Swiss franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continued uncertainty about the outcome of next month's German national
elections yesterday helped the Swiss franc to its strongest level since
October 1991, writes Philip Gawith.
Investors seeking exposure to core European currencies, but wanting to
lighten their D-Mark holdings, drove the franc to a London close of SFr0.83,
from SFr0.834 on Tuesday, against the D-Mark.
Elsewhere in Europe, though, the D-Mark was generally firmer on declining
expectations of another round of rate cuts. Against the escudo and peseta it
finished at Es102.2 from Es101.9 and at Pta83.12 from Pta82.92.
In spite of firmer than expected retail sales figures, and rumours of
central bank intervention, the dollar closed lower at DM1.5374 from DM1.5493
and at Y98.875 from Y99.045. But in New York it picked up to end at DM1.5416
and Y99.20.
Sterling finished firmer against the dollar, but down against the D-Mark,
with the trade weighted index unchanged at 79.2.
Although the Swiss economy is benefiting from good growth and inflation
performances, analysts said the main engine behind the recent appreciation
was rising political uncertainty in Germany.
Markets are now nervous about whether Chancellor Kohl and his alliance
partners will win sufficient support in next month's elections to continue
governing without having to enter a grand coalition.
The D-Mark had recently been bid up following renewed discussion of a
multi-tier Europe. But investors, concerned that their exposure to Germany
had become overweight, have recently been diversifying into the franc.
Some observers believe the Swiss franc is vulnerable to a downside
correction, possibly aided by a cut in central bank rates. The central bank
has recently been very accommodating in its money market operations, with a
three-month money bid rate of 3.93 per cent.
Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior international economist at UBS, said this might
indicate central bank concern at the impact of exchange rate appreciation on
exporters. He said technical charts suggested that if the franc appreciated
through SFr0.8230, it might well revisit the 1990 levels of around
SFr0.8130.
The higher than expected UK retail price index, which rose 2.4 per cent in
the year to August, unsettled the short end of the interest rate market,
raising fears of a further tightening of monetary policy. The December short
sterling contract traded some 48,000 lots to end 14 basis points down at
93.23, and prices fell across the length of the yield curve.
Analysts said the figures had undermined, in some quarters, the view that
Monday's 50 basis-point rise in interest rates had been a pre-emptive strike
against inflation.
Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at broker GNI, said there was a 'disturbing
bear market psychology' afield, and added that investors were using the
futures market to hedge cash positions. Futures prices were reflecting this
selling pressure, rather than a market view of likely interest rates.
Mr Phillips said the market was looking for another 50 basis-point rise in
rates before Christmas, rather than the 100 basis points the December
contract is discounting.
In its daily operations the Bank of England provided UK money markets with
late assistance of Pounds 40m after forecasting a Pounds 200m shortage. It
did not operate in the morning or afternoon rounds. Overnight money traded
between 4 1/4 and 6 1/4 per cent. Three-month sterling LIBOR was unchanged
at 5 13/16 per cent.
Currency markets appeared to have taken a more positive view of Monday's
monetary tightening. Mr Avinash Persaud, currency strategist at JP Morgan in
London, said there was now a prospect of sterling decoupling from the
dollar.
Earlier in the year, sterling had tracked the dollar rather than the D-Mark,
with the market taking the UK policy background - an early pick-up in
growth, concerns about inflation and a deteriorating current account - as
more similar to the US than Europe.
But Monday's rate move, he added, had gone some way to overcoming market
scepticism about the authorities' willingness to take the necessary steps to
combat inflation.
Other factors lending support to the pound were potential D-Mark weakness,
ahead of the elections; and relative bond market stability, meaning that
there was less incentive to take refuge in the D-Mark.
There is little expectation of a shift in German interest rates at today's
Bundesbank council meeting.
Ms Phyllis Reed, fixed income strategist at BZW, said that while she
expected a further cut in rates, the Bank would probably wait for a suitable
peg to hang it on - probably in the form of an improved set of money supply
figures.
The repo rate also looks unlikely to move, following comments from Mr Johann
Wilhelm Gaddum, the Bundesbank deputy president. He said the current money
supply situation could not justify cutting the repo rate to 4.8 per cent,
from 4.85 per cent.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK set to maintain cereal crop
yields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK wheat crop is expected to rise by 3 per cent this year in an overall
cereals harvest little changed from last year at 19.6m tonnes, according to
preliminary estimates by the National Farmers' Union.
The French wheat crop is expected to be 4 per cent higher than last year,
but German barley yields could be 10 per cent lower because of drought, the
NFU anticipates.
The NFU points out that, although British cereals output is likely to be
little changed from last year's 19.5m tonnes, the composition of the crop is
expected to change significantly.
Wheat production is expected to rise but barley output is forecast to fall.
This reflects price expectations made by farmers when planting their crops.
Bad weather caused wide variations in crop yields, but affected both wheat
and barley crops in a similar way.
Crop yields were broadly higher in the south and south-east and lower in the
east Midlands and East Anglia, where heavy rain delayed spring planting.
The NFU also pointed to much higher variations in yield within each region
than had been recorded in previous years.
The area sown with wheat increased by 4 per cent for the 1994 harvest, but
wheat yields fell slightly from 7.3 tonnes per hectare to 7.29 tonnes per
hectare, producing a crop of 13.28m tonnes.
Barley planting continued its downward trend with the winter barley area
falling by 3.5 per cent in England and the spring barley planting dropping
by 9.6 per cent.
Oilseed rape sowings are estimated to have risen by 5.8 per cent but yields
in England and Wales were down by 6 per cent, leading to production
remaining unchanged at around 1m tonnes.
In France, the area sown with cereals declined by about 3 per cent overall,
but most of the drop was in the maize areas. Wheat planting increased by 2
per cent.

A strike in British Columbia's coastal logging and saw milling industry may
yet be averted.
Mr Gerry Stoney, president of the IWA-Canada, representing 15,000 coastal
wood workers, said 'informal attempts' were being made to restart full
negotiations with the employers' group in Forest Industrial Relations.
'We broke off negotiations at the weekend because of a log jam over pay and
job security,' Mr Stoney said in Vancouver yesterday.
FIR has offered 6 per cent over three years plus a CDollars 500 (Pounds 235)
signing bonus, while the IWA-Canada has reduced its original pay demand from
18 per cent to 13 per cent over three years.
'The company must improve their offer before full negotiations can resume,'
said Mr Stoney. 'In any case no settlement is likely before the weekend. Job
security is highly important for us.'
Sporadic stoppages by wood workers on Vancouver Island were halted early
this week after the provincial Labour Relations Board ruled that they were
illegal.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farmers call for cut in
set-aside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European farmers' organisation, Copa, yesterday called for a reduction
in the amount of cereals and oilseed land set aside or left to lie fallow in
the 1994-95 growing season under a European Union scheme.
French and British farm unions have also called for substantial cuts in
set-aside. The UK National Farmers' Union has called on European Union
agriculture ministers to rethink the scheme at next week's council meeting
in Brussels.
Poor weather and current set-aside obligations are expected to cut this
year's EU grain harvest to between 158m and 160m tonnes compared with 166m
tonnes last year. The average harvest before the 1992 Common Agricultural
Policy reforms was 185m tonnes.
Copa said it urgently requested a reduction in the set-aside 'which will not
affect the good functioning of the market'.
Sir David Naish, president of the NFU, warned that if set-aside was
maintained at its current level of 15 per cent, it could prove difficult for
EU farmers to maintain their market.
The European Commission says that 15 per cent was never meant to be a
sacrosanct figure. 'It's a management tool - the figure can go up or down
depending on the real outcome of the harvest,' an official said.
EU cereals stocks have dropped from 33m tonnes to 16m tonnes in the past
year. Farmers' leaders say this could mean European customers having to
import unless the set-aside is reduced.
Sir David is also urging ministers to take the matter up as quickly as
possible to allow time for farmers to adjust planting patterns this autumn.

International coffee prices tumbled by Dollars 153 a tonne yesterday as
London traders expressed confusion over Brazilian government plans to halt
stockpile sales. The November futures contract in London slipped to Dollars
3,840 a tonne.
Brasilia halted its weekly auction of the government coffee stockpile when
it failed to dampen domestic inflation. Yesterday, influential growers'
groups called on the government to restart the auctions, claiming their
members would be adversely affected.
International prices were boosted last week when Brasilia called a halt to
the auctions with the market touching Dollars 4,060 a tonne - close to an 8
1/2 year peak. But prices dropped by Dollars 200 a tonne with speculation
that the government would resume export sales.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Shrinking surplus puts platinum
level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The platinum market is likely to be in balance this year for the first time
since 1989, according to Mr Michael McMahon, chairman of Impala Platinum,
the world's second-biggest producer.
Persistent supply surpluses in the past four years have depressed prices.
Now Impala is forecasting that last year's surplus of 365,000 troy oz will
fall to 80,000 oz.
Mr McMahon suggested yesterday that even this potential surplus might be
eroded because car companies - the biggest users of platinum - had been
re-stocking at a greater rate than Impala had anticipated.
Over-supply hit the market after South African producers increased capacity
following a surge in prices to nearly Dollars 550 an ounce in the late
1980s.
Impala's own expansion plans have been substantially reduced and two
platinum mines in which it has an interest - Kennedy's Vale and Crocodile
River - have been mothballed, while development of the Messina project has
been suspended.
Mr McMahon said it would take about three years to bring the two mines back
into production. Although the industry could look forward to 'steady but
unexciting' growth in demand for platinum, 'this is a commodity-type
industry now and there are ore reserves that can be brought into production
to stop us getting too fat and happy'.
In this context, the decision of BHP, Australia's biggest group, to proceed
with a platinum mine in Zimbabwe was 'misguided,' suggested Mr McMahon.
Platinum reached a 3 1/2 -year peak of Dollars 430 (Pounds 277) an ounce in
July. Last night the price closed in London at Dollars 417.50.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Malaysia, until the late 1980s the world's biggest natural rubber exporter,
has had to import record amounts of the commodity this year to fuel its own
processing industry.
Natural rubber imports increased by 96 per cent in the first five months of
this year to 94,400 tonnes, the Malaysian statistics department said.
In 1988 Malaysia produced 1.8m tonnes of natural rubber, but this year's
production is forecast to be about 1m tonnes. Natural rubber exports in the
first five months of the year were down 6 per cent at 365,000 tonnes.
Labour shortages, sharp increases in land values and a period of low natural
rubber prices which lasted until earlier this year have forced many growers
to turn to more lucrative commodities like palm oil or sell their land for
development.
The country's processing factories have had to make up for a shortfall in
local supply through increased imports, mainly from Thailand and Burma.
Malaysia's processing industry uses about 300,000 tonnes of natural rubber
each year.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India takes on wheat giants -
Farmers can compete now price curbs have gone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Indian government's decision last week to abolish the minimum export
price for durum wheat is expected to boost exports and allow Indian wheat
farmers to compete with major producers like the US, Canada and Australia.
The food ministry has also proposed to the commerce ministry that the
minimum export price of Dollars 200 (Pounds 129) for non-basmati rice be
lifted in an attempt to reverse the fall in rice sales and make this year's
huge surpluses competitive on international markets.
The moves reflect India's willingness to compete with the world's wheat
giants in lucrative markets in north Africa and southern Europe, where durum
wheat is used for making pasta. The relaxation of export curbs is also in
keeping with the Gatt treaty, to which India is a signatory.
Mr Sanjeeva Reddy, director-general of foreign trade, said the minimum
export price of Dollars 160 a tonne for durum was no longer necessary
because local production was rising and wheat supplies for India's domestic
market were adequate.
Exports of durum or superior quality wheat were permitted by the government
last November, subject to a floor price of Dollars 160 a tonne and a ceiling
of 300,000 tonnes a year. The price did not prove competitive on world
markets, and durum exports fell to 59,000 tonnes in the year ended March 31,
down from 3.7m tonnes in 1992-93.
The government, which had rejected a proposal from the commerce ministry to
scrap the floor price last year, is more confident of being self-sufficient
this year. A bumper durum harvest is expected next April after good monsoon
rains this summer.
According to government estimates released in June, India produced 57.8m
tonnes of wheat this year, up from 56.86m the previous year. No separate
estimates for durum are available, but officials in the agriculture ministry
say it accounts for a negligible amount of the total.
In Punjab, farmers in Khanna, Ludhiana district, Asia's largest grain
market, have begun to grow yellow-rust resistant varieties of durum. The
farmers know that while India's low-value bread wheat - used for domestic
consumption - can fetch a maximum price of Dollars 100 a tonne, durum would
yield an additional Dollars 10 a tonne on the market.
About 10 per cent of Punjab's total wheat area is under durum, with a total
production of 0.8-1m tonnes. A small amount of durum is also grown in
central and southern India.
India, the world's fourth largest wheat growing country, has no tradition of
consuming pasta, which remains an essentially western product, and
availability is confined to the cities. The per capita consumption of pasta
products in the country is 80 grams a year compared with 5kg in the US and
30kg in Italy, but government incentives to encourage the growth of durum
for export may help the minuscule domestic pasta market to grow as well.
The arrival of several food multinationals vying for India's vast untapped
markets may further encourage durum wheat growers. Pizza Hut, the American
food chain, will need durum wheat to make its pizza bases.
The removal of the minimum export price does not necessarily guarantee
increased exports. India faces stiff competition from developed countries
like the US, which heavily subsidises its sales using funds available under
its export enhancement programme. While India has difficulty realising a
price of Dollars 100 a tonne, the price of US wheat for Asian markets varies
from Dollars 122 a tonne for hard red winter wheat (HRW) to Dollars 218 a
tonne for durum non-specified (DNS).
Officials in the commerce ministry are even more pessimistic about the
performance of non-basmati rice on the export market, even after the minimum
floor price is lifted. While there was a sharp rise in basmati exports when
the minimum export price was removed in January, Indian non-basmati
varieties would find it hard to compete internationally, even without a
floor price.
Non-basmati exports slumped to 3,984 tonnes last June from 13,096 tonnes in
April.
Officials say that Indian foodgrains, especially rice, cannot compete
internationally, mainly because of the high levels of farm subsidies in
developed countries. Indian foodgrains become even less competitive once
transport and loading costs have been added.
'Once the Uruguay Round agreement is implemented and farm subsidies in
developed countries reduced gradually, India's competitiveness should
increase dramatically,' says an official from the commerce ministry.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Accountancy Column: First, last and the more things change -
Worrying trends in the profession in the 1990s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The contents of the first article and the first column I wrote on becoming
accountancy correspondent could hardly have been more appropriate. They have
set the tone well for the period up to my departure nearly three years
later.
The article concerned a change to professional ethical rules dictating who
could call themselves 'chartered accountants'. Firms would be able to retain
the title even if only three-quarters of their partners were in fact members
of one of the chartered institutes.
The column dealt with Chancery Bank, one of the more ambitious attempts to
effect a corporate rescue using administration, the procedure created by the
1986 insolvency act.
These two broad themes - the commercialisation of the profession and the
varied and painful effects of the prolonged recession - came to dominate
accountancy in the early 1990s.
Within the next few days, Price Waterhouse laid off 150 staff in its
management consultancy division, financial salaries dipped to their lowest
levels in eight years, and one of the leading professional indemnity
insurance underwriters warned of a sharp growth in litigation against
accountants. The firms continued to create new and ever more bizarre
specialist units offering services with barely a passing resemblance to
accountancy. Other ethical rule changes (often meekly following in the wake
of practices already under way) permitted practices such as cold-calling and
contingency fees.
Changes to the law requiring disclosure of the non-audit income generated
from audit clients to any company revealed the enormous extent of consulting
work carried out. On other issues, the accountancy firms have steadfastly
refused to provide meaningful financial information about themselves.
Nowhere was the intersection of insolvency and commercialism more powerfully
illustrated than with the emergence of 'low-balling', with firms eagerly
slashing their fees to retain clients or win them from competitors. It
helped delay redundancies, but at what cost to the longer-term quality of
the audit or the reputation of the firms?
In short, nothing changes in the trends. Or where it does, it has generally
been for the worse: whether for the profession, the accountancy firms, or
for the preparers and the users of companies' accounts.
While insolvency may have caused more obvious and immediate pain, growing
commercialism arguably threatens to inflict greater long-term damage to any
attempt by accountants to continue to call themselves members of a
profession rather than simply another business.
Yet, as an analyst listening to the tales of the disturbed accountant
sitting on the consulting couch might put it, the profession went into heavy
denial. Expectation gaps, calls for proof to justify the slightest criticism
(when the firms refuse to reveal the data on which any analysis could be
based), and the introduction of some tokenistic new rules all seemed easier
ripostes than facing up to the real problems.
It is easy for auditors to cry foul: to say that they are only sued because
they have 'deep pockets', that the public is ignorant of their role and
limitations, that company directors are the ones responsible for preparing
accounts.
Yet by law shareholders appoint the auditors with the single purpose of
providing a reasonable assurance that the accounts show a true and fair
view. The firms' staple product of the audit report has been understandably
discredited by the experience of the last few years.
A quick glance around the morgue of corporate carcasses shows that many
companies collapsed with no warning signs from auditors examining their
health just a few months before. An examination of the working papers after
the event shows that the auditor was very often aware of many of the signs
of impending doom - but said nothing publicly.
By treating the symptoms, accountants have been able to demonstrate some
apparent progress of late. The Accounting Standards Board has got off to a
good start by introducing tough new rules which appear to close many of the
more malleable ones of old.
The Financial Reporting Review Panel has begun flexing its muscles,
generating a climate of reform - through fear among finance directors, and
probably at least as importantly among auditors, a number of whom have soon
after ceased acting for reprimanded clients.
But all this activity does nothing to affect the underlying cause of the
financial reporting malaise. The climate may have temporarily swung against
the mood of the late 1980s, and the absence of economic growth may have
militated until now against aggressive financial transactions.
However, the relationship between auditors and their clients remains
unchanged. If the mood changes again, there is little that either the review
panel or the accounting standards board can do to influence the private
discussions that are only partially reflected in published accounts.
The fundamental tension is how can an auditor, effectively hired, fired,
paid by and reporting to executive management, act objectively and sometimes
against its interests? As one senior accountant put it recently: 'It's like
leaving the rabbits in charge of the lettuce'.
This argument does not simply apply to audit fees. Accountants know few
bounds when it comes to the range of work they are willing to undertake for
companies. Conflicts of interest seem rarely to feature. Show a conflict to
lawyers and they normally quickly withdraw.
Accountants, by contrast, sweep aside objections by blithely claiming in the
same breath both the importance of 'synergy' from existing experience, and
yet simultaneously an easy ability to 'manage' any such tensions and prevent
conflicts arising.
These tensions are rarely acknowledged within the profession. When I
suggested over a lunch a few months ago to a senior partner of a 'Big Six'
firm that they might present problems, he gave a single-word reply  -
unprintable but unmistakeably negative.
There has at least now been some progress, with the recognition of the issue
in both the discussions of the Auditing Practices Board and a document from
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland within the last two
years. Yet there has been little sign of any recommendations to develop the
points.
If the accountancy profession has generally been complacent, it has been
aided in its apathy by a lack of interest by others who should be paying it
greater attention: not least government and users of accounts. Yet they have
remained conspicuously silent on most issues, content to let accountants get
on with their lives without much interference.
I can point to some stimulating debates and some delightful friendships
developed with accountants over the last three years. On the future of their
profession and the degree to which it has recognised its problems and
attempted improvements, I am rather less able to be positive.

FT  15 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: Gilts slip on UK inflation worries and
European falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concerns about the UK government's ability to keep the lid on inflation and
declines in some European bond markets pushed UK gilts lower yesterday, with
the long end falling by more than one point.
Gilts fell initially on a higher-than-expected rise in the Retail Price
Index of 2.4 per cent for August. Analysts said the fall then gathered pace
on worries over the government's anti-inflation policy.
Mr Simon Briscoe at SG Warburg said the decision by UK chancellor Kenneth
Clarke to raise the base rate by 50 basis points to 5.75 per cent on Monday
had been presented as a move to pre-empt inflation.
However, some dealers now believed the move was in response to the RPI
figures which they suspected the chancellor knew about on Monday. 'People
had been led to believe that the authorities made this (interest rate)
decision without knowing the RPI numbers,' he said. 'There is now
uncertainty about policy and that has made the market nervous today.'
Mr Andrew Roberts, at UBS, said gilts were unlikely to rally as long as the
market felt Mr Clarke was increasing interest rates in response to
inflation, instead of moving to stifle it.
But Mr Nigel Richardson, at Yamaichi, said: 'Really there is no significant
inflation problem in the UK, so Monday's rate rise is still pre-emptive.'
The yield spread between gilts and bunds widened from around 138 basis
points on Tuesday to around 150 yesterday. On Liffe, the December long gilt
future traded at 98 25/32 in late trading, a fall of 1 5/16 point on the
day.
Comments by the Bundesbank's vice-president, Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, which
suggested that further interest rate cuts were unlikely and
stronger-than-expected wholesale data for August weighed on German
government bonds yesterday.
Mr Gaddum's view that Germany's rapid money supply growth did not allow him
to justify a reduction in the fixed-rate repo rate from the current 4.85 per
cent dashed lingering hopes that the Bundesbank would ease the repo rate
this week. The market now expects no changes from the Bundesbank after its
meeting today.
Although Mr Gaddum is regarded as one of the Bundesbank's more hawkish
members, analysts said his remarks were the first clear indication that the
Bundesbank was moving away from the policy of cutting interest rates
further.
Mr Julian Callow, European economist at Kleinwort Benson, said Mr Gaddum's
views also suggested that the Bundesbank was now giving a higher priority to
dampening down inflation rather than to tackling unemployment.
A 0.2 per cent rise in west German wholesale prices in August from July, up
2.2 per cent from a year earlier, and an unexpected drain of DM1.3bn by the
Bundesbank during its weekly repo operations were seen as two further
reasons why the Bundesbank would not be easing rates further. On Liffe, the
December bund future fell 0.5 point to 88.70 while in the cash market,
yields on 10-year bunds rose by 8 basis points to 7.60 per cent.
The weakness in bunds prompted the spread between German and French bonds to
go below 50 basis points at one point during the day. However, dealers said
the narrowing spread did not necessarily reflect greater investor confidence
in the French market.
US Treasury bonds edged higher in light trading yesterday afternoon as
traders shrugged off a mixed reading on retail sales.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/8 better
at 97 31/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.667 per cent. On the short end,
the two-year note was up  1/16 at 99 29/32 , to yield 6.30 per cent.
The day's economic news, while not entirely negative, could not dislodge the
gloomy mood which has gripped the market over the past week. Bonds finished
a little higher after drifting aimlessly for most of the session.
As trading began, the Commerce Department announced that retail sales last
month were up 0.8 per cent, against forecasts of 1 per cent. But any
enthusiasm over the favourable headline figure was dampened by evidence that
much of the growth had come from outside the motor vehicle sector. Excluding
automobiles, August sales climbed 0.7 per cent, much higher than the 0.4 per
cent increase which had been expected.
At midday the Federal Reserve released its Beige Book, which indicated that
the economy continued to expand this summer. The report served to reinforce
the fears of mounting inflationary pressures. In the end, however, there was
no forward-looking evidence to push prices in either direction.

FT  15 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: BZW move brings DTB and Matif
closer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French and German futures and options exchanges came one step closer
yesterday when a UK bank announced it was ready to trade interest rate
futures across a link jointly developed by the two markets.
BZW Futures, part of Barclays, will shortly begin trading a range of German
futures and options from its Paris offices. Other traders are expected to
follow over the next few months.
France's Matif and Germany's DTB announced their collaboration 18 months
ago. They hope that the link will allow them to compete more effectively
with Liffe and other international exchanges.
'This is the most important single development in European financial futures
markets for many years,' said Mr Graham Newall, chief executive of BZW
Futures.
'It is the first trade in a new era in the way futures business will be
conducted in Europe,' he added, arguing that the development would 'enhance
liquidity on DTB'. The trades have been made possible by the installation of
DTB terminals in Paris.
In a second stage of co-operation, Matif, where trades are predominantly
carried out through the traditional 'open outcry' method on the dealing
floor, will allow DTB members to trade two of its products over the German
exchange's screen-based trading system.
Subsequently, the two exchanges plan to generate joint plans to develop
trading software, clearing and settlement.
The exchanges will be particularly keen to challenge Liffe's 70 per cent
share of the market for German bund contracts.
Mr Daniel Hodson, chief executive of Liffe, played down the threat, arguing
that the London exchange offers a wider range of products, greater liquidity
and better distribution than its European rivals, which 'tend to be seen as
domestic exchanges'.
He said, however, that the tie-up could succeed in attracting new players
into the marketplace.
Liffe would not lose any 'significant percentage' of its bund business to
the DTB, he predicted.
Collaboration between Liffe and its European counterparts is likely to
remain limited, Mr Hodson said.

ITC Classic Finance, the Indian financial services group, is seeking a
partnership with Threadneedle Asset Management, a BAT subsidiary, in order
to promote an asset management company in India.
Mr Feroze Vevaina, an ITC Classic director, said the two companies had
started discussing 'the various aspects of the proposed collaboration,
including the participation in the equity capital of the asset management
company to be formed. I think the collaboration will take a definite shape
by the end of this year'.
ITC Classic has been given permission by the Securities and Exchange Board
of India to launch mutual funds. But, as Mr Vevaina pointed out, 'we need
expertise and technology to design and operate close and open ended schemes.
A tie-up with Threadneedle will take care of that'.
Threadneedle has invested in Indian companies through its emerging markets
fund.
ITC Classic had tried to promote the asset management company in partnership
with Peregrine of Hong Kong.

FT  15 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Halifax launches first FFr offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Halifax Building Society yesterday launched its debut offering in the French
franc market, following a series of investor presentations in Paris last
week.
Although the Halifax is now the best-rated financial institution in the UK,
building societies have often fared poorly with overseas investors because
they are perceived as rather parochial entities. However, the success of the
Abbey National, which has become one of the most active borrowers in the
international markets since its conversion to bank status, has inspired
other societies to step up their marketing efforts with international
investors in an attempt to reduce wholesale funding costs.
A Halifax treasury official described the deal as 'part of a consistent
process to establish a presence on the world's principal markets'.
The seven-year offering of 8 per cent bonds was priced to yield 28 basis
points over the comparable OAT, a level which dealers said was aggressive,
relative to deals by better-known French borrowers. However, there is
currently a dearth of paper in the French market, particularly at current
coupon levels.
The lack of new issues is partly due to poor swap opportunities. However,
the Halifax deal was swapped into floating-rate sterling at a level slightly
higher than the society normally pays for borrowings under its medium-term
note programme, an official said.
Joint lead manager SBC estimated that around half the deal was placed
overseas and half in France.
In the D-Mark sector, KFW, the German development agency, launched a DM1bn
offering, which successfully reopened the 10-year sector after a five-month
lull. Priced to yield 25 basis points over the 10-year bund, dealers said
the spread was sufficiently attractive to appeal to both international and
domestic investors, unlike a number of recent D-Mark offerings, which were
too aggressive compared with paper available in the domestic market.
Joint lead manager JP Morgan reported a 50/50 split. The spread held steady
at 25 basis points, after the syndicate broke.
In the dollar sector, two banks launched fixed-rate deals, while three banks
launched floating-rate transactions. Among the floating-rate deals, the Bank
of Melbourne brought an initial Dollars 250m offering of floating-rate
notes, bearing interest of 25 basis points over three-month Libor.

<TEXT>
Japan's Mitsubishi group and Daimler-Benz, the German motors and aerospace
group, have reached agreements on various engineer exchange programmes, as
well as on small-scale co-operation in fields including environmental
preservation and telecommunications, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The agreements were announced in a joint statement issued by Daimler-Benz
and four Mitsubishi companies - Mitsubishi Corp, Mitsubishi Electric,
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Motors.
Mitsubishi and Daimler-Benz officials met this week to discuss areas of
business co-operation. They have met once or twice a year since 1990.
In addition to various personnel exchanges, the statement reported three
moderate co-operation agreements.
'There were no big joint projects announced this time. It's just that
co-operation between the two companies is gradually building up,' an
official of Mitsubishi Heavy said.
Mitsubishi Heavy and Daimler agreed to exchange young engineers and managers
in preparation for a future joint project.
Daimler-Benz has been asking for joint development of aircraft, but
Mitsubishi had called for engineer exchanges, Mitsubishi Heavy said.
The three agreements include the establishment of a 50-50 joint venture
between Mitsubishi and Daimler-Benz's wholly owned unit Daimler-Benz
Inter-Services, to provide general information.
The statement added that Mitsubishi Motors had agreed to start selling
pick-up trucks in South Africa through Daimler's Mercedes-Benz South Africa
unit by the end of October, six months ahead of schedule.
Daimler-Benz and Mitsubishi Heavy also decided to continue joint research on
the recycling of waste plastics.
The two groups are to seek areas of co-operation in other parts of Asia.

Australis Media, the quoted company which holds one of Australia's two

to set up a pay-TV system by the beginning of next year, yesterday unveiled
a loss of ADollars 19.1m (USDollars 14m) in the year to end-June.
Australis said that the loss reflected start-up and establishment costs for
both its planned broadcast subscription services and its targeted business.
The company currently runs a handful of special language services and a news
service, which are sold to subscribers in Sydney and Melbourne.
The company said that its emphasis over the next few months would be on the
completion of programming arrangements.

International securities house James Capel and South African stockbrokers
Simpson McKie have announced plans to form a new company, Simpson McKie
James Capel, to be responsible for the marketing of South African securities
through James Capel offices worldwide.
Once the necessary amendments to South African securities law are made,
expected by April 1995, a James Capel affiliate will purchase 30 per cent of
Simpson McKie. It plans ultimately to purchase a further 21 per cent when
further legislation permits. The value of the transaction has not been
released.
All 16 current directors of Simpson McKie will be on the new board while
James Capel will nominate a further three. Mr Duncan Agar, James Capel
international director, said the transaction gave James Capel direct access
to the South African market.
According to Mr Dixie Strong, Simpson McKie chief executive, his firm's
expertise would be able to provide the new company with top quality South
African research, while the James Capel link would provide it with an
established global marketing network.

Arnott's, the Australian food group 61 per cent owned by Campbell Soup of

Mr Paul Bourke, Arnott's managing director, said the new factory, planned to

The PSA, a federal body, recently released a report on biscuit pricing.
Arnott's said earlier this year it may shelve plans to build the factory if
it was not released from surveillance.

FT  15 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: CME designs new currency
swaps - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since the Chicago Mercantile Exchange first launched foreign currency
futures in 1972 it has been trying to find ways to bring a larger portion of
the interbank foreign exchange trade on to its dealing floor. The interbank
market, with some Dollars 1,000bn in daily turnover, is a fat target for any
of the world's exchanges, but a difficult one.
The interbank market is highly liquid, pricing is straightforward, default
rates are remarkably low, and longstanding credit lines back up trading
relationships.
In designing its new Currency Forward Contracts, the exchange has drawn on
its experience with its very successful eurodollar futures and options
contracts. 'Currency Forwards have the potential to become a primary swap
pricing mechanism like eurodollars have become,' says Mr Clifford Besser, a
former options trader who has spent the past year making markets in the
CME's Rolling Spot pit.
Noting that forward swaps (usually a spread with one leg in the spot market
and one on a forward date) comprise about 40 per cent of all foreign
exchange transactions, the CME hopes its version of forwards will offer
enough incentives that they will eventually win over a substantial amount of
interbank trade. Used in conjuction with the CME's year-old Rolling Spot
contracts, the exchange products can replicate over-the-counter currency
swaps.
Those swaps typically are bets on the movement of the interest rate
differentials between two currencies over time.
The exchange says its forwards offer at least three distinct advantages:
unlike interbank currency forwards, CME forwards don't tie up bank credit
lines, and so are particularly attractive for locking in interest rate
differentials between currencies for periods beyond one year; banks trading
the exchange products do not have to be concerned with BIS capital adequacy
requirements; and finally, credit risk is minimal because the CME clearing
house acts as counterparty to each trade.
The cost savings using the CME can be significant - in the interbank market,
credit lines and capital charges can add up very quickly - but that feature
may be lost on bank traders, who are not directly responsible for their
transaction costs.
For the CME products to have a chance at success, the exchange will have to
attract and maintain sufficient liquidity to keep the nascent market going
over the long period it will take to wean banks away from established
practices.
Mr Garret Glass, senior vice-president and head of market risk management at
First National Bank of Chicago, notes that foreign exchange transaction
costs are insignificant to banks on a trade-by-trade basis. However, he
says: 'Over time, we've found that a bank would be better off using a
clearing house for foreign exchange trades.'
The CME launched its Currency Forwards on September 12 with a Dollars
/D-Mark product, and intends to expand with Dollars /yen contracts if
D-Marks are successful. The forwards are valued at Dollars 250,000 each,
trade in one-quarter point 'pips', or increments, and settle, in an unusual
twist, into the CME's Rolling Spot currency contracts. Unlike the CME's
currency futures, Currency Forwards are quoted in European terms, making the
product compatible with the OTC markets.
The contracts are listed two years into the future and expire on a monthly
basis.
Currency Forwards, pitched to please the interbank market, do not have much
to offer the typical CME floor trader. The potential market is huge, but
particularly in the forward swaps arena, prices do not move much, and
provide few short-term opportunities.
This does not bother the exchange, which recognises that the Currency
Forward and Rolling Spot contracts, properly nurtured, could transform the
CME into the world's first forex clearing house. Rather than depend on local
traders, the exchange is relying on member banks to quote both sides of the
forward and rolling spot markets.
'Our big challenge is to overcome inertia,' says Mr. Besser. 'Bank traders
aren't very adventurous. We have to get big institutional traders to try us
out,' he said.

<TEXT>
South China Morning Post Holdings, the publisher of Hong Kong's leading
English-language newspaper, has reported a 4 per cent drop in annual net
profits to HKDollars 564m (USDollars 73m) from HKDollars 586.4m for its
first year under the control Malaysian millionaire Mr Robert Kuok.
Results for the year ended June 30 1993 were swollen by an exceptional item
of HKDollars 92.4m, from the sale of investment properties.
There were no exceptional items in the latest financial year.
Earnings per share slipped in line with profits, down 4 per cent to 37.61
cents from 39.09 cents. But the dividend is to be maintained at 13 cents a
share.
Circulation figures show a 4 per cent rise to 105,458 copies for the
flagship daily paper, and Mr Kuok says the entry of a third English-language
newspaper - The Eastern Express, which launched earlier this year - has not
adversely affected either revenues or circulation.
Mr Kuok paid USDollars 349m to Mr Rupert Murdoch for control of the Post
last September.

PT Barito Pacific Timber, Indonesia's largest manufacturer of timber
products, said net income in the first six months of 1994 rose to Rp103bn
(Dollars 47m) from Rp82bn a year earlier.
The company also reported that net sales increased to Rp481bn from Rp462bn
the year before.
Barito Pacific has come under fire recently for management at its forest
concessions.
The company, which ranks as the world's largest tropical hardwood plywood
manufacturer, is majority owned by Mr Prajogo Pangestu.
Mr Pangestu recently agreed to allow the Indonesian government to take a 49
per cent stake in two of the forest concessions he operates and which supply
Barito Pacific with timber.
The Ministry of Forestry said that the move was aimed at improving
management at the forest concessions.

<TEXT>
Jardine International Motors Holdings, the Hong Kong based car distribution
arm of the Jardine Group, yesterday reported a 6 per cent increase in net
profits to USDollars 38.1m for the six months to June 30, up from Dollars
35.8m in the same period last year.
Gains were struck on a 55 per cent surge in turnover, to Dollars 717.5m from
Dollars 462.4m, reflecting the acquisition of Cica in Europe. Sales and
deliveries into China during the second quarter were hit by the mainland's
additional tariffs on vehicles.
The new taxes, effective from April, put a 150 per cent levy on top-range
big-engine cars sold to joint ventures, which make up the bulk of imported
car sales.
Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said: 'The strength of the Hong Kong market and
continued recovery in most of the group's other operations will help to
offset the effects of higher tariffs in China, and results for the full year
are expected to be satisfactory.'
Some 77 per cent of the group's profits before interest are generated in
Asia. In spite of a strong market in Hong Kong, half-year profits from the
colony slipped from the 1993 first half, when a large number of orders was
carried forward from the previous year.
Earnings per share for the half-year rose in line with after-tax profits, up
6 per cent to 7.98 cents from 7.5 cents last year. The dividend is to be
held at 1.20 cents.
Jardine International Motors, which is only listed in Hong Kong, has no
plans to quit the exchange. However, the issue of a possible de-listing  -
following the decision by Jardine Matheson and Jardine Strategic to sever
their Hong Kong listings at the end of the year - is on the agenda at board
meetings today and tomorrow for sister companies Dairy Farm, Mandarin
Oriental and Hongkong Land.

FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: PTC offering attracts Dollars
1.4bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bids from international investors for a placing of 5m vouchers in the
state-run Pakistan Telecommunication Corp (PTC) reached Dollars 1.4bn
yesterday, joint global co-ordinator Jardine Fleming said.
The offering had been expected to raise around Dollars 750m for the
government of Pakistan. The 5m PTC vouchers, which are exchangeable into
shares in the future privatised Pakistan Telecommunications Company, account
for around 10 per cent of the company.
The bookbuilding process is scheduled to close today, after which
allocations will be made. An official at Jardine Fleming said that the
vouchers were likely to be priced between Rs5,000 and Rs5,500. This compares
with a price of Rs3,000 in a recent domestic offering of vouchers which
accounted for 2 per cent of the company.
The official said that demand was particularly strong from emerging market
funds and from institutional investors in east Asia, the UK and the US.
Non-resident Pakistanis in the Middle East also showed a keen interest in
the offering.
The strong response from foreign investors prompted the vouchers to close
Rs575 higher at Rs6,350 at the Karachi Stock Exchange.
Jardine Fleming is co-ordinating the offering with Muslim Commercial Bank.

gain

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cott Corporation, the fast-growing Canadian supplier of private-label
beverages, lifted second-quarter earnings by 50 per cent, but confirmed that
intensifying competition was eroding margins in some important markets.
The company's latest balance sheet provided ammunition to both supporters
and critics of the controversial, Toronto-based company which has been a
prime target of short sellers on North American stock exchanges.
On the one hand, accounts receivable, inventories and long-term debt rose
sharply in the second quarter.
However, Cott also reported a large increase in accounts payable, capital
assets and goodwill.
Net earnings rose to CDollars 15.9m (USDollars 11.5m), or 26 cents a share,
in the three months to July 30, from CDollars 10.7m, or 19 cents, a year
earlier.
Sales climbed 62 per cent to CDollars 320m, due mainly to a 39 per cent jump
in US volumes, which accounted for more than half the 64m cases sold during
the quarter.
Volumes in Canada rose 12 per cent, while volumes outside North America were
up 14 per cent to 9.2m cases.
Gross margins declined to 16.3 per cent of sales from 17.2 per cent last
year and 16.5 per cent in the first quarter.
Cott attributed the narrower margins to weak prices in Canada and the low
margins of Ben Shaw, its UK canner. Long-term debt rose to CDollars 71.3m on
July 30 from CDollars 41.6m three months earlier and CDollars 23.2m a year
ago.
The latest jump was ascribed to ambitious capital investments and a US
acquisition. But Cott said its cash flow was 'more than sufficient to fund
heavy seasonal demands for non-cash working capital as well as increases in
other assets'.
Mr Robert Mason, analyst at Richardson Greenshields in Toronto, said the
company 'is still considerably under-leveraged'.
Its share price lost 75 cents to close at CDollars 19 1/2 on the Toronto
stock exchange yesterday.

Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada's third biggest bank, has extended its
investments in emerging Latin American and Asian markets by buying a 25 per
cent stake in Argentina's Banco Quilmes.
Scotiabank will pay USDollars 57m for its interest, which will include an
agreement to provide technical services to Banco Quilmes, based in Buenos
Aires.
Banco Quilmes has assets of USDollars 1.2bn and 90 branches, making it
Argentina's seventh-biggest privately-owned bank. It is controlled by
members of the Florito family.
Scotiabank, which has assets of CDollars 132bn, has for many years had the
most extensive international network of Canada's big six banks, and is the
only one which continues to place a strong emphasis on expansion outside
North America.
It has taken equity stakes and forged other links with medium-sized
financial institutions in Mexico, Chile, the Philippines and Thailand.
It is in the process of finalising a deal with Idris Hydraulic, a Malaysian
financial-services group.
Mr Peter Godsoe, Scotiabank's chief executive, said the bank was committed
to 'maintaining and building on the international diversity of our
operations, and we expect the rate of economic growth in Latin America and
the Pacific rim to provide us with solid returns'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Exxon yesterday became the second US energy group to launch a co-branded
credit card, following Shell Oil a year ago.
The move also represents the biggest step by GE Capital, the financial
services group which is issuing the card, into the co-branded credit card
sector, the fastest-growing part of the card market. Until now, the
financial services group has specialised in issuing private-label cards for
retailers. Its only co-branded card has been for General Electric, its
parent.
Service stations represent a big potential market for general purpose credit
cards. At present, there are about 117m private-label cards issued by oil
companies, which can be used only in their own outlets and which account for
annual payments of Dollars 27bn.
Exxon sold its own private-label card business to GE Capital last December.
Yesterday, the financial services company said it did not believe the new
co-branded card, which carries the MasterCard logo, would compete directly
with that business.
Cardholders, who will not pay an annual fee, will receive a rebate of 3 per
cent on purchases made in Exxon's 9,400 stations, and 1 per cent on other
purchases.

GE has been reported in recent weeks as talking to various suitors,

rumoured to be interested in buying a TV network.
Both companies declined to comment yesterday.
Ms Jessica Reif, an analyst with the broking firm Merrill Lynch, said: 'A

   MONTREAL

<TEXT>
Shareholders of John Labatt, the Canadian-based international brewer, have
rejected management's anti-takeover 'poison pill'.
The plan would have made it prohibitively expensive to buy control of
Labatt, but institutional holders swung the vote at Tuesday's annual
meeting, bringing those in favour of rejection to 52 per cent.
The institutions have been critical of the ambitious expansion plans of Mr
George Taylor, president, but after the meeting, Mr Taylor maintained the
vote was 'a verdict on management and nothing to do with corporate
strategy'.
Mr William Mackenzie, vice-president of Fairvest Securities, an
institutional holder, said the poison pill was unacceptable because it did
not allow a partial bid to succeed. Others said it was an attempt to protect
management.
The pill would have been triggered if anyone tried to buy more than 20 per
cent of Labatt.
In such a situation. existing shareholders could buy additional shares at a
50 per cent discount.
Management said the pill was designed to give it time to pursue
alternatives.
Mr Taylor said he knew of no potential bidders for Labatt. The company has
been widely held since the Edper-Hees group divested control nearly two
years ago.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French banking group, expects by the end of
the year to have completed its review of its European operations.
Mr Jean Peyrelevade initiated a comprehensive review of Credit Lyonnais'
activities outside France when he was appointed chairman last year by the
French government, with a brief to rescue the heavily loss-making group.
Credit Lyonnais, a state-controlled company, created one of Europe's largest
banking networks in the late 1980s in a series of acquisitions.
The first phase of the Peyrelevade review was completed earlier this week,
when the UK subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais announced plans to cut costs by
closing seven offices and branches.
The cuts are concentrated on the retail banking network which, said the
group, did not have sufficient critical mass to compete efficiently in the
UK.
Credit Lyonnais intends to concentrate on its more competitive areas in the
UK such as corporate banking, private banking and capital markets trading.
Similar reviews are approaching completion in other countries, notably
Belgium, Spain and Italy.
However, Credit Lyonnais ,said yesterday the group did not envisage making
significant cuts in these countries because its operations were larger and
more cost-effective.

mobile deal

Three US telephone companies yesterday declined to comment on a press report
that they were planning to merge their mobile telephone businesses into a
grouping that would be even larger than the one being formed through AT&amp;T's
Dollars 12.6bn takeover of McCaw Cellular Communications.
One of the companies, Sprint, is a long-distance carrier, and the other two,
Bell Atlantic and Nynex, are Baby Bell regional telephone companies.
According to the Wall Street Journal, the three companies are close to
reaching agreement on a deal under which their cellular telephone businesses
would be merged and marketed under the Sprint name.
The combined operation would serve more than 3m existing cellular
subscribers and almost 76m potential customers.
Last month AT&amp;T, the biggest long distance carrier in the US, won federal
court approval to proceed with a takeover of McCaw Cellular Communications.
That deal will produce an organisation with slightly fewer than 3m existing
subscribers and fewer than 74m potential subscribers.
The regional telephone companies are concerned that a nationwide cellular
service sold under the well-known AT&amp;T name could lure away their local
customers.
Bell Atlantic and Nynex had sought to block the AT&amp;T-McCaw deal on
anti-trust grounds, but a federal judge this week denied their request for
an injunction.
Bell Atlantic and Nynex announced earlier this year that they had agreed to
merge their cellular businesses.
However, a partnership with Sprint would enable them to compete much more
strongly with AT&amp;T-McCaw.

Mr Robert Corrigan, formerly president of IBM's personal computer business,
has been appointed president and chief executive of Imax, a Canadian film
production company that has pioneered the use of giant screens, large-format
and motion simulation.
Mr Corrigan's appointment is the latest example of the increasing cross-over
between the computer and entertainment industries with the development of
multimedia technologies.
'The entertainment world is rapidly changing inside and outside the home,'
said Mr Corrigan.
He added that Imax was poised to capitalise on this by developing and
delivering the next generations of hardware and software.
'We are on the threshold of a sophisticated marriage between computer
technology and entertainment,' added Mr Douglas Trumbull, vice-chairman of
Imax.
In another example of the convergence of entertainment and electronics, Mr
Strauss Zelnick, former president of 20th Century Fox who for the past two
years has headed Crystal Dynamics, a leading Silicon Valley video games
software developer, is to become head of BMG Entertainment North America in
January.
BMG is a subsidiary of Bertelsmann, the German media company.
Mr Zelnick will oversee the operations of BMG in the US, including its music
publishing and interactive entertainment operations. He will also lead BMG's
expansion into film in the US.
Time Warner's board of directors has appointed Mr Norman Pearlstine the
company's next editor-in-chief, Reuter reports.
Mr Pearlstine becomes the fifth editor-in-chief in Time's history on the
date of Mr Jason McManus's retirement at the end of the year. He is the
first editor-in-chief chosen from outside the company.

FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: Heinz raises quarterly dividend

HJ Heinz, the US food group headed by Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Irish
businessman, lifted its quarterly dividend by 9 per cent to 36 cents and is
buying back a further 10m of its shares.
Heinz's stock price has been under a cloud following the company's poor
financial performance in the year ending April 1994.
But on Tuesday Mr O'Reilly told shareholders at the company's annual meeting
that Heinz was 'back on track to deliver double-digit growth in annual
earnings in the 1990s'.
Mr O'Reilly said one significant area of growth would be baby foods.
According to a Reuters news agency report, he told journalists after the
meeting that Heinz's board had approved the acquisition of another baby food
company in Europe.
Earlier this year Heinz bought the Farley's baby food line from Boots, the
UK retailing and pharmaceutical group. This came shortly after it had agreed
with Glaxo, the UK pharmaceuticals group, to buy Glaxo's baby food line in
India.
However, Mr O'Reilly said Heinz's growth would result from a combination of
higher volume, cost reduction, price increases, stock repurchases,
acquisitions and global expansion, particularly in Asia and the Pacific.

FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: Swiss investment group
criticises banks' profit fall
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BK Vision, the investment company controlled by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking
group, has strongly criticised the first-half profit slump of Switzerland's
large banks.
In its report to shareholders for the eight months to August 31, BK argues
that the volatile own-account securities trading business is not compatible
with the traditional and highly profitable services of Swiss banks.
BK is the largest shareholder in Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), holding 7
per cent of the capital with a SFr2.1bn (Dollars 1.59bn) market value.
UBS, Switzerland's largest bank, last month reported a 28 per cent slide in
first-half net income to SFr929m, mainly because its profits from trading,
at SFr493m, were SFr1.05bn lower than in the first half of 1993.
Credit Suisse and Swiss Bank Corporation also suffered sharply lower trading
profits.
BK, which earlier this year attacked UBS for having too large a board of
directors, called on the banks' boards to make clear their risk policies.
Mr Kurt Schiltknecht, a BK director, said there was nothing intrinsically
wrong with high earnings volatility, but investors needed to know where they
stood.
Mr Schiltknecht said Swiss banks had to be active traders in support of
their large fund management businesses for clients.
According to a recent compilation by Euromoney magazine, UBS is the third
largest fund manager outside the US, with about Dollars 245bn under its
control.
However, the question was whether the banks should also be trading in risky
securities for their own account.
UBS said yesterday it was not just a fund manager. It aimed to be a global
financial services group, strong in credit and trading sectors as well.
It felt the volatility of its trading profits had stayed within reasonable
levels in the past few years, with the exception of the first half of 1993,
when the result was extraordinarily high.
BK made a SFr11m profit for the eight-month period, turning round a loss of
SFr30.1m suffered in the first four months.
Administration expenses were virtually unchanged from the first four months.
No management fee was payable in the latest four months because of the
decline of the market value of the shares in the portfolio.
The company charged SFr30m against earnings for unrealised losses.
BK reported a SFr76.7m net gain on investments in the eight months, compared
with a loss of SFr3.9m in the first four months.
Its holding of Zurich Insurance was reduced by 65,500 shares between April
and August while its holding in UBS was unchanged with 18.6 per cent of the
registered shares and 3.1 per cent of the bearers.

FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: NordLB buys into Berlin bank
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Norddeutsche Landesbank-Giro-zentrale will pay DM1bn (Dollars 645m) for a 10
per cent stake in Bankgesellschaft Berlin in one of the largest German
banking deals in recent years.
BGB yesterday confirmed that the state of Berlin will sell a 10 per cent
holding - part of its 67.7 per cent controlling stake - to Hanover-based
NordLB. The links arising from the deal will also allow BGB to expand its
presence in northern and north eastern Germany.
'This is a strategic decision in which BGB will gain access to more retail
banking in the north of Germany, while NordLB will gain important access to
the German capital, particularly as this part of Germany begins to expand,
and to our international markets,' BGB said.
NordLB is one of Germany's largest public sector regional banks. Last year
its operating profits, after risk provisions, totalled DM400.4m, a sharp
rise over 1992, when operating profits totalled DM145.9m.
The deal, which could be approved as early as September 22 when NordLB's
supervisory board meets, coincides with a period of structural change in
Berlin's banking establishment.
BGB was created as a holding and investment banking company in January
following the merger of three banking institutions - Berliner Bank,
Landesbank Berlin, which owns the saving banks, and Berliner Hypotheken-und
Pfandbriefbank, or Berlin Hyp, a property financing institution.
The merger brought together for the first time in German banking the private
and public sectors. Apart from Berlin's 67.7 per cent stake, 10 per cent is
held by Gothaer Insurance Group and the remaining 22.3 per cent by minority
shareholders.
BGB's total equity capital is DM7.8bn and its assets total DM220bn. In its
first interim results, it reported consolidated operating profits of DM734m.
After taking into account risk provisions totalling DM326m, operating
profits came out at DM408m.
Bank officials said the state had no plans to relinquish its majority
status. BGB may retain the right to buy back half of NordLB's 10 per cent
stake.

FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: US pension funds expand abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US pension funds have further expanded their investments in non-domestic
securities in the first half of 1994, allocating Dollars 22bn to mandates to
be invest-ed outside the US, a rise of 9 per cent from the end of 1993.
InterSec Research Corporation, a US-based investment consulting firm, said
that 80 per cent of the cash is invested in non-US equities, with the
remainder in fixed interest.
Cash flow into equities in the first half of 1994 totalled Dollars 17bn,
some Dollars 5bn more than in the same period a year ago. However, it was
Dollars 5bn below the cash flow which poured into foreign equities in the
second half of 1993.
The move abroad is part of a trend which became visible by the end of 1993
when it was calculated that the value of US pension funds' assets abroad
rose by 69 per cent to Dollars 260bn from Dollars 156bn at the end of 1992.
As of June 1994, US pension fund assets invested abroad totalled Dollars
284bn.
InterSec calculated that some 7 per cent of US pension assets were invested
abroad at the end of last year, compared with 5 per cent a year earlier.
US pension funds historically have been reluctant to invest outside the
country. Five years ago, only 3 per cent of their assets were non-US.
Of the funds invested outside the US in 1994, Dollars 20bn represents net
new cash allocated to the sector while only Dollars 2bn represents an
increase in assets under management.

FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: GE shows interest in Snecma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Electric would be keen to invest in Snecma, the French state-owned
aero-engine manufacturer in the event of its privatisation, according to the
head of the US group's aircraft engines division.
'We would like to participate in any operation which would support the
future of our French partner,' Mr Eugene Murphy said. 'If there is an
opening of Snecma's capital we would like to take part.'
The US and French groups work closely in the development and marketing of
aircraft engines and are associates in CFM International, a joint engine
manufacturing company.
Mr Murphy said that co-operation between the two companies was becoming ever
closer but rejected a scenario in which they would divide the production of
small and large aircraft engines between them.
Snecma is one of the 21 companies on the French government's privatisation
list. But the group is not expected to be sold in the near future since the
government has already launched plans for the issues of shares in other
companies including Renault, the vehicle group, and Assurances Generales de
France, the insurer.

FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: Volvo welcomes revised deal -
Divorce sends European automotive groups along divergent routes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo, the Swedish motor manufacturer, said yesterday it had won a much
better divorce deal from Renault than it initially negotiated.
The terms contained in the French government's plan for the partial
privatisation of Renault announced on Tuesday put a higher price on Volvo's
20 per cent holding in Renault than previously agreed. They also give Volvo
greater freedom over when it sells out.
'This is a good deal for Volvo,' the company said. The deal provides for the
unwinding of almost all the cross-shareholdings left over following the
collapse last December of the two groups' plans to merge. In particular, it
allows for Volvo to take back full control of its highly-profitable truck
division.
In February, Volvo agreed to swap a 12 per cent stake in the Renault parent
for the 45 per cent share in Volvo trucks held by Renault, if the French
company was privatised by December. The deal was worth FFr4.5bn (Dollars
849m), implying a total valuation of Renault of FFr37.5bn.
This week, the terms were changed to allow Volvo to buy back the Renault
share of its truck division for 5 per cent of Renault - valued at FFr2.12bn
 -plus FFr2.38bn in cash. This implies a total valuation of Renault of
FFr42.5bn.
Volvo, which wants eventually to sell out its full 20 per cent holding, is
also obliged to sell a further 3 per cent stake in Renault at whatever
privatisation price is offered to institutional investors. However, for the
remaining 12 per cent it has considerable freedom to pick its time and
price.
It has the option to sell up to a further 4 per cent at the institutional
offer price at the time of privatisation. It has undertaken to retain its
residual 8 per cent for a period yet to be stipulated, but which will not be
longer than six months after privatisation. Within that period, however, it
will be free to sell when it feels the price is right.
'It provides us with the opportunity to benefit from a possible value
increase in Renault,' said Mr Soren Gyll, the chief executive.
Under the original divorce terms, Volvo has been able to treat the truck
division as wholly owned, so benefiting from resurgent profits now accruing
in both the truck and car divisions. However, it was anxious to regain full
control as part of its new strategy, adopted after the merger collapse, to
concentrate on core car and truck operations.
It has meanwhile begun a programme to sell SKr40bn of non-core assets.

FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: Longuet looks to boost Renault
sale - Divorce sends European automotive groups along divergent routes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The planned flotation of shares in Renault should be followed by further
reductions in the government's holding in the French automotive group,
according to Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister.
Speaking after the government announced plans to sell a stake of about 28
per cent in the car and truck maker, Mr Longuet told Le Figaro newspaper:
'There is no particular reason for the state to remain the majority
shareholder in the long term.' He described the planned flotation as a
'step, not a completion'.
The political sensitivity of Renault, a former trade union stronghold,
prompted the centre-right government of prime minister Mr Edouard Balladur
to limit the scale of its issue of Renault shares and retain a stake of at
least 51 per cent.
Volvo, the Swedish motor group which holds 20 per cent of Renault's shares,
will sell a stake of between 8 and 12 per cent as part of the operation. The
move is part of an unravelling of an alliance between the two companies
following the collapse of merger plans at the end of last year.
The French industry minister said Renault would need to find industrial
partners before full privatisation. Describing a consolidation of the
European automotive industry, he said Renault would play a part in the
reshaping of the sector. Shareholders in an ultimate privatisation would
need to know what they were buying into, he said. Mr Longuet declined,
however, to comment on possible partners.
He said the Renault sell-off should take place as quickly as possible,
reinforcing speculation that the operation will be launched at the end of
October or early November. He indicated that the government had valued the
company at between FFr40bn and FFr44bn (Dollars 7.5bn-Dollars 8.3bn), at the
lower end of analysts' calculations.
Regarding other issues in the government's privatisation programme, Mr
Longuet said that Groupe Bull, the computer manufacturer, was well-prepared
for sale. He hoped the state would be able to reduce its 76 per cent holding
in Bull before presidential elections, scheduled for early 1995.
French economic officials stressed that the partial flotation of Renault did
not derail plans to privatise Assurances Generales de France, the insurer
which has been competing with the automotive group to be the next
privatisation issue. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said plans
for the AGF sale were continuing and that the operation would be launched as
soon as possible.

generator
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Electricite de France, the French state utility, has negotiated the purchase
of a 5.5 per cent stake in Sydkraft, Sweden's second largest electricity
producer.
The deal forms part of EdF's strategy of making foreign acquisitions as well
as expanding its sales abroad.
EdF, the world's largest electricity producer, said it would pay SKr1.1bn
(Dollars 150m) for the stake, which would give it 9 per cent of the voting
rights in Sydkraft.
Like EdF, Sydkraft is an integrated generator and distributor of
electricity. It serves 1.2m customers in southern Sweden, and last year made
a net profit equivalent to FFr1.5bn (Dollars 270m) on turnover worth some
FFr8bn, EdF said.
Sydkraft's shareholders are mainly Swedish, in particular the city of Malmo,
which led the negotiations with EdF. However, Preussenelektra, a subsidiary
of Veba, the German energy conglomerate, already has a larger stake in
Sydkraft than the one EdF plans to take.
EdF is stepping up its international acquisitions. Two years ago it bought
into an Argentine electricity distributor and last year it took stakes in
Spanish and Portuguese power generating companies.
However, for the moment the French government has no intention of opening
the French utility's capital to outsiders.

FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: Foster's sale lifts KLM's
Northwest holding to 25%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines yesterday agreed to increase its stake in Northwest
Airlines, the fourth largest US carrier, to 25 per cent from 20 per cent by
buying a 5 per cent stake from Foster's Brewing, the Australian beer group.
The ADollars 242m (USDollars 180m) share purchase will take KLM's holding in
Northwest to the maximum level allowed. Under US law, foreign companies are
not permitted to own more than 25 per cent of the voting stock of US
airlines.
Foster's decision to sell its stake is in line with its policy of disposing
of non-core assets to reduce its substantial debts. The company's investment
in Northwest represented the largest remaining non-core asset in its
portfolio.
KLM said it had taken the opportunity to buy the stake because the move
demonstrated its commitment to its strategic alliance with Northwest. The
two carriers' combined operations link170 North American cities with more
than 85 cities in Europe, Africa and the Middle East.
Northwest welcomed the move, saying it reflected KLM's 'strong belief in
Northwest's prospects for the future'.
KLM's move comes at a time when other cross-border airline alliances, such
as that between British Airways and USAir, have proved troublesome. KLM,
however, appears to have been relatively lucky with its US investment:
Northwest recently returned to profitability after coming close to
bankruptcy last year.
Foster's acquired its stake in Northwest in 1989 when the US carrier was the
subject of an USDollars 3.65bn leveraged buy-out by an investment consortium
put together by Mr Alfred Checchi, a former Disney executive, and his
partner Mr Gary Wilson.
At that stage, Foster's - in the form of its predecessor company, Elders IXL
 -was run by Mr John Elliott, the Melbourne-based businessman. Through its
finance arm, Elders agreed to invest in the Checchi consortium, and was
given board representation at Northwest when the bid was successful. Asked
about Elders' involvement at the time, Mr Checchi said he and Mr Elliott had
become 'close personal friends'.
KLM was also a member of the Checchi investment group.
Foster's said it would make an after-tax profit of around ADollars 95m on
the share sale, after costs. It had not written down the value of its
Northwest holding, in spite of the airline's serious financial problems in
the early-1990s.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The management of Waterglade International has lost its battle for control
of the lossmaking property developer. It is to be replaced by the opposing
shareholder group, led by Singaporean Winston Ng, writes Simon Davies.
The new directors have undertaken to pursue a recapitalisation, which has
become an urgent need for a company with negative shareholders funds of
Pounds 10m. An immediate rights issue of Pounds 6m is expected.
Mr David Cunningham, chairman, and the three other directors have resigned,
and compensation for loss of office has been agreed.
Mr Selwyn Midgen, Mr Anthony Midgen, Mr John Darby and Mr Derek Hayes will
join Mr Ng on the new board.

Powergen has repurchased 2.5m of its own shares for cancellation, bringing
the total spent over the last month on buy-backs by the privatised power
generator to more than Pounds 27m.
Several of the electricity companies have been buying back their own shares
in recent weeks.
The buy-back was achieved at a price of 573p per share and leaves Powergen
with 0.6 per cent of its share capital for cancellation.
The company has the power to purchase up to 10 per cent of its shares.

FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Savoy in black with Pounds 0.58m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Savoy Hotel, which announced a new management structure on Tuesday,
yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 575,000 for the half year to
June 30 compared with losses of Pounds 1.75m.
The group - whose hotels include the Savoy, Claridge's, the Connaught and
the Berkeley - said business had been boosted by recovery in both the US and
the UK. Operating costs had increased, however, partly because of rising
terrorism insurance expenses.
Savoy said on Tuesday that Sir Ewen Fergusson would replace Sir Anthony Tuke
as chairman at the end of the year. It said Mr Martin Radcliffe, a Savoy
director, would be acting managing director in place of Mr Giles Shepard,
who resigned on Monday. Savoy has approached Mr Ramon Pajares, general
manager of London's Four Seasons hotel, to fill the position.
A chairman's committee made up of Sir Ewen, Mr Rocco Forte, chairman of
Forte, and Mr John Sinclair, a Savoy director, would assist the new managing
director.
Savoy said Mr Radcliffe, Mr Sinclair and Mrs Jane Thorne, an assistant to Mr
Radcliffe, had resigned as trustees of shareholding trusts. They no longer
have non-beneficial interests in the shares held by these trusts. This does
not affect the overall ownership of the group.
Turnover for the six months increased by 13 per cent to Pounds 42.9m (Pounds
37.8m). There was an operating profit of Pounds 1.13m (Pounds 1.61m loss).
Earnings per A share were 1.3p (4p losses). Earnings per B share were 0.6p
(2p losses).
The A shares fell 12p to close at 913p.

FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Credit Lyonnais withdraws from UK personal
banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais, the state-controlled French banking group, is to withdraw
from personal banking in the UK and will close half its regional corporate
banking centres in a re-focusing of its activities.
The number of staff in the UK is expected to fall by about 60 to around 400:
some but not all of these will be compulsory redundancies.
The group expects to close its personal banking facilities within six months
and will aim to help its few thousand UK personal banking customers find
alternative facilities.
Mr Bernard Darmayan, UK general manager, said the number of personal
customers was too low to justify the investment that was required.
Regional corporate banking centres at Bristol, Cambridge, Newcastle,
Nottingham and Southampton would be closed by the end of the year, he said,
but this would be offset by investment in information technology at the
remaining five centres, enabling them to provide better services and to
cover the areas previously dealt with by the wider network.

FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Aegis rises to Pounds 14m aided by
refinancing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last October's Pounds 60m refinancing package was behind a sharp improvement
in interim pre-tax profits at Aegis, the London-based holding company of
Europe's largest media-buying and planning group.
The pre-tax figure rose from Pounds 9.7m to Pounds 14.2m on flat turnover of
Pounds 1.45bn. Interest tumbled from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 900,000.
However, operating profits for the six months to June 30 fell by 27 per cent
from Pounds 21.3m to Pounds 15.5m. The fall, which more than offset a
reduction in operating costs to Pounds 54.8m (Pounds 59m), reflected a
decline of just over Pounds 10m in gross income in France, where a law
introduced last year slashed media-buying revenues.
Mr Roger Parry, group development director, said the figures had been
transformed by the refinancing. 'They reflect no significant improvement in
trading, but they do show a significant improvement in the balance sheet.'
The shortfall in shareholders' funds improved from Pounds 229m to Pounds
115m. Net debt at the end of the half was down 81 per cent at Pounds 26m
(Pounds 137m).
However, net cash outflows of about Pounds 30m were expected in the second
half, including payment of a Pounds 4.2m fine to the Conseil, or French
monopolies commission, for trading practices before the Loi Sapin was
introduced last April. This would result in net debt reaching about Pounds
50m at the year end.
The group remains extremely cautious over prospects in France. introduced
French business produced 27 per cent of turnover and more than 30 per cent
of profits.
Operating margins overall fell from 5.5 per cent to 4.9 per cent in the
period, reflecting the 'cut-throat competition' in both France and Spain.
Northern European business was better, particularly in the UK, where
turnover rose 30 per cent.
Earnings were 1.1p (2.2p). There is no dividend this year.
Mr Crispin Davis, formerly with United Distillers, takes over as chief
executive next month from Mr Charles Hochman, who is retiring. Shortly
afterwards a new finance director will be appointed.
COMMENT
The benefits of last October's refinancing are clearly shown. Aegis now
looks much more financially sound and a raft of new appointments will
strengthen management. With operating costs coming down, the company is well
poised to take advantage of any improvement in southern Europe once
recession ends, although it is being extremely cautious in its forecasts and
the pressure on margins is severe. It is continuing to win good new
business, so the flatness of the turnover is a little disappointing.
Full-year profits of Pounds 28m this year and Pounds 30m for 1995 both
translate into unexciting earnings of about 2p since the tax charge will
increase.

FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Glaxo plans Zantac to be over-the-counter
drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo has confirmed that it intends to apply this year for a licence to sell
its best selling drug Zantac as a medicine which can be bought over the
counter without a prescription, writes Daniel Green.
In a formal statement of research and development, the company said it would
seek approval for two more versions of ulcer drug Zantac. One is a version
of the drug which kills bacteria that are thought to contribute to or even
trigger ulcers.
These steps are likely to be important in the attempt to maintain Zantac
sales at the Pounds 2.5bn it recorded last year.
Three more applications, all new ways to administer inhaled asthma drugs,
will also be filed by the end of the year.
Reviewing progress since the last formal R&amp;D update last November, Glaxo
said it had launched or gained approval for 15 new drugs or formulations
worldwide and three new compounds have started clinical trials.
After exploratory development, four new compounds are also under
pre-clinical testing, involving drugs to combat heart failure, pain, cystic
fibrosis and asthma.
Several, however, have been dropped since last November, including an
anti-herpes compound. Development of GR 87442, a potential follow-on to
Glaxo's successful Zofran anti-nausea drug, has also been discontinued.

FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Cold winter and cost cuts behind advance at
Calor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A cold winter and cost-cutting helped Calor Group, the bottled gas supplier,
increase interim pre-tax profits by 13 per cent from Pounds 27.6m to Pounds
31.1m in spite of a 3 per cent drop in turnover from Pounds 153m to Pounds
148m.
Mr Hamish Macpherson, group treasurer, said the cold snap between January
and March had helped to improve volumes, which rose by 6 per cent. 'People
were keeping the gas fires burning a little bit longer,' he said.
However, the benefits of improved volumes were offset by lower butane and
propane prices. The trading climate remained difficult, Mr Macpherson said,
although the decline in prices had begun to stabilise.
The treasurer said Calor had maintained its more than 50 per cent share of
the UK liquid petroleum gas business, despite fierce competition.
Calor's profits were also helped by the continuing programme to cut costs.
Since 1990, Mr Macpherson estimated the group had cut some Pounds 10m a year
from on-going costs. Operating profits in the first half rose by 9 per cent
to Pounds 30.3m. Profits in the core gas business increased by 6 per cent to
Pounds 31.4m.
The group finished the first half with net cash of Pounds 60m. Calor's
strong balance sheet would allow it to seek acquisitions abroad in its main
LPG business. Mr Macpherson said Calor would look for opportunities both
with its 46 per cent shareholder, SHV, and independently.
The LPG joint venture with SHV in Poland, Hungary and Slovakia was breaking
even. Calor invested Pounds 800,000 in the business in the first half.
The drinks dispensing operation - where Calor leases air separation systems
to brewers and pub chains - reduced its losses from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds
1.1m. This business was expected to break even next year.
The dividend is maintained at 6p. Earnings were 13 per cent higher at 11.7p
(10.4p).
COMMENT
These results are yet again a demonstration of how value can be extracted
from the LPG market - even if it is a mature one. By passing on the benefits
of increased purchasing to customers, reducing costs and holding margins,
Calor has built itself a net Pounds 60m cash pile. The problem now is what
to do with it. There are likely to be few exciting opportunities to buy into
the international LPG market, and those that are around will take some time
to develop. Shareholders facing little excitement in the short-term will be
wanting to see some of that cash find its way into an increased dividend.
Forecasts are for just that. Profits are expected to rise to Pounds 37m this
year, along with a small boost to the pay-out of 0.5p for a total of 13p.
The yield of almost 6 per cent against the market's 4 per cent is Calor's
biggest attraction.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Holiday Inn is to remove its name from its luxury Crowne Plaza hotels which
will now be marketed as a separate brand.
The change will apply initially to Crowne Plaza hotels in the Americas only.
However, Mr Bryan Langton, Holiday Inn chairman, said he expects the change
to be extended to the rest of the world eventually. This would follow
consultation with hotel owners in Europe and Asia, he said.
Mr Langton said the decision followed market research which indicated that
the Holiday Inn brand should not be extended to top-range hotels.
The company, which is owned by Bass, the UK brewing and leisure group, is
also introducing two new hotel brands in the Americas. The first is Holiday
Inn Select, which will consist of business hotels in cities and suburban
areas. The second will be Holiday Inn Hotel and Suites which will cater for
longer-stay guests.
Mount Charlotte Thistle, the UK hotel company which is majority owned by
Brierley Investments of New Zealand, is to market its Thistle and Mount
Charlotte hotels as two separate groups.
The holding companies for the hotels will be Thistle Hotels and Mount
Charlotte Hotels and the holding company for both will be Mount Charlotte
Investments.

FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Suffering a saturated market - The tough
conditions facing the DIY retailers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An increase in operating profits from Pounds 41.6m to Pounds 44.5m at B&amp;Q,
the UK's largest DIY chain, was one of the few bright spots in Tuesday's
results from Kingfisher group. Elsewhere, however, there is little joy among
DIY retailers.
The fierce discounting battles that broke out in 1992 after the slump in the
housing market are over. B&amp;Q moved last year from 'high-low' pricing towards
an everyday low pricing strategy, bringing to an end the weekends when DIY
operators battled to outdo one another on special offers.
But conditions remain tough. Little market growth is forecast, and analysts
agree there is too much capacity - with more being added as operators such
as Wickes, Great Mills and Sainsbury's Homebase step up expansion.
Little capacity is likely to be taken out. Do It All, the lossmaking joint
venture between Boots and WH Smith, did sell 100 stores this year  -
reducing the chain to 140 - but 10 of those went to Focus, the
privately-owned DIY chain preparing for flotation.
On the horizon is another threat: Home Depot, the US 'category killer' which
sells a vast range from giant stores at low prices, is planning to expand
into Europe. It has hired Mr Jim Hodkinson, former managing director of B&amp;Q,
to seek out opportunities.
The outlook is very different from a decade ago. In the 1980s, DIY
operators, like the big food retailers, enjoyed the double whammy of rapid
expansion and ever-increasing gross profit margins.
The number of DIY superstores almost doubled from 560 to 1,019 between 1985
and 1990, according to Verdict, the retail research group. At the same time,
according to the Central Statistical Office's Retailing Inquiry, DIY
retailers' gross margins increased from 30 per cent to 34.5 per cent.
But, again like the big grocers, DIY retailers ran into saturation problems
just as the growth in the market slowed. To prosper in the new environment,
DIY operators are seeking ways of being distinctive, often choosing to
specialise in the 'soft' end of the market - decorative and gardening
products - or the 'hard' end - hardware, tools and construction products.
B&amp;Q aims to be a broad-based retailer, and is adopting a 'twin-track'
expansion approach.
It has sought to pre-empt the arrival of Home Depot by launching a lookalike
format, originally called Depot but now known as B&amp;Q Warehouse. B&amp;Q has 14
Warehouse stores of 80,000 to 100,000 sq ft, and plans at least 50. Mr Alan
Smith, Kingfisher chairman, said this week the two newest Warehouses are
already on track to achieve sales of between Pounds 14m and Pounds 15m in
their first year.
At the same time it is refurbishing its existing 40,000 sq ft
'supercentres', based on a successful trial at Fareham, Hampshire.
Analysts' favourite stock in the sector is Wickes, which, like B&amp;Q
Warehouse, is targeted partly at trade customers. Wickes also took advantage
of signs of recovery in the housing market at the end of last year to reduce
prices indefinitely on 1,000 product lines. Interim profits more than
doubled from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 8.76m.
Unlike B&amp;Q, however, which sells mainly proprietary brands, Wickes sells
mainly own-label products, which have earned a strong reputation for
quality.
Own-label is an important component in the strategy of Sainsbury's Homebase,
another format favoured by analysts. Homebase has an upmarket image, and
'softer' range.
The remaining two of the biggest five chains are finding life more
difficult. First-half profits at Texas Homecare fell from Pounds 16.6m to
Pounds 2m. Texas, which had become a specialist in home adornment, is
testing a 'harder' format.
Do It All faces the most difficulties, although co-parent WH Smith last
month announced that interim losses had fallen from Pounds 14.3m to Pounds
10.5m following the chain's rationalisation.
What was supposed to be the way ahead for Do It All, its New Trading Concept
format, did not meet expectations, and is being replaced by the Project
Focus Store. This has a 'softer' feel and does not group products so rigidly
into DIY project categories as the NTC format.
WH Smith and Boots say Do It All should return to profits in the next
financial year. It would be helped - as would all DIY chains - by a
substantial upturn in the housing market. For the moment, there seems little
sign of that.

FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Fidelity launches third investment trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fidelity is to launch its third investment trust, a UK special situations
fund to be run in parallel with the group's existing special situation unit
trust.
Fidelity Special Values will be managed by a team led by Mr Anthony Bolton,
the respected manager who has been responsible for the special situations
unit trust since its launch in 1979.
It ranks second of 54 funds in the UK equity growth sector over 10 years,
and fourth of 130 over three years, but 54th of 116 over five years (source:
Micropal).
The investment strategy for both funds is based on a contrarian approach,
concentrating on individual companies rather than economic factors.
Fidelity's team of UK analysts looks for companies with recovery or growth
potential not fully priced into the shares, under-researched and undervalued
companies, takeover candidates, restructurings and so on.
The fund will be at least 80 per cent invested in the UK, with small amounts
elsewhere in Europe and the US.
Fidelity has a programme of launching investment trusts based on its most
successful unit trusts, to broaden the appeal of its range to investors.
The new trust will be launched with a placing and public offer, due to open
on October 19. Ordinary shares at 100p will have warrants attached in a
one-to-five ratio, and the trust will be geared by the issue of equity
index-linked loan stock, up to the value of 25 per cent of the net proceeds
of the share issue.

FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Advance by bingo clubs helps Vardon to
Pounds 1.54m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong performance from bingo clubs helped Vardon, the leisure group which
also owns the London Dungeon, increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 540,000
to Pounds 1.54m at the interim stage.
Vardon's visitor attractions also advanced strongly, contributing Pounds
7.52m (Pounds 5.44m) to total turnover of Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 6.45m) in the
six months to the end of June. The bingo division contributed Pounds 5.16m
(Pounds 1.02m) to sales while operating profits rose from Pounds 79,000 to
Pounds 946,000.
'Our strategy of developing purpose-built, edge-of-town, high quality
facility bingo clubs is proving correct. The new clubs are attracting
younger and more affluent players,' Mr David Hudd, chairman, said.
Vardon runs 11 bingo clubs, five of which have been specially built on the
outskirts of towns, mostly near shopping complexes with parking facilities.
The company has plans for four new clubs, including one in Croydon which
will be the biggest in the UK with a capacity for 3,200.
The attractions division, which includes 15 sea life centres, a Cornish seal
sanctuary and the London and York Dungeons, saw operating profits rise from
Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 1.3m. Mr Hudd said the new sea life centres in
Tynemouth and Newquay were trading well, although the hot, dry weather had
led to a mixed performance from indoor coastal attractions.
Three new sea life centres are planned, including a Pounds 4.4m aquarium at
Brinley Place in the centre of Birmingham which the company expects will
attract 400,000 customers a year. The London Dungeon attracts 550,000
annually.
Vardon committed Pounds 11m to its development programme in 1994, Pounds 6m

cent increase in port revenues.
The port operations' workforce has fallen from 9,500 to 1,800 since 1983,
and with its reduced and largely fixed cost base, increasing revenues flow
comparatively directly into profits.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 amounted to Pounds 38m, up
from Pounds 29.4m, despite only a Pounds 1.8m increase in turnover to Pounds
99.4m.
Severence costs fell from Pounds 4m to Pounds 800,000, with 30 lay-off's so
far this year. However, there were no fixed asset sales, which had provided
Pounds 1.5m of profit in 1993.
A number of high turnover operations have been closed, but the ports saw
total throughput increase by 4 per cent during the period, rising from 53m
to 55m tonnes.
Sir Keith Stuart, chairman, was up-beat about the performance, saying:
'prospects for the group are excellent, with our ports well placed to take
advantage of the upturn in the UK economy and expanding world trade'.
The Southampton Container Terminals, jointly owned with P&amp;O Containers, saw
a 22 per cent increase in container throughput, and trans-shipment cargo
rose 50 per cent, as it took business from other European ports.
Profits from port operations rose from Pounds 28.4m to Pounds 35.7m, and
income from the leasing of port-related property and land increased from
Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 11.1m.
The company has invested consistently in its port and transport facilities,
and plans to maintain annual capital expenditure at between Pounds 50m and
Pounds 60m.
During the period, it invested Pounds 23m. Net borrowings rose to Pounds
349m (Pounds 345m at December 31); however, gearing fell from 52.5 per cent
to 51.4 per cent, and uncapitalised interest costs were Pounds 15.2m (Pounds
17.1m).
Property investment income rose from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 5.8m, in spite of
the impact of last year's property sales.
Property development profits fell from Pounds 1m to Pounds 600,000, but the
sales programme is likely to accelerate over the next one to two years, as
ABP refocuses on property adjacent to its port operations.
The interim dividend is being increased from 1.75p to 2p, with earnings per
share of 7.6p (5.9p).
COMMENT
First it was obstructive labour practices, and then its dabbling in the
property market, but ABP's future is now looking better than ever. With high
operational gearing, profits will rapidly outpace a steady recovery in
revenues. ABP should continue to win business from the continent and smaller
British ports, while trade continues to expand with the growing economy.
Analysts are looking for up to Pounds 78m profits for the full year, putting
the shares on a premium p/e rating of 17.4. Given the strength of core
earnings, and the renewed potential for property profits, there should be
more growth to come.

FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 4m loss at Gent after retail
withdrawal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A withdrawal from retail activities led to pre-tax losses of Pounds 4.28m at
SR Gent, the Marks and Spencer garment supplier, for the year to June 30.
The group reported a downturn from pre-tax profits last year of Pounds
2.52m, despite turnover rising 7 per cent from Pounds 120.5m to Pounds
129.3m.
Retailing losses stood at Pounds 10.5m, including a provision of Pounds 7m
of exceptional costs to cover the sale of Susan Woolf, a chain of women's
fashion stores.
However, the group's core business of garment production posted a 20 per
cent rise in operating profits to Pounds 7.12m (Pounds 5.93m), while
turnover rose just 1 per cent to Pounds 117.5m (Pounds 116m).
Mr Peter Wolff, chairman, said the Barnsley-based group was completing a
strategy of moving 50 per cent of its garment production overseas. The
company owns 25 per cent of a manufacturing company in Sri Lanka, with a
workforce of 14,000. 'We are going back into our core business of
manufacturing,' he said.
Demand from Marks and Spencer is expected to rise this year as the group
enters the menswear clothing market for the first time. The company has also
seen growing demand for cinema-related merchandising in children's clothes.
The pre-tax profits figure was struck after net interest charges up from
Pounds 1.93m to Pounds 2.4m, although the share of associates' profits rose
to Pounds 758,000 (Pounds 430,000 losses).
The shares closed up 6p at 75p yesterday. Earnings per share fell from 3.2p
into a loss of 12.6p this year after exceptional costs.
The final dividend was again 1.35p for a total of 2.25p (2.1p).

FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: London Forfaiting declines to Pounds 7.34m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Forfaiting, the specialist trade finance group, yesterday reported a
30 per cent drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 7.34m for
the first half of the year.
The company blamed volatile conditions in the eurobond market, particularly
in the emerging markets, for the downturn. Trading income declined 5.5 per
cent to Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 15.5m), while earnings per share fell from
8.03p to 5.33p. The interim dividend is maintained at 3.2p.
Mr Jack Wilson, chairman, said that the core export finance business, which
is involved in making fixed-rate loans, had performed well.
In particular, the eastern European export market had turned up, and the
company was continuing to see good returns from its financing of European
exports to Asia and South America. To this end, the group had opened an
office in Stockholm to tap the Swedish export finance market.
The transferable loans business was another bright spot. New loans worth
more than Dollars 1bn had been arranged so far this year for Asian
borrowers.
These included London Forfaiting's first foray into the Japanese market with
a Dollars 100m transferable loan for Takefuji Corporation. There was also a
Dollars 170m floating note facility for a Bangkok bank. More than 80 per
cent of the company's revenues are earned overseas.
However, Mr Wilson said that the continuing uncertain bond market conditions
made it impossible to give a prediction on current trading. The fall in
profits had been well flagged by the company, which had warned at the annual
results of tough trading conditions, but came in ahead of market
expectations. The shares climbed 11p to 175p.

FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Argent Pounds 448,000 in black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argent, the property investment and development company which made its Stock
Exchange debut in May, reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 448,000 in the
six months to the end of June against a loss of Pounds 1.2m last time.
However, last year's figures did not include profits from Argent's portfolio
of investment properties which were held off-balance sheet in joint ventures
until March.
Yesterday's result includes rents and interest payments on this portfolio
from March 11, the date of consolidation. Rental income amounted to Pounds
3.98m in this period and interest costs Pounds 3.08m.
Administrative expenses at Pounds 1.15m (Pounds 647,000) were higher as a
result of the additional staff costs and expenses arising from quoted
company status.
Mr Peter Freeman, joint chief executive, said he expected administration
costs for the full year to be about Pounds 2.5m. Earnings per share were
1.3p.
Since flotation Argent has complete two large deals. At its Brindleyplace
development in central Birmingham, the company let 120,000 sq ft of office
space to British Telecommunications on a 15-year lease and acquired an
adjacent 170,000 sq ft building - also let to BT - for Pounds 5.1m.
British Airways Pension Fund has agreed to finance the development of an
additional 68,000 sq ft office building at Brindleyplace.
At the end of last month, Argent acquired 28 acres of land at the Thames
Valley Business Park in Reading for Pounds 17.4m and immediately sold seven
acres for Pounds 5.8m.
Mr Freeman said that the company was considering development options for
this site.
The shares closed down 2p yesterday at 273p, well above the offer price of
255p in May.

FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Northern motor retailers merge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of north-west England's best known motor industry retailers, Ron
Stratton and Company, based in Knutsford, Cheshire, and Ian Anthony, of
Bolton, Greater Manchester, have merged.
Ron Stratton concentrates on low mileage specialist cars such as Ferrari,
Rolls Bentley, Mercedes and Porsche, while Ian Anthony is a BMW dealership.
Mr Stratton and Mr Jon Crossley, his sales director, will join the expanded
Ian Anthony (Holdings) board of directors headed by Mr Ian Blenkinsop,
founder and managing director of Ian Anthony.
Mr Stratton and Mr Blenkinsop are equal partners in the merger. Their
current operations have a combined annual turnover of Pounds 25m.
Montague Private Equity has taken a minority shareholding in Ian Anthony
(Holdings) and will help to fund a new showroom offering the range of cars
in which Stratton specialises, alongside Ian Anthony's existing Bolton BMW
showroom.
The Knutsford operation will continue to trade under the name Ron Stratton
and Company.
Over a period of 20 years Mr Stratton, whose past customers include the Al
Fayeds, Mr Eddie Shah and ex-Beatle George Harrison, built up the largest
Ferrari and Rolls Royce dealership outside London before selling out to
Pendragon in 1991.

FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Polypipe maintains growth with 20.5% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Polypipe, the manufacturer of plastic pipes and fittings and other domestic
plastic products, yesterday announced results which continue its unbroken
run of successive annual profit increases since its 1985 flotation.
Pre-tax profits for the year to June 30 grew 20.5 per cent to Pounds 20.6m
(Pounds 17.1m) on turnover ahead 21 per cent at Pounds 145.4m (Pounds
120.5m). Operating profits rose 20 per cent to Pounds 20.9m (Pounds 17.4m),
before unchanged net interest payable of Pounds 300,000. The shares rose 5p
to 144p yesterday.
Mr Kevin McDonald, chairman, managing director and owner of 21.2 per cent of
the group, ascribed the maintenance of margins to three essential factors.
First, he spoke of 'the group's consistent strategy of investment in a
substantial and continuing capital expenditure programme'. In the year this
rose to Pounds 15.3m (Pounds 12.5m), against depreciation of Pounds 8.9m
(Pounds 7.2m). Planned expenditure for the current year was Pounds 12.5m,
with, said Mr Bryan Stock, finance director, 'Pounds 5m to Pounds 6m on
plant, Pounds 3m on tooling, Pounds 1m on buildings and the rest on
lorries'.
Second, on the expansion front, the group bought Allerton Glass - now merged
with GCA Windows - in June 1993, and last May it spent up to Pounds 10.1m on
Janoplast, the Alsace-based manufacturer with 11 per cent of the French
plastic conduit market.
The French company, Polypipe's entree into Europe, contributed Pounds 1.9m
to group sales in the year. It exports 9 per cent of its turnover, taking
Polypipe beyond the French and into the Belgian, Czech, German and Swiss
markets.
Third was the group's 'ever-expanding range of products'. Part of the motive
for this is the search to make products to the same specification but using
less raw material. Mr McDonald said price rises of PVC of 20 per cent or
more had led the group to lift its own selling prices.
Polypipe had no gearing at the year-end and cash balances of Pounds 1.6m
(Pounds 6.7m).
Earnings rose 19 per cent to 8.83p (7.4p) and the recommended final dividend
is raised 10 per cent to 1.59p for a total of 2.3p (2.1p).
COMMENT
The biggest question exercising the City over Polypipe is: can it forever
pass the rises in raw material prices on to its customers? The answer seems
to be yes, for now. PVC accounts for 45-55 per cent of the group's selling
prices, but Polypipe does scour the earth for cheaper supplies. Polypipe is
also sensible in the way that some 60 per cent of its capital expenditure
goes into profit generating areas, with the figure rising to 70 per cent in
the current year. The recovery in the refurbishment market, echoed by
Caradon on Tuesday, should take the eye off flattish profits at Janoplast
for a year or two. With forecast pre-tax profits for the year at Pounds 24m,
the shares are on a multiple of 14, in line with the sector, but perhaps
with more to play for.

FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Defence of Enterprise offer cost Lasmo
Pounds 24m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three leading financial institutions received about Pounds 16m in fees to
defend the loss-making oil explorer, Lasmo, from a hostile Pounds 1.6bn bid
by rival independent Enterprise Oil.
Schroders, Goldman Sachs and NatWest Securities were paid about two-thirds
of the total Pounds 24m in bid costs, said Mr Joe Darby, chief executive.
The rest went in charges such as legal fees.
The failed bid has cost shareholders in the two companies almost Pounds 50m.
Enterprise disclosed last week that its costs, including an Pounds 18.3m
writedown on the value of its 10 per cent stake in Lasmo, would come to
Pounds 24m.
Lasmo's comments came as it announced first-half net losses of Pounds 22m,
against a Pounds 22m profit last time.
While the bid costs appeared to push the company into the red, these were
more than offset by a Pounds 36m gain on asset disposals. Turnover fell from
Pounds 309m to Pounds 306m, partly due to the lower oil price.
The results were largely in line with analysts' expectations. Yet the market
was impressed with the cost-cutting achieved in the period. Operating costs
per barrel fell by 15 per cent to Pounds 3.70. Mr Darby said he expected
average costs for the year to fall to between Pounds 3.50 and Pounds 3.55
per barrel.
By 1997, unit operating costs would be 25 per cent below 1993 levels.
Lasmo now had the financial strength to pursue exploration opportunities and
to develop its existing reserves, he said. The company aimed to produce
about 210,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day by 1996, against the current
167,000.
Gearing fell from 69 per cent to 37 per cent in the first half, largely due
to a Pounds 219m rights issue in the spring. Mr Darby estimated that annual
spending on exploration would average some Pounds 50m over the next three
years.
Of the 14 wells drilled in the first half, eight were successful and
included two substantial finds in Algeria. Development expenditure was
static at about Pounds 117m (Pounds 119m).
There was no interim dividend (1.3p). The loss per share was 2.6p (2.8p
profit).
COMMENT
Lasmo yesterday painted a picture of a company which was confident in its
strategy and future. The City was inclined to agree. However, even after all
the surgery, the company's finding costs will still only be on a par with
its rivals. This highlights a fundamental problem for exploration companies,
such as Lasmo and Enterprise, which have much higher finding costs than the
majors. After losses this year, Lasmo should be just back in profit in 1995,
assuming oil prices of Dollars 18. In 1996, a rising production and earnings
profile should lead to substantially improved profits. The most tempting
aspect for some investors, however, might be the very real prospect of a
foreign income dividend this year.

FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: W Canning doubles to Pounds 3.64m at midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
W Canning, the speciality chemicals company which sold its electronic
components distribution division in July, doubled pre-tax profits to Pounds
3.64m at the interim stage.
The Birmingham-based company reported increased turnover for the six months
to June 30 of Pounds 60.9m (Pounds 56.1m), including Pounds 34.9m (Pounds
33.1m) from speciality chemicals and Pounds 26.1m (Pounds 19.8m) from
electronic components distribution.
Mr David Probert, chairman, said that as a speciality chemicals company,
Canning intended 'to remain in and close to its core businesses, which are
capable of significant organic growth.'
The company was in a strong position to finance this growth and to make
acquisitions 'if suitable opportunities arise.'
At the end of the period net borrowings were Pounds 10.2m.
The group's chemicals division raised operating profits from Pounds 2.95m to
Pounds 3.29m. The sale of the electronics components side, which made Pounds
1.22m (Pounds 777,000), will lead to a Pounds 13m exceptional loss in the
1994 accounts, related to goodwill.
The interim dividend is again 2.94p. Basic earnings per share rose to 7.5p
(2.1p). Last year's figure included an exceptional item of 3.3p.

FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: Woodchester plans to invest
IPounds 120m surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Woodchester Investment, the Dublin-based leasing and banking group, said
yesterday that it had IPounds 120m (Pounds 118m) of surplus capital which it
planned to invest in its core business.
The surplus capital has proved a drain on earnings, as falling interest
rates cost the group about IPounds 3m at the interim stage, and resulted in
a decline in pre-tax profits from IPounds 16.4m to IPounds 14.9m for the
first half of 1994.
Mr Dan O'Connor, deputy group chief executive, said Woodchester was
interested in expanding its UK operations through acquisitions. At present
about 75 per cent of UK profits come from vehicle financing, with the
remainder from small unit finance. The existing UK operations saw
significant improvements in profits and new business during the period.
Woodchester is in a process of consolidation after a radical restructuring
of its Irish operations, which resulted in IPounds 15m reorganisation costs
last year. The reorganisation followed a period of rapid expansion.
Mr O'Connor said the redundancy programme had been completed, and its
provisions would be 'more than adequate'.
Credit Lyonnais increased its stake from 49 to 53 per cent during the
period, and Woodchester said the French banking group was committed to
developing its Irish subsidiary as its vehicle finance arm in Europe.
Woodchester is taking on Credit Lyonnais Leasing Europe's businesses in
Denmark and Portugal, and is looking to extend its operations in other
European markets.
It expressed confidence in the future by increasing its dividend by 15 per
cent to 2.39p (2.08p), in spite of earnings falling from 6.37p to 5.53p.

terms
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Country Casuals, the clothing retailer, yesterday announced the departure of
its chairman and chief executive, Mr John Shannon, just a day after the
group saw more than a fifth of its market value wiped out following a
profits warning.
The group said Mr Shannon resigned when the board refused to extend his
contract. It is believed that Mr Shannon, who was on a one-year rolling
contract, had pressed for a two-year deal. He will be replaced as chief
executive by Mr Mark Bunce, finance director. Mr Tom Adam becomes
non-executive chairman.
Mr Shannon was one of three directors who bought Country Casuals from Coats
Viyella as part of a management buy-out in 1989. He was on a salary of
Pounds 106,000, with a one-year rolling contract, and is expected to receive
a payment of at least Pounds 145,000.

conditions in France.
The shares closed at 215p, down 28p, and almost half the year's high of
405p.
Mr Neville Buch, chairman, said that difficult trading conditions in France,
which accounts for half of turnover in a full year, had intensified. 'We
should have reacted earlier,' he said, warning that full-year results would
be lower than budgeted.
In the six months to end-June, pre-tax profits increased from a restated
Pounds 15.8m to Pounds 19.2m, while turnover grew from Pounds 82.5m to
Pounds 99.7m. The latest figures included Pounds 2.3m of profit and Pounds
9.9m of turnover from acquisitions.
Mr Christopher Crowcroft, finance director, said that on a like-for-like
basis operating profits were down 5 per cent, reflecting the French
situation. Turnover from all acquisitions, including those completed last
year, accounted for Pounds 16.2m of the total, while operating profits
benefited by Pounds 4.1m.
In France business was down 11 per cent and the amount of space sold fell by
13 per cent. Margins declined from 19 to 15 per cent, compared with total
group margins down from 24 to 22 per cent.
The decline in French business was reflected in a fall in the net cash
inflow to Pounds 10m (Pounds 26.5m).
Mr Staffan Svenby, managing director, said that recession 'struck a large
part of our market and we were slow to react to what was going on. Customers
were questioning the value of exhibitions, and when we convinced them they
were worth doing they demanded increased value for money.'
The group is now restructuring its French operations, cutting nine divisions
down to four.
Business improved in the US, but margins fell from 32 to 25 per cent. In
contrast the UK business increased margins from 18 to 20 per cent.
Net interest payable fell from Pounds 4m to Pounds 2.9m.
Earnings per share declined from 11.7p to 10.8p, reflecting an increase in
the tax charge from 32 to 35 per cent and the low yield on the remaining
cash from last year's Pounds 76m convertible preference share issue.
The interim dividend is increased from 3.4p to 3.5p.
COMMENT
It will be some time before confidence in this stock can be restored. The
management, now wearing hair shirts, clearly believed that exhibitions were
relatively immune to recession. Their forecasts were too optimistic, and
they were not quick enough to adapt to changing conditions. While that has
all changed, it could be another six to nine months before any good news
emerges from France. However, investors willing to gamble on a strong future
for exhibitions might be attracted. If nothing else goes wrong, and earnings
next year reach 23p, the discount to the market is around 25 per cent, and
the yield is 6 per cent.

FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: ECC is flattered by land sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first interim profits from English China Clays since it demerged Camas,
its construction materials arm, in June were flattered by a sharp increase
in profits from land sales.
ECC's construction business increased sales from Pounds 13.2m to Pounds
37.9m and operating profits from Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 21.6m in the six
months to June 30. The group said it intends to sell off the business's land
bank over the next few years, subject to the state of the market.
The remaining land is worth an estimated Pounds 65m-Pounds 70m at current
market prices, but analysts estimate next year will mark the last
significant contribution to group profitability, with the remaining
disposals being spread over several years.
Mr Patrick Drayton, finance director, said it had been decided to keep the
construction business within ECC while it was being run down, because the
profits and cashflow from the disposals would have greatly distorted the
performance of the much smaller Camas.
ECC's group sales rose from Pounds 515m to Pounds 618m, including a full
contribution from Calgon, the US speciality chemicals business it bought
last June for Pounds 210m.
Calgon, which now makes up the speciality chemicals division, made operating
profits of Pounds 6.1m on sales of Pounds 78.5m. Growth was significant in
paper chemicals, but water management sales were down, reflecting customer
destocking, lower usage and competitive pricing.
Earnings per share rose to 11.47p (9.45p). An interim dividend of 5.35p,
combined with Camas's interim, gave an unchanged total of 6.6p.
COMMENT
ECC has cuts its workforce heavily in recent years, so should benefit
quickly from any increase in volumes, even without hoped-for price
increases. Analysts were pleased by signs that this operational gearing is
already being demonstrated in Europe, but remain puzzled as to why the US
paper industry seems to be recovering so slowly. With gearing of only 30 per
cent, Mr Teare has plenty of elbow room to pursue his strategy of growing
the speciality chemicals business by acquisition. Forecast full-year profits
of Pounds 104m put the shares, down 10p to 381p yesterday, on a prospective
multiple of 17. The premium to the market increases if one strips out the
contribution to earnings from land sales. That seems reasonable, at least
until the US situation becomes clearer.

FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Co-op Bank aided by lower bad debt
provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A combination of lower provisions for bad and doubtful debts and higher
operating income helped Co-operative Bank to a 37 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits for the year to late July.
As well as announcing the interim results, the bank sought to underline its
commitment to service for customers by launching a guarantee in five areas
of service where it will pay Pounds 10 compensation each time it fails to
meet the standards it has set itself.
Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 11.05m (Pounds 8.07m), while provisions fell
by 15 per cent to Pounds 16.68m (Pounds 19.53m).
Mr Terry Thomas, managing director, said he expected provisions to fall
further though the scale of reductions would depend on economic improvement.
He said that while Monday's 0.5 percentage point rise in the base rate would
make balances held by the bank worth more, it would not give an opportunity
to widen interest margins. He predicted continuing pressure on margins,
suggesting that they might fall a further 0.1 percentage point in the second
half of the year.
Despite the lower net interest margin of 4.5 per cent (4.8 per cent), net
interest increased to Pounds 71.8m (Pounds 69.4m) partly as a result of
higher retail loans and deposits.
Non-interest income which includes commission from Visa, the card payment
system, rose by Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 52.5m.
Expenses rose by 5 per cent to Pounds 96.4m (Pounds 91.9m), reflecting
particularly an increase in costs from losing and relocating staff as a
result of the bank's re-organisation. The bank is expanding the number of
its automated banking kiosks from 16 to 30 by the end of the year, but does
not expect to open any more branches.
Mr Thomas also said that the bank's five guaranteed service standards for
its 2m personal customers covered areas such as dealing correctly with
standing orders and direct debits, and swift decisions on overdrafts or
personal loans.
It amounted, he said to a challenge to the other banks to offer similar
guarantees. The bank estimates there will be significantly fewer than 40,000
errors a year. He dismissed the promise made by Midland Bank of Pounds 10
compensation for each error made in transferring a customer's current
account from another bank as a 'nine days' wonder'.

FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Devro at Pounds 14m seeks to expand range
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Devro International, the Scottish-based company which makes sausage casings
out of the protein collagen, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 14.1m in the six
months to June 30, a 17 per cent rise on the pro-forma figures of the
corresponding period of 1993.
Mr Leon Allen, chairman, said the company was 'continuing to progress as
planned.' It would continue to examine opportunities around the world 'to
extend and improve our product range.'
Sales rose 3 per cent to Pounds 47.5m (Pounds 46.3m), of which 1 per cent
was due to exchange rate factors.
Devro, which was founded by Johnson &amp; Johnson, was floated on the stock
exchange last year after earlier being bought out by its managers.
The company said it had done well in the first half in the UK, the US and
the Australian markets, in all of which it has manufacturing plants. But it
suffered a 19 per cent drop in sales in Japan, mainly because of recession.
New product lines are being brought out for the Japanese and Scandinavian
markets. New manufacturing plant has been installed at Bellshill in Scotland
to increase output of collagen film.
Devro is also testing a new product, aimed at the US market, for sausages of
up to 45mm diameter, compared with its present limit of 30mm.
Despite increased raw material costs, operating margins rose from 27 per
cent to 29.5 per cent. Interest received of Pounds 100,000 (Pounds 470,000
charge) reflected increased cash on the balance sheet of Pounds 9.2m,
against Pounds 4.2m at December 31.
Earnings per share were 7.9p (6.4p) and an increased interim dividend of
2.35p is being paid (2.08p).
COMMENT
Devro is a conservatively run company whose future lies in the gradual
erosion by collagen of traditional gut sausage casing. To speed up the
process it is developing several new products for its far-flung markets. Its
results were in line with expectations, but the shares fell 19p to 230p on a
poor day for the stock exchange. There was evidently some profit taking as
the market realised that Devro's operating margin will have to be even more
powerful to offset the rising tax charge of the next few years. Some
analysts are questioning its growing cash pile, but Devro insists it is
under no pressure to reduce it, though it does not rule out acquisitions.
Analysts are sticking to their forecast of about Pounds 29.5m for the full
year, meaning earnings per share of 16.5p and a prospective multiple of 14.
That suggests a period of consolidation for Devro.

FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Camas 44% ahead to Pounds 4.9m - Upturn in
UK building materials market fuels the advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Increases in sales and prices in UK building materials lifted pre-tax
profits of Camas, Britain's fifth largest aggregates group, by 44 per cent
from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 4.9m in the first six months of 1994. Turnover
grew from Pounds 174m to Pounds 210m.
The company yesterday announced its first half year figures since it
demerged from English China Clays at the beginning of June.
Mr Alan Shearer, chief executive, said the first-half profits had gained
from an initial contribution from the Kost building materials businesses,
acquired in the US for Dollars 31.5m (Pounds 21.5m) earlier this year.
Camas, which is paying an interim dividend of 1.25p, expects to pay a total
of at least 3.75p this year. Earnings per share rose from 0.98p to 1.6p
after adding back Pounds 1.5m exceptional costs of the demerger.
Profits from the European division, of which the UK accounts for about 90
per cent, rose by more than a third to Pounds 8.7m (Pounds 6.5m). Sales
volumes of crushed rock, sand and gravel rose by about 13 per cent. Prices
had increased by an average 10 per cent since the beginning of the year.
The sales increase was mainly the result of a sharp rise in private sector
housebuilding and increased private industrial construction. Coated stone
sales had risen by 5.6 per cent, reflecting a higher level of road
construction and maintenance, said Mr Shearer.
The group's operations in the Channel Islands also increased profits, helped
by two land reclamation contracts in Jersey.
US profits increased from Pounds 804,000 to Pounds 1.4m, including a first
time contribution of Pounds 747,000 from the former Kost businesses in North
Dakota. Without this contribution, US profits would have fallen from Pounds
804,000 to Pounds 656,000.
The decline was because of the completion of construction and a subsequent
delay in opening Denver's new airport. This had led to the postponement of
private infrastructure projects, such as hotels, which were expected to go
ahead when the airport opened, said Mr Shearer.
Profits from Minneapolis and St Paul's, the group's other regional US
business, were slightly higher than at the same stage last year.
Net debt at the end of June was Pounds 75.2m, representing 34 per cent of
shareholders' funds of Pounds 223.1m. The company said that this was likely
to reduce to about Pounds 65m, with 30 per cent gearing, by the year end.
COMMENT
The UK has performed better than expected and the US worse because of the
delayed opening of the Denver airport, which is likely to continue to affect
the group into the first half of next year. A few eyebrows also might be
raised at the company's report of increased costs in its non-aggregate UK
building materials business. Elsewhere there were few surprises. Pre-tax
profits of Pounds 18m this year and Pounds 25m next would put the shares on
prospective multiples of more than 18 and 14, which is fair value but
already in the price - which should be expected for a company which
published its demerger prospectus only four months ago.

FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Flotation values Compel at Pounds 19m with
125p share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Compel Group were priced at 125p per share yesterday in a placing
with institutional investors which values the computer systems and services
company at Pounds 19.07m.
The group is issuing 2.48m new shares to raise Pounds 3.1m, with existing
shareholders selling 4.12m shares worth Pounds 5.15m. Directors and their
families will retain about 24 per cent of the enlarged share capital.
Mr Neville Davis, chairman and chief executive, said: 'this is funding
working capital needs which the business requires to keep growing. We have
made acquisitions over recent years and continue to look for more, but we
have nothing in mind at the moment.'
Compel intends to expand its sales force at its existing UK network of seven
offices, with a new office planned to open in the City.
The proceeds of the flotation provide a partial exit for Compel's venture
capital investors, 3i and Lloyds Development Capital. It is also expected to
boost the share option scheme for employees, a third of whom are already
shareholders.
The company, which focused on corporate clients after a management buy-out
in 1987, provides computer systems to blue chip and public sector customers
including Glaxo, Manchester City Council and the Post Office.
The group announced a sharp increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 604,000
to Pounds 2.06m in the year to June 30, following a wide-ranging
restructuring which saw staff numbers cut by 14 per cent to 227. In the same
period, turnover rose from Pounds 43.8m to Pounds 54.5m, with operating
profit lifting from Pounds 898,000 to Pounds 2.36m.
At the placing price, the historic p/e ratio is 12.08, with a notional
dividend yield of 4 per cent.
The issue is sponsored and fully underwritten by Societe Generale Strauss
Turnbull Securities, which is also the broker to the placing.

FT  15 SEP 94 / T&amp;N obtains option to control Kolbenschmidt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T&amp;N, the UK automotive components and engineering group, last night agreed
to acquire an option to buy a majority stake in Kolbenschmidt, a leading
German motor components producer. The complex deal, which would give T&amp;N a
dominant position in the German market for some key engine components, must
be approved by the German cartel authorities.
Metallgesellschaft, the troubled German metals, mining and engineering
group, is to sell its 47 per cent holding in Kolbenschmidt. Magna
International, the Canadian automotive components group, is to reduce its
stake in Kolbenschmidt from 12.5 to 2.5 per cent. As a first step,
Commerzbank is to take over a 24.99 per cent holding in Kolben-schmidt, and
German institutional investors will take over 32 per cent.
Metallgesellschaft said the deal meant its disposal programme was almost
complete.
T&amp;N has acquired an option on the Commerzbank-held shares and on a stake of
25.01 per cent to be held by the institutions. The option must be exercised
by March 31 1995. T&amp;N could take the remaining 2.5 per cent still held by
Magna, giving it an option to acquire a total stake of 52.5 per cent. The
deal could cost T&amp;N almost DM300m (Pounds 123.9m).
Last year T&amp;N bought German-based Goetze, Europe's largest producer of
piston rings. Kolbenschmidt had sales of DM1.59bn in 1992-93.
