FT  13 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norwegian government approves
Pounds 1.75bn upgrade plan for ageing Ekofisk oil field

The Norwegian government yesterday announced approval of Phillips
Petroleum's NKr19bn (Pounds 1.75bn) upgrade plans for the ageing Ekofisk
field in the North Sea, ending two years of uncertainty over its future.
The field is the hub of the world's largest oil transportation system. In
1992 the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the oil industry watchdog,
threatened to close the 250,000-barrels a day field by 1996 for safety
reasons.
The industry and energy ministry said the upgrade would comprise the
construction of two steel well-head platforms to house drilling and
production facilities. The development is also expected to reduce carbon
dioxide emissions from the field by an estimated 1m tonnes.
The government estimates the sales value of the crude oil to be produced
from the field between 1999 and 2028 at NKr130bn, based on a price of
Dollars 15 a barrel.
The ministry confirmed plans by the state to take a direct 5 per cent stake
in the field separate from that of Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company,
which has a 1 per cent shareholding.
The state also decided to increase its shareholdings in the Norpipe oil and
gas pipelines to 70 per cent from 50 per cent from respectively the years
2005 and 2007. This would mean a reduction to 30 per cent of private
shareholders respective stakes in the pipelines.
The oil pipeline runs from Ekofisk to Teesside in England while the gas
pipeline runs to Emden in Germany.
The ministry also confirmed that it would waive a 16 per cent production
tariff for the new facilities during the 1999-2028 period. Earlier the
ministry said the extension of the licence combined with the production
tariff waiver would mean cost savings of NKr900m.

The good general demand was sustained, reports the Tea Brokers' Association.
Coloury Assams met strong competition and prices ruled fully firm to often
dearer. Plainer North Indians also sold well at generally higher levels. The
few brightest East Africans on offer tended 2 to 5 pence easier although
pd's were a good feature and prices advanced. Coloury mediums remained
unchanged but lesser mediums lost 2 to 4 pence. Ceylons were about steady.
Offshore: fairly good demand at around last levels. Quotations: best
available 160p/kg, good 135p/kg, good medium 128p/kg, medium 108p/kg, low
medium 80p/kg. The highest price realised this week was 161p/kg for a Kenya
pd.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: English bees in quarantine as
disease spreads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Honey bees are to be kept in quarantine across most of England in an effort
to control the spread of a disease that can wipe out whole colonies, the UK
government announced yesterday.
Varroa, a parasitic mite that weakens bees, first arrived in England in the
spring of 1992. In November that year, the government introduced controls on
the movement of bees in the greater London area and 22 mainly southern
counties.
The disease was subsequently found in six more counties, prompting an
intensive search for the mite across the whole country by scientists from
the Ministry of Agriculture's National Bee Unit in Warwickshire.
Their minute investigations of over 5,000 bee colonies uncovered varroa in
75 apiaries in a further eight counties. That took the total of affected
metropolitan and shire counties in England to 36 out of 45.
From January 1 next year, beekeepers in the 14 more recently affected
counties will be subject to the 1992 restrictions.
They will only be able to move their charges, and any hive frames containing
honeycomb, into or out of the infected areas if they have licences.
Movement of bees and frames within the infected zones will remain
unrestricted.
Despite the spread of the disease, Mr Michael Jack, junior agriculture
minister, expressed confidence yesterday that the country's beekeepers were
learning to control varroasis with pesticides and that 'we shall retain a
healthy bee population in the UK'.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Analysts say West can do
without Russian nickel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nickel production is rising so fast that new output from western producers
will more that compensate for any fall in Russian exports, according to some
analysts who have been looking into the recent very sharp rise in nickel
prices.
Much of the price rise has been accompanied by rumours about production
problems at Norilsk in Russia, the world's biggest supplier.
'Traders who have pounced on every bullish rumour have been rewarded with
ever-higher prices and bigger commissions just before the Christmas
holiday,' one analyst pointed out.
Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, said that, even if problems at
Norilsk had cost output of 30,000 tonnes, this equated to only two weeks
consumption at the present rate. Two weeks off current stocks would still
leave them equivalent to 13 weeks of consumption and six week above 'normal'
levels.
He said that during the winter months shipments from Norilsk were reduced to
a trickle so there would be no impact from the shortfall for some months. In
any case, the Siberian port of Dudinka and, it was thought, Rotterdam in the
Netherlands, had substantial stocks of nickel that could be delivered to
London Metal Exchange warehouses. Also, western nickel producers were very
rapidly raising output - Mr Moore estimated production would increase next
year by 70,000 tonnes.
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton Metals, is forecasting a
65,000 tonnes rise - or 11 per cent - in western nickel production to
655,000 tonnes in 1995 followed by a further slight increase to 665,000
tonnes in 1996.
Nickel consumption is also forecast by Billiton to grow strongly because of
increasing demand from the stainless steel industry, the main user of
nickel. But, says Mr MacMillan, 'the most extreme case imaginable - of zero
Norilsk shipments next year - would still leave us with stocks at 16 weeks
of consumption by the end of 1995 if our demand forecast is near the mark.'
Billiton is forecasting that net imports of nickel to the west will slide
from 135,000 tonnes this year to 120,000 tonnes in 1995 and to 115,000
tonnes in 1996. Nevertheless, this would still leave total western world
supply up from 730,000 tonnes this year to 780,000 tonnes in 1995 and
785,000 tonnes in 1996. If these forecasts prove correct, there would be a
nickel surplus of 10,000 tonnes this year, of 20,000 tonnes in 1995 and no
supply deficit until 1996, when there would be one of 15,000 tonnes.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries lower ahead of economic news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury prices fell from last week's highs in quiet trading yesterday as
investors awaited economic figures on producer and consumer prices due out
today and tomorrow.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 9/16 at
95 5/16 yielding 7.905 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was  7/32 lower at 99 9/32 , yielding 7.631 per cent.
Last week, the market benefited somewhat as investors sought safe
investments in the wake of uncertainty surrounding Orange County,
California's declaration of bankruptcy. Yesterday, however investors turned
their attention to the spate of economic data due out this week.
Most economists expect both the producer price index, due today, and the
consumer price index, due tomorrow, to show increases for November.
So far this year the CPI has held relatively steady, increasing by about 0.2
per cent a month despite inflationary pressures elsewhere in the economy.
Economists believe the CPI for November will show an increase of 0.3 per
cent.
Also important will be tomorrow's release of capacity utilisation figures,
which show the percentage of capital being used for the creation of goods.
Analysts expect November's figure to increase to 84.8 per cent from 84.6 per
cent in October. The figures should give traders an indication of what the
Federal Reserve might do at the December 20 meeting of its open market
committee.
With no important economic data released yesterday, the market reacted to
comments from President Bill Clinton that he was not averse to a tax cut.
Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Mr Clinton said he felt the country could
afford a middle-class tax cut. This sparked concern among Treasury bond
traders of a growing deficit that could add to inflationary pressure.
The fall in US Treasuries yesterday gave a weaker tone to the European
government bond markets, but they also had their own problems.
French bond prices were hit by the announcement from Mr Jacques Delors that
he would not run for election as French president.
Meanwhile, Italian bonds were affected by government uncertainties and fell
by more than a point.
French prices fell on increased political uncertainty after the withdrawal
of Mr Delors from the presidential campaign. The December Notionnel future
on Liffe fell 0.90 to 112.28.
Mr Dominique Barbet, at Paribas Capital Markets in Paris said French bonds
had fallen 10 basis points as a result of the move by Mr Delors. He said:
'They may fall another 10 or 20 basis points, because we have a lot of
uncertainty in the French market. Among socialists, Mr Delors was the one
the market liked the most.'
Italian government bonds were affected yesterday by international and
domestic politics. Prices were affected by the announcement by Mr Delors
because it suggested that European monetary union was further away.
Meanwhile, Mr Roberto Maroni, Italy's interior minister, said the coalition
forming the government could be different next year.
Mr Simon Maggs at IBJ said volatility in Italian bonds had lessened since
the budget looked like getting through parliament, but had now increased.
The yield on 10-year government bonds rose 24 basis points to 12.37 per
cent.
UK gilts were largely unmoved by the November producer price data, although
they took their tone from US Treasuries and the December long gilt future
moved down  13/32 to trade around 102 1/16 . The spread over bunds was
around 123 basis points.
Mr Kevin Adams at BZW said the PPI numbers were pretty much in line with
expectations, and investors would now be waiting for the data on unit labour
costs, which is due out tomorrow.
Recent political troubles for the ruling Conservative party were not seen to
move the market yesterday, although Mr Robert Thomas at NatWest Markets
said: 'If it were not for the government staggering from one political
crisis to another, it would be realistic to forecast that the gilt/bund
spread for 10-year maturities could narrow down to 100 basis points or
less.'
Mr Harry Thapar at Technical Data said: 'Gilts have not yet priced in the
political risk, because they remain surrounded by post-budget bliss'.
German government bonds slipped in thin trading. The March bund futures
contract on Liffe fell 0.13 to 89.84.
An analyst in Frankfurt said bunds were trading in a range of 89.73 to
89.90, and were likely to continue to do so until after the Christmas break.

FT  13 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Cresvale brings first placing
for Romanian group - International equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cresvale, a subsidiary of France's Banque Pallas Stern, has completed the
first international placing of shares for a Romanian company, raising some
Dollars 1.5m from institutional investors for Societatea R, the local
publishing group.
The deal is one of a number of international issues planned ahead of the
expected opening of the Bucharest stock exchange early next year.
Mr Paddy Shanahan, head of European emerging markets at Cresvale, said the
group aims to raise some Dollars 6m for a local services company and Dollars
5m for an industrial group early in the new year.
Some 66,000 of the new Societatea shares were issued to repay borrowings,
and Cresvale acquired additional shares from employees. In total, just under
30 per cent of the company has been sold to international investors. The
paper will trade over-the-counter.
Societatea R publishes Romania Libera, a popular broadsheet newspaper with a
circulation of 200,000, and also has a range of other magazine and
book-binding interests. Mr Shanahan said that on estimated 1994 earnings,
the share is currently trading on a price earnings ratio of seven.
Cresvale is involved in other under-developed east European markets. Earlier
this year it raised Dollars 8m through an international placement of shares
in Estonia's Hansa Bank. Its asset management department also launched the
Baltic Republics Fund in August.
Some 30 per cent of the fund, which is oversubscribed and was capped at
Dollars 30m in August, is currently invested in Estonia. Among its
investments is the wood processing company, Viisnurk, an internationally
known manufacturer of cross country skis. Cresvale's Prometheus Fund,
launched in beginning of 1994, has invested some Dollars 12m in Russia and
eastern Europe.
Pricing of the shares of Tadiran, the Israeli electronics company which is
planning an offering in New York, is expected in the next few days.
The issue, which follows an initial public offering in 1992, is expected to
raise Dollars 80m including a Dollars 7.4m greenshoe option. Merrill Lynch
is lead-managing the deal.
Roughly 3.9m of the company's shares are being sold: 2.34m in the US and
1.56m on international markets. The shares will also be listed in London on
the SEAQ market and in Tel Aviv.
Oppenheimer, Lehman Brothers, UBS and BZW are co-lead managers. After the
offering, Koor Industries' stake in Tadiran will fall from 76 to 52 per
cent.
SG Warburg and UBS, joint global co-ordinators for the international issue
of shares in EVC, Europe's largest manufacturer of polyvinyl chloride,
yesterday took advantage of the 'greenshoe option', increasing the size of
the issue by a further 1m shares.
The greenshoe allowed an issue of up to 1.35m extra shares. The shares were
yesterday trading at Fl 77.1 compared with an issue price of Fl 77.
ICI of the UK and Enichem of Italy each sold 35 per cent stakes in EVC,
raising a total of Fl 770m.

FT  13 DEC 94 / International Bonds: 3M makes a rare visit with Dollars 200m
two-year offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continued strong demand from European retail investors for short-dated bond
offerings tempted borrowers into the US dollar and Australian dollar sectors
of the eurobond market yesterday.
However, new issuance was light with borrowers and investors winding down
for the Christmas period.
Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing, the diversified US manufacturing group,
better known as 3M, and a rare borrower on the eurobond market, launched a
Dollars 200m offering of two-year bonds priced to yield 9 basis points over
US government bonds.
Traders said the pricing was aggressive but lead manager JP Morgan said that
3M was keen to tap the market before favourable swap levels closed in the
new year.
JP Morgan said that the 7 3/4 per cent coupon was the highest available in
either the two or three-year areas of the dollar sector for an AAA rated
name, bar GECC's Dollars 200m offering launched last week with a 7.875 per
cent coupon.
Syndicate officials said the issue found firm demand among Swiss and Benelux
retail investors.
3M last borrowed in the eurobond market in May with a Dollars 200m
three-year offering that is now trading in the secondary market at 20 basis
points through US Treasuries, JP Morgan said.
Yield spreads in the eurodollar market narrowed slightly after widening
sharply last week.
Traders in the sector said that spreads over US government bonds on paper in
the two-year to five-year maturity range closed in by about three basis
points after widening sharply by about five basis points on the fear that
the financial crisis in Orange County, California, would lead to the
liquidation of its bond portfolio, resulting in a flood of bonds on to the
secondary market.
In the Australian dollar sector, the World Bank launched an ADollars 100m
issue of three-year bonds offering a coupon of 10 1/8 per cent.
New South Wales Treasury Corporation launched a ADollars 100m offering of
three-year bonds which were sold almost entirely into Japan, lead manager
Nomura said.
The lead said that Japanese investors are currently attracted to the
Australian market by the prospect of a strengthening in the country's
currency against the yen as the Australian economy continues to grow.
In the lire sector, Deutsche Bank Finance, the big German bank's external
financing vehicle, launched a L200bn issue of three-year bonds offering a
coupon of 11 per cent.
The bonds were sold to Italian retail investors, Belgian funds and German
investors, traders said.
The Republic of Argentina is set to make its debut in the euro-French franc
market this week with a FFr1bn issue maturing on January 6, 1998.
An official at Societe Generale, which is leading the deal, said that the
issue will yield some 240 to 250 basis points above French government bonds
and will have a coupon of 9.5 per cent.

FT  13 DEC 94 / International Company News: Plasterboard group rejects
takeover bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
National Gypsum, the second-largest US maker of plasterboard, has rejected a
Dollars 940m hostile bid from Delcor, an investor-group led by the company's
non-executive chairman Mr CD Spangler.
A special committee of the board said the proposed price of Dollars 43.50 a
share was 'inadequate' and the proposal 'highly conditional'. National
Gypsum's shares closed down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 39 7/8 .
Delcor, a division of investment company Golden Eagle Industries, owns 19
per cent of National Gypsum, which emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy last
autumn.
It is supported in its bid by the North Carolina-based investment banks
First Union Corporation and NationsBank . The bid is conditional on Delcor
'satisfying itself' on National Gypsum's liability for asbestos claims. A
trust fund was set up when the company emerged from bankruptcy to cover such
claims.
Lafarge Coppee, the French building materials group which owns 10 per cent
of National Gypsum, recently rejected a joint bid, although it is not clear
whether it will be actively opposing it.
It had been seen as a possible partner after working closely with Delcor to
acquire the stake last year.
Mr Allan Cecil, corporate spokesman for National Gypsum, said the company
was not talking to any other potential bidders.

It also said an informal committee of preferred stockholders had agreed a

In October, TWA asked creditors to swap Dollars 800m of the company's

FT  13 DEC 94 / International Company News: Former Macy chief moves to
Woolworth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Woolworth, the troubled US store group, yesterday pulled off a coup by
securing the services of one of the most highly regarded figures in US
retailing: Mr Roger Farah, formerly chief operating officer of the RH Macy
department store group.
Mr Farah, 41, is to become Woolworth's chairman and chief executive. He
faces turning around a company that reported six consecutive quarters of
losses before making a small profit in the latest quarter.
Before joining Macy, Mr Farah spent three years at Federated Department
Stores, the US retailing group that owns the Bloomingdale's chain. As head
of the group's central buying and product development arm, he earned a
reputation as a skilful merchandiser.
When Mr Farah announced he was leaving Federated for Macy, Federated tried
to block his move with a lawsuit claiming breach of contract. The companies
settled out of court, and Mr Farah began working for Macy in July.
Two weeks later, Macy, which had been operating under bankruptcy protection
since January 1992, agreed to merge with Federated, so Mr Farah, who had
alienated Federated by his perceived disloyalty, had to start looking for
another job.
At Woolworth, Mr Farah will replace Mr John Adams, an outside director who
had been acting as chairman and chief executive pending the replacement of
Mr William Lavin, who previously held both posts.
Mr Lavin was stripped of the chairmanship in May after it was discovered the
company had falsified some of its quarterly results to make losses look like
profits. He remained as chief executive, but left the company in October.
Woolworth has been trying to improve its financial performance by cutting
back on its fading five-and-dime store operations and diversifying into
specialty retailing. The strategy has failed to yield the expected results.
Yesterday, Mr Adams said Mr Farah had a record of accomplishment,
particularly in growing businesses. 'We are looking forward to benefiting
greatly from his leadership and his merchandising expertise'. Woolworth's
shares closed up Dollars 1/8 at Dollars 13 7/8.
Kmart, the ailing US discount store group, yesterday announced it was
eliminating 900 full-time equivalent jobs at its Troy, Michigan
headquarters.

FT  13 DEC 94 / International Company News: SmithKline sees another wave of
pharmaceuticals mergers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another wave of mergers and acquisitions will change the pharmaceuticals
industry as mid-sized companies succumb to larger competitors better able to
compete with developments in the healthcare industries, Mr Jan Leschly,
chief executive of SmithKline Beecham, the UK pharmaceuticals group, said
yesterday.
He was making the long-awaited account of progress in integrating the two US
companies that SmithKline bought this year for Dollars 5.2bn - DPS, the drug
distributor, and Sterling Health, the over-the-counter medicine maker.
Mr Leschly said some of SmithKline's 78 manufacturing sites and hundreds of
distribution centres would close as part of its restructuring programme
following the acquisitions. The purchases laid the ground for the company's
transformation into a broadly-based supplier of human healthcare whose
customers paid for healthcare, not doctors.
Mr Jerry Karabalas, SmithKline's president of North American
Pharmaceuticals, said there had been 'faster growth than expected' at DPS.
This was the more controversial of the acquisitions, which cost Dollars
2.3bn in May.
The deal was criticised as too costly for a small company with uncertain
growth prospects and fickle customer base.
Mr Karabalas said DPS's customer base had grown 27 per cent in eight months.
New corporate customers for which it helps manage the cost of buying
medicines included Disney, the entertainment company, Merrill Lynch, the US
securities house, and the 'very lucrative' United Mineworkers Union, which
spent Dollars 100m a year on drugs for retired miners.
He said DPS was likely to benefit as companies, which paid for their
employee's healthcare, sought to control costs more tightly.
The acquisition of Sterling Health, which brought SmithKline its first OTC
analgesic, Panadol, would help the company grow in developing markets, said
Mr Harry Groome, chairman of SmithKline Beecham Consumer Healthcare.

The Chatterjee group, an Indian affiliate of Soros Fund Management, has
signed an agreement to acquire a 25 per cent stake in United Breweries and
McDowell, two flagship companies of the Bangalore-based UB conglomerate, for
Rs2.25bn (Dollars 71.7m). The agreement says the Chatterjee group will
acquire the equity by sale and/or private placement of shares and not by the
sale of warrants.
The companies have agreed to jointly develop the globalisation and expansion
of United Breweries' brands of beers and spirits, particularly in the
Pacific Rim countries, also to protect and promote UB's beer and spirits in
India. The UB group has a 29 per cent market share of the Rs50bn Indian
liquor industry, and commands 32 per cent of the beer market with its
Kingfisher brand.
The understanding says Mr Vijay Mallya, the chairman of the UB group will
continue to maintain his equity stake and manage the activities of the
group. The Chatterjee group will have two representatives on the board of
the company to contribute to the company's global strategies.
UB group has interests in brewing, distilling, pharmaceuticals, engineering,
fertilisers and plastics in India. The company recently announced plans to
build a brewery in Myanmar, Burma, and acquire three breweries in China,
besides signing an agreement with Carlsberg International to produce
Carlsberg beer in India.
Soros Fund Management, promoted by Mr George Soros, one of the world's
largest fund managers, manages more than Dollars 12bn in funds.

Wise Stores, an eastern Canadian retail chain with 126 units, is filing for
protection from creditors. The move results from its 1992 acquisition of
Peoples Stores from Marks &amp; Spencer Canada, part of the UK stores group.
Wise, a family-controlled company operating mostly in smaller cities, still
owes CDollars 12.7m (USDollars 9.2m) to M&amp;S under the terms of the 1992
leveraged buy-out of Peoples Stores.
It said M&amp;S, a secured creditor, had obtained a court order naming an
interim receiver for Peoples. M&amp;S had agreed last August to delay loan
repayments until July 1995.

forestry rival
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The rationalisation of Canada's forestry industry is poised to take a big
step forward with an all-share bid by Vancouver's Canfor for Slocan Forest
Products, also based in British Columbia.
Canfor's offer values Slocan at about CDollars 715m (USDollars 518m), or
CDollars 18 a share, which is one-third higher than Slocan's closing price
on the Toronto stock exchange last Friday.
Canfor is Canada's biggest lumber company and second biggest pulp producer.
Its flagship is the Howe Sound pulp and newsprint mill north of Vancouver, a
joint venture with New Oji Paper of Japan.
Slocan's business centres on lumber and it has cutting rights to 3.7m cubic
metres of timber a year.
Its shareholders would be offered 0.935 Canfor shares for each Slocan share.
The offer is subject to a minimum acceptance of 75 per cent.
Slocan had not responded to the unsolicited offer by midday yesterday. Its
shares are widely held, with its chairman and chief executive, Mr Irving
Barber, holding a 9.5 per cent stake.
Canfor said the combination would increase its wood and fibre
self-sufficiency, strengthen its marketing clout and offer a better balance
between solid wood products, pulp and newsprint.
The combined company would have posted sales of CDollars 1.6bn in the first
nine months of this year, with cash flow of CDollars 183m.
The forestry industry's fortunes have improved in the past year, on the
heels of unexpectedly sharp rises in pulp and paper prices. Canfor earned
CDollars 28.7m in the third quarter, compared with a CDollars 7.9m loss a
year earlier. Slocan's profit has surged to CDollars 25.5m from CDollars
10.1m.
However, many companies have been weakened by the protracted recession of
the early 1990s and by heavy investments in anti-pollution equipment and
other modernisation projects.
The Canadian industry has been especially slow to modernise, leading to
predictions of an extensive shake-up as companies seek to maintain their
competitive edge.
In one of the biggest deals to date, Slocan joined forces a year ago with
Donohue, a Quebec-based producer, to buy Finlay Forest Products, a troubled
lumber and newsprint producer.

Haitai, the South Korean food group, has taken management control of
International Korea Electronics (Inkel), the country's leading audio
company, as part of its strategy of diversifying into electronics.
Haitai bought 17.2 per cent of Inkel from Mr Cho Dong-sik, its founder and
largest shareholder, for an estimated Won20bn (Dollars 25.3m).
Inkel has 25 per cent of the domestic audio market. It exports to the US and
Europe under the Sherwood brand name following its purchase of the UK audio
company.
Inkel has come under financial pressure due to rapid production expansion
and diversification into telecommunications. Sales have fallen sharply to
Won125bn in the first 10 months of this year, against Won233bn for all of
1993, due to increased competition.
Operating profits, which were Won2bn last year, have been affected by a
price-cutting campaign by rival companies. The takeover of Inkel is meant to
improve the performance of Haitai Electronics, which also manufactures audio
equipment.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Seven Network, one of Australia's smaller commercial TV networks, is to
withdraw from the Optus Vision consortium, formed a few months ago to build
a national cable network across Australia.
Seven's involvement in the consortium - which includes Mr Kerry Packer's
Publishing &amp; Broadcasting group and Optus, the telecommunications carrier -
was controversial, given that 15 per cent of Seven's shares are held by Mr
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, and another 10 per cent by the
government-owned Telecom group. News and Telecom have formed a consortium to
build a rival national cable/pay-TV network.
Seven said its withdrawal was prompted by the federal government's stance
over the regulatory framework for broadband networks, announced last month.
Seven said it considered the new rules had 'marginalised the Optus Vision
business opportunity'.
Some commentators suspect that Seven's withdrawal heralds the collapse of
the Optus Vision consortium.
Its future was thrown into doubt when Mr Michael Lee, the federal minister
for communications, said he would not allow monopolies in cable
infrastructure and would not act to stop geographical duplication of the
networks planned by Optus Vision and Telstra. P&amp;B has withdrawn from a
potential ADollars 318m (USDollars 246m) investment in Optus as a result.
Australis Media, the fledgling company which has promised to provide
Australia's first pay-TV service at the beginning of 1995, said it planned
to raise about USDollars 200m through an issue of senior discount notes in
the US. Merrill Lynch has been retained to handle the public offering, which
is expected to take place in the new year.
Australis said the proceeds would be used to fund a portion of the costs of
rolling out subscription broadcast TV services.

FT  13 DEC 94 / International Company News: UBS denies wrongdoing in share
vote

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Union Bank of Switzerland yesterday dismissed suggestions that it had done
anything improper to win its board's controversial share unification
proposal at an extraordinary general meeting last month.
Two leading Swiss newspapers said at the weekend that the recent discovery
of some large off-market transactions made during October and November in
UBS registered shares raised questions about the bank's role in the market
during that period.
UBS confirmed that one of its subsidiaries was the buyer of 1.45m registered
shares on October 28 in 'a normal options deal'. At that day's closing
price, those shares were worth nearly SFr400m (Dollars 299.3m). UBS did not
comment on a 2.9m-share deal on October 17 or a 946,000-share transaction on
the day of the extraordinary general meeting.
'There were some transactions in the normal process of business, but we have
done nothing against the law,' UBS said yesterday.
Mr Martin Ebner, chairman of BK Vision, the investment fund appealing
against the share unification scheme, said his BZ Bank, a market-maker in
UBS securities, was not involved in any of the transactions.
He suspects that UBS directors secured votes for the EGM by having the bank
or its affiliates write option deals for large registered shareholders at
favourable terms. Such deals would remove the risk of retaining the
registered shares but leave the holder still able to vote them.
Mr Nikolaus Senn, UBS chairman, said at the EGM that the bank had only
entered into normal agreements and fulfilled normal contractual conditions.
'In no case did we influence the vote. All larger transactions were checked
by our internal auditors,' he said.
In the end, the UBS board won by only 65,449 votes out of 31.6m represented
at the meeting. Under its plan, the registered shares would be converted
into bearer shares on terms that eliminate their extra voting power. BK
Vision has obtained an injunction blocking its implementation.

FT  13 DEC 94 / International Company News: Banco Santander looks to sell
Ebro stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Santander is believed to have offered a 10 per cent stake in Ebro, the
leading Spanish food company, to Tabacalera, the state-controlled tobacco
conglomerate. The move could signal renewed foreign assaults on the
country's sugar sector.
Santander denied it had approached Tabacalera, which owns 4.6 per cent of
Ebro, although it said it was seeking to dispose of its stock in the
profitable sugar and rice producer.
The offer to the government's tobacco group was, however, confirmed by
well-placed market sources, who viewed it as a tactical move by Santander
before placing the stake with a foreign group.
Tabacalera is understood to have told Santander it could not increase its
shareholding because it was restructuring the group and concentrating on its
core tobacco business.
'Santander talked to Tabacalera, but it was merely being deferential with
the government before seeking a buyer abroad for the the Ebro stock,' said
Mr Joan Bastos, managing director of Madrid brokers Ibersecurities.
The 10 per cent shareholding in the food company, worth Pta7.2bn (Dollars
55m) at current market prices, had been owned by Mr Javier de la Rosa, the
Barcelona financier and former chief executive of the Kuwait Investment
Office (KIO) in Spain, who was imprisoned pending fraud charges in October.
Santander took the stake when it executed outstanding loans to Mr de la Rosa
following his arrest.
The clear signal from Santander, the leading domestic banking group, that it
is not interested in being an Ebro shareholder, and Tabacalera's reported
rejection of the equity offer will not escape European groups such as
Saint-Louis of France and the UK's Tate &amp; Lyle.
The two groups were recently blocked by the government when they attempted
to increase their minority joint stake in General Azucarera, Spain's
second-ranked sugar company, through an agreed bid for a controlling
shareholding in the company, owned by Banco Central Hispano, BCH.
The government said it did not want see Azucarera in foreign ownership, in
the interests of protecting the domestic sugar quota. This argument does
not, however, apply to Ebro, which is already partly foreign controlled. Its
main shareholder, with 36.5 per cent of the equity, is Grupo Torras, the
KIO's Spanish investment arm.
The KIO announced plans two weeks ago to write off Grupo Torras debts of
Pta184.4bn to bring the investment arm out of receivership. The Kuwaiti
group is reviewing its long-term strategy in Spain, and the re-think will
focus closely on its plans for Ebro, the crown jewel of its Spanish
investments.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Williams Companies, a US natural gas and telecoms group, has announced an
agreed cash and stock takeover of Transco Energy, a rival gas company. The
deal values Transco at Dollars 677m.
The acquisition, which will be made with part of the cash Williams expects
to raise on the completion of the Dollars 2.5bn sale of its telephone
business, signals that consolidation in the US natural gas transmission and
marketing businesses is well under way.
Shares in Williams slumped 10 per cent to Dollars 24 1/8 , down Dollars 2
3/4 , on fears that the deal would add substantially to its debt levels.
Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agencies, said they were
considering a downgrade of Williams's Triple B ratings in the light of
Transco's Dollars 2.3bn of debt. S&amp;P, however, indicated it expected the
company to retain an investment-grade rating.
The substantial premium offered by Williams drove Transco's shares up by
Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 16 1/8 in early trading.
Together, Williams and Transco would control one of the US's biggest natural
gas distribution businesses. Transco, with after-tax profits of Dollars 65m
on sales of Dollars 2.9bn last year, runs two interstate gas pipeline
systems totalling 16,600 miles and covering the mid-west and east coast.
Williams' interests include three pipeline companies covering 18,900 miles
and serving north-western and central US states. It is also one of the
biggest gatherers and processors of natural gas through its Williams Field
Services. Some 90 per cent of its Dollars 2.4bn of revenues and 78 per cent
of its Dollars 411m operating income came from the natural gas business,
with the rest from its WilTel telephone operations. The deal will give
Williams the second-biggest gas pipeline system in the US, behind Enron.
The fall in Williams' share price yesterday in part reflected general
disappointment about its decision to use part of the proceeds from the
previously-announced sale of WilTel to LDDS. The profitability of gas
transmission in the US is expected to come under greater pressure, following
last year's deregulation to allow utility companies to buy and store their
own natural gas.
The company had earlier indicated it planned to use Dollars 800m of the cash
to buy back its own shares, and would invest much of the rest in operations
with better profit prospects than the pipeline business.

In spite of a collapse in profits from trading on its own account - caused
by the weakness in bond markets - group operating profits for the first 10
months were only 2 per cent lower, at DM901m (Dollars 571m) than in the same
period of 1993.
Higher mortgage lending and lower risk provisions kept the decline in check.
Only its Bavarian rival, Bayerische Hypo-Bank, produced comparable results.
Its operating profit also eased by 2 per cent to DM807m. Deutsche Bank
reported a 15 per cent drop in operating profits to DM3.6bn, with Dresdner
Bank 17 per cent lower at DM1.3bn and Commerzbank down by 27 per cent to
DM660m. All figures are based on direct comparisons with the same 10-month
period last year.
'The Vereinsbank group has held up well in a difficult environment,' said Mr
Albrecht Schmidt, the chairman. Continued growth in mortgage lending was the
main impulse behind a 14 per cent increase in the interest surplus, to
DM3.5bn, though property financing had lost some of its strength this year.
Commission earnings were 1 per cent lower at DM854m, mainly because of
weaker securities markets. After an 11 per cent rise in operating expenses,
to DM2.8bn, including heavy spending on information technology, partial
operating profits (excluding own-account trading) were 10 per cent higher at
DM1.6bn.
Sharply eroding the bank's financial performance was the collapse in trading
profits on its own account. These were 98 per cent lower at DM6m - after a
loss at the six-months stage - because of bond market weakness. Mr Norbert
Juchem, a director, said the bank changed its trading strategy in May as
interest rates kept rising.

FT  13 DEC 94 / International Company News: Cariplo emerges as contender for
Rolo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Potential suitors for Gruppo Bancario Credito Romagnolo (Rolo), the
Bolognese banking group, continued to stir up speculation yesterday about a
possible counter-bid for the bank.
Credito Italiano (Credit), the Milan-based bank, formally launched its
L20,000-a-share bid for Rolo at the weekend. The offer for 65 per cent of
the company will open on December 19 and run until January 16. If
shareholders accept the offer, Credit will have to spend nearly L2,800bn
(Dollars 1.7bn).
Rolo has deliberately left itself open to possible counter-bids, and
attention is now focused on Cariplo, the unquoted Italian savings bank,
which is said to be preparing an alternative offer in alliance with IMI, the
Italian financial services and banking group.
Without confirming those rumours, Mr Sandro Molinari, Cariplo's chairman,
indicated yesterday that there would 'certainly' be more news before
Christmas.
Under Italian takeover rules, Cariplo has until the end of the first week in
January to launch a counter-bid. It would have to be pitched at least 5 per
cent higher than the Credit bid, both in terms of the price per share, and
the overall amount offered.
Mr Gianguido Sacchi Morsiani, chairman of Rolo's local rival, Cassa di
Risparmio in Bologna (Carisbo), said yesterday that his bank would also be
ready to take part in an alternative bid. However, he said Carisbo had not
yet talked to Cariplo about making a friendly approach to Rolo.
Rolo and Carisbo have cross-shareholdings in one another of just over 3 per
cent. Rolo originally planned a merger with CAER, the parent company of
Carisbo, as a defence against Credit's first, hostile offer. Those plans
were dropped 10 days ago, when Rolo's board declared that Credit's plans for
a higher offer were an improvement on the initial approach.

FT  13 DEC 94 / International Company News: Bid for Italian steel group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Franco-Italian consortium yesterday issued a bid for Ilva Laminati Piani
(ILP), Italy's state-owned flat steels company. The bid opened what should
be the final phase in the break-up and privatisation of Italy's state steel
industry.
The consortium is headed by Lucchini, the private Italian steel producer, in
alliance with Usinor Sacilor, the French steelmaker, and Bolmat, a company
headed by two Italian steel traders.
The value of the bid was not revealed, but it is understood that Lucchini
has a dominant stake in the consortium. Lucchini and Usinor made their offer
through their jointly-owned company, Lutrix.
IRI, the state holding company which owns ILP, would not say whether other
offers were tabled before yesterday's noon deadline.
Mr Emilio Riva, the Italian steel magnate, was considered the most likely
counter-bidder. Riva made a conditional offer for ILP at the beginning of
this month with Tarnofin, a consortium of local entrepreneurs, but it was
withdrawn when IRI announced it wanted to remain open to other offers.
IRI is expected to evaluate the offer at a board meeting on Thursday, in the
hope of striking a deal by the end of the year, the deadline set by Italy's
European Union partners for the privatisation of the Italian steel industry.
If IRI and its advisers are not happy with the original offer they could
call for new bids, or open private negotiations.
The Franco-Italian bid follows weeks of talks set in motion by Mr Bruno
Bolfo and Mr Vittorio Malacalza, who head Duferco, a steel trading company,
and Bolmat. They had indicated that a number of international steel
producers were interested in ILP.

FT  13 DEC 94 / International Company News: IFI posts L175bn for half year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IFI, the quoted Italian holding company controlled by the Agnelli family,
yesterday reported a consolidated profit before tax of L175bn (Dollars 107m)
for the six months to September 30.
It is the first time IFI has presented consolidated figures for the half
year so there is no comparative figure for the first six months of 1993-94.
For the whole of 1993-94, IFI recorded a consolidated loss of L285bn, mainly
because of heavy losses at Fiat, the automotive and industrial group.
The absence of a dividend payment by Fiat hit IFI parent company profit in
the first half. It fell to L27.2bn before tax from L155bn a year earlier.
IFI controls 30 per cent of Fiat, including an indirect stake through the
Agnellis' other quoted holding company, Ifil.
The company said since September 30 it had realised a parent company capital
gain of L34bn on the conversion of bonds into shares in Fiat and Unicem, the
cement subsidiary, and had received a 1994 dividend of L4bn from Exor, the
French investment company.
IFI said net parent company profit for 1994-95 was likely to be lower than
the L100.2bn profit in the previous year, but enough to allow a dividend
payment at least equal to the 1993-94 payout of L30.3bn.
More than 80 per cent of IFI's shares are controlled by the private Agnelli
holding company.

FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Samuel Heath falls
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Interim pre-tax profits at Samuel Heath &amp; Sons, the hardware and giftware
company, fell 24 per cent from Pounds 136,000 to Pounds 103,000, on turnover
ahead 22 per cent at Pounds 1.05m, compared with Pounds 857,000.
Earnings per share for the half-year to September 30 dipped to 2.3p (3p) but
the interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p.
Mr Samuel Heath, chairman, said the result reflected a 'dramatic' rise in
the cost of raw materials, particularly copper. He also warned that a
serious fire at the company's Birmingham factory since the the period-end,
and the consequent breakdown in customer service, was likely to have 'ill
effects' in the future.

FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: API advances 30% to Pounds 7.02m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at API Group, the packaging, coatings and office consumables
company, rose 30 per cent from Pounds 5.41m to Pounds 7.02m in the year to
October 1.
Group turnover rose 8 per cent to Pounds 79.6m (Pounds 73.4m) and operating
profits expanded 33 per cent to Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 5.11m). Within these,
Arnold Belford, the specialist coatings company bought in June for Pounds
1.7m cash, contributed Pounds 799,000 to turnover and Pounds 73,000 to
profits.
Diffusion, the only company left in the heating and ventilation division
until its sale in February for Pounds 1.5m, made Pounds 185,000 (Pounds
208,000) on turnover of Pounds 1.39m (Pounds 3.93m).
Mr Michael Smith, chief executive, drew attention to the margin increases,
both across the group on continuing operations from 7.1 to 8.5 per cent, and
within the two divisions. In foils and laminates, the margin rose from 8.1
to 9.3 per cent and in converted film and paper products the growth was from
10.1 to 11.7 per cent.
Mr Smith said that so far the group had managed to pass on raw material
price rises, mostly experienced in the final quarter, and expected to be
able to continue to do so.
However, he stressed that API was not beholden to the whims of raw material
suppliers as other packaging groups were: rather, it made premium products
often for niche markets.
Again, the alliances API had created with both suppliers and customers -
accounting for 30 to 40 per cent of sales - were cited as strengths to help
offset the pressures on prices, as was the group's commitment to reduce
waste, which accounts for 5 per cent of sales.
From an R&amp;D budget that works out at about 3 per cent of sales, API is
developing an alternative to holograms for banknotes, for example, which
cannot be copied. It has also developed a universal foil, which Mr Smith
said could 'revolutionise the foil business'. API has an exclusive contract
with Polaroid for the laminating of film for the medical and graphics
markets, and the market for thermal transfer systems is growing at 20 per
cent a year. The group is investing Pounds 8m over three years in a
greenfield plant to manufacture metallised paper, a market estimated at
Pounds 300m.
On the acquisition front, Mr Smith said API would announce 'something
significant' in the next three to six months, in the UK, Europe or the US.
Earnings grew to 21.8p (16.8p) per share and a final dividend of 5.38p lifts
the total to 9.08p (8.25p).

FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Trio halved to Pounds 2.4m and calls for
Pounds 6.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trio Holdings, the international money and securities broker, blamed
'subdued market conditions' for the halving of pre-tax profits from Pounds
5.08m to Pounds 2.4m in the year to September 30.
The group also announced a Pounds 6.5m rights issue to fund its
modernisation programme and expand its operations further.
The issue, of up to 27.8m new ordinary shares, is on the basis of 1-for-2,
priced at 25p. The shares closed 1p higher yesterday at 24p.
Mr David Hagan, chairman, said the company had already re-equipped a third
of its workforce in its move to develop a comprehensive global money markets
operation.
He said that during the year Trio had taken management control of a Japanese
broker and had also extended and updated its market operations in the
London, New York and Frankfurt markets.
Mr Hagan added that the group was keen to pursue joint venture opportunities
in east Asia.
Recent interest rate rises in the UK and US pointed to an upturn in the
group's fortunes, he said.
Turnover increased by 36 per cent to Pounds 99.1m (Pounds 72.7m). Earnings
per share dropped from 3.1p to 0.71p and the dividend for the year is cut to
a nominal 0.1p (2.5p).
Regent Pacific Group, a Canadian investment company which owns 14.95 per
cent of Trio, and Inuvialuit Investments, another Canadian group, have
underwritten the issue.

FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 4.39m losses rule out final dividend
from JFB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Johnson &amp; Firth Brown, the specialist engineering group, yesterday failed to
declare a dividend for the first time in 10 years after heavy restructuring
costs and subdued demand undermined its results for the year to September
30.
Reporting pre-tax losses of Pounds 4.39m against profits of Pounds 3.06m,
the group said it would concentrate on improving the performance of its core
forging and light engineering activities rather than use reserves to pay
dividends. A total of 1.35p was paid last time.
Although Mr Martin Llowarch, chairman, said the group was anxious to restore
dividend payments, he ruled out such a move following a year in which the
company lost Pounds 2.49m on the disposal of six light engineering
subsidiaries and incurred further restructuring costs of Pounds 1.47m.
'A lack of volume and reduced profits contributed to the poor results,' he
said. 'And we had difficulty seeing where the light engineering companies
were going.'
Operating profits, including a Pounds 64,000 loss on discontinued
operations, fell from Pounds 4.83m to Pounds 1.54m on turnover virtually
unchanged at Pounds 130.1m.
Firth Rixson, the group's UK forging and alloy business, reported profits
down from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 2.1m, while profits at its remaining light
engineering businesses fell from Pounds 1.04m to Pounds 106,000.
Even so, Mr Llowarch said the company had seen orders increase 30 per cent
in recent months and both divisions were now enjoying healthy profits
growth. He warned, however, that the businesses could come under margin
pressure under the impact of raw material price increases, particularly for
steel.
To counter such increases, he said the group would use provisions of Pounds
750,000 to reorganise Firth Rixson's North American activities - mainly
supplying aircraft engine manufacturers - and impose stricter controls on
the light engineering businesses.
Gearing was unchanged at 36 per cent, although the Pounds 6.25m raised from
the sale of non-core businesses helped reduce net borrowing from Pounds
18.2m to Pounds 16.5m.
Losses per share came out at 3.6p (earnings of 1.4p).

FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Supply side improvement as Northern
Electric rises 21%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp improvement in the performance of its supply business helped
Northern Electric lift pre-tax profits by 21 per cent to Pounds 63.4m,
against Pounds 52.6m, in the six months to September 30.
Northern is among the most active of the regional electricity companies in
the supply market, part of which was opened up to competition in April.
Supply profits rose from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 12.8m.
Mr David Morris, chairman, said this should lay to rest any uncertainty felt
by others about the policy.
However, analysts were unconvinced, with some saying that the supply
business had been helped by the regulatory cap on prices in the electricity
wholesale pool.
Group turnover was Pounds 490.7m (Pounds 460.7m). The interim dividend of
9.6p (7.4p) will be paid from earnings of 39p (32.1p).
Mr Morris said the company intended to reduce dividend cover from 3.2 times
at the last year end to towards two over the next few years.
Mr Tony Hadfield, chief executive, said the company benefited from an upturn
in the regional economy. He pointed to strong inward investment from
overseas companies including Samsung.
Stripping out the effects of coal mine closures, distribution volumes grew
by 1.5 per cent for operating profits of Pounds 30m (Pounds 36m), but this
was after a Pounds 10m charge for redundancy costs. Mr Hadfield said the
underlying profits increase in distribution was 15 per cent.
Northern yesterday joined the growing number of recs which say they intend
to demerge the whole of their holding in the National Grid. Northern owns
6.5 per cent.
Mr Alan Groves, finance director, said the company expected gearing to be 10
to 15 per cent by the year end. Net cash at the end of September was Pounds
91m but Pounds 126m payments for a share buy-back were made after the half
year ended.
Mr Morris disclosed that the company had made an unsuccessful NZDollars 90m
(Pounds 36.6m) bid for 49 per cent of Capital Power, an electricity
distributor in Wellington, New Zealand.
Northern cut 136 jobs in the period to 4,493 and expects to cut 300 more by
the year end.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scotia, the UK's third biggest biotechnology company by market
capitalisation, has licenced a dermatitis drug to Galderma, a company
jointly owned by L'Oreal of France and Nestle of Switzerland.
The deal will bring Scotia 'in excess of Pounds 3m in cash' over the next
three years.
The drug treats seborrhoeic dermatitis, a fungal skin disease.
Galderma is already a licencee for the drug in Germany. The new deal extends
that arrangement to the rest of Europe and the US.
Under the terms of the agreement, Galderma will bear the cost of clinical
trials needed for regulatory approval in the US.

Sega, the Japanese computer games group, has informed British Thornton
Holdings that it will not be renewing its exclusive distribution contract
when it expires next March.
BTH said the terms required to secure renewal would not have provided it
with a satisfactory return, adding that it believed longer-term market
volumes in the video games industry would continue to decline.
BTH said its trading results for the year to April 30 1995 would not be

<TEXT>
Albrighton, the USM-quoted quarrying company, reported pre-tax profits down
from Pounds 324,000 to Pounds 105,000 on turnover more than doubled from
Pounds 1.74m to Pounds 4.21m for the six months to end-September.
The increase in turnover - largely the result of acquisitions made in the
second half last year - had been below budget, directors said.
This, coupled with other factors, had led to an unfavourable product mix and
higher costs over the period, they added.
After a Pounds 10,000 profit from an associate undertaking, against a of
Pounds 29,000, and increased interest payable of Pounds 120,000 (Pounds
73,000), earnings came out at 0.1p (0.6p) per share. The interim dividend is
unchanged at 0.1p.

</HEADLINE>

An increase in research and development costs led to pre-tax profits falling
from Pounds 4.67m to Pounds 4.12m at Electronic Data Processing in the year
to end-September.
Turnover also fell slightly to Pounds 14m (Pounds 14.3m) reflecting the
'tough environment' at a time when the company was undergoing a period of
transition, said Mr Michael Heller, chairman.
In the course of the past three years the group has shifted from being a
supplier of hardware and some software to being primarily a software
publisher and services provider, he added.
Research and development costs amounted to Pounds 1.57m (Pounds 1.41m) while
net interest receivable fell from Pounds 563,000 to Pounds 540,000. Cash
balances at the year end, however, had grown to Pounds 12.2m, compared with
Pounds 10.9m at the beginning of the year.
An increased final dividend of 1.333p is proposed making 2p (1.833p),
payable from earnings of per share down from 11.71p to 10.21p.

Mr Jeffrey Gould, chief executive of the lossmaking Upton &amp; Southern retail

Mr Gould defended the increase, saying that Upton, which ran into

FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Eastern advances 27% to Pounds 98m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eastern Group said yesterday it was asking the regulator to lift limits on
the amount of electricity it could generate as it revealed a 27 per cent
increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 77.4m to Pounds 98.1m.
Mr John Devaney, chief executive, said it had asked the regulator to lift a
restriction that means it can buy only 15 per cent of its power from
companies it owns or with which it is associated.
Eastern has used up 83 per cent of the limit, more than any other regional
electricity company. 'We are prepared to supply competition to the
generators,' said Mr Devaney. 'Why should we be falsely capped?'
Mr Devaney said his company had spoken to the electricity generators
following their commitment to try to sell off up to 6 gigawatts of capacity.
He said: 'No-one is getting much clarity from the generators.'
Mr Eric Anstee, finance director, said that even with existing interests,
the company expected to make about a quarter of its profits from generation
within a few years.
In the half year to September 30, Eastern increased turnover from Pounds
799m to Pounds 820.4m. Earnings per share were 28.4p (20.9p) and the interim
dividend is 8.25p (6.6p).
The company announced a Pounds 28m rebate for domestic and small business
customer, making a total of Pounds 46m for the year.
Cuts in staff helped the company to reduce operating costs in the
distribution business by 7 per cent. Units distributed rose 2.4 per cent.
Distribution operating profits were 16 per cent ahead at Pounds 82.4m
(Pounds 71m) while supply showed a 38 per cent improvement to Pounds 8.7m
(Pounds 6.3m).
Generation contributed profits of Pounds 2.2m, against losses of Pounds
600,000, and gas Pounds 300,000 (Pounds 200,000 loss). However, retailing
made Pounds 1.9m, a sharp drop on the previous Pounds 3.1m.
Analysts believe Eastern's commitment to retailing through its Powerhouse
joint venture may be challenged unless the performance improves.
Mr Anstee said gearing was likely to rise from about 18 per cent at
September 30, when debt was Pounds 154m, to 20 per cent at the year end.

The closure of its carpet factory in Northern Ireland and its knitwear
activities in Ayrshire resulted in Richards, the Aberdeen-based textile

The company had warned of a 'significant write-off' when it announced the
carpet closure in August. However, the shares still lost 5p yesterday to
close at 38p. There were provisions and losses on the closures of Pounds
3.97m.
Turnover for the year to September 30 was Pounds 75.1m (Pounds 67.8m) with
Pounds 15.7m (Pounds 17.6m) from discontinued activities.
Operating losses were Pounds 465,000 (Pounds 147,000) with losses on
discontinued activities of Pounds 1.28m (Pounds 1.34m). Continuing
operations showed a 54 per cent increase in operating profits.
Losses per share were 17.31p (earnings 0.54p) and the proposed final
dividend is 0.93p for a total of 2p (3p).

FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Brandon Hire jumps to Pounds
610,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Brandon Hire jumped from Pounds 99,000 to Pounds 610,000,
on sales doubled to Pounds 4.69m, in the six months to October 31.
Mr Brian Nathan, chairman of the Bristol-based hirer of power tools and
catering equipment and distributor of industrial fasteners, described the
period as the most significant in the company's history.
Mr John Laycock became chief executive in May when his company JSL Fasteners
was acquired by Brandon Hire, in which he now holds 42 per cent of the share
capital.
Mr Nathan said Mr Laycock had 'set out on the promised path without delay
and a programme of controlled expansion is proceeding'. He added: 'I do not
wish to be over-optimistic but I look forward to the future with
considerable enthusiasm.'
In October, Beechwood Hire and Sales, with seven branches in south Wales and
one in Bristol, was bought for Pounds 1.8m. Winchester Tool Hire was
acquired earlier this month.
Earnings per share were 3.3p (0.86p).
The company is changing its year-end from April 30 to December 31 and the
current trading period will cover the eight months to end-December. It
intends to declare a combined interim and final dividend for that period.

FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Scholl shares dip on profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Scholl, the healthcare products group, fell 18 1/2 p yesterday to
125p, after it warned that trading conditions remained difficult.
At the same time the group said it would take an Pounds 8m exceptional
charge against full-year profits to cover restructuring costs following a
strategic review.
Mr Neil Franchino, chief executive, said: 'Even with two new product
launches, we do not anticipate that the shortfall in profits at the interim
stage will be made up in the second half of the year.' Pre-tax profits for
the six months to June 30 fell from Pounds 11.7m to Pounds 9.96m.
UK sales were down, in part because of continued destocking by retailers and
wholesalers. Sales were flat in continental Europe but strong in Asia
Pacific.
The forecast final dividend of 3.8p, giving 6.4p for the full year, will be
maintained.
The charge includes provision for the loss of 100 jobs. Cost savings should
amount to Pounds 1.5m in 1996. The group will close 21 retail outlets,
mostly in Germany, the UK and Canada. Brand management will be centralised
and located in the UK.
Product rationalisation will include the reduction of the number of footcare
products from 109 to 57 over the next two years, and a buyer is being sought
for Valdor, the French cosmetics business.
Goodwill of Pounds 3.7m, previously written off to capital reserves, will be
written off through the profit and loss account.

FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Contemplating a long engagement - Norma
Cohen on the prospective Morgan Stanley/Warburg merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In exhibiting the virtues of a Morgan Stanley/SG Warburg merger, executives
at both investment banks point to their asset management arms.
The combined entity - should it ever be created - would have roughly Dollars
150bn (Pounds 91bn) under management, making it the eighth largest US fund
manager and the single largest American manager of institutional money.
Moreover, the strengths of the two organisations complement each other;
where MAM is strong, Morgan Stanley is non-existent, and the sectors where
MAM has been weak are among Morgan Stanley's strongest selling points.
But melding two discrete fund management companies, each with their own
approach to investment and loyal band of clients, is easier said than done.
Indeed, it now appears that, at least initially, the two fund management
arms will continue as separate businesses which benefit from their close
relationship.
'In the early stages, we think it should be independent,' said one Morgan
Stanley official. 'We will have to see how the co-ordination and the synergy
work before putting the two together,' he added.
For one thing, a full merger would require the permission of Morgan's
institutional clients, who under US rules must agree to a change of
ownership of their fund manager.
Meanwhile, at MAM, senior executives enjoy managerial autonomy which they
would be reluctant to surrender. Moreover, MAM's largest clients, many of
whom are also shareholders of MAM and Warburg, are anxious that the merger
does not spark the flight of the most talented fund managers.
But analysts and pension consultants say that there are indeed synergies
which would be created by a merger of the two fund management units.
Morgan Stanley, for instance, has only a handful of European clients, and
most of its clients are based in the US. MAM, by contrast, manages
relatively little money in the US, and much of that is mandates to manage
non-dollar fixed-interest portfolios.
Its strength is concentrated in the UK, and about two thirds of the Pounds
62.7bn in total assets is managed for UK institutional clients.
Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley is a relative newcomer to the retail market, only
in the past year launching a range of US mutual funds which now have about
Dollars 500m under management. MAM, by contrast, has launched an aggressive
campaign into the retail sector with an impressive array of unit and
investment trusts both in the UK and overseas.
Moreover, in performance terms, Morgan Stanley's strengths are MAM's
weaknesses, according to pension consultants who scrutinise fund managers'
returns. While MAM has turned in above-average performance in UK equities,
in general, its investment in overseas equities has been below average for
each of the past five years, according to data from Combined Actuarial
Performance Services.
'What MAM definitely needs is a credible overseas presence,' said one
pension consultant. For one thing, MAM 'did not go thumping into emerging
markets' - an area which Morgan Stanley's fund management arm has
specialised in - and it has also had particular problems with stock
selection in the US and Japan.
While MAM is said to be disputing its overseas performance data, saying it
accounts differently for costs than other fund managers, its clients too
have noticed some weaknesses.
'Overall, they haven't been too bad,' said one client, noting that there had
been particular problems with stock selection in some regions.
Meanwhile, Morgan has made little headway in attracting European business,
particularly the key UK institutional fund management market.
It is obvious that the mechanics of a merger could leave key members of each
firm's senior management - and its star fund managers - unhappy. Both
Warburg and Morgan Stanley are surely likely to opt for two expanding fund
management businesses, than a larger one in danger of imploding.

FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hunters Armley rises 29%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hunters Armley, the commercial printer which last week expanded with the
purchase of a private Bristol-based printing company, increased pre-tax
profits by 29 per cent in the year to September 30.
Investment in new production facilities and the addition of more than 100
new customer accounts helped lift profits to Pounds 3.46m (Pounds 2.67m), on
turnover up 27 per cent at Pounds 41.1m (Pounds 32.2m).
Despite increases in paper prices of up to 60 per cent, operating margins
rose from 9 per cent to 9.2 per cent. Operating profit jumped 30 per cent to
Pounds 3.77m (Pounds 2.9m).
Mr Brian Sugden, managing director, said: 'Increased paper costs are an
opportunity not a threat for us, because they show that there is increased
demand.'
Capital expenditure of the group, which floated in December 1992, amounted
to Pounds 6.3m, including the installation of two new web offset presses at
the Bradford plant, which now has the same capacity as the Leeds plant.
A rights issue in May, which raised Pounds 9.4m, helped the group record a
net cash position of Pounds 3.06m, against net borrowings of Pounds 3.7m and
54 per cent gearing last time.
On December 5 it acquired Harlequin Colourprint, the Bristol-based sheet-fed
printer, for a maximum consideration of Pounds 4.4m. In the last financial
year Harlequin made pre-tax profits of Pounds 258,000 and has made profits
of more than Pounds 500,000 in the first nine months of this year.
Mr Sugden said that the group would be looking to make further acquisitions
of sheet-fed printers in London and Scotland.
Earnings per share were up 11 per cent at 10.01p (9.05p).
The proposed final dividend is 2.68p making 4p (3.75p) for the year, a 6.7
per cent increase.

FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Lex expands in Europe with FFr40m buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lex Service, the motor retailer, is making its first foray into continental
Europe with the acquisition of a large minority in PGA Motors, France's
largest car dealer group.
It has paid FFr40m (Pounds 4.75m) cash for a 26.7 per cent holding and a
convertible bond, which will increase its stake to 34 per cent on
conversion.
Earlier this year PGA acquired the Diace dealer group. Following the
rationalisation of the business, it is expected that it will be operating
about 28 dealerships by the end of the year, selling more than 31,000 new
and used cars a year with a turnover of more than FFr2.6bn.
It operates dealer groups mainly in the areas between Bordeaux, Nantes and
Tours, and between Avignon, Toulouse and Perpignan and holds franchises for
Volkswagen, Audi, Seat, Opel, BMW and Mercedes-Benz as well as Peugeot and
Citroen.
PGA was founded in 1978 by Mr Pierre Guenant, the present chief executive,
who remains the majority shareholder.
Sir Trevor Chinn, chairman of Lex Service, said yesterday that car retailing
in France was now 'undergoing the sort of change that occurred in the UK
some years ago with the formation of large, prof-essionally managed groups'.
Continental European car markets, including France and Germany, are much
more fragmented than the UK. Most dealerships are privately-owned and large
public groups, such as Lex, are virtually unknown.

FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Waverley Mining raises Pounds 14.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Waverley Mining Finance yesterday announced a placing and offer to raise
Pounds 14.7m net. Some Pounds 6.3m will be used to finance a proposed
investment in Mining (Scotland), which is the government's 'preferred
bidder' to take over British Coal's Scottish interests.
The rest of the proceeds will be used to provide funds for further
investments in 'some or all' of the companies in WMF's portfolio and to make
other investments.
Mr Willie McLucas, WMF's investment manager, said the injection of funds
would more than double the asset base of the trust. He is to join the Mining
(Scotland) board.
The value of WMF's proposed investment in Mining (Scotland) will represent
about a quarter of its net assets following yesterday's placing and offer of
15.6m shares at 100p each. The open offer to shareholders is on a 7-for-10
basis.
WMF's Pounds 6.3m investment will give it 22 per cent of Mining (Scotland).
Other investors include Mr Malcolm Edwards' Coal Investments and Northern
National Resources.
Mining (Scotland) is paying Pounds 39.4m for the Scottish coal region with
an additional Pounds 10m for stocks and stores. The bid is funded by a
Pounds 28m equity subscription from investors and Pounds 30m debt provided
by Clydesdale Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland.
The placing and offer was underwritten by Williams de Broe and the parent of
Noble &amp; Company, which advises WMF.

FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Flotation pays off as Allders leaps to
Pounds 25.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The benefit of last year's flotation was seen in the fourfold increase in
profits at Allders, the department store and tax and duty free retail group.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 6.36m to Pounds 25.4m during the year to
September 30. The previous period covered 53 weeks. Operating profits rose
by almost 17 per cent from Pounds 23.1m to Pounds 25.1m on sales of Pounds
732.9m (Pounds 685.5m).
Mr Harvey Lipsith, chief executive, said the group was continuing to show
healthy growth. Trading in the 12 department stores since the financial
year-end was 6 per cent higher than last year 'and the early indications are
very encouraging for Christmas'.
Mr Lipsith welcomed the Budget increases on drink and tobacco duties: 'Let's
have more of it, please - we celebrate when the duty goes up.'
Operating profits at the department stores rose from Pounds 12m to Pounds
13.1m on sales of Pounds 296.8m (Pounds 286.6m). Trading was erratic, the
group said, but there was good response to promotions.
A Pounds 1.4m rates refund offset profits lost while the Croydon flagship
store was being refurbished.
Allders International, the duty free division, lifted operating profits from
Pounds 13.1m to Pounds 13.5m, while sales rose from Pounds 399m to Pounds
436.2m. Europe contributed Pounds 12m (Pounds 8.8m), while the North
American side fell Pounds 1.3m into the red (Pounds 1.4m profit), hit by the
costs of closing in San Francisco.
Interest payments fell from Pounds 8.9m to Pounds 1.2m, and would have been
Pounds 400,000 lower if the flotation had taken place at the start of the
financial year. The group ended the year with effectively zero gearing.
Fully diluted pro forma earnings per share before exceptionals were 17.4p
(13.9p), while basic earnings were 20.6p (4.3p). The board is proposing a
final dividend of 4.5p, giving a total for the year of 6.7p compared with a
pro forma 6.1p.
COMMENT
Encouraging signs in the approach to Christmas and a Budget targeting drink
and tobacco put smiles on the faces of Allders' management yesterday. Once
the figures - not as clearly presented as they could have been - are
untangled, the underlying trends appear favourable. The department stores
are benefiting from the bias towards consumer durables; the Croydon store
has yet to show its full potential; and further stores are being added to
the newer Allders at Home concept. Forecasting profits from the duty free
side is more difficult. The group, which will be glad to see the back of the
troublesome San Francisco contract, is making the business more
international and is trying to reduce its dependency on drinks and tobacco
sales. Profits of Pounds 26.5m this year give a multiple of 12.6, which
looks fair value.

FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Recovery continues as City Site turns in
Pounds 2m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
City Site Estates, the property investment and development group, announced
sharply increased profits for the year to September 30 as it built upon the
recovery shown in the previous 12 months.
Mr William Syson, chairman, said distributable reserves were Pounds 1.74m,
enabling the repayment of arrears of Pounds 2.82m on preference dividends,
during the current year.
Net asset value rose from 22p to 55p per share by the period end. This has
since risen to 60p pending the assignation of seven leased properties from
Shoprite to Kwik Save.
'I am confident that with the quality of the portfolio and positive cash
flow we can look forward to a sustained period of growth and an early return
to the payment of ordinary dividends,' Mr Syson said.
Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 2.07m, against a restated Pounds 318,000.
The company sold properties during the year for a total of Pounds 9.75m, in
excess of book value. Property acquisitions amounted to more than Pounds
20m, giving additional income of Pounds 2.13m a year at an initial yield of
10.6 per cent.
Earnings per share were 4.29p (losses of 6.81p).

FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind 57% gain at Protean
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A first full contribution from acquisitions made at the end of last year
helped Protean, the laboratory equipment and water purification company, to
lift interim profits by 57 per cent.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to end-September increased from Pounds
1.73m to Pounds 2.72m, while sales rose by 26 per cent to Pounds 23.8m
(Pounds 18.9m). Excluding acquisitions, operating profits rose 19 per cent.
Mr Geoff Spink, managing director, said the group was very pleased with its
achievement over the past five years, during which earnings had doubled.
Earnings per share in the first half rose from 4.21p to 5.52p, and the
interim dividend is raised from 1.05p to 1.35p.
The water purification side made operating profits of Pounds 984,000 on
sales of Pounds 10.4m, compared with a previous Pounds 726,000 on sales of
Pounds 11.6m. The group completed fewer industrial contracts, but was making
better returns.
Other scientific equipment and consumables lifted operating profits from
Pounds 1.08m to Pounds 1.78m, with sales rising from Pounds 7.24m to Pounds
13.3m. The rise reflects the acquisition last December for Pounds 9m of
Techne, which makes controlled temperature equipment, and LIP, a maker of
medical and laboratory sample plastic bottles.
The group has continued on the acquisition trail, paying Pounds 4.15m at the
end of the first half for Jenway, a bench-top monitoring and analysis
equipment manufacturer based in Essex. It wrote off Pounds 4m of goodwill
with the purchase, reducing shareholders' funds to Pounds 8.8m against
Pounds 11.3m at the March year end.
Borrowings at end-September were Pounds 4.1m, giving gearing of 47 per cent.
However, net interest paid was Pounds 48,000, down from Pounds 81,000.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The strong financial performance of the regional electricity sector was
highlighted yesterday when Northern Electric lifted its interim dividend by
30 per cent and Eastern Group by 25 per cent.
Northern's increase, by 2.2p to 9.6p, is the second highest in this year's
electricity results season. All six England and Wales regional companies
which have reported so far this year have lifted dividends by more than 20
per cent. Eastern's dividend rose from 6.6p to 8.25p.
The payouts, which have come on top of healthy profit increases of 20 per
cent or more, will increase the political controversy surrounding the
companies.
The Labour party has called for a 'windfall profits' tax on utilities,
arguing that the power companies were sold off at too low a a price four
years ago and have not been regulated rigorously enough since then.
Political debate is likely to become more heated before the likely flotation
of the National Grid next May or June. The government is opposed to a
windfall tax, but is under pressure to act on what many see as the power
companies' excessive profits.
Northern, based in Newcastle Upon Tyne, said its profits for the six months
to September 30 were Pounds 63.4m, a 20.5 per cent increase. Eastern Group,
based in Ipswich, reported a 27 increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 98.1m.
Both companies said the high dividend increases were made possible by recent
buy-backs of their shares. Northern has bought 10 per cent of its shares and
Eastern 5 per cent.
Buy-backs allow companies to lift dividends because there are fewer shares
in issue.
Northern said its underlying dividend increase was 16 per cent while Eastern
said total dividend payments would rise 19 per cent.
Analysts expect Northern's full-year dividend increase to be around 30 per
cent.
Some say its willingness to increase dividends is influenced by speculation
that it will be the first regional power company to be subject to a takeover
bid.
The government's 'golden share' in each of the regional companies ends in
March, making takeovers more likely. Scottish Power is often rumoured to be
interested in taking over Northern.
Mr David Morris, Northern's chairman, said there had been no noticeable
changes in the company's shareholders recently.

FT  13 DEC 94 / No chance for quiet evolution amid revolution: John Gapper
explains why changes at the top of Schroders are causing a stir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Under other circumstances, the news that Mr Win Bischoff is to succeed Mr
George Mallinckrodt as chairman of Schroders, the UK investment bank, might
not attract much attention. 'I would be very surprised if it came as a
surprise to anyone here. It is totally evolutionary,' said Mr Mallinckrodt
yesterday.
But in the week after SG Warburg's announcement that it intends to merge
with Morgan Stanley, the move is likely to renew speculation about
Schroders' future. In particular, it begs the question of whether Schroders
will become a fully integrated investment bank by acquiring a UK broker.
Schroders already distributes equity in the US through its now wholly-owned
subsidiary Wertheim Schroder, but has not yet followed Warburg and others in
acquiring UK distribution. Its conservative policy during the Big Bang
deregulation of the City in 1986 has served it well, but could change.
'We were asked at the time of Big Bang, 'Where does that leave Schroders?'
This is another Big Bang, a global one, and hopefully we will answer the
question correctly,' says Mr Bischoff, who has helped Mr Mallinckrodt to set
Schroders' strategy since their dual appointment in 1984.
The danger is that by following Warburg's strategy of UK integration
combined with ambitious global expansion, it would simply over-burden itself
with costs. But if it does not buy a broker, such as Cazenove &amp; Co or Smith
New Court, it could eventually lose access to distribution.
'Our vested interest must be in Cazenove and Smith New Court remaining
independent. That does not cost us any money,' says Mr Mallinckrodt. Yet
Schroders' senior executives accept that they could be forced to make a
different decision if other banks start to buy the brokers it uses.
'If the marketplace requires something else, that is what we will do. We
won't do it just because other people are doing it,' says Mr Bischoff, who
will not comment on suggestions that Schroders has expressed interest in
buying NM Rothschild's 25 per cent stake in Smith New Court.
These questions are partly prompted by its rapid growth between 1984 and
1993. Net asset value more than quadrupled and staff grew from 2,630 to
3,911. It has also gained plaudits from analysts for its relatively low
exposure to volatile trading income.
Yet it remains collegial, with all but one vote in 10 years on the group
executive committee being unanimous. 'We are not a bunch of yes men. Debate
is vigorous, but when we make a decision we stick to it,' says Mr Peter
Sedgwick, head of its asset management arm, who is to become vice-chairman.
One reason for what Mr Mallinckrodt calls 'a partnership feeling' is that it
remains largely controlled by the Schroder family, which holds more than 40
per cent of its equity. One token of this is Mr Mallinckrodt, who is married
to the sister of Mr Bruno Schroder, the leading family shareholder.
Mr Mallinckrodt says having the backing of shareholders who 'have been
through some substantial vagaries in the past 190 years' helps to give the
bank stability, although Mr Bischoff emphasises that stability has been
combined with sufficient financial strength to finance growth out of
earnings.
Its investment management arm has expanded funds under management to Pounds
60bn. Mr Sedgwick argues that it has already achieved some of the inroads
into the US pension fund market which has been cited as a benefit of merger
for Mercury Asset Management, which is 75 per cent owned by Warburg.
Yet management stability will now be tested. As the bank has grown, the
management task has become more complex. It includes overseeing Wertheim
Schroder, which employs 1,200 people, as well as expanding operations in the
Asia Pacific and other emerging markets where Schroders is strong.
Mr Bischoff argues that Schroders cannot simply sit back with its current
mix of business. 'Once you say to yourself that you can stop a strategy of
growth, you're on a slippery slope.'
But he says it would be 'mathematically impossible' to sustain recent growth
rates.
Schroders' record of ignoring siren voices may give it more chance than
others of avoiding pitfalls in the second Big Bang. Yet it will have to pick
its way carefully to maintain growth without committing errors and incurring
the cost burdens that weighed down Warburg.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Stanhope asks for standstill on debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stanhope, the property developer on the brink of collapse, will today ask
banks, meeting to decide its future, for a debt standstill of up to three
years.
The company was last night trying to arrange a deal which would offer the
banks full repayment of their Pounds 140m loans, with interest, at the end
of a standstill period.
Stanhope's existing loan facility runs out next Monday. The 16 banks led by
Barclays must decide whether to appoint receivers or give the company more
time to come up with a rescue package. The other rescue proposals for
Stanhope come from British Land, the property investment company headed by
Mr John Ritblat, and PosTel, the post and telecommunications pension fund
run by Mr Alastair Ross Goobey.
Both of these plans ask the banks to take a write-down of more than 20p in
the pound on their loans.
Stanhope's own proposal envisages the company's Pounds 5m-Pounds 10m a year
running costs would be met during the standstill period by an unknown
investor in return for an equity stake.
The total cost of funding the company through the period would be Pounds
25m-Pounds 30m, against a market capitalisation of less than Pounds 20m.
Before giving Stanhope more time to finalise the plan, the banks will want
to know the identity of the investor and haveassurances of sufficient
working capital.
Stanhope's main asset is its 50 per cent stake in Broadgate Properties,
which owns much of the Broadgate and Ludgate developments in the City of
London. Broadgate Properties' accounts, published in October, valued its
assets at Pounds 1bn and Stanhope's stake at Pounds 116m.
Forecasts carried out for the company by Jones Lang Wootton, the surveyors,
suggest that the value of Broadgate Properties' assets could rise to Pounds
1.4bn by June 1997.
While this would allow Stanhope to repay its loans at the end of any
standstill, assumptions about Broadgate's future value are based on
forecasts of rents which could be wrong.
Sources close to the talks yesterday said they expected the banks to give
the company more time. Stanhope's shares fell by 3p to 10p yesterday.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Tiphook agrees a Dollars 12m settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tiphook, the transport leasing group, yesterday announced that it had
reached a Dollars 12m (Pounds 7.3m) settlement of a lawsuit being brought by
some of the group's US bondholders. The agreement will go before a US
federal court within the next two weeks for approval.
The bondholders, who started their legal action last January, had been
seeking Dollars 700m, the amount Tiphook raised from three tranches of bond
issues between November 1992 and April 1993. They claimed that they were
sold Tiphook bonds and shares on the basis of 'materially false and
misleading' information. Shortly after the final bond prospectus was issued,
Tiphook announced that interim profits would be some 20 per cent below
previously indicated results.
The company yesterday denied claims made by representatives of the
bondholders, that the final bill for Tiphook would be 'several million
dollars higher', owing to modifications agreed on how the bonds are
structured.
Mr Leonard Barrack, of Barrack, Rodos and Bacine, lead attorneys to the
bond-
holders, said: 'These are non-cash benefits to the bondholders which will be
agreed to over the next two weeks prior to the final signing of the
settlement papers.' He added: 'Given the financial situation of this
company, we are happy with the result.'
Tiphook said that the outcome of the case resolved one of the biggest
financial uncertainties hanging over the company. 'As far as we are
concerned the Dollars 12m settlement is the end of all outstanding claims
against the group in relation to the class action.'
The company also stated that its half-year results, due on Thursday, would
show improved trading leading to a small operating profit.
However, it also warned that the results 'are likely to incorporate further
exceptional provisions', and 'after payment of interest the company will
report a loss'.
Company sources said that group debt, currently standing at Pounds 512.5m,
would be little changed, as would its hefty interest bill, which for the
year to April 30 was Pounds 76m. The group's pre-tax losses for the year
were Pounds 331.1m. Market talk of a financial restructuring involving the
group's bankers was denied.
Tiphook refused to comment on the financial affairs of Mr Robert Montague,
its chief executive, who is facing a petition for bankruptcy. He is due to
attend a hearing on December 22 having successfully sought an extention to
gain further time to solve his problems. Royal Bank of Scotland is seeking
repayment of its outstanding loans, worth in the region of Pounds 2.5m.

FT  13 DEC 94 / MAM guards its independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley are discussing arrangements which would
maintain their fund management arms as two separate companies even if a
merger between the two investment banks goes ahead.
Top officials of the two fund management companies are understood to be
meeting today to discuss the structure.
A merger between Warburg's 75 per cent-owned asset management company,
Mercury Asset Management, and Morgan Stanley Asset Management had been part
of the deal's rationale.
It is thought that there have been concerns within MAM about the possible
loss of autonomy. Currently, MAM has its own board and its own executive
committee. Although Mr Hugh Stevenson, MAM chairman, would probably join the
board of the combined Warburg/Morgan Stanley group, it remains unclear how
MAM would maintain its independence.
'They have more power as two separate entities,' said one official involved
in the talks. 'As time goes by, we may decide to merge,' the official said,
adding that the senior managements of both firms preferred to see how an
association worked before seeking full integration.
It is understood that talks have been going on between the two fund
management arms for about a month and that senior officials on both sides
would prefer to keep the organisations separate.
Several MAM clients, who are also shareholders, said maintaining MAM's
independence was a primary concern. 'I would like to see that they are not
wholly owned by this company,' said one. 'If they are not operationally
independent, all sorts of problems could come up.'
Maintaining MAM as a separate shareholder would ease the pressure on Warburg
and Morgan Stanley to make an offer to the holders of the 25 per cent of the
company Warburg does not already own. It is understood that Morgan Stanley
would prefer that a minority 'rump' Warburg did not continue for a long
period of time.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Franc falls as Delors steps down from poll line-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French financial markets reacted anxiously yesterday to the decision by Mr
Jacques Delors, the head of the European Commission, not to stand as the
Socialist candidate in next spring's presidential elections.
His announcement on Sunday that he would not contest the vote after leading
in the polls for the past few weeks was seen as a devastating blow to the
Socialist party which would hand victory to the right.
But it raised fears of factional feuding within the conservative ranks and a
challenge from more nationalistic politicians to Mr Edouard Balladur, the
Gaullist prime minister, and now the favourite for next year's election.
The French franc fell to FFr3.44 to the D-Mark from its Friday close of
FFr3.432. Pressure on government bonds pushed yields on 10-year securities
up by 10 basis points to more than 8 per cent. However, the currency and
French bonds recovered some lost ground in afternoon trading.
Although Mr Balladur holds economic views similar to Mr Delors', economists
pointed to the risks of divisions on the right.
'Balladur could face a challenge from those who are less committed to
anti-inflationary policies and progress towards a single European currency,'
said a senior economist at one French merchant bank.
'What seemed like a straight Balladur-Delors contest with little risk in
policy terms has become more open,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, economist
at Salomon Bros.
The Socialist party admitted the setback dealt by Mr Delors' departure. 'We
have lost our best player and so we have a difficult match to play,' said Mr
Henri Emmanuelli, the party leader.
The French press was more pessimistic. 'Good-bye Delors, Ciao the left,
Hello Balladur-Chirac,' was the headline in the daily Le Parisien.
Economists said the French franc would remain vulnerable in the run-up to
the elections.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Banks face tough rules on capital adequacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British banks will have to hold additional capital to cushion them against
market movements, such as rising interest rates, under proposed rules
intended to bring the UK into line with a new European directive.
The proposals, drawn up by the Bank of England and due to take effect in
January 1996, will set tougher standards than those required by Brussels in
some areas to ensure that banks remain solvent under adverse trading
conditions.
The move is a strong rebuff to the banks which have warned they risk losing
business to French and German competitors, whose regulators may not take
such a tough stand.
Yesterday the British Bankers Association expressed concern about the
proposals, released in a consultative document, saying the 'superequivalent'
demand could leave them at a competitive disadvantage.
However, Bank officials made clear that they would not weaken their plans
simply in response to concerns about competition.
'We are certainly not in a Dutch auction on capital requirements,' one
official said.
The Bank stressed that many institutions would have an unchanged capital
requirement overall, and some may even have lower requirements. This is
because the European directive relaxes capital requirements for certain
types of bank investment.
One of the key rules would set much higher requirements than sought by the
directive for UK banks holding equities issued by companies outside the
European Union or Group of Ten leading industrial countries. Thus, UK banks
with portfolios of say, emerging markets equities, or of Australian
equities, could be hit harder than their Continental counterparts.
Bank officials signalled that Brussels might modify its directive if it
emerged that similar capital adequacy guidelines from the Basle committee on
banking supervision currently under discussion were 'superior'.
The proposed rules will allow banks to 'net' their exposures so an
institution which both lends to and borrows from a counterparty will only
need to hold capital against the difference.
The consultation period will end early in the new year and a final version
of the rules will be issued by next spring.

FT  13 DEC 94 / IBM halts shipments of 'flawed chip' computers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines has halted shipments of computers containing
the Pentium microprocessor made by Intel, the world's leading supplier.
The move follows growing customer concern about a flaw in the chip that can
lead to miscalculations in some mathematical applications.
Intel's share price dropped yesterday after the decision, closing in New
York at Dollars 60 3/8 , down from Dollars 62 3/4 on Friday.
IBM is one of Intel's largest customers. Its action has strained relations
with the company - which revealed last month there were problems with the
microprocessor. Intel complained yesterday that IBM had refused to provide
details of its analysis of Pentium errors and gave no notice of its
decision.
The microprocessor fault has proved embarrassing for Intel, which has 90 per
cent of the world microprocessor market. It is running an Dollars 80m
(Pounds 53m) worldwide campaign to persuade personal computer users to buy
Pentium-based machines.
Other PC makers using the Pentium microprocessor include Compaq,
Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Gateway and Packard Bell. They have offered to
replace faulty chips, but IBM is alone in halting shipments. However, other
manufacturers may now feel obliged to follow IBM's lead.
IBM stressed it had no desire to exacerbate Intel's embarrassment or to gain
competitive advantage. 'IBM is not encouraging customers to switch to
different products,' it said. 'Our decision to halt shipments is based
solely on customer interests.'
Intel has argued that most computer users would never experience the fault
which, it said, was likely to occur only once every 27,000 years. The only
people likely to be affected, it said, were technologists such as aircraft
designers carrying out large computations.
IBM, however, said that its scientists had found that the risk of errors may
be higher. 'A user could face either significantly more errors, or no errors
at all. If an error occurs . . . it may have no effect or it may have
catastrophic effects.' Customers using common spreadsheet programs could
encounter errors once every 24 days. For a customer with 500 Pentium-based
PCs, this could result in as many as 20 mistakes a day.
Intel said it believed IBM's action was 'unwarranted' and added that it did
not expect to take a charge against fourth-quarter earnings because of any
repercussions from the flaw.

FT  13 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: German equity culture
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
German private investors are almost pathologically disinclined to invest in
equities, so any step to reverse this is welcome. Reducing the nominal value
of shares from DM50 to DM5 - a move now under active consideration by
Allianz and Dresdner Bank - will help. Though it will not alter the
fundamental attractions of German shares, it will slash their high market
prices. Dealing will become less unwieldy as a result.
Only 6 per cent of German households own shares, compared with more than 20
per cent in the UK or US. Share splits will not make share-owning popular
overnight. Two factors point to changes ahead. First, the past year's poor
performance of bonds may drive more investors into equities. Second, the
forthcoming Deutsche Telekom privatisation will require the government to
whip up enthusiasm for shares. Professional investors will not swallow the
whole issue and the government may need to stimulate demand with tax breaks
for equities.
German companies could also do more to create value for shareholders.
Allianz, though at the vanguard of the move to lower denomination shares, is
behind on the shareholder value front. The DM20bn it has spent in the past
four years on acquisitions have probably earned less than if the cash had
been left in the money market. Even allowing for its deep discount rights
issues, Allianz's shares are down nearly a quarter against the market over
the period.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Large dividend increases yesterday by Eastern Group and Northern Electricity
did nothing to reverse the sector's recent underperformance. Northern's 30
per cent dividend rise demonstrates the benefits of buying back 10 per cent
of its shares: the underlying increase was only 16 per cent. Eastern's
pay-out is up 25 per cent, a tribute to its thorough cost cutting. Both
regional electricity companies profited from moves away from distribution.
This core business will suffer earnings decline when tougher price caps are
implemented next year. Northern's focus on deregulated sales to customers
buying more than 100kw of electricity was vindicated by a sharpincrease in
profits from such sales. Eastern also saw profit from deregulated sales jump
while power generation and gas supply made contributions too. Eastern says
that in two years more than a quarter of profits should come from businesses
other than distribution.
Both companies are committed to reducing dividend cover to two times.
Together with growth in unregulated income, this leaves scope for further
dividend growth, despite next year's lower distribution profits. Politics
has hurt electricity shares - Northern is the exception, due to bid
speculation - but any windfall profits tax from a future Labour government
remains relatively distant. Indeed, recs could anticipate such action by
giving more cash to shareholders now. They also offer more immediate upside
from next year's National Grid demerger. The recent sell down looks over
done.

FT  13 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Control premiums
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Morgan Stanley/Warburg merger talks have raised the question of when a
'control premium' should be paid in mergers. Some argue no premium is
payable because this will not be a takeover. Others think that, since Morgan
Stanley shareholders will hold two-thirds of the combined group, Warburg
shareholders should receive a premium. There is also the question of whether
minority shareholders in Mercury Asset Management, Warburg's 75 per
cent-owned subsidiary, should receive a premium.
The case for a premium in a cash takeover is clear: the bidding company
expects the takeover to yield benefits, so it is reasonable that the
target's shareholders receive some of these via a premium. MAM seems to fit
this description. If Morgan Stanley/Warburg intends to buy out the minority
so MAM can be merged with Morgan Stanley's own fund management arm, a
premium will be needed.
The opposite extreme is that of a share swap between two equally-sized
groups. The idea then that premiums must be paid to both by giving each
group of shareholders a larger share of the combined entity is nonsense.
Their reward, rather, comes from enjoying the fruits of merger - provided it
works. Does this logic apply when one company is twice the other's size?
There are two reasons why it may not. First, in such a share swap, the
smaller company's shareholders will enjoy only a third of any extra value
created through the merger. Second, by merging, the smaller group loses the
option of selling itself for cash. In such cases, a modest premium could be
the answer.

FT  13 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Stores of value
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The combination of warm weather, two budgets and a rise in interest rates is
not auspicious for UK retailers, especially in the vital trading weeks
leading up to Christmas. No wonder that the de-rating endured by the sector
over the past year has accelerated, with stores' shares underperforming the
market by nearly 6 per cent in the last three weeks.
Is the gloom overdone? To the extent that it is caused by fears about
Christmas trading, the answer is probably yes. There is plenty of time left
for a last-minute shopping spree. If retailers can hold their nerve and
resist the temptation to slash prices, there is no reason for this December
to be unseasonally dire - yesterday's upbeat prognosis from Allders supports
this. Longer term worries abound, though. Not least, there is the fear that
the retail environment has deteriorated now that inflation has dropped.
Double-digit growth in revenues becomes difficult to achieve even when
volume growth is at respectable single figure levels.
But the signs are that the sector's strongest companies, with high market
shares and up-to-date information technology, are coping well. They are
generating plentiful cash. Moreover, earnings growth could even beat that of
the market as a whole next year. Yet the sector, excluding Marks and
Spencer, has shed its traditional premium rating. Weaker retailers have been
punished by investors - Kingfisher shares are down 43 per cent over the past
year. By contrast a re-rating of the stronger companies is overdue.
Shareholders could find some good yuletide value in the sector.

'That's not sangfroid, that's savoir faire,' the Frenchman protested.
'Sangfroid is when you interrupt them, but invite them to carry on.'
'Rubbish,' exclaimed his wife. 'That's laisser-faire. Sangfroid is when your

Audio on at last at Granada Television. The Independent Television
Commission will this Thursday decide what action to take over repeated
violations of the rules on 'undue prominence' of products on the Granada
programme This Morning.
Just in time for the meeting, Granada has announced a vacancy for a
Compliance Adviser - someone whose job it will be to ensure that Granada's
programmes comply with ITC rules.
The new adviser's job will cover everything from Coronation Street and Prime
Suspect to Cracker, World in Action and This Morning. Particularly This
Morning.
All fine and dandy. But it may be too late; Sir George Russell, the ITC
chairman, has warned he is considering 'statutory action' - which could
include a different sort of fine amounting to up to 3 per cent of Granada's
qualifying income of around Pounds 150m.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Observer: Lomax 'in transition'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Just when we thought that Britain's brain drain was coming to an end,
another high-flier jumps ship. Worse still, she is one of the few women
economists to make any mark in the upper reaches of Her Majesty's
male-dominated Treasury. Rachel Lomax, currently head of the cabinet's
economic secretariat, is to take up a well-paid job at the World Bank.
She is off to Washington in the new year to be a country director in Wilfrid
Thalwitz's Europe and central Asia division, with responsibility for bank
programmes in three 'economies in transition' - Romania, Bulgaria and
Macedonia - as well as Portugal and Turkey. Lomax, 49, is not the first
Treasury exile in Washington - John Odling Smee is the IMF's point man on
Russia. But she will be a bigger loss to Whitehall where far too few women
have made it into the upper ranks.
The recent cuts in the size of the Treasury and the increasing power of the
Bank of England may have had something to do with her decision. She'll be
able to forget such trivia as VAT on fuel and turn her mind to a far more
challenging task: the historic economic transformation under way in eastern
Europe.
Even so, for a woman who had been tipped as a future permanent secretary, it
seems a surprise. So why is she moving? The World Bank has been struggling
to boost its thin complement of senior female executives, so much so that
its job advertisements now seek well-qualified 'women and men' in that
order. Could Lomax, a former deputy chief economic adviser to the UK
Treasury, be in the running to take over from Thalwitz.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Tilt in the balance of power: Delors' decision creates
problems for the French left and right
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 9m French people turned on their television sets on Sunday night
to hear Mr Jacques Delors announce that he would not run for the Elysee. The
level of interest showed how conscious they were of the consequences this
would have for the presidential election and possibly for French policy
towards Europe.
'This is not an easy decision to take,' said the European Commission
president, who had led all other possible presidential candidates in the
polls over recent weeks. Having said he wanted a break after 50 years of
work, and that he did not want office for office's sake, he concluded: 'I
will without doubt be criticised by certain people for an attitude that is
not frequent in political life.'
In fact, his decision won praise from many commentators, with the Liberation
newspaper describing him as 'the best president France never had', and
gained backhanded compliments from the nationalists on the extreme right and
left for his honesty in recognising there was no pro-European majority in
the country to elect him.
However, by 'certain people' Mr Delors really meant his fellow Socialists.
Most understood Mr Delors' personal reasons for not wanting another seven
years in harness, though some noted that General de Gaulle was almost Mr
Delors' age of 69 when he became president. What dismayed them was the
openness of his analysis that winning the Elysee would be a pyrrhic victory.
No Socialist president would have a hope of converting the present large
conservative majority of 480 out of 577 parliamentary seats into a majority
and a government he could work with.
Inevitably, many Socialists see this public admission, if not as a stab in
the back, then as queering the pitch for a future Socialist presidential
candidate. One who might fill that slot is Mr Jack Lang, former education
and culture minister.
Mr Lang said he could not understand Mr Delors' reasoning. 'Jacques Delors
would have been able to create a majority for his actions and ideas which
would have come from the very depths of society.' Even if this were true of
Mr Delors, however, it is not so of Mr Lang, or anyone else in the Socialist
party.
The right's problem with Mr Delors' decision is that it removes their
electoral need for unity. The plan by the ruling coalition, of the Gaullist
RPR and centre-right UDF parties, to hold US-style primaries to select a
single candidate for the Elysee had already collapsed. Now so will the need
for unity on which Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has, in particular, based
his campaign strategy against his fellow Gaullist, Mr Jacques Chirac.
To offset the greater hold that Mr Chirac has over the RPR party machine
that he created and led for nearly 20 years, Mr Balladur has assiduously
courted the UDF. There are more UDF members in his government than RPR
ministers, and he has tried to cater to the UDF's centrist, pro-European
susceptibilities. But to the dismay of the Balladur camp, the UDF spokesman
said yesterday that 'circumstances are becoming more favourable for the UDF
to advance its ideas in the presidential campaign'.
This could presage presidential bids by ex-President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing or his former prime minister, Mr Raymond Barre, thus driving a
wedge into the constituency sought by Mr Balladur.
The reason for the UDF's desire to speak up is its fear that, with the
battle now being fought on the right, the main Gaullist contestants may
start listening to 'the siren voices of the anti-Europeans', as Mr Jacques
Barrot, a centrist, put it yesterday.
In fact, both Mr Balladur and Mr Chirac have reasons for not wanting to make
Europe too much of an issue.
The prime minister recently criticised Euro-federalism as outdated, but this
was partly a pre-emptive move to mark his distance from Mr Delors. Given the
impossibility of saying anything on Europe that would please UDF
Euro-enthusiasts and RPR Euro-sceptics equally, Mr Balladur would probably
prefer to say nothing.
Without a real UDF following, Mr Chirac has less of a balancing trick to
perform. Eurosceptics are part of his natural catchment area. But he will
want to remove competition for their votes by persuading Mr Philippe de
Villiers, the anti-Maastricht conservative, to stay out of the race.
But whatever their inclinations, the main candidates will probably have
Europe thrust upon them.
France assumes the presidency of the European Union from January 1 right
through the campaign. Governments holding the EU's rotating presidency can
usually get away with - and sometimes must adopt - a position of bland
neutrality on EU controversies. But it is hard to see French politicians -
particularly Mr Balladur's rivals and opponents outside government - keeping
their lips buttoned for so long.
Mr Philippe Seguin, the pro-Chirac national assembly president, can be
counted to speak up on Europe, as may Mr Delors himself in support of
whatever candidate the Socialist party chooses.
Increasingly unavoidable, too, is the EU's looming constitutional conference
in 1996. France's EU partners, particularly Germany and the UK, have begun
to formulate their views on reforms of institutions and policies, and are
impatient to know what Paris thinks.
The ruling conservatives who are now likely to produce the next French
president are caught in the middle. They broadly share UK government views
on institutions, believing that the inter-governmental council of ministers
should hold dominance over the supranational bodies of Commission and
parliament. And they, conversely, dislike the institutional federalism
avowed by some leading Christian Democrats.
But on new policy initiatives they see little common ground with the UK,
except in defence, while converging closely with Bonn on a wide range of
policies.
Clever technicians such as Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's EU affairs
minister, have been working hard on compromises. Out of Mr Lamassoure's
fertile mind have come proposals to reduce EU competences, satisfying the
UK, while at the same time giving the European Parliament greater
co-decision powers on remaining legislation, pleasing the Germans.
He has also proposed a novel overhaul of the Council of Ministers, turning
it into a directorate on internal policy, which would award bigger states
such as Germany, the UK and France greater relative say, and giving it a
powerful secretary general to steer external policy.
But these are the sort of filigree compromises that will get shot through
when the presidential candidates start firing off on Europe.
What does France propose for 1996? Clearly its EU partners want a straight
answer. But a presidential campaign is the wrong time to ask for one.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Dream ticket's demise: Lionel Barber on the let-down felt by
Euro-enthusiasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Delors' decision against running for the presidency of France
says a lot about the man, his age, his family commitments and his thin skin.
But it may say more about the fragile state of public opinion in France
toward Europe.
As president of the European Commission since 1985, Mr Delors has been a
driving force in Franco-German efforts to build an 'ever closer' European
Union. The single European market, economic and monetary union, the
Maastricht treaty: each bears his indelible mark. Now, with the Elysee
seemingly within reach, Mr Delors has flinched.
The disappointment of French socialists is nothing to compare with the sense
of let-down felt by European supporters of faster, deeper integration. Mr
Delors was their champion. They hoped he would form a 'dream ticket' with
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany to dominate the 1996 inter-govermental
conference that will review the Maastricht treaty.
'When I first heard about his decision, I felt an explosion of anger,' says
a long-time Eurocrat and friend of Mr Delors. 'He could have made this
decision three months ago. Now I am afraid we will have to go slower in
1996.'
In time, more sober conclusions may be drawn. The absence of one man, even a
towering figure such as Mr Delors, will not alter France's calculation that
Germany is its most important ally; or that French influence, especially
over Germany, is best projected through a united Europe. The question is:
what type of Europe?
When Mr Delors leaves Brussels in January, his successor will be Mr Jacques
Santer, the Luxembourg prime minister. Mr Santer sees himself as
consolidator, not a promotor of new ideas in the mould of Mr Delors.
For the past decade, the Delors-Kohl-Mitterrand troika has driven forward
the plans for European monetary and political union, sweeping aside the
doubters led by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, former UK prime minister. Yet the end
product - the Maastricht treaty - was an uneasy compromise that fell far
short of the ambitions of its promoters.
Mr Delors still chides himself for being caught up in the planning for a
single European currency while the British sabotaged provisions for
'political union' in Europe - the German-led push for greater powers for the
European parliament, progressive elimination of the national veto in the
Council of Ministers, and a common defence policy.
Yet Mr Delors would be the first to admit that the British were assisted in
their efforts by the French. It was Mr Pierre de Boissieu, now France's
ambassador in Brussels, who devised Maastricht's 'pillar system' that
divides European decision-making into different areas: some such as the
common agricultural policy are decided at supranational level; others such
as foreign policy, justice and immigration affairs are subject to looser
intergovernmental co-operation.
Inside the European Commission, contempt for the pillar system is rife. A
senior official describes justice ministers' efforts to reach agreement on
issues such as tackling organised crime as a 'sham'.
Another official involved in the common security and foreign policy says
nothing of substance has been accomplished, beyond the establishment of an
EU presence in the heavily shelled Bosnian town of Mostar.
'There is trench warfare between the Commission and the member states,' he
says.
Euro-activists hope that 1996 will end the battle over national and
supranational responsibilities, seeing the role of the inter-governmental
conference as akin to the Philadelphia convention of 1787 that created the
US constitution. Euro-sceptics vow to roll back Maastricht, mainly by
depriving the Commission of its main power, the sole right to propose
legislation on areas of EU competence.
France stands somewhere in the middle, worried about following Germany into
political union, but equally wary of the Thatcher-Seguin model of Europe as
little more than a free trade area.
Mr Delors' answer is an inner circle of integrationist-minded states led by
France and Germany. This hard-core would be committed to common economic,
political and security policies inside a European Union enlarged by the
former communist countries of central and eastern Europe. Those unable to
join the inner core at an early date (possibly Italy or Spain) or those
unwilling (possibly the UK, Denmark or Sweden) would be free to catch up
later.
Mr Delors' views are broadly similar to the ideas put forward in a recent
analysis by the ruling CDU-CSU party in Germany. Together they represent an
act of faith in proclaiming the virtual end of the nation state and
an attempt to prevent the paralysis of the Union's decision-making as it
prepares for the next round of enlargement in eastern Europe.
The exit of Mr Delors from France's presidential race diminishes the
prospect of a strategic bargain between France and Germany in 1996 on
political union. But Euro-sceptics will find that his absence does not
diminish the powerful forces supporting European co-operation and
integration.
First, there remains strong support for establishing a single European
currency by the end of the decade. Second, as the UK has grasped, US
political and military disengagement from Europe is forcing consideration of
new forms of defence co-operation. Third, an unstable Russia may accelerate
the integration of eastern Europe into the Union, forcing a streamlining of
decision-making and a corresponding erosion of national sovereignty.
Mr Delors' withdrawal may have removed Mr Kohl's natural ally in this
programme. But Germany's chancellor, who sees Europe's future as a matter of
war and peace, will not easily be rebuffed.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Leading Article: A new target for inflation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling's expulsion from the ERM on September 16 1992 was followed by a
typically British improvisation of a new framework for monetary policy. The
time has now come to put that framework on a longer-term basis.
Yesterday's figures for producer prices show why the counter-inflationary
framework needs to be fortified. Output prices for manufactures were up only
0.1 per cent in November. But strong inflationary pressure is revealed in
the 2.4 per cent jump in input prices over the month and the 7.9 per cent
over the year.
The more credible the framework, the easier it will be to hold the line on
output prices. Credibility has not yet been achieved, however, as is shown
by the gap between yields on index-linked and conventional gilts, now
running at slightly over 4 1/2 percentage points. Similarly, yields on gilts
are 1 percentage point above those on D-Mark bunds.
The current framework has three principal elements: a target for the retail
price index (less mortgage interest payments) of 1-4 per cent, falling to
the lower half of the range by the end of the parliament; the Bank of
England's inflation report; and the publication of the minutes of the
monthly meetings between the chancellor of the exchequer and the governor of
the Bank of England.
This framework suffers from four defects: first, the chosen inflation index
includes changes in indirect taxation, to which monetary policy should not
normally respond; second, the range of 1 1/2 percentage points for the end
of the parliament is too narrow to be consistently hit, given current
knowledge, with potentially serious consequences for credibility; third,
there is no target beyond the end of the parliament, within less than two
and half years, while the lag between policy action and outcome is at least
two years; and, finally, many financial contracts have a much longer
maturity than the life of a parliament, which means the target's duration is
self-evidently too short.
The solution to the first problem is to switch to a target for what the Bank
of England calls RPIY, which excludes indirect taxes. The solution to the
second is to move to a range of 3 percentage points once more, but at a
lower level, to reflect the fact that the annual rate of inflation is now
substantially lower than the 4 per cent or so of late-1992. A sensible range
would be 0-3 per cent.
The solution to the third and fourth problems is to challenge the opposition
to reject the proposed new target range. That would put Messrs Brown and
Blair on the spot, since refusal would imply that they are inclined towards
higher inflation. Ideally, however, they would accept it. Certainly, it
would be in their interest to do so, since they too need low long-term
interest rates. If Labour were to accept, the UK would possess a cross-party
consensus on the long-term monetary framework. It would have reached that
destination in a typically muddled way. But at least it would be there.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Bravo, Jacques
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Delors' decision not to stand for next year's French presidential
election was a brave and realistic move. Although he faces criticism from
the Socialist party for handing a near-certain victory to the conservatives,
it is the right decision for Mr Delors and for France. If it ends up helping
to clarify the French debate about widening and deepening European
integration, the decision could turn out, too, to be the right one for
Europe.
The French head of state wields far more power than most European heads of
government. Mr Delors' trump card would have been the breadth of his
electoral appeal. Nonetheless, the balance in his decision seems to have
been tipped by the fragmentation of the Socialist party, combined with his
own weariness after 10 years at the European Commission. Mr Delors is
probably right to judge that, had he won the presidency, he would have been
unable to assemble a working majority in the National Assembly; his role in
economic and social reform, as well as foreign and defence policy, would
have been shackled.
Even assuming a new parliamentary election, Mr Delors would have been forced
into an uncomfortable 'cohabitation' both with the Gaullists and with his
own party, in which he lacks a strong power base. None of this would have
been conducive to decisive government. A President Delors would have had an
agenda, but little chance of carrying it through.
Mr Delors' step inflames the Socialists' self-inflicted wounds, but it gives
the party a better long-term chance of finding a younger leader. As for the
right, the benefits need to be weighed against the disadvantages that may
ensue from intensified in-fighting between the two main presidential
contenders, Mr Edouard Balladur and Mr Jacques Chirac.
Both rivals support European integration in co-ordination with Germany.
Compared with Mr Delors, however, they ascribe to the nation state a
stronger role in European affairs. It is thus almost certain that President
Mitterrand's successor will adopt an agenda for reforming the EU's
institutions and enlarging its membership that falls well short of the
federal ambitions of Mr Delors and Chancellor Helmut Kohl. By vacating
France's political middle-ground, Mr Delors' decision could indirectly
encourage a regrouping of the French centre-right with more convincing
policies for combining national and European decision-making than those at
present espoused by the Gaullists alone.
By steering through the Single European Act and supporting Mr Kohl over
German unification, Mr Delors has already decisively aided European
integration. If his withdrawal from the race helps bring about more coherent
European policies on the right, Mr Delors' decision may eventually be seen
as one more contribution to the European cause.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Leading Article: China and 1997
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is in everybody's interest that the UK's handover of Hong Kong should be
a success. Britain needs a dignified exit from its colonial past; China
requires a prosperous and peaceful Hong Kong if it is eventually to
reintegrate Taiwan. As 1997 gets closer, China will increasingly be calling
the tune. The question is how it plans to use that influence. Last weekend's
meeting in Beijing of China's preliminary working committee, which is
examining details of the handover, was not encouraging.
China plans to install a provisional Legislative Council in 1997 in place of
the body elected next year under Governor Chris Patten's reforms. It has now
made clear it intends that council to run for at least a year. It is also
prevaricating about the shape of the court of final appeal which is to be
the territory's supreme legal authority after 1997. This is unsettling, not
only because Britain thought the arrangements were already agreed. Without
some guarantee of judicial continuity, Hong Kong's future looks deeply
uncertain.
China will damage its own interests if it lets rancour over electoral reform
impede practical progress on the handover arrangements. There is a pressing
need to ensure that Hong Kong can remain an economic and social success
after 1997. Civil servants need to be sure their careers will continue after
that date. The business community needs to know that the provisional LegCo
will not be used to impose capricious and repressive legal changes that will
undermine confidence in the economy.
To prevent a legal vacuum, China should agree quickly to the establishment
of the court. It may be unable to go back on its LegCo plans. But when
Chinese officials meet their British counterparts in London this week, they
could at least make a categoric commitment to limit the scope of the
provisional council's mandate to passing essential legislation, rather than
allow it to enact more far-reaching changes. For its part Britain should
leave the door as wide open as possible to practical co-operation, allowing
formal contacts between government officials and the preliminary working
committee and taking more care to consult on policy.
One problem is China's apparent obsession with the notion that, since it
will not recognise the Legislative Council elected under the Patten reform,
it will also not recognise any laws it passes. That only makes for maximum
uncertainty. A more constructive approach would be to work for a good
showing by pro-mainland parties in next year's elections.
The world would then see that Hong Kong's Chinese citizens did not all view
1997 as a threat. Many are deeply patriotic and would welcome reversion to
mainland rule were it not for their fear of the Communist party. Beijing
cannot succeed in this enterprise unless it tries harder to win the hearts
and minds of the Hong Kong people.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Personal View: High cost of liquidity - Amar Bhide on the
downside of US investor protection rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AMAR BHIDE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Policy makers around the world who seek the Nirvana of frictionless trading
found on Wall Street have enthusiastically en-dorsed the US model of
securities laws and other investor protection rules. The imitators may not,
however, appreciate the costs.
US rules to protect investors and the integrity of stock markets impair firm
governance. They discourage shareholders from providing informed oversight
and induce executives to neglect their fiduciary duties. The worldwide
scramble to mandate accurate and complete disclosure, incarcerate insider
traders and eliminate shady trading practices will likely benefit
stockbrokers rather than stockholders.
As the experience of Continental countries suggests, liquid equity markets
do not easily sustain themselves. Wall Street financiers, who argue
passionately for free enterprise, in fact owe a great debt to their
regulators. The Securities and Exchange Commission reassures the speculators
who provide market liquidity by certifying the integrity of exchanges.
Casinos with reputations for rigged games eventually drive away patrons.
Penalties for insider trading similarly undergird a liquid market in which
many buyers bid for stocks without much regard for the identity or
motivations of the seller. The fear of trading against better-informed
insiders would otherwise require protracted negotiations between known
parties.
The SEC's enforcement of accurate disclosure facilitates the trading of
claims on companies that neither buyer nor seller has personally examined.
Early this year, for example, the SEC filed a complaint accusing the Bank of
Boston of failing to disclose fully the deterioration of its loan portfolio.
Whatever the merits of the case, such actions reassure traders that they can
buy a company's stock without an independent audit of its loans.
Laws that protect mutual fund investors and pension plan beneficiaries by
enjoining broad diversification of portfolios also contribute to market
liquidity by fragmenting shareholding of stocks. The concentration of
stockholding in a few hands impairs liquidity.
Diffused, arm's-length stockholding also discourages investors from playing
an effective role in the governance of companies. Pension and mutual fund
rules that direct their trustees and investment managers to diversify
holdings widely make relationships with a small number of managers unlikely.
The seemingly irreproachable insider-trading rules place special
restrictions on investors who hold large positions in a company's stock,
serve on its board, or receive any confidential information about it. They
must report their transactions, forfeit short-term gains, and try to avoid
any appearance of trading on inside information. But why should investors
become insiders and be subject to these restrictions just so that everyone
else can enjoy the benefits of a level trading field?
They don't. Institutional investors, with fiduciary responsibilities,
usually refuse to receive any private information from managers. They may
grumble about a company's performance, but they will not sit on its board
for fear of compromising the liquidity of their holdings. Without such
rules, the same institutions would likely demand access to confidential
information before they even considered investing. The rules thus make large
investors resolute outsiders.
And outside shareholders cannot provide effective oversight. Evaluating
chief executive officers - distinguishing between their luck and ability -
requires considerable confidential and contextual information. But managers
have a fiduciary duty to conceal strategic information from shareholders.
The dialogue between managers and the public investment community therefore
usually revolves around quarterly earnings estimates even though both sides
are dubious about their long-run significance.
Disclosure requirements, too, impose special burdens on insiders and thus
encourage arm's-length stockholding. For example, rules requiring disclosure
of transactions with insiders make a company's banks, suppliers or customers
less willing to hold large blocks of stock or serve on boards. Disclosure
rules, intended to treat all investors equally, make anonymous shareholding
safe. If company reports were sketchy or unreliable, shareholders would
likely require an inside role and ongoing access to confidential
information.
Market liquidity itself weakens incentives to play an inside role in firm
governance. All companies with more than one shareholder face what
economists call a free-rider problem. The oversight and counsel provided by
any one shareholder benefits all others; therefore all of them may shirk
their responsibilities. The issue is of particular concern if a company
faces a crisis. The absence of a liquid market prevents shareholders from
running away easily and forces them to pull together to solve the problem.
With stock liquidity, however, it makes more sense for each investor to sell
out instead.
US investors who have been locked out of an inside role see many CEOs as
entrenched, overpaid and self-serving while CEO's complain about their
shareholders' short-sightedness. The alienation helps make public equity
markets an unreliable source of equity.
Accepted beliefs notwithstanding, the exceptional liquidity of US markets
does not give publicly traded companies advantages in issuing equity.
Investors regard stock issues with suspicion and companies issue equity as a
last resort, or opportunistically, in overheated markets. Managers in fact
go to considerable lengths to insulate themselves against fickle investors.
They reinvest profits, sometimes in marginal projects. Or they acquire
companies in unrelated businesses to generate counter-cyclical earnings.
Managers also don't try very hard for anonymous shareholders. Several
studies have shown dramatic improvements in a company's performance after it
has been subject to a leveraged buy-out, with just a few private
shareholders. Overall, the robustness and vitality of US business owes
little to publicly traded companies. Closely-held entrepreneurial companies
have for more than two decades provided the principal source of innovation
and growth.
In the US it may be too late to undo the damage. Elsewhere, regulators ought
to re-think their opposition to multiple classes of stock, poor disclosure,
limited float, insider trading and other impediments to stock market
liquidity. Liquid markets play a valuable economic role - in physical
commodities or well-secured, standardised contracts such as government bonds
or currency futures. With the more amorphous equity claims, the traditional
private relationships are usually best.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Playgroups for politicians
</HEADLINE>

   By JOE ROGALY

<TEXT>
British tax-payers are about to spend more on teaching under-fives. Do not
hesitate. Rush out and buy. Pick companies heavily into egg-boxes,
water-colours, paint sets, plastic bricks, and sharp objects suitable for
throwing at random. The auction for the tots' vote has begun. Mr John Major
made his bid at the Conservative conference in October. Good quality
pre-school places will in due course be provided for four-year-olds whose
parents want to take them up. What? Reluctant to invest in the prime
minister? Not a penny? Have no fear. Labour's policy is more expansionary
than Mr Major's, and just as cheap. The opposition offers universal nursery
education - without increasing any taxes, you understand. Taxes? Heaven
forfend]
On the government side the education secretary, Mrs Gillian Shephard, is
inventing a means of delivering her boss's careful promise. She is juggling
a familiar mix of potential providers: playgroups, private and voluntary
establishments, and local education authorities. Choice will be her slogan.
Let us decide upon the basis of what would be educationally beneficial, she
will say. You can bet on at least a few more places for four-year-olds
before the next election. Her Labour opposite number, Mr David Blunkett, has
a more complicated task. He is preparing to reposition Labour's policy, so
that it may become a close replica of the Conservative scheme, while looking
different. He is working with the same list of providers as Mrs Shephard,
but appears to want 'integration', favouring elected authorities while not
upsetting the powerful voluntary movements or challenging the existence of
private nurseries. Choice will be his implied slogan.
The word-play used to express Labour's strategy once it is settled should be
a source of infinite delight. Mr Blunkett's boss looks with greater favour
on schools that have opted out of local education authority control than I
suspect Mrs Shephard does, yet the process of converting the people's party
is turning out to be predictably tedious. The main difficulty is this:
Labour is lying under its blanket, keeping perfectly still, not daring to
breathe, deeply afraid that it might wake up and find that what has been
happening to the Conservative party is all a dream.
Meanwhile there is movement in the room. The deputy director of the Centre
for Policy Studies, that well-known nutter, has come thumping along to say
that she favours a voucher system for nursery education. 'Nutter?' I would
have patience with the critics of Dr Sheila Lawlor, some of whom are to be
found among her supposed Conservative allies, were it not for the awkward
fact that from time to time she is right. She is half-right on this
occasion, as we shall see in a moment. The centre she deputy-directs was
inspired by the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher, who once undertook to provide
universal pre-school tuition. The lady never got around to it. Nor did Lord
Joseph, who has just died. He founded the CPS, and helped Dr Lawlor prepare
her latest pamphlet*. As with her, his political sanity was often in doubt;
for which we should be grateful. It was his charm, as it is her saving
grace.
I recall several long conversations with the then Sir Keith, in particular
one in the early 1970s, in which he said that he would love to be secretary
for education but feared that if he followed his instincts in that post the
teachers would march round his offices and pelt him with rotten vegetables.
At the time he was secretary for social services. A decade later he was
moved to education but, alas, failed to change much. The protest marches did
not take place. It would have been a triumph if they had. He too proposed a
voucher system, but for 5 to 16-year-olds, not toddlers as in the case of Dr
Lawlor. This was derided as mad, but what is the logic of the system of open
enrolment in state schools if not to attach the money to the pupil rather
than the academy?
Yet Dr Lawlor is half-wrong this time. She sees local education authorities
as inherently evil wasters of money and purveyors of politically-correct
schooling designed to shape society. Kindergartens controlled by Labour-run
education authorities would turn out what were once called in the trade
'state babies'. Dr Lawlor knows how to defend us from her nightmare. Give
parents Pounds 700 a year in vouchers, she argues, allow them to contribute
as much again from their own pockets, and the private and voluntary
academies could capture the market. You can hear Mrs Shephard and Mr
Blunkett in chorus: 'But vouchers are so cumbersome'.
Perhaps they are. Deployed as Dr Lawlor proposes they would constitute an
elaborate mechanism for circulating money from all tax payers to middle
class parents, which she implicitly rejects. A means-tested voucher system,
which would help children of low-income parents, is dismissed on the ground
that it 'would go against the tradition in this country of providing free
schooling'. In effect, it would also be a levy on middle and higher income
tax payers. That, however, is the point. The results of studies in the US
suggest that children in poor families in city centres do better if given a
'head start' in a nursery. Dr Lawlor questions the applicability of these
conclusions to the general population (and indeed doubts the research
methodology), but the evidence is strongest when applied to the least well
off.
Here is Mr Blunkett's opportunity, as indeed Mrs Shephard's. The latter has
not ruled out any system, yet. She, and he, should promise vouchers for poor
families. Both could explain to their separate constituencies why a variety
of school organising principles, state and voluntary, suits the mood of the
times. Both might profit from Dr Lawlor's observation of the French, who
educate the majority of their toddlers in state schools, but 11.8 per cent
privately. The basis for their success, she says, is 'a greater consensus
between state, teachers and parents than in Britain - a shared confidence in
a system which favours the transmission of knowledge and rigorous but
distinct academic or vocational education, and reflects a long tradition of
enlightened state control of schools'. We can't emulate that, she argues.
We could try.

Sir, Frank Blackaby (Letters: December 7) asks what the ratio between the

interest to know that in 1915 Admiral Jellicoe, who was described as the one
person who could lose the war in an afternoon, was paid Pounds 1,825 a year,
while an Ordinary Seaman earned Pounds 12 3s (Pounds 12.15) a year - a ratio
of 1:150. By 1917, the ratio had dropped to 1:105.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: No dramatic change in UK labour
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Simon Burgess and Hedley Rees are to be congratulated for nailing
another myth about the UK labour market: that lifetime jobs have become a
thing of the past (Personal View: 'Jobs for life still available to many',
December 9). Their research findings showing only modest changes for men in
the average duration of jobs and no change for women need to be taken on
board by all those interested in welfare, employment and training policy.
Evidence from the US matches that for the UK. In 1979, 30 per cent of
Americans reported that they had been in their current jobs for more than
eight years. In 1991, 31 per cent said they had been in their jobs for more
than eight years.
So in the two most flexible western labour markets, the length of job tenure
has either changed very little or not at all.
These findings go alongside other research, for example relating to the
absence of significant growth in temporary employment, which suggests that
changes in the structure of employment in the UK in recent years have been
far less dramatic than is commonly supposed.

Anti-smuggling staff will continue to be active in airports and ports

We are confident that by putting greater emphasis on quality results in

FT  13 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Mandatory institutional voting would
curb executive pay excesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ANNE SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The belated cabinet concern over excessive executive pay is to be
welcomed. But if institutional investors are expected by the cabinet to
monitor and supervise it, they will have to be given the tools to do the
job. Expecting executives themselves, serving as non-executives on other
company boards, to exercise restraint is unrealistic because of their
conflicts of interest. Turkeys will not vote for Christmas.
The solution lies in enabling institutional investors to exercise
appropriate supervision over those whom they elect to manage company assets.
At present, these investors cannot vote on the total remuneration package
for directors, but only part of it (the rather arbitrary elements like share
options, compensation and five-year contracts). But voting on remuneration
packages will not be enough unless the principles of integrity,
accountability and openness which Cadbury set out for companies are also
operated by City fund managers who exercise (or not) votes on behalf of
pension scheme members and insurance policy holders. To keep the Christmas
fowl in mind, Cadbury sauce for the company goose should also be sauce for
the investment manager gander.
Where should John Major begin unravelling these conflicts? The first step
would be to oblige institutions to cast their votes in the first place. At
many companies, most proxy votes are filed in the waste paper bin. A minor
amendment to the Pensions Bill making voting mandatory would catch the
majority of institutional investors and would also bring UK pension funds in
line with their American cousins, which are already under such an obligation
in respect of their shares in British companies. But will such votes be cast
in the interests of pension scheme and insurance policy holders interests?
To ensure that institutions are up to the mark on this they should make
their voting policy public (as Cadbury recommended, but most have ignored)
and keep records of their voting activity which are open to inspection by
the beneficiaries/policy holders.
Unless the government digs a little deeper into the conflicts of interest, a
worthy reform in favour of voting on directors' pay could simply be used to
engineer a mandate for further unacceptable and unjustified pay rises.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: The democratic deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN H GILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I hesitate to take issue with Lord Plumb (Letters, December 8), but I
believe there is a rather more important lesson to be drawn from your
public-spirited Anglo-German opinion poll, even allowing for the known
imperfections of such exercises.
It demonstrates the very substantial gap (should we call it a 'democratic
deficit'?) that exists on matters European between EU national governments
and their electorates. One should also note that the one head of government
that is in tune with this aspect of his electorate's concerns is the UK
prime minister.
The 'European project' has much to recommend it, and is probably essential
to the future of the peoples of Europe. What the politicians appear to have
lost track of is the sensibilities of their electorates, and until that
problem is addressed the European grouping will continue to stutter rather
badly.

<TEXT>
Sir, I am bemused by the furore over VAT on fuel.
I thought public interest required a reduction in unnecessary consumption of
non-renewable fossil fuels and imposition of VAT was to serve as an
incentive for householders to reduce consumption.
Trade and industry secretary Michael Heseltine has claimed a reduction in
price in real terms of gas through privatisation, which suggests fiscal
penalties are even more necessary now.
Have I got it wrong?

   From Mr JOSEPH WRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Is democracy really the winner, as is stated by William Bakewell
(Letters, December 9) in response to the government's defeat over an
increase in VAT on domestic fuel?
Perhaps it is when one considers that the majority of the electorate would
not seem to support the move.
However, as far as parliamentary democracy is concerned can we be so sure?
Did every member of all the opposition parties vote according to their
conscience, or did they vote politically to bring about a humiliating defeat
on the government?
Equally, did all the unrebellious Conservatives vote with the government for
the former reason or were they simply trying to prevent such a humiliation?
If political motives did indeed determine how MPs voted, then democracy has
not been served.
The outcome in reality acts merely as an example of how enormous political
power can be wielded by small minority groups or parties whatever electoral
system is prevalent when governments rule through coalition or small
minorities.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Arts: Goldschmidt premiere - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY BYE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For all the confrontational nature of much of its art, the 20th century has
given us a surprisingly large number of accessible violin concertos by
composers as diverse as Bartok, Britten, Prokofiev, Shostakovich and Walton.
At its first British concert performance on Thursday at the Royal Festival
Hall, 40 years after its completion, Berthold Goldschmidt's Violin concerto
was given every chance to succeed as well: the interpretation, at least,
seemed everything the composer could have wished for.
Such belated premieres are nothing new for the Jewish refugee who settled in
England, where he abandoned composition entirely. Recently Goldschmidt's
fortunes have changed and he has resumed composing. CDs of both his earlier
and later music are proliferating and his two operas have recently been
staged in Germany.
The Violin concerto offers no grandiose world-view such as one might expect
from a composer who was instrumental in getting Mahler's music recognised in
Britain. It owes more to Stravinsky and Hindemith, an attractive four
movement work, new-classical in outline but shot through with darker
undercurrents. The fourth movement is perhaps less convincing than the first
three, which are beautifully crafted and idiomatically written for the
violin. The first, in particular, shows Goldschmidt at his finest: rhapsodic
in form, one idea generates the next in a succession of episodes which
embrace a gamut of moods from bitter-sweet lyricism to turbulent polyphony.
My only doubts lay with the quality of the work's raw materials. The
gestures are all in place, but are the melodies memorable enough?
The young Canadian violinist Chantal Juillet certainly tried to convince us
that they were, dispatching the often fiendish solo part with heroic aplomb.
Charles Dutoit and the Philharmonia Orchestra provided firm, colourful
support, on top form after opening with a reliable but solid account of
Bizet's Second L'Arlesienne Suite. In spite of the obvious attractions of
the Goldschmidt, however, it was a magisterial account of Prokofiev's Fifth
Symphony which provided the most nourishing experience of the evening. Even
though the orchestra's guest leader, Hugh Bean, collapsed dramatically
during the first movement (he was later reported to be comfortable in
hospital), the orchestra responded with playing of great power and warmth,
fully at one with Dutoit's broad, romantic conception and firm structural
command of a work which can all too easily sound protracted and coarse - a
fine tribute to the Philharmonia's professionalism and Dutoit's consummate
artistry.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Arts: Three Graces unveiled at the V&amp;A
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Three Graces were unveiled in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London
yesterday, ending a five year battle over ownership of the 19th-century
sculpture.
The Graces have been the subject of controversy since the Marquess of
Tavistock, whose ancestor commissioned sculptor Antonio Canova in 1814,
offered the work to the V &amp; A almost a decade ago. The museum could not
afford the Pounds 1m price, condemning the Three Graces to years in a London
warehouse, the property of the mysterious Fine Art Investments &amp; Display.
In 1989 the J. Paul Getty Museum at Malibu paid Pounds 7.6m for the work,
but attempts to export it were thwarted by British heritage groups, which
raised Pounds 3m from the National Heritage Fund, Pounds 1m from John Paul
Getty 11, Pounds 800,000 from Baron Thyssen, Pounds 500,000 from the
National Art Collections Fund and the remainder from the V &amp; A and the
National Gallery of Scotland.
National heritage secretary Stephen Dorrell said yesterday that the
unveiling of the sculpture was a boost for the nation's heritage and the end
of a 'long saga'. The Graces will leave London in July for Edinburgh, where
they will spend the next four years in the National Gallery of Scotland.
They will return to the V &amp; A in 1999 then rotate between the two
institutions every seven years.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Arts: Focus on the figure - William Packer reviews the early
figurative work of Edward Burra together with more recent paintings and
drawings by Sergei Chepik and Patrick Procktor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Working from the figure is rather an issue these days. Should the life model
be available to the student and, if so, what kind of use should be made of
it? Should it be a focus of objective and technical study, or merely a
prompt for subjective interpretation and response? In the old days the
answer would have been taken as read, that of course it must be the first
alternative, for without such a fund of knowledge and practice, how could
one possibly move on usefully to the second?
By chance, several current London shows, and one in particular, make the
point. The Lefevre has had a number of shows lately of the work of that most
idiosyncratic of English surreal romantics, Edward Burra. The latest is of a
fascinating group of works on paper from his time as a student in the 1920s,
and his first years of independence.
Here is the mature artist in embryo, wearing his influences on his sleeve,
flirting with caricature and making his first moves towards the vigorous
mannerism and wicked imagery of cafe, low cabaret and hotel, that were soon
to mark him out. Nothing is inconsistent to the artist we know, for all that
the young Burra as cartoonist was looking to Lear, as illustrator to Rackham
and Dulac, as artist to the still-lifes, interiors and gardens of David
Jones and the brothers Nash. These last, views taken in and around Burra's
family home at Rye, are most beautiful drawings.
To declare an influence is never to betray oneself, if it is taken as
something direct, useful and unselfconscious. It is indeed the great paradox
of creativity that the artist is most himself when least concerned with
himself. This is nowhere more evident than in the life-drawings and figure
studies which punctuate this show. How typical of the period they are, with
that swift, incisive contour and judicious modelling through the form,
shades of Strang and Kennington and Randolph Schwabe, who taught him at the
Royal College.
But even so, Burra's personal inflexion always comes through, with just a
shift of an emphasis here, and an exaggeration there. Suddenly we see how
firm and knowing was the base that he had acquired in his study of the
figure, and how necessary it was to every graphic liberty he was
subsequently to take. It underpins, and validates, the entire oeuvre.
Next door, at Roy Miles, Sergei Chepik, a Russian painter now living in
Paris, is showing his latest work. Chepik, who had an orthodox academic
training in Leningrad, is evidently talented and prodigiously prolific. And
it is typical of the prolific that too often they do not know when to stop.
More to the point, so anxious are they to move on that too much is left
perfunctory and unresolved.
Chepik is prepared to work on an epic scale, and with epic themes, composing
and ordering them with remarkable vigour and invention. And these too often
lead him into the abyss of gothic fantasy, essentially literary and
sentimental, peopled by armies of ghouls and madmen, clowns and monsters,
all gesticulating with fearful histrionics. Someone should tell him quietly
that the white-faced clown, indeed any clown, is the first and final
disqualification for any serious regard.
And yet, as one recoils somewhat from the kitsch excess, one cannot but
acknowledge and even respect the artist buried beneath it all, who may yet
struggle free. For the more straightforward the work becomes, and the less
forced the symbolism and the portentousness, the better it is. A still-life,
a portrait or two, some compositions in the Russian illustrative tradition,
all offer much hope. The figurative skill and knowledge are there, and the
discipline too, though dormant. Perhaps Chepik should not try so hard.
Patrick Procktor, now at the Redfern with a mini-retrospective, is a painter
who in the past has seemed, perhaps, not to be trying hard enough. His
pictorial wit, his lightness of touch, his graphic sensibility and charm
were quite enough to carry us along, and not notice too unkindly that the
image was skimped and the painting perfunctory. But all is not always as it
seems, and this little show gives us pause for thought in adding some
retrospective substance to the work.
What is most useful is to see the latest paintings, of landscapes and
figures, against the figure painting of the early 1960s, when Procktor first
sprang upon an astonished world. That work was a sophisticated expressionism
founded in the old discipline of life painting, worked directly from the
model. And what we find is that while not so closely disciplined, this new
work marks a return to that richer surface and a closer selective working of
the paint within the looser general statement. And those more lightly stated
paintings in the interim, portraits, views of Venice and the like, they are
not so slight after all.

'The night before Christmas' is started off-screen in the stilted
semi-cockney whine associated with stage infants, but the camera reveals a
journalistic adult: Suzanne Moore, who presents Without Walls: J'Accuse
Santa Claus (9pm, Channel 4). The modern image of Santa is apparently the
Americanisation of such pagan figures as our own Father Christmas.
A parade of po-faced witnesses (except the author of The Making of Modern
Christmas whose smile is as strained as any department store Santa's)
earnestly describe the moral and psychological harm done to children by (a)
believing Santa exists and (b) finding he doesn't. The editor of
Cosmopolitan says toy advertising 'offends the hell out of me'. A professor
from Loughborough University calls the phenomenon 'pretty hideous'. A writer
compares Santa unfavourably with Catholic warnings of eternal hell-fire.
Their implied superiority to us ad-watching ignoramuses is as ludicrous as
the solemn lament for joyfully subversive paganism uttered in Ms Moore's
humourless tones.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Arts: Calamity Jane - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH HEMMING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you like your ham hickory smoked, this is surely the show for you. The
Steam Industry's production of Calamity Jane (at BAC, Battersea), is a hoot
from start to finish: wildly energetic, noisy, sweaty, totally over the top
and thoroughly enjoyable.
Phil Willmott's staging gallops through the story of the pistol-toting
tomboy, Calamity Jane, her efforts to please the local wasters by fetching a
glamorous actress to perform in Deadwood, Dakota, her fights and her
eventual romance with Wild Bill Hickock, manages to send it up
comprehensively, but in a generous spirit.
Willmott hooks his audience from the outset with the dashing opening. The
show begins very quietly as little groups of two and three filter on to the
stage in the dark to stand and wait, until the stage is filled with two
dozen silent people and the anticipation cannot be sustained any longer.
Then the remainder of the 30-strong cast bursts into the auditorium and
thunders down through the audience singing 'The Deadwood Stage' at full
throttle. From then on the pace is furious, the company putting everything
into a staging that is corny and camp, but never churlish.
The choreography, by the appropriately named Jack Gunn, is of the wide-eyed,
thigh-slapping, cheesy-grinning variety - Gunn must have raided every
musical on offer to pilfer every cliche in the book. The cast shuffles and
stomps, the girls do high kicks, the men in the bar move as one, like a
shoal of fish, while the stars leap onto furniture and pound up and down the
stairs. This is not a show for those with a nervous disposition or a passion
for subtlety.
At the centre of it all, Leigh McDonald holds her own in the Doris Day role
as a tremendously appealing Calamity Jane. A tough, chirpy little body, she
has a strong voice - a little breathless at times, but that is because she
throws herself into the part with such exhausting energy. She is nicely
matched by Michelle Bissell as the sweet and wholesome Katie Brown and Jason
Griffiths as the sly Mr Wild Bill Hickock.
There is no danger of any deep psychological interpretation of Calamity
Jane's insistence on dressing like a man and playing tough, indeed there is
no danger of any depth or subtlety at all. But, as Calamity would say, what
the heck. The Steam Industry is an interesting company, whose work ricochets
from the inspired to the dire, but this production is irresistible, pure
entertainment on a shoestring, and it generates enough energy to rival
Battersea power station in full swing.
At BAC, Battersea (071 223 2223).

FT  13 DEC 94 / Arts: The Valkyries ride at La Scala - Richard Fairman
reports from Milan on Riccardo Muti's opening production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The management of La Scala, Milan, will no doubt have been relieved that the
opening night of the season passed off so peacefully this year. The rumoured
student demonstration failed to materialise and the audience responded with
reasonable enthusiasm to the performance.
Some reports suggest that Riccardo Muti, the musical director, would be
happy to see the opening night ritual done away with altogether. While the
riot police are outside guarding the glittering audience, many of the
performers inside liken the atmosphere to being put on trial; the
unfortunate ones who fall from grace (including Pavarotti recently) finding
themselves on the receiving end of whistles and jeers.
The worst incidents have occurred on opening nights devoted to Verdi, La
Scala's presiding genius. Some resentment may have been caused by this
season's choice of opera - why Wagner when there were so many Italian
operas? - but in other respects Muti has found a good way of diffusing the
tension. Italian temperament does not burn on such a short fuse when the
opera is German.
There is another reason, too. Ironically, it is easier to cast a Wagner
opera well at the moment than it is one of the grand operas by Verdi. For
this new production of Die Walkure La Scala has assembled not one, but two
all-star casts, the first of which exhibited a high level of purely vocal
accomplishment on Saturday (like most people interested in the opera rather
than the occasion, I attended the second performance).
As Siegmund and Sieglinde, Placido Domingo and Waltraud Meier poured out a
stream of rich tone with no hint of strain or forcing. Domingo habitually
swallows his German consonants and Meier's Sieglinde was less exciting than
her famous Kundry, but at least they made a handsomely-sung couple. Matthias
Holle's menacing Hunding completed a strong trio for the opening act.
In the second cast Jane Eaglen will be making her La Scala debut as
Brunnhilde, but the first cast offers the well-tried and powerful Gabriele
Schnaut, wielding a laser-beam soprano which can jar on the nerves when it
is not exactly in tune. Monte Pederson has stepped into Wotan's shoes early
in his career and his youthful, carefully-contained baritone is still
growing to the right stature; his vocal reserves were waning fast some way
before the end. Marjana Lipovsek's Fricka was as sure as a rock (fortunate
as she was placed on a precipitous crag) and there was a strong band of
Valkyries, including Susan Anthony, Ruth Floeren and Penelope Walker.
Muti himself received widespread public acclaim, although his sleek Wagner
conducting might not go down well everywhere. The music sped through the
fast passages as though flying weightlessly, only to become becalmed when
the tempo had to slow; and it was strange that the excellent, apparently
well-rehearsed La Scala orchestra should have a brass section that could get
itself into such a pickle.
It is not clear yet what definite plans the company has for the other Ring
operas. If this Walkure is a one-off assignment, it will matter less that
Andre Engel's production showed so little inclination to get a grip on the
Ring's intellectual issues. The best course was to enjoy Nicky Rieti's
strangely alluring stage pictures and not trouble oneself asking why
Hunding's hut seemed to be an underground dwelling in the middle of a desert
or what Siegmund was doing wandering among a consignment of white duvets
(were they clouds?) before he died.
There was, however, one stunning coup de theatre. For the Ride of the
Valkyries four remarkably lifelike mechanical horses appeared at the back of
the stage, rearing their heads and galloping towards the audience in awesome
slow motion. Every staging of the Ring gets one of the special effects
right. It is just a shame one cannot collect them over the years and put
together a definitive production.

FT  13 DEC 94 / People: Succession settled at Schroders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER

<TEXT>
Schroders, the investment bank, announced yesterday that Win Bischoff, the
current chief executive, is to succeed George Mallinckrodt as chairman of
the group. Mallinkrodt has announced he will retire from the post next May
and become president. He will remain on the board.
Bischoff, seen as a driving force in strategy since his appointment as chief
executive in 1984, will be partnered by Peter Sedgwick, chief executive of
Schroder Investment Management, who will become vice-chairman.
Mallinckrodt, who is connected with the Schroder family through his marriage
to Charmaine Schroder, said yesterday that he had decided to retire as
chairman in order to allow others in the group to move up to senior
positions.
'People must have the opportunity to progress. You cannot have a chairman
who sits at the top until he is 80 and blocks people,' says Mallinckrodt,
64, who will maintain links with international clients as president.
Sedgwick, who has developed the bank's asset management arm into one of its
most valuable operations, will become vice chairman on January 1.
Mallinckrodt says he and Bischoff would form a 'partnership' at the helm of
the group. Jean Solandt, who heads treasury and trading, will become
chairman of J. Henry Schroder Wagg, the merchant bank, and chair the group
executive committee. William Slee and David Challen will be joint
vice-chairman of the merchant bank.
John Govett will become chairman of Schroder Investment Management, and Hugh
Bolland and David Salisbury will be joint chief executives of SIM. Andrew
Sykes is to succeed Jean Solandt as head of treasury and trading in London.
Mallinckrodt says the changes, on which he has been working with Bischoff
since last December, were meant to be 'as easy and evolutionary as possible'
and reflected the need for a broader management structure to reflect the
bank's growth.

Allied Leisure, the ten-pin bowling group, hopes to have ended a year of
boardroom upheavals with the appointments of Neil Goulden, as managing

Directors have been falling like skittles at Allied, which lost its chief
executive and other directors this year as it plunged into the red. In
September, it reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 30.1m for the 48 weeks to
June 19 after withdrawing from its nightclub businesses to refocus on its
ten-pin bowling operations.
Ken Scobie, who resigned as chief executive of Brent Walker in January 1993,
was appointed part-time chairman in September, replacing William Davis.
Damien Harte, appointed finance director just over a year ago, said
yesterday that Allied's management team is now complete. Goulden's major
task would be to consolidate the core bowling business and take it forward.
Goulden, 41, is currently chief executive at Letheby &amp; Christopher, the
division of Compass that specialises in sports and event catering. During
his six-year tenure, Letheby's turnover has doubled to Pounds 40m. His
20-year experience of the leisure industry includes stints with Ladbroke and
with Grand Metropolitan at the Chef &amp; Brewer and Berni Inns chains.
Bowling contributes less than half Allied's turnover, which is made up from
food and drink operations, and from video machines.
Molony, who was the longest serving member of the Rolls-Royce board when he
left in 1986, previously worked as finance director of Scottish &amp; Newcastle
Breweries and as Accountant General to the Post Office.

VCI, the video and audio publishing group which was floated on the London
Stock Exchange earlier this year, has appointed Michael Grade non-executive
chairman as from January 2.
As chief executive of Channel 4, Grade, a former director of programmes at
the BBC, is allowed to have two non-executive directorships. He is already a
non-executive of First Leisure Corporation.
Steve Ayres, at the moment both chairman and chief executive of the company,
is to give up the chairman's role to concentrate on being chief executive.
Ayres was a pioneer of the video 'sell-through' market in the UK - selling
rather than renting videos. The company has since moved on to include audio
tapes and is now experimenting with multi-media technology. VCI's stock
reached a new high of 160p on news of Grade's appointment, valuing the
company at more than Pounds 60m.

<TEXT>
Keith Jones, who has spent his entire career at IPC Magazines, is to become
chief executive of Reed Business Publishing next May when John Matthews, the
present chief executive, retires.
Jones, 38, who joined IPC, now part of the Reed Elsevier group, as a
graduate trainee in 1977, is at the moment managing director of the
specialist publishing group within IPC. Specialist publishing covers a total
of 40 titles and the portfolio includes sectors such as golf, fishing,
football, equestrianism and science.
Jones, who was chosen as Publisher of The Year in 1991 by the Periodical
Publishers Association, will become deputy chief executive of Reed Business
Publishing on January 1 in preparation for the hand-over.
Matthews has spent a long career with Reed Elsevier. He joined the printing
division of Odhams at Watford in 1962 and ultimately became managing
director. He transferred to IPC Magazines in 1984 and, following the
acquisition of Independent Television Publications by IPC Magazines, was
appointed managing director. He was also responsible for the launch of the
successful TV listings magazine What's on TV before becoming chief executive
of business publishing in 1992.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Banking on the ombudsman
 -Alison Smith on the extension of a complaints scheme to small firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The greatest pleasure, as described by Charles Lamb, the essayist, was
'doing a good action by stealth and having it found out by accident'.
This approach is less desirable when the ability to do the good action
depends to a large extent on publicity.
It is therefore unfortunate that the extension of the banking ombudsman
scheme to any complaints from small businesses as well as those from
personal customers has had such a low profile.
The report from the banking ombudsman for 1993-94, published last week,
marked the first time that the scheme has separated complaints made about
banks' behaviour by business customers from those made by personal account
users.
Sole traders, partners and unincorporated companies have been able to have
their complaints heard by the ombudsman since the scheme first started in
1986.
But only since January last year has the scope been extended to limited
companies which have an annual turnover of up to Pounds 1m. The ombudsman
can only take up complaints after banks' internal procedures for addressing
grievances have been exhausted. It is therefore really only this year that
the extension has had much impact.
Some small business groups had hoped that businesses which already had
access to the ombudsman might also come forward with their grievances. But
since the new new role has gained little coverage such businesses have not
been encouraged to air their views.
Despite the lack of publicity, the report revealed that more than 1,700
complaints to the ombudsman related to business - about one in five of the
total 8,700 complaints received in the year to the end of September.
This is an increase of about five per cent on the proportion they
represented in the previous year's report.
Laurence Shurman, the ombudsman, expects the number to rise gradually, as
the business dimension to the scheme becomes better-established. 'It takes a
while for things to pick up,' he says.
At the same time, he believes there will be fewer cases reaching the
ombudsman as banks show themselves increasingly ready to resolve business
complaints.
This is, he believes, partly because business customers often have more
leverage with the banks than do the personal customers.
'Where a complaint relates to a very modest personal account there is less
room for profit. But where a bank is hoping to profit from a business that
complains, it may decide that even if it doesn't agree in this particular
instance, it makes good commercial sense to go along with it.'
Nonetheless, the ombudsman does not rely heavily on this possibility where
small businesses are involved.
Shurman instead has called for the voluntary code of banking practice to be
extended to small businesses.
It is therefore uncertain whether they would welcome any extension of the
code, which will not be issued in a revised form again until 1997.
Shurman may have to demonstrate the advantages that have followed from the
extension of his own role to small businesses, if an extension of the code
is to occur.
John Parsons, chairman of the Confedertion of British Industry's small
companies panel, says anecdotal evidence suggests there has been no major
impact. Even so, he is clear that the move is worthwhile.
'If you're running a growing business and you have a complaint against a
bank, you may well not have the resources to deal with it yourself,' hesays.
'But businesses ought to be more aware of the scheme.'

The UK's Customs and Excise is introducing a new procedure aimed at
streamlining imports and export procedures.
Instead of checking for fiscal and regulatory matters at frontiers, Customs
officers will move surveillance to importers' and exporters' premises, which
will be visited sporadically.
This, Customs and Excise says, will save time for traders who develop a
record of complying with the filing requirements. The first companies to be
covered by the new system will be included in a pilot system to be
introduced in 1996.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Italian investment in
Yorkshire company - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italians are coming to Pudsey, West Yorkshire. A new joint venture
between two of Italy's oldest families - Benetton and Bonomi - has made its
first development capital investment in the glass bottle mould manufacturer,
Johnson Radley.
The Pounds 13.5m deal, mainly funded by Charterhouse Development Capital,
will be the first move for the new venture, called 21 Invest, according to
Andrea Bonomi, who will be its managing director.
Bonomi says the two families will each invest about Pounds 10m in deals over
the next two years through 21 Invest. He says the group will try to
differentiate itself from some other private equity investors by helping
companies to grow and will not simply make financial investments.
In the case of the first deal, Johnson Radley will be able to invest in new
capacity to overcome current constraints on production. The company already
has about half the UK market and exports half its Pounds 15m turnover.
21 Invest pipped local venture capital houses to the Johnson Radley deal
after making contact through the packaging interests of Invest, the Bonomi
family investment company.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Uncertain road - Richard
Gourlay on the rare case of a company that sought protection by calling in
the administrator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This time last year Paddy Hopkirk was on a roll. His Bedfordshire company,
which makes cycle racks and other car accessories, was expecting big new
orders from Germany. He was introducing new Japanese production techniques
that invigorated his workforce and led to productivity improvements. And
after some loss-making years, the former Monte Carlo rally driver felt his
company was back on the road.
That optimism has now evaporated. Last month, Paddy Hopkirk Ltd received
court approval for the appointment of administrators. As sales failed to
materialise and overheads ballooned, the company faced a cash crisis and the
prospect that the directors risked trading while insolvent.
'You do not take this decision lightly,' says Hopkirk, the majority
shareholder, who having injected fresh equity in recent years this time was
advised not to provide his personal guarantee.
'But it is the only way of protecting the business.'
The administrators, Leonard Curtis, say the core business is sound. They say
they are confident that potential investors from continental Europe might
want to buy the Paddy Hopkirk name and manufacturing base as a cheap way
into the UK car accessory market.
But as potential buyers troop around the factory in front of a worried
workforce, this relatively happy outcome is far from certain.
It could have been a lot worse. It is still rare for insolvent companies to
go into administration, the UK procedure that accountants say provides most
protection for a business while it tries to agree restructuring or an
arrangement with creditors.
So far this year about 20,000 companies have gone directly into liquidation,
many of them small companies with few assets worth retrieving. Only about
2,000 companies have gone into receivership and there have been fewer than
200 appointments of administrators, according to figures compiled from the
DTI and accounting firms.
What is more, it is almost impossible to enter a Company Voluntary
Arrangement (CVA), which also confers protection on the business's assets,
without going through the expensive procedure of applying to a court for
administration first.
Figures like these and the failure of CVAs to live up to expectations since
they were introduced in 1986, have prompted the Department of Trade and
Industry to improve insolvency procedures and encourage what the chancellor
called a 'rescue culture' in his November Budget. The government plans to
introduce a 28-day moratorium for all parties to allow insolvent companies
time to reach voluntary arrangements with creditors.
The government's case - challenged by some in the insolvency profession - is
that too many businesses are closed by their creditors before all rescue
options have been explored. This debate gives the Paddy Hopkirk
administration significance beyond the question of whether its business can
be saved. The 28-day moratorium could work as a similar, but cheaper version
of administration.
The attitude of the banks will remain crucial. Hopkirk's bank, Northern Bank
of Northern Ireland, had fixed and floating charges over the company's
assets. It was therefore in a position to put the company directly into
receivership.
Jeff Jones, the administrator for Leonard Curtis, says the bank chose to
accept his firm's plan for administration, acting with a degree of integrity
sometimes not shown by creditor banks.
The problems at Hopkirk may be familiar to a large number of companies that
have not tipped over the edge into insolvency. The company had focused
considerable management time on improving the productivity of its
manufacturing processes. Late last year it had called in the services of
consultants from the Kaizen Institute who were trying to introduce ideas of
continuous improvement and the notion that the workforce is the best source
of ideas on improving productivity (see Management page, January 4).
Hopkirk admits that while there was so much focus on the shop floor,
management's attention might have wandered from more pressing issues
elsewhere. Despite good computers and software, the board lacked a clear
idea of its cost of materials and the gross margin made on its six basic
products.
'We thought we knew how much the products were costing us but in hindsight
we got it wrong,' says Hopkirk. 'In manufacturing that is very common.'
There was also the over-optimism of some managers, who have now left, who
had rapidly expanded the workforce and overhead base to cope with sales that
did not materialise. 'They had the overheads for a Pounds 10m plus business
rather than a Pounds 6m business (the actual sales level last year),' Jones
says.
The company was also 'chasing sales', he says. 'They had a good core product
but they seemed to expand into hundreds of variations to satisfy complicated
orders that damaged the core business.'
The company believes that many of the financial control problems of six
months ago have been addressed.
Some of the least viable product lines have been suspended or closed. And
the workforce has been reduced from a peak of more than 160 to 83 - a level
below which Jones believes he will not need to go. But the company is at the
point of its year when cash is most squeezed - its sales of car bicycle
racks, for example, are greatest in the summer and yet it has to build for
stock now.
Hopkirk tried to raise extra capital from an investor but when this did not
materialise, he got in touch through his auditors with the administrators.
Jones says Hopkirk's decisive early approach to the administrators after the
refinancing fell through was not only valuable for the business but also
unusual.
'We were introduced to the business at a sufficiently early stage that
allowed steps to be taken to secure the business to give it an opportunity
to protect its future,' says Jones.
That future remains as uncertain as the proposition that a 28-day moratorium
will improve insolvency procedures. But Hopkirk, who has a strong sense of
loyalty to his workforce, may have taken the best steps to ensure part of
his business survives, if not his company.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Business and the Law: A policy in disarray - Robert Rice on
the UK government's attitude to competition and deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two weeks ago, UK competition policy looked in total disarray. Sir Bryan
Carsberg, director general of the Office of Fair Trading, had just announced
that he was to step down early as head of the UK's competition watchdog.
The known preference of Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
for industrial policy over competition policy had driven away the last
advocate of a strong consumerist approach to competition policy.
At the same time, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission which, under the
chairmanship of Mr Graeme Odgers, a former industrialist, stands 'four
square' with Mr Heseltine's views on privatisation, competitiveness and
deregulation, had little to do.
Suddenly, however, a flurry of activity has led some observers to suggest
that reports of the death of competition policy are greatly exaggerated.
Both the GEC and British Aerospace bids for VSEL, the UK submarine maker,
have been referred to the MMC, as has the Performing Rights Society over its
handling of royalties for composers and song writers. The proposed Halifax
and Leeds building societies merger may also be referred.
Mr Bill Bishop of Lexecon, the economic consultancy, says: 'Two weeks ago
you could have said 'Heseltinisation' resulted in non-statutory abolition of
competition policy - but you can't say that now.'
Others argue it is too early to talk about a revival of competition policy.
They feel the VSEL case could be a one-off.
At first sight, the decision to refer the bids sits oddly with Mr
Heseltine's relaxation of policy to help create strong UK champions capable
of competing globally. The City was certainly taken by surprise and VSEL's
share price fell sharply on the news from Pounds 15.35 to Pounds 13.35.
His decision was also unusual. The GEC bid was referred on competition
grounds, because GEC already owns the other large warship yard at Yarrow on
the Clyde. But the BAe bid raised no competition issues. It was referred
because of issues of 'public interest involving national security'.
Since the introduction in 1984 of the so-called 'Tebbit doctrine', which
made competition the primary criterion of merger reference policy, no other
bid by a British company has been referred to the MMC on non-competition
grounds.
If it had not been for Treasury pressure on Mr Heseltine to preserve an
element of competition in this area of defence procurement, he would almost
certainly have cleared both bids, despite the OFT recommendation that the
GEC bid be referred on competition grounds.
Having bowed to Treasury pressure on the GEC bid, however, the BAe referral
can only have been for political expediency, particularly as it contradicts
stated DTI policy of not referring just to level the playing field between
rival bidders. The most recent example of that policy at work was the 1992
battle for Midland Bank where Lloyds Bank's bid was referred but Hongkong
and Shanghai Banking Corporation's was not.
The uniqueness of the VSEL case - in terms of industry and political
considerations - makes it difficult to conclude the DTI is showing sudden
renewed interest in competition policy. Most signs still point to Mr
Heseltine's continuing lack of interest in competition policy. Sir Bryan
appears to accept he failed to nudge the DTI or MMC towards a more
consumerist approach. His belief that markets should be free of
anti-competitive restraints unless patently of benefit to the consumer has
been rejected by a succession of MMC reports on fine fragrances, ice-cream
and recorded music.
Since the MMC cleared the record industry in the summer of acting together
to keep the price of compact discs in Britain artificially high, he has not
recommended the referral of any cases involving vertical restraints to the
MMC.
The government has also been relaxed to the point of indifference about
acting on competition concerns raised C reports.
In August, Mr Neil Hamilton, then corporate affairs minister, announced
after long delays that the government was implementing three MMC reports.
The report on London exhibition halls would be implemented after the
failure, after eight months of negotiations, to secure satisfactory
undertakings from five electrical companies which enjoyed a complex monopoly
giving exhibitors no say in buying electrical services.
He also announced that he had accepted statutory undertakings from Mainline
Group, formerly South Yorkshire Transport, to remedy the anti-competitive
effects of its 1989 acquisitions of four rival Sheffield bus companies.
Both MMC reports were published in 1990. Although the subject of court
challenges, these had been dealt with by the end of 1992.
The government has also finally accepted undertakings from Stagecoach
Holdings, the bus company, which followed the MMC's 1990 report on its
acquisition of Formia, an East Sussex bus company.
Other MMC reports remain unimplemented more than a year after publication.
Satisfactory undertakings have still not been negotiated with Prosper de
Mulder, the leading UK animal waste rendering company, more than a year
after the MMC suggested measures to prevent further breaches of undertakings
given by the company in 1986 and to curb discriminatory pricing.
The apparent inability of the OFT to tackle abuses of market power when
confronted with red-blooded monopolists sends the wrong signals about
anti-competitive behaviour to UK companies, competition lawyers argue. It
also suggests British competition law badly needs reform. The government's
decision last year to retreat from radical changes to the rules on abuses of
market power may have pleased the industry lobby which opposed the prospect
of heavy fines for practices such as deliberately pricing goods too cheaply,
but it is looking indefensible, these lawyers add. .
Reform of restrictive trade practices legislation - which would bring the UK
more closely into line with Europe by prohibiting anti-competitive
agreements, such as price fixing cartels, and make companies liable to heavy
fines for breaches of the law - was first promised in 1987.
In January Sir Bryan criticised the government for not including the reforms
in this year's DereguLation Act. Welcoming articles to reduce the burdens on
industry of competition law, he said reform of the law on anti-competitive
agreements would have 'reduced the burdens on business generally while also
creating a more effective protection of competition'.
The government's failure to include the reforms in this year's Queen's
Speech is thought to have been decisive in Sir Bryan's decision to resign
from the OFT.
By failing to take action on competition law reform the UK is also becoming
isolated in Europe, many competition lawyers believe. A project is under way
in Brussels to see how decision-making under EU competition laws - article
85 of the Rome treaty on anti-competitive agreements and article 86 on abuse
of market power - can be shared with member states.
Articles 85 and 86 are already directly applicable in the UK when
inter-state trade is affected, so British industry cannot ignore the EU
regime. But with the exception of the Dutch, who are moving towards a system
based on articles 85 and 86, Britain is now the only EU member state without
a regime based on prohibition of anti-competitive practices backed by a
system of fines.
Decentralisation of decision-making requires convergence of competition
rules in Europe. Mr Christopher Bright, a partner in Linklaters &amp; Paines,
the international law firm, says: 'There is no doubt Brussels is very uneasy
about UK case handling.' But European competition law is also in a state of
flux. Mr Bright says there is controversy over the expansive nature of
article 85, which prohibits many agreements with no significant
anti-competitive effect unless the Commission grants a specific exemption.
Some European Commission officials indicate the case-by-case approach of the
US under the Sherman Act might be preferable.
These issues are important to UK businesses. But by remaining on the fringes
there is a danger Britain will be unable to influence the outcome of these
deliberations.
Whitehall rumours say the issue of restrictive trade practices law reform
may not be dead after all. Whether the government was shocked by Sir Bryan's
resignation into reviving the idea is not clear. But what is apparent is
that UK competition policy remains in disarray.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Technology: The weapons of a killer - The search for what
causes cancer has thrown up hundreds of suspects, from smoking to driving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Advice for avoiding cancer: Don't smoke. Hide from the sun. Eat fruit and
vegetables. Join the upper classes. Employ a chauffeur and don't look out of
the car window.
Epidemiologists estimate 75-80 per cent of all cancers are preventable, in
the sense that they are triggered by features of the individual's lifestyle
and environment. The problem is identifying the avoidable risks. A few are
well known and easy to act on; much the most obvious example is smoking.
Most risks, however, are less well defined and harder to avoid. For
instance, cancer as a whole is more common - and more likely to be fatal -
among the 'lower' social classes. This is true even when the statistics are
adjusted to take account of all known risk factors such as smoking, diet and
access to health care.
Researchers are coming to the conclusion that there is something
intrinsically unhealthy about being near the bottom of the social pecking
order, even if you follow the rules for healthy living. Sally Macintyre,
director of the Medical Research Council's Medical Sociology Unit in
Glasgow, says the mechanism of this effect is far from clear, though it
appears that 'repeated psycho-social stress' somehow depresses the immune
system.
Hundreds of different risk factors have been suggested for cancer - some of
them an inextricable part of modern life. For example, Australian research
has shown a statistical correlation between driving and cancer. The theory
is that the brain responds to moving surroundings by priming the body
chemically for movement that never takes place; the resulting chemical
imbalance may trigger cancers. More concern has been expressed about
man-made hormones, particularly in the contraceptive pill. Clinical studies
involving tens of thousands of women have shown no general increase in
cancer among long-term pill users, though some groups may be at slightly
greater risk of developing breast or cervical cancer.
But epidemiologists say people should not be too concerned about minor or
speculative causes of cancer, when smoking and poor diet are so much more
important.
'One of the biggest myths in recent years is that there is a cancer epidemic
caused by exposure to radiation, pollution, pesticides and food additives,'
says Sir Richard Doll of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund's cancer studies
unit in Oxford. 'These factors have very little to do with the majority of
cancers.'
Epidemiologists are confident tobacco is implicated in about 30 per cent of
cancer deaths in Europe and North America. They are far less sure about food
and drink; a typical estimate is that diet is involved in 35 per cent of
cancer deaths.
Because there can be a delay of several decades between starting to smoke
and the onset of disease, the big rise in lung cancer did not begin until
the 1940s among men and the 1970s among women (see chart). The male lung
cancer rate is falling in countries such as the US and UK where large
numbers of men gave up smoking in the 1960s and 1970s, but it is rising
throughout the developing world. Female lung cancer rates are increasing
everywhere.
Although lung cancer is the most obvious effect of smoking, 12 other cancers
are linked to the habit, as well as cardiovascular and other diseases.
However, if an individual smoker gives up before becoming ill, he or she can
avoid most of the risk of dying from tobacco. Ten years after stopping, half
of the smoker's additional cancer risk will have disappeared.
In contrast to smoking and lung cancer, there is no cancer epidemic clearly
linked to changing diet. On the contrary, the most striking trend is the
long-term decline in stomach cancer in Europe and North America - a fall
widely attributed to modern methods of food preservation and storage which
prevent the formation of carcinogenic decay products.
Although colo-rectal cancer rates have remained steady for several decades
in the west, those in Japan have risen rapidly to European levels - probably
because the Japanese diet has become westernised with more meat and fat
eaten.
Epidemiologists say there is overwhelming evidence that a diet rich in fruit
and vegetables reduces the risk of cancer. But they do not know how the
protective effect works.
A favourite scientific theory is that anti-oxidant nutrients, such as
vitamins E and C and beta-carotene, play a protective role by scavenging
'free radicals' which can damage a cell's genetic material. Food supplements
containing these nutrients have become very popular. as a result, although
there is not yet conclusive clinical evidence to prove their effectiveness.
The next stage, according to speakers at the UK Biochemical Society
Conference this week, will be genetic engineering of crops to make more of
these protective nutrients. Catherine Rice-Evans, a biochemistry professor
at Guy's Hospital, London, predicts: 'The introduction of plants that have
been manipulated to produce more effective anti-oxidants should be possible
within five years.'

FT  13 DEC 94 / Technology: Cancer risks from radiation exposure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Radiation is responsible for about 3 per cent of cancer deaths. The vast
majority result from natural sources: radon gas in the air; radioactive
minerals in rocks and soil; cosmic rays from outer space; and ultraviolet
radiation from the sun.
Exposure to man-made radiation has fallen substantially over the past 30
years - mainly because regulatory authorities have responded to scientists
such as Alice Stewart of Birmingham University, who showed that the risks of
low-level radiation were greater than anyone realised during the golden dawn
of the nuclear age in the 1940s and 1950s.
Medical X-rays deliver far smaller doses than they used to, and the nuclear
industry has cut the radiation exposure of its own workforce and of the
general public through discharges into the environment.
Now, natural radiation is becoming increasingly controversial. The most
significant natural source is a radon, a radioactive gas that occurs at
elevated levels in some parts of the world (such as Devon and Cornwall in
England and the Appalachian Mountains in the US).
On the basis of studies of uranium miners exposed to very high radon levels,
the US Environmental Protection Agency and UK National Radiological
Protection Board have estimated that indoor radon is responsible for about
14,000 lung cancer deaths a year in the US and 2,000 in the UK - making
radon the main cause of lung cancer after smoking. They are therefore
running expensive campaigns to identify houses with highest radon levels and
alter their foundations and floors to keep the gas out. But some critics
dispute the evidence that domestic radon is causing so much cancer.
The ultraviolet rays that beat down on us from the sun have a quite
different effect on the body. Whereas the 'ionising radiation' from
radioactive materials causes internal cancers, the sun's impact is on the
skin. Cases of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, are currently
increasing by about 4 per cent a year in Europe and north America - a direct
consequence of the growing popularity of sunbathing and outdoor pursuits.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Technology: Drugs to tackle infections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some microscopic bacteria and viruses are carcinogenic. Infections may
account for 10-15 per cent of all cancers, according to epidemiologists at
the Imperial Cancer Research Fund.
Five kinds of germ have been identified as possible cancer triggers:
Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium which survives in the stomach. It
irritates the stomach lining which may respond with ulcers or cancer.
Epstein-Barr virus is associated with Burkitt's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal
carcinoma, cancers more common in central Africa and China respectively than
in the west. EBV may be linked to cancer in people with suppressed immune
systems, perhaps after an organ transplant.
Human Papilloma virus (HPV) causes genital warts. Some sub-types have been
linked to cervical and vaginal cancers.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) survives for long periods in about 10 per cent of
the population, who are then at increased risk from liver disease, including
cancer.
Human T-cell Lymphotropic viruses (HTLV) have been implicated in leukaemia
in some populations such as Japan.
In principle, antibiotics and vaccines can beat these infections.
There are several hepatitis B vaccines on the market. Biotechnology
companies, including Isis in the US and Cantab in the UK, and the UK's
Cancer Research Campaign, are developing better HBV vaccines. The CRC says
its vaccine might even help patients already with cancer. Work is being done
too on broad spectrum antiviral drugs. California's Gilead has a material
which shows promise against EBV and HPV. And an industry is growing up
around H pylori. Diagnostics companies are launching saliva tests to replace
blood or tissue analysis, and Swedish drug company Astra this year won UK
approval for an antibiotic-based ulcer treatment.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Business and The Law: Ruling on single shipping action in
two courts - The European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week, the European Court of Justice gave a ruling in response to
several questions, referred to it by the English Court of Appeal, regarding
jurisdiction in shipping cases under the Brussels Convention on Jurisdiction
and Judgments where the same action is pending before two different courts.
The questions arose in the context of actions concerning a cargo of soya
bean oil, which the owners complained was contaminated on the vessel Tatry
en route from Brazil to Rotterdam and Hamburg.
Actions were brought by the shipowners and cargo owners at different times
in UK and Dutch courts. In November 1988 the shipowners brought an action in
the Rotterdam district court against two of three groups of cargo owners
seeking a declaration that they were not liable. In September 1989 the
shipowners initiated separate but similar proceedings against the third
group in Rotterdam.
Finally, in October 1990 they initiated proceedings in the Netherlands
seeking to limit their liability in respect of the entire cargo under the
1957 International Convention on limitation of shipowner liability.
Two actions to arrest one of the shipowners' vessels were brought in
Liverpool by two of the cargo owner groups, but writs were not issued until
September 1989. The shipowners secured release of their vessel by providing
a guarantee. The action continued under English law, where doubts exist
whether such proceedings continue only against the ship (in rem) or both
against the ship and against the shipowners for damages (in personam). The
English Admiralty Court acted under the 1981 Supreme Court Act which
implements the 1952 Brussels Arrest Convention.
Later precautionary actions were brought by the two cargo owner groups in
the Netherlands. The third group only brought an action for damages in
September 1989 in the Netherlands.
The Admiralty Court refused to decline jurisdiction under the rules
governing situations where the same action is pending in different courts.
It said the previous Dutch proceedings did not involve the same cause of
action, since damages were sought in the English proceedings. The earlier
Dutch proceedings merely sought a declaration that the cargo owners were not
entitled to claim damages from the shipowners. Moreover, one of the cargo
owners was not a party to the Dutch proceedings. The Admiralty Court
accepted that the two proceedings were related actions, but found it
inappropriate to decline jurisdiction.
The ECJ ruled first that a specialised convention, such as the 1952 Arrest
Convention, precluded the application of the Brussels Jurisdiction
Convention only in cases governed by the specialised convention. When it
contained no provision as to what should happen when the same cause of
action was pending in separate courts, the Brussels Convention applied.
The Court said an action seeking to have the defendant held liable for
damages had the same cause of action and the same object as earlier
proceedings brought by the defendant seeking a decla-ration that he was not
liable for damages.
Distinctions in English law between actions in rem and in personam were
irrelevant to the interpretation of the convention.
Where two courts claimed jurisdiction over a similar action, the second
national court to consider the case should decline jurisdiction in favour of
the first court. When not all the parties are the same, it should decline
jurisdiction only to the extent the parties to the second action are the
same as the parties to the earlier action. The second action could continue
between the other parties.
However, the ECJ ruled that in this context the two actions will be related
actions involving the risk of conflicting decisions. It said the risk of
conflicting decisions would arise when two separate groups of actions for
damages were brought by different cargo owners in two different national
courts against the same shipowner under separate but identical contracts.

FT  13 DEC 94 / OFT post turns into a competition headache: Robert Rice
surveys the list of likely candidates to meet the challenges as head of the
Office of Fair Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the preference for industrial policy over competition policy expressed
by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, finding a
successor to Sir Bryan Carsberg as chief of the UK's competition watchdog
will not be easy.
As one economic consultant put it last week: 'It's a bit like trying to
appoint a bishop when the archbishop doesn't believe in God.'
Many observers feel that Sir Bryan's consumerist approach to competition
policy as head of the Office of Fair Trading set him on a collision course
with Mr Heseltine. Ultimately their difference of approach made his position
untenable.
His successor must live with the knowledge that Sir Bryan found the lack of
any real power too frustrating. Few will relish the prospect of ploughing
the same barren furrow.
In the light of Sir Bryan's experience the qualities required for the job
are also not easy to define. Mr Stephen Locke, director of policy at the
Consumers' Association, which has been critical of the UK competition
authorities in recent years, believes independence is the main requirement.
He said: 'It must be someone who sees it as a vital part of the job to
protect consumers' interests - someone who is not frightened to stand up to
awkward politicians or producer lobbies.'
Sir Gordon Borrie, Sir Bryan's predecessor who served 16 years at the OFT,
also listed independence as the chief quality required. He highlighted the
need for a questioning mind, the ability to make a strong case - to the
public, the Department of Trade and Industry or the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission - and leadership qualities.
The DTI's hint that it would be looking for someone with regulatory
experience puts the utility regulators in the frame. Ms Clare Spottiswoode
at gas, Mr Donald Cruickshank at telecommunications and Mr John Swift at
rail are all relatively new to their jobs and most observers think they are
unlikely candidates. That leaves Professor Stephen Littlechild, the
electricity regulator, and Mr Ian Byatt, at water.
Opinion seems equally divided on their suitability. Both recently completed
industry reviews and have several years of regulatory experience.
Prof Littlechild, a former economics professor at Birmingham University, has
served on the MMC where he was extremely non-interventionist. This approach
might appeal to Mr Heseltine, but his appointment would cause an uproar
among the consumer lobby which might prove politically unpalatable for the
government.
Some observers believe Prof Littlechild would not accept the job anyway. He
enjoys Offer, where he has real power, and may be unwilling to give it up
for the OFT after witnessing Sir Bryan's frustration. He has also just been
re-appointed for a second five-year term.
Mr Byatt is seen by many as a safer bet. As a former civil servant - he was
deputy chief economic adviser at the Treasury - he is used to the Whitehall
machine. If it is accepted that the director-general's job is less
'independent' under Mr Heseltine than in the past, he might be the ideal
candidate. It is also widely thought that he finds the water job dull.
But his appointment would also anger the consumer lobby, which feels he was
too soft on the water companies and their shareholders in the recent water
prices review. Some observers believe he does not have broad enough
experience for the OFT job.
Of the accountants and lawyers who might be suitable the name of Ms Sheila
Masters, a partner at KPMG Peat Marwick, crops up frequently. She is a
member of the private finance panel, the Inland Revenue Management Board and
the NHS Policy Board. She has advised the Treasury on privatisation and
between 1988-1991 she was seconded to the Department of Health as director
of finance on the NHS Management Executive.
Among lawyers, Prof Richard Whish's name is mentioned by several observers
as a possible candidate. A partner of City solicitors Watson Farley &amp;
Williams, he is the author of a standard competition law textbook and highly
regarded.
At the Bar, Mr Jeremy Lever QC, the deputy warden of All Souls College,
Oxford, has a good reputation but at 61 is thought by some to be too old. Mr
Steven Richards is frequently mentioned, but as a junior Treasury counsel is
widely tipped for a High Court appointment. Mr Thomas Sharpe QC, a former
competition law lecturer at Wolfson College, Oxford, is also seen as a
possible candidate.
Numerous economists are suggested, but three names stand out - Mr Derek
Morris, the macro-economist in charge of Oxford economic forecasting and a
former MMC member; Prof Martin Cave, dean of the faculty of social sciences
at Brunel University, who is seen as one of the great privatisation gurus;
and Professor John Kay, head of the centre for business strategy at the
London Business School.
In many ways Prof Kay seems the ideal candidate - a highly respected
micro-economist who was director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies for
seven years before leaving to set up the centre for business strategy in
1986.
Under his leadership the IFS took an interest not only in tax reform but
also in the benefits system, pensions and competition policy.
He is not an unquestioning believer in privatisation, saying that effective
competition is more important as a means of improving efficiency and levels
of service than simply moving an organisation from the public to the private
sector.
But his approach would differ from that of Sir Bryan. He takes issue with
Sir Bryan over his opposition to restrictive distribution agreements. Prof
Kay says they are often essential if manufacturers are to add value to their
products - the MMC reached the same conclusion in its recent report on fine
fragrances.
The main question mark over his candidature is whether he could be persuaded
to do the job. It is widely believed that he was offered it three years ago,
before Sir Bryan, but that he turned it down because he could not persuade
the government to give the OFT greater independence with Next Steps agency
status.
If the government is keen to demonstrate the OFT's independence rather than
just paying lip service to it, Mr Heseltine could do worse than give it
agency status and appoint Prof Kay.

FT  13 DEC 94 / George Michael denied speedy appeal hearing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The pop star George Michael yesterday suffered a further blow in his legal
battle to free himself of his contract with Sony, the record company.
The singer had applied for a speedy hearing of his appeal against Mr Justice
Jonathan Parker's ruling in June that he should stand by the contract he
signed with Sony in 1988.
Sir Thomas Bingham, the Master of the Rolls, said yesterday that Mr
Michael's lawyers had 'failed to come anywhere close' to showing that his
case had the urgency required to enable him to jump the long queue of other
pending appeals.
Sir Thomas, sitting with Lord Justice Hoffman and Lord Justice Waite, said
Mr Michael had to wait until February 1996 before the courts would hear the
latest round of his multi-million pound action.
Mr Charles Gray QC, for Mr Michael, had told the judges the case was urgent
and the singer was 'horrified' by the prospect of long delays.
Mr Gray said that Mr Justice Parker's ruling meant the singer was tied to
Sony until 2003 - and 'probably longer' - but that as he was genuinely
unable to work for the company, his recording and musical career were
frozen. Mr Michael's career was becoming 'a wasting asset'.
He added that Mr Michael's last two albums had made gross profits of Pounds
60m, the lion's share of which had gone to Sony. 'Millions and millions of
people all over the world listen to this man's music. There is deprivation
over a huge field.'
Concern in the industry about the implications of the case also justified
the appeal being heard quickly, he said.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Mortality up in northern areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Death rates for some age groups in the poorest areas of northern England
have risen for the first time since the 1930s, according to a study into
inequalities in health.
The research highlights a widening gap between affluent and poor areas of
north-east England and Cumbria in the 1980s.
It shows the health and mortality record improving for the wealthiest, but
deteriorating for the poorest.
The study is based on detailed analysis of health and mortality records in
all 678 wards of north-east England and Cumbria from the 1981 to 1991. It
shows that in the most deprived 20 per cent of wards the death rate rose for
the first time in 50 years for men aged 15 to 44 and women aged 65 to 74.
It also indicates a rise in low weight births (below 2.5 kg) in the poorest
areas.
The report says that with the social and economic changes of the 1980s it
should not be a surprise that the population's health echoes economic
indicators which point to growing polarisation between the fortunes of the
affluent and the poor.
It says mass redundancies and a contraction of employment opportunities due
to steady industrial decline in the region in the first half of the 1980s
left a legacy of very high long-term unemployment, which was compounded in
the second half of the decade by cuts in state benefits.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Business backs urban initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBYN CHALMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government will press ahead with its drive to revitalise urban centres
following a solid endorsement for its quality initiative from business
leaders yesterday.
The government launched its Quality in Town and Country initiative in July
with the publication of a discussion document and invited interested parties
to comment.
Mr Paul Murrain of Oxford Brookes University, who assisted in compiling the
response document, said that about 95 per cent of the respondents thought
the government's quality initiative was valuable.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said yesterday at a symposium
organised to consider the results of the document that the response had
stiffened his resolve to continue with the initiative.
He committed the government to promoting a proper mix of uses in
development, taking action to increase transport choice, advancing town
centre management in general and discussing how and when design should be
addressed in the planning system.
Mr Gummer added that the quality initiative would be applied in developing a
new vision for the River Thames.
A study to identify the development potential of the banks of the Thames was
under way, and he would publish a new strategic planning guidance for the
river in the new year.
Mr Roy Swanston, president of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors,
said there was a close correlation between the degree to which towns had
maintained the quality of their townscape and their economic fortunes.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Teleworking gets muted response
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Top managers like the idea of the 'information superhighway' but are far
from enthusiastic about some of the services that it is expected to pioneer,
a survey by James R Adams and Associates, a London-based consultancy, shows.
There was little enthusiasm for teleworking - working from home using a
personal computer connected by telephone to the office - in the survey of
100 managers chosen from the UK's top 1,000 companies.
Two-thirds of the sample said they would not be able to do their jobs from
home. 'Nor would they want to, even if they could,' the survey says. 'Most
of these attitudes stemmed from benevolent feelings towards the workplace,
largely of a social nature. The most attractive aspect of working from home
was to avoid commuting.'
Most of the respondents believed that the superhighway would be beneficial
for their companies. A quarter of those answering thought it would do a
'great deal of good' and a third 'some good'.
Home shopping received a muted response because of the perceived costs of
distribution.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Computer highway wins first customer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 40m commercial information superhighway carried by electricity
pylons and existing underground cables announced its first customer
yesterday - a live network for training keyhole surgeons remotely from
operating theatres in St James's Hospital in Leeds, Ian Hamilton Fazey
writes.
Torch Telecom, a joint venture between Yorkshire Electricity and Kingston
Communications, said the technology was capable of transmitting engineering
or textile designs, high-quality faxes, thousands of telephone calls or
large amounts of computer data.
The network - being marketed to business and big public-sector customers -
is developed around what Torch calls a 'backbone ring' linking Leeds,
Wakefield, Huddersfield, Halifax and Bradford in West Yorkshire. Secondary
circuits will allow local access throughout Leeds, Bradford, Sheffield and
Hull.
Video-link medical applications of fibre optics elsewhere use the telephone
network. Torch said its system had a bandwidth capacity of 155 megabits per
second - compared with 2Mbit/s using upgraded telephone lines - giving
better pictures or more reliable data transmission.
The keyhole surgery system, which has been on trial for three months, will
soon be improved to 622 Mbit/s, allowing 12 operations to be transmitted
simultaneously from the hospital to the Leeds Institute for Minimally
Invasive Therapy.
As well as enabling trainees to see better, voice links allow them to
communicate with surgeons as though everyone was in the operating theatre.
Torch said its network would improve inward investment prospects by
improving the business communications infrastructure and helping
locally-based companies reduce costs.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Report urges steps to end benefit fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER, Employment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong measures to prevent benefit fraud have been advocated by Mr Frank
Field, the Labour MP, in an effort to advance the debate on unemployment,
which he says is 'dominated by ideologues of left and right'.
He has published a report which 'rejects the Conservatives' tinkering with
benefits and calls for a totally new approach to welfare: one that aims to
reduce the numbers on welfare rather than punish those forced to depend on
it'.
Mr Field, who chairs the Commons committee on social security, has written
the report with Mr Matthew Owen, a Liberal Democrat economist.
The document, funded by Nuffield Foundation, says:
Claimants suspected of defrauding the public should be required to register
on a number of occasions each day with their local Jobcentre to ensure that
they are undertaking adequate job searches and are maintaining and upgrading
their skills.
Employers should have to register all long-term openings with the employment
service so that claimants can be offered real jobs before losing their
benefits.
Taxpayers will need to fund an employment service adequate to meet the
challenge of a flexible labour market where continuing education is a basic
requirement for all workers, no less for those in work than those in the
dole queue.
Government must wipe out benefit fraud as a start to building the
foundations for full employability in Britain.
Government must start viewing training schemes as opportunities for
self-improvement and the betterment of claimants - and not as a means of
punishing them.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Howard defends jail chief's bonus
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, yesterday defended a Pounds 35,000
bonus paid to Mr Derek Lewis, head of the prison service, rejecting
suggestions that it was 'a reward for incompetence' in the wake of a number
of jail breakouts and security blunders.
He said any future payments would depend on the Prison Service's continuing
to achieve and maintain its targets. The service had 'largely achieved'
goals for improving performance.
The contract under which Mr Lewis was recruited made clear the circumstances
in which he was entitled to a bonus - 28 per cent on top of his Pounds
125,000 salary.
Mr Lewis said the bonus related to the relatively incident-free year to
March 1994. He added: 'It was paid very much earlier in the year and
announced at the time. There has been no secret about it.'
Mr Howard - campaigning in the Dudley West by-election - said the number of
escapes had been cut significantly and the amount of time prisoners spent
out of their cells had risen.
Mr John Prescott, Labour deputy leader, said the bonus was 'an absurdity of
the moment - paying bonuses to people while at the same time cutting back on
the police service. If the home secretary prefers to reward someone in these
circumstances it seems to me to be the wrong priority'.
Inquiries are still going on into the discovery of Semtex explosive and the
attempted break-out at Whitemoor prison by IRA inmates.
Guns have been found at other jails and the service has been accused of
political gaffes, such as the decision to transfer Brighton bomber Mr
Patrick Magee back to Ulster the day after the IRA declared its ceasefire.
Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat deputy leader, said: 'The public will find
it impossible to understand how someone on a pretty high salary should get a
massive bonus when there has been so much going on in the prisons.'
Sir Ivan Lawrence, Commons home affairs committee chairman, said top
salaries had to be paid to attract top people.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Safety strategy at BR 'changed'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail is no longer in favour of the introduction of an automatic
system to prevent trains passing signals at danger, a senior railway manager
disclosed yesterday.
Mr David Rayner, Railtrack's director of safety and standards, was giving
evidence to the public inquiry into the latest fatal BR crash, the head-on
collision at Cowden in Kent on October 15 in which five people died.
Mr Rayner outlined a series of alternative ways of improving safety, which
Major Kit Holden, the inquiry inspector, suggested amounted to a hotchpotch
of ideas.
General provision of automatic train protection, to prevent trains passing
signals at danger, going too fast or running into buffers, was recommended
by Sir Anthony Hidden in his report on the inquiry into the 1988 Clapham
disaster in which 35 people were killed.
The report's recommendation was accepted by BR and the government at the
time.
But Mr Rayner told the public inquiry yesterday that the situation had
changed.
Pilot schemes on the Great Western main line and the Chiltern line showed
costs were much higher than expected. He said: 'It was therefore concluded
that it was difficult to justify a complete system installation using that
form of technology.'
Mr Rayner said the main alternatives were a variation of the automatic train
control system adopted on high-speed trains in France and Japan, and
introducing systems to give some of the benefits of the BR automatic system
to particular areas.
He said this view was passed to the government in March.
Maj Holden said he was sceptical about the prospects of seeing any benefits
from the proposed systems in less than about 10 years. He added: 'It would
become very difficult to analyse the benefits of any single one of these
options.'
Mr Rayner disagreed. It was normal for signalling to vary.
The inquiry, in East Grinstead, West Sussex, also heard from Mr David
Burton, director of product quality for BR's south and east passenger group.
He said he believed the cost of the crash was higher than the savings made
by making the line single track in 1990.
Reducing the 26-mile Oxted-Uckfield branch line to single track saved Pounds
1.1m compared with renewing double track.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Extra Eurostar trains will run through the Channel tunnel to Paris in the
Christmas and new year period, it was announced yesterday.
European Passenger Services, the UK arm of Eurostar, had been planning to
increase the number of services to and from London's Waterloo station in
late January but it said that high demand meant that it would run extra
trains before then.
Mr Richard Edgley, EPS managing director, said: 'Barely a month after the
public launch, many trains are . . . running virtually full.'
The additional trains will be a 5.15pm Waterloo to Paris service and a
7.07pm Paris to London service on December 16, 23 and 30 and on January 6
and 13. EPS will run a 4.53pm London-Paris and a 7.07pm Paris-London service
on December 18 and January 8 and 15.
In addition, there will be a 12.53pm London-Paris and a 7.07pm Paris-London
service on January 20.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Worldwide interest in rail leases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eighty organisations in the fields of banking, leasing and railway equipment
manufacture have shown an interest in the three rolling stock leasing
companies set up under rail privatisation, Hambros Bank said.
Hambros, the government's adviser on the sale of the rolling stock
companies, said that it had approached more than 300 companies in Europe,
north America and the Far East to see if they wanted to acquire a stake in
the rolling stock companies. Eighty had attended or had asked to attend a
detailed presentation.
Under the government's plans for the privatisation of British Rail ownership
of BR's 11,000 locomotives and carriages has been transferred to three
companies which will lease them to the train operators. The leasing
companies will be responsible for maintaining rolling stock and they are
also expected to order new equipment on behalf of the train operators.
Prospective bidders will be expected to pre-qualify in February and March.
The first round of bids will be invited in the summer. Hambros expects to
ask for final bids in late summer or early autumn, with the sales to be
completed by the end of next year.
Hambros believes it has devised a method of calculating the value of
existing rolling stock which will allow it to be leased at acceptable rates.
South West Trains, however, has calculated that leasing new rolling stock
would cost Pounds 250,000 more a year than using existing stock - a sum
which it could not recover by charging higher fares.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Fall in assisted homeless families
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of families accepted as homeless by local authorities has fallen
to its lowest level for more than two years, official figures showed
yesterday.
But the figures coincided with a report that Britain faced 'new youth
homelessness crisis' with growing numbers of women and younger people on the
streets.
Mr David Curry, housing minister, said the new data reflected the success of
government measures to increase the supply of affordable housing and to
persuade local authorities to move away from using bed and breakfast as
temporary accommodation.
A survey of those staying at the charity Centrepoint's emergency shelters,
however, found the proportion of young women up from 26 per cent to 43 per
cent in the past seven years, with a 38 per cent rise in the number of
16-year-olds and 17-year-olds.
A survey of 1,500 under-25s at six charity projects shows that 44 per cent
were from ethnic minorities.
More than four in 10 of the homeless had no income at all, because those
aged 16 and 17 cannot claim benefit.
The official figures, from the Department of the Environment, put the number
of homeless households accepted for rehousing in England in the last quarter
at 31,270.
In the year ending September 1994 homelessness acceptances were 125,640  - 9
per cent down from the year ending September 1993 and a reduction of 19,440
from the peak annual total of 145,080 for the year ending March 1992.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Weak retail figures likely
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Competition is forcing shops to cut prices to attract Christmas shoppers,
retail experts said yesterday.
Figures this week are expected to show little sign of a strong recovery in
consumer demand and the retail sector is bracing itself for disappointing
sales in what is usually its busiest period.
Mr Clive Marshall, an analyst with retail research group Verdict, said:
'Over recent years retailers have been doing a lot of discounting and
consumers are starting to expect it. They are sitting on their hands and not
going out to shop until retailers start cutting prices.'
This view is echoed by the British Retail Consortium, which said profit
margins were being cut as stores competed for custom.
Two lots of figures on consumer demand are due this week - from the
Confederation of British Industry today and the government on Thursday.

FT  13 DEC 94 / House sales 'same as last year'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
House sales in November fell 10.3 per cent compared with October but are
virtually unchanged from November last year, according to a survey of 4,000
estate agency offices, Simon London writes.
The figures, published by the ombudsman for corporate estate agents and
covering about half of all offices, confirm that the housing market recovery
of the summer fell away during the autumn, with activity stabilising at
about the same level as last year.

FT  13 DEC 94 / A union rallying cry echoes in Europe: Robert Taylor reports
on the TUC's break with tradition in advocating workplace rights for all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Workplace rights for all workers looks likely to be the new rallying cry for
Britain's trade unions as the TUC's new approach takes British unions into
the mainstream of European thought on industrial relations.
The new approach may offend some union feelings. Many have traditionally
opposed the provision of rights for everybody, fearing that people would not
feel the need to join a union to enjoy protection at work.
But union leaders involved in the TUC's task group on workplace
representation say that statutory representation for all should encourage
unions to develop new strategies for growth and influence.
They believe unions will retain a strong workplace presence as unions still
do in Sweden and Germany, where such systems operate successfully.
But the TUC is not simply copying mainland European practice. As Mr Bill
Morris, the head of the task group, explained to German and Swedish union
officials and employers, UK unions want to see how the voluntary principle
of trade union membership can best be linked with satisfactory arrangements
for statutory representation.
This will require a complex balance between voluntarism and regulation, but
it looks as though the TUC has achieved a remarkable degree of consensus
among union leaders - from Mr Tony Dubbins of the GPMU print union on the
left to Mr Bill Jordan, AEEU craft union president, on the right.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, has been helped in his efforts to win
over sceptics in the unions by the government's almost wholly negative
attitude to the European Union's social affairs agenda, symbolised by its
opt-out from the social protocol of the Maastricht treaty.
Recent decisions against the UK by the European Court of Justice have said
that employees must have adequate information and consultation rights under
EU directives covering collective redundancies and the legal transfer of
undertakings from one company to another.
The task group has accepted that what it proposes needs to be compatible
with the directives as interpreted by the European Court of Justice, which
means recognising adequate protection for all workers without undermining
trade union influence and collective bargaining.
The kind of process the TUC has in mind is based on how the new EU works
council directive is likely to develop. This provides information and
consultation rights in bigger trans-national enterprises.
Although the UK may have opted out of the directive's provisions as applied
to Britain, more than 100 British-owned companies are likely to have such
councils in place in their businesses in the next three years. More
important, the directive shows the TUC how to integrate the voluntary
approach with statutory regulation.
Once the works council directive comes into force representatives of either
management or workers can establish a 'special negotiating body' to discuss
what kind of works council the company will establish. Only if the employer
refuses to do this, or negotiations fail for some other reason, is a legally
enforceable fallback provision for councils applicable.
The proposed negotiating body will be in line with national law and
customary practice in each EU member state. The TUC says this should favour
trade union representation in Britain and include full-time officials. The
task group envisages a similar process for the creation of workplace
committees in every company in the UK.
The TUC position is a bold step forward but it is likely to arouse
widespread opposition from employers. It is not a sharp break with the past,
however. The task group has been ingenious in weaving together the
regulatory and voluntary traditions. It provides a positive way forward by
suggesting a voice for all employees in Britain's workplaces, where surveys
suggest people are feeling increasingly insecure, and offers a chance for a
trade union revival.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Few schools report curriculum results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only 20 per cent of secondary schools in England and Wales reported the
results of national curriculum tests for 14-year-olds to the government this
year, although two teachers' unions lifted their boycott of the tests.
But the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority, the education department
quango which administers the tests, said it had collected enough data to
treat the results as a benchmark for future years.
It also stepped up the pressure on the National Union of Teachers, the only
union which has continued with the boycott, to start preparing children for
the tests. Mr Nicholas Tate, the chief executive, said: 'The message to
teachers boycotting the tests is that they are missing a great deal of
information about their own pupils and the effectiveness of their own
teaching.'
The format of the tests will remain unchanged next year, and the authority
is exploring a marking system which would enable each child's work to be
marked as a percentage. This would help in constructing 'value-added'
tables, which measure children's progress. However, such tables will not be
possible until 1996 at the earliest, when the results achieved by this
year's 14-year-olds can be compared with their grades in GCSE exams, taken
at 16.
The authority was anxious not to draw strong conclusions from the test
results, but found that physics results for 11-year-olds were weak.
Officials believed this was because the subject was relatively new to
primary schools.
There was also evidence that primary school boys underperformed badly in
English. This appeared to confirm academic studies which suggest that boys
underperform at GCSE because they lack control of the basics of literacy.
Mr Tate said: 'I think boys' under-achievement, in English in particular, is
a serious problem. It is just as serious as girls' under-achievement in
science in the past.'
The authority will also simplify the language in science and mathematics
tests, after pupils were shown to have difficulty with the scientific
applications of words such as 'conductor', 'producer' and 'probability'.
In the tests for 11-year-olds, only 29 per cent of abler children spelt
'illuminated' correctly, while more than two out of three spelt 'reference'
incorrectly.
In mathematics, the most common mistakes included misplacing decimal points,
failing to calculate percentages and fractions in mental arithmetic, and
confusion between squaring and doubling of numbers.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Company to raise funds for Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of Labour party supporters in the City has set up a limited company
to raise at least Pounds 100,000 for political advertising at the next
general election.
The company, Common Campaign, has no formal connection with Labour but the
founders are all members of the party's finance and industry group, set up
to tap City expertise.
Mr Roger Warren Evans, managing director and a former Bovis and Sainsbury's
executive, said the company hoped to raise funds from business people keen
to see a change of government but unwilling to contribute directly to
Labour.
He said: 'There is growing personal support for Labour in business and
professional circles, but it is difficult for the party to access those
supporters through normal political channels.
'At election time the government has always been able to rely on a
subservient Tory press, pull in large advertising funds from corporate
executives with keen personal interests in a Tory victory, and gain special
access to media deals. We are seeking to redress that balance. We are
committed to a Labour victory and we are giving the wider business and
professional community the chance to do something practical.'
In an attempt to reassure supporters that the company is independent, its
articles of association limit its objectives to purchasing advertising
independently of Labour, and specify that it must be wound up three months
after the next election.
Common Campaign will observe Labour's guidelines for donations, which bar
anonymous gifts, but offer confidentiality to donors of less than Pounds
5,000.
Like the party, the company says it will concentrate on seeking personal
donations but will consider corporate donations 'on their merits'.

FT  13 DEC 94 / More signs of inflation pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further signs of inflationary pressure were revealed yesterday, with figures
showing that manufacturers are increasing prices at the factory gate, while
raw material costs are rising at their fastest for 18 months.
The core measure of the output prices of manufacturers, which excludes
volatile goods such as food, beverages, tobacco and petroleum, rose a
seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent between October and November.
According to the Central Statistical Office the annual rise in the core
measure of output prices was 2.6 per cent in the 12 months to November. But
the pace of growth is accelerating. Prices in the three months to November
were 4 per cent higher than in the previous three months, on an annualised
basis.
Analysts saw the strength of yesterday's producer price figures as evidence
that the chancellor was right to sanction a half percentage point increase
in base rates last week. But it is not yet clear whether higher producer
prices would be passed on to consumers in the high street.
Mr Adam Cole, UK economist at James Capel, pointed out that low wage growth,
combined with strong productivity, was offsetting rising commodity prices.
He said manufacturers' overall cost bill was broadly flat, so that the aim
behind the factory gate price rises was to improve margins. With consumers
reluctant to pay higher prices, the result was that 'retail margins are
clearly getting squeezed very heavily,' he added.
The overall level of output prices rose an unadjusted 0.1 per cent between
October and November, for an annual rise of 2.4 per cent. There were
particularly sharp jumps in the prices of pulp and paper products, chemicals
and in paper and plastic products.
Meanwhile, manufacturers' raw material costs are rising even faster than
factory gate prices. Input prices rose an unadjusted 2.4 per cent between
October and November, for an annual rise of 7.9 per cent, up from 6.9 per
cent in October. This was the highest annual rate since March last year.
The main component in the unadjusted rise was the winter increase in the
price of electricity. The seasonally adjusted index rose just 0.7 per cent
on the month, for an 8.1 per cent annual increase. Higher milk prices also
played a part, contributing 0.4 percentage points of the monthly rise.
The cost of many commodities rose substantially in the year to November,
with coffee more than doubling in price.

FT  13 DEC 94 / 'Bazaar' plan angers ex-GLC boss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A former Tory leader of the Greater London Council protested yesterday
against new plans for its former headquarters, County Hall, saying the
building was in danger of being turned into 'an eastern bazaar'.
Lord Plummer urged ministers at Lords question time to ensure that the
redevelopment was carried out in accordance with its planning permission.
The original proposals from the building's owners, the Japanese property
company Shirayama, included provision - recently abandoned - for a
600-bedroom hotel. It is now planned to turn the building into a Pacific
Asia centre.
Lord Plummer, GLC leader from 1967-73, told peers: 'County Hall occupies a
prime location in the heart of the capital and should not be allowed to
lapse into an eastern bazaar.'
Lord Inglewood, for the government, said it was for Lambeth council, not
ministers, to ensure the planning rules were observed.
But he added that English Heritage was satisfied that the works accorded
with the planning consents.
Tory Lord Beloff said it would have been far better if the building had been
taken over by the London School of Economics as a 'major educational
edifice'.
Baroness Hollis of Heigham, for Labour, said two commercial schemes for the
building had collapsed, the Shirayama deal had been a 'shambles' and
possible future use by the public sector should be considered.
But Lord Inglewood said: 'Anyone who owns a building and has planning
permission for it is entitled to implement that permission.'

FT  13 DEC 94 / Major's joke starts a row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major, the prime minister, threw a bone to his Eurosceptic rebels
yesterday, and promptly found himself embroiled in a dogfight.
Answering questions in the Commons after a statement on the European Union
summit in Essen, Mr Major joked that few other heads of government were
subject to the rigorous questioning faced by UK prime ministers in the
Commons.
As Tories cheered, he added: 'Indeed I have to say that some of my fellow
heads of government could scarcely find their way to their parliament with a
guide dog.'
Mr Major's joke backfired as Labour MPs demanded he withdraw his
'gratuitously insulting' comment. Mr Tony Banks (Newham NW) warned that his
remarks were likely to develop into 'a story throughout Europe'. He added:
'Perhaps they have got their parliaments rather under greater control than
you have your own.'
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, wrote to Mr Major, saying his
remarks risked undermining Britain's standing in the Union.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Incident at Blair's office to be probed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The House of Commons security authorities were last night inquiring into the
mysterious appearance of three people - including two Conservative
researchers - in the private Commons office of Mr Tony Blair, the Labour
leader.
The three were found emerging from the doorway of Mr Blair's inner office on
Friday night by Ms Sue Jackson, the Labour leader's head of administration,
after she heard them laughing and shouting.
They were escorted away by security men after refusing to give their names
or explain their presence, but were allowed to leave after their Commons
passes were checked. They were identified as researchers working for Mr
David Atkinson, Conservative MP for Bournmouth East, and a friend visiting
the Commons for the day. Mr Atkinson later confirmed that his research
assistant Mr Andrew Hull had been involved in the incident.
Mr Blair's office declined to discuss the incident.
Tory MPs said the three had found themselves in Mr Blair's office after
taking a wrong turn in the Commons' labyrinthine corridors on their way back
from a social engagement.
Ms Jackson said she was alerted by 'loud laughter' at about 7.30pm on Friday
night. 'After several minutes I realised it was coming from Tony Blair's
inner office,' she said.
'I thought it was odd because everybody who works in that area had gone home
for the evening. There were three people coming out of the doorway of Tony
Blair's private office.
'I asked them who they were and what they were doing. They would not say.
They said they were lost. One of them rudely demanded to know the way out. I
blocked the door and said I would have to get security to show them the way
out.'

FT  13 DEC 94 / Sinn Fein shuns conference: Ulster's gathering of
international investors faces disruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, last night announced it was
boycotting an international business conference in Belfast, claiming its
proposed delegates were being treated as 'second class citizens'.
The move could disrupt the conference as some delegates from the US have
threatened to withdraw their participation if Sinn Fein does not attend.
With US delegates yesterday already on their way to Belfast for the
conference, it was not clear what position they would take before it is
officially opened tonight.
Sinn Fein last night signalled its intention to surround the conference in
political controversy by saying that it planned to organise a lobby of
overseas delegates.
Under pressure from the US, the British government last week agreed that six
Sinn Fein councillors could attend the conference. But last night Sinn Fein
said the councillors had not been invited as members of the party and that
its demands for equal status with other politicians had been rejected by the
government.
Mr Graham Gudgin, a leading Northern Ireland economist, said last night that
politics was threatening to undermine the success of the conference. He
said: 'Things are becoming very messy.'
The government's handling of the conference was yesterday criticised by the
Labour party as it launched proposals for economic regeneration in the
province.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said she thought
there had been 'a lack of clarity of thought' about the conference.
The party's 13-page document calls for a range of measures to regenerate
Ulster's economy including a strategy for redirecting public spending
towards investment.
The document says the Northern Ireland Office budget should not be cut
'simply because resources are available from international sources'. All
international aid 'is and must continue to be treated as additional to, and
not a substitute for, public expenditure'.
The paper advocates a package of measures for small businesses, including
the establishment of a Business Devel-opment Bank to raise private finance
for investment in the sector.
It also urges a 'Northern Ireland skills audit' to target training funds
more accurately. The Isle of Man government yesterday offered the island as
a neutral venue for peace talks on the political future of Northern Ireland
in a letter to the Home Office.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Some careful planning in Belfast: John Murray Brown on the
work behind the event opening tonight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like generals plotting a battle, the 'operations room' staff of Northern
Ireland's Industrial Development Board were yesterday making final
arrangements for Belfast's International Investment Conference, which Mr
John Major, the prime minister, is due to open tonight.
Surrounded by clocks showing the time in seven of the world's capitals they
put final touches to the seating plan for tonight's opening dinner, which
will be attended by Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary.
Mr Maynard Mawhinney, director in charge of promotions at the IDB, said:
'It's not just an exercise in putting bums on seats. It's about
sensitivities. Imagine you put two competitors on the same table. And if you
do, is that a problem?'
The conference is described as the biggest and most extravagant corporate
event in Northern Ireland's recent history. About 250 delegates are
expected, including executives from 70 businesses from the rest of Europe,
the US and the far east.
Given that the conference was only announced in October, the IDB is pleased
with the turnout. Mr Mawhinney said: 'Germany would normally be our target
market in Europe. But December is an impossible month. German companies are
all holding their AGMs.'
The venue for the conference is the Europa hotel. Mr Billy Hastings, head of
the eponymous Ulster company which acquired the Europa from Stoy Hayward,
the administrators, 15 months ago, said: 'If Northern Ireland can turn
itself around as quickly as we did, things will really be happening.'
The hotel, which used to be sealed off like a fortress, was bombed more than
40 times in the 25 years of violence. On the last occasion Mr Hastings was
still in negotiations with the administrators. After a Pounds 6.5m
refurbishment it is a potent reminder of the change that peace can bring to
the city.
'We were doing a function here the last time a bomb went off,' said Ms
Claire Faulkner, whose company Project Planning has been contracted to
devise the conference. 'We then didn't know whether it was just a matter of
sweeping up glass, or something more serious.'
The real challenge on this occasion has been to get the conference ready on
time. For an event of this size, the IDB would normally have sought
commercial sponsorship. On this occasion there was just not time.
At the weekend, replies were still coming in from businesses around the
world. 'We have one person whose sole task is to cope with the late
replies,' said Ms Faulkner.
Delegates coming from Heathrow will travel on a British Airways Concorde
which will have to fly out over the Atlantic to reach supersonic speeds -
its flight time will be longer than the regular shuttle.
A team of 'meeters and greeters' will be at Belfast's Aldergrove airport,
with a tailor from Parson &amp; Parsons, dress hire specialists, to measure up
any male delegate who arrives without the required black tie evening dress
for the dinner.
The mood is celebration mixed with remembrance. A boy soprano from the
city's St George's Choir will sing grace before dinner - a song entitled 'A
Grateful Heart'.
'I don't know whether that will help the dinner go down or not,' said Mr
Mawhinney. But no one is going to argue with the sentiment.
The menu will feature Northern Ireland produce. The 370 guests will be able
to drink Antrim Hills water with their North Down lamb, the renowned
'Comber' potatoes, Irish salmon and a 'Causeway' souffle.
The wines are French - a Macon Blanc Villages and Chateau Canada - but
liqueurs include St Brendan's cream liqueur and a Hennessey cognac, which
some would describe as another Irish brand name. Before dinner, Black Velvet
is on offer - a mixture of Moet &amp; Chandon champagne and Guinness, another
household name, although a southern one.
Even in deciding the decor for the conference hall, politics is never far
away. 'In Northern Ireland, you have to remember colours are very important.
You don't want red, white and blue and equally you don't want just green,
white and orange,' said Ms Faulkner referring to the union jack and the
Irish tricolour, the flags of the two traditions of the province.
So what is the conference's chosen colour scheme? 'A mix of terracotta and
purple.'

FT  13 DEC 94 / Weak retail figures likely
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Competition is forcing shops to cut prices to attract Christmas shoppers,
retail experts said yesterday.
Figures this week are expected to show little sign of a strong recovery in
consumer demand and the retail sector is bracing itself for disappointing
sales in what is usually its busiest period.
Mr Clive Marshall, an analyst with retail research group Verdict, said:
'Over recent years retailers have been doing a lot of discounting and
consumers are starting to expect it. They are sitting on their hands and not
going out to shop until retailers start cutting prices.'
This view is echoed by the British Retail Consortium, which said profit
margins were being cut as stores competed for custom.
Ms Ruth Parkhouse, the consortium's assistant director of external affairs,
said: 'We believe (Christmas shopping) takings will be up. However, there is
a problem with profitability because retailers have reduced prices.'
Two lots of figures on consumer demand are due this week - from the
Confederation of British Industry today and the government on Thursday.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Benn is voted off committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The House of Commons decided last night by a majority of 129 (181-52) to
remove Mr Tony Benn from the privileges committee which is examining the
'cash for questions' affair.
An unrepentant Mr Benn, Labour MP for Chesterfield, said that he had been
justified in breaching the rules of the committee and the House by
publishing his own account of proceedings which took place in private.
He insisted that the public was entitled to know about charges which had
been said to involve 'bribery, fraud and corruption'.
Mr Benn said he did not know whether the allegations were true, but they had
gravely damaged the democratic process.
He said the public would be wondering if some MPs were using their position
not to represent their constituents but to 'pedal their influence for
money'.
'If the House decides to retreat behind its traditional practice of working
in secret, it will be making a very great mistake that could damage
parliament and public confidence in us,' he said.
His demand that statements made by members of the committee when
deliberating over their conclusions - as well as evidence by witnesses  -
should be published was opposed from both sides of the House.
Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, argued that the maintenance of
secrecy during the deliberation process was an essential element in helping
to achieve the consensus which frequently led to a majority report.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow leader of the House, was joined by Mr Peter Shore,
Labour MP for Bethnal Green and Stepney in suggesting that, as with juries
in criminal trials, it would be wrong for the deliberative processes of the
committee to be conducted in public.
Mr David Alton, for the Liberal Democrats, complained that Mr Benn's
deliberate action in breaching the rules of the House had delayed the
inquiry into a matter which had brought the reputation of parliament into
disrepute.
The committee's investigation centres on the action of Mr Graham Riddick,
Conservative MP for Colne Valley and Mr David Tredinnick, Conservative MP
for Bosworth, in agreeing to accept payment for tabling questions in the
Commons.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Trusts 'to control 98% of the NHS'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, said in the Commons last night
that 98 per cent of the National Health Service would be under the control
of self-governing trusts from April next year.
Labour MPs strongly disputed her claim that the growth in the number of
trusts, coupled with other changes introduced in 1991, had produced a
'fundamental and irreversible shift' in the balance of power to patients.
Mrs Bottomley moved the second reading of the bill to abolish regional
health boards and merge district and family health service authorities. She
said it would put in place 'the final building block to create the
first-class health service' needed for the next century.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow health secretary, said the self-governing
trusts represented a 'structure of individual health businesses' which would
not be acceptable to the next Labour government.
She said that the changes initiated by the trusts had resulted in care being
determined by management and not by medical need. The conflict between
managers and clinicians was growing, she said.
Mrs Beckett saw the bill as further confirmation that the government's
'ultimate agenda' was the privatisation of the NHS.
Mrs Bottomley said she had approved a further 13 applications from hospitals
and ambulance services which wished to become trusts from next April. Trusts
were already responsible for 96 per cent of hospitals and community health
services, she said, and from next April this would increase to 98 per cent.
Mrs Bottomley saw the streamlining of NHS administration by the bill leading
to an annual saving of Pounds 150m in England and at least Pounds 3m a year
in Wales. A further Pounds 50m would be saved by reductions in the
Department of Health.
The bill was given a second reading after a Labour amendment complaining
that it failed to deal with the problems of hospital closures, waiting lists
and commercialisation of trusts was defeated by a government majority of 41
(308-267).

FT  13 DEC 94 / County Hall plan angers Tory peer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A former Tory leader of the Greater London Council protested yesterday
against new plans for its former headquarters, County Hall, saying the
building was in danger of being turned into 'an eastern bazaar'.
Lord Plummer urged ministers at Lords question time to ensure that the
redevelopment was carried out in accordance with its planning permission.
The original proposals from the building's owners, the Japanese property
company Shirayama, included provision - recently abandoned - for a
600-bedroom hotel. It is now planned to turn the building into a Pacific
Asia centre.
Lord Plummer, GLC leader from 1967-73, said: 'County Hall occupies a prime
location in the heart of the capital and should not be allowed to lapse into
an eastern bazaar.'
Lord Inglewood, for the government, said it was for Lambeth council, not
ministers, to ensure that the planning rules were observed. But he added
that English Heritage was satisfied that the works accorded with the
planning consents.
Tory Lord Beloff said it would have been far better if the building had been
taken over by the London School of Economics.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Nadir tax offer will be assessed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The attorney-general of northern Cyprus is to rule on the legality of a
proposal put forward by fugitive businessman Mr Azil Nadir to turn over a
fruit packaging business to the breakaway republic in lieu of tax debts, Jim
Kelly writes.
Mr Nadir has offered to give the Sunzest company to the government in a
dispute about unpaid taxes which are understood to amount to Dollars 10m
(Pounds 6m).
The administrators of Polly Peck International say Mr Nadir has no authority
to dispose of Sunzest and are anxious to be a party to any agreement to use
the assets to cancel debts.
Mr Ozker Ozgur, the northern Cyprus deputy prime minister, said yesterday:
'Nadir says he has the authority from the shareholders to do this, but the
(PPI administrators) claiming to represent the shareholders, claim
differently. So we will ask the attorney-general if Nadir has the right to
do this.'

FT  13 DEC 94 / Major faces revolt on fish policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's government risks a further defeat in the House of Commons
this week, amid signs that Tory Euro-rebels are preparing to challenge the
UK's fisheries policy.
Several Tory MPs said yesterday that they might vote against the government
in a debate over plans to extend fishing rights to Spanish and Portuguese
trawlers in the Irish sea.
The issue is expected to come up in a general debate tomorrow on the
government's agriculture policy. The Labour party has put down an amendment
saying that Britain should not give Iberian fishermen access to an area to
the west of the UK coastline, called 'the Irish box'.
However, the amendment runs counter to the UK's expected negotiating
position at a forthcoming European fisheries council. Mr William Waldegrave,
the agriculture minister, is expected to concede at the meeting that Iberian
trawlers should be given access to the area while strengthening the rights
and protection of British and Irish trawlers.
Two Tory MPs who were deprived of the party whip a fortnight ago admitted
yesterday that they could vote with Labour on the issue. Mr Christopher
Gill, a member of the Commons agriculture committee, said his 'general
feeling' was that the fishermen had a very strong case. He said there was 'a
prospect' that he would not support the government on Wednesday.
It is also understood that Mrs Teresa Gorman, the Tory MP for Billericay,
could vote against the government.
In the Commons, Sir Teddy Taylor, the MP for Southend, expressed fears that
the Spanish government had won the new rights in 'behind-the-scenes' talks
at the European Council meeting in Essen at the weekend. The prime minister
gave an assurance that rumours of a victory by the Spanish government on the
issue were not true.
Mr David Harris, the MP for St Ives in Cornwall and a loyal supporter of the
government, has also expressed concern about the impact on fishing fleets in
his constituency.
He admitted yesterday that there might be little the government could do, as
the issue would be decided by a majority vote of EU member states.
A government defeat would not be of the same order of magnitude as the one
on value added tax on fuel last week because tomorrow's motion has no
statutory force.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Corporate manslaughter verdict poses legal dilemma: John
Mason reports on the impact of last week's historic conviction of a company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Legal history was made last week when a leisure and activity company was
convicted of corporate manslaughter over the deaths of four teenagers on a
canoe trip in Lyme Bay, Dorset.
Both the company, OLL, and its managing director, Mr Peter Kite, were
convicted of manslaughter. Mr Kite was jailed for three years. His company
was fined Pounds 60,000.
The conviction marks the first time a company has been successfully
prosecuted for this offence. Previous attempts to prosecute companies in the
criminal courts have consistently failed - as the case brought against the
P&amp;O shipping line following the Zeebrugge ferry tragedy demonstrated.
Lawyers specialising in corporate criminal liability agree that the Lyme Bay
verdict will not dramatically reshape the legal landscape, but say it should
reinforce warnings to companies of the possible consequences of neglecting
safety issues.
The case highlights a continuing debate about the adequacy of current law
regarding corporate manslaughter. The government has been reluctant to
tighten the law, saying it would create extra 'red tape' for companies to
contend with. The Law Commission is reviewing the law, however, and is
expected to make recommendations early next year.
The problems in charging companies with criminal offences such as
manslaughter are two-fold. First, recent cases have shown that it is
extremely difficult to prove the guilt of all but the smallest companies.
Second, there is considerable debate about the purpose of bringing criminal
charges against companies at all. Some say that after disasters such as
Zeebrugge the public interest may be better served by a speedy, efficient
public inquiry aimed at avoiding the repetition of such tragedies.
The problems of making a criminal charge 'stick' against a company are well
demonstrated by the Zeebrugge prosecution, which fell foul of the strict
evidential requirements for proving a case.
To prove a company criminally guilty, it must be shown that the 'mind' of
the company actively approved the actions or lack of them at the centre of
the case.
The concept of a company's 'mind' is a legal fiction which has proved
troublesome for the courts to cope with. In successive cases it has been
taken to mean the conduct at the centre of the case must effectively amount
to company policy as approved by directors.
In the Zeebrugge case the judge threw out the charges because the failings
that led to the tragedy occured too low down the managerial and operational
chain of command.
The prosecution also failed because of the other widely regarded failing of
the current law, which is the inability to consider 'aggregation' - the
accumulative effect of a series of failings amounting to gross negligence.
The success of the Lyme Bay prosecution illustrates what all lawyers agree
is the result of the present state of corporate manslaughter law - that
small companies are far more likely to be convicted than large ones.
OLL was a small business, in effect run by one man. Lawyers say that, in
such circumstances, it is far easier to show that the mind of the individual
and the 'mind' of the company are in effect one and the same.
This has caused concern among those lawyers acting for victims of disasters.
Mr Mark Scoggins, a partner with Davies Arnold Cooper, a law firm
specialising in corporate liability, said: 'People feel that the law is
ineffective at dealing with the people who are the real cause of safety
being ignored. There is a law against this but offences are difficult to
prove except where small companies are involved.'
The other problem over corporate criminal liability is what purpose such
prosecutions serve when there are other ways of protect-ing the public
interest.
Mr Christopher Newell, director of casework for the Crown Prosecution
Service, insists that the CPS will prosecute companies when appropriate. He
says, however, that after disasters such as Zeebrugge the public interest is
generally best served by trying to ensure that there is no repetition of the
tragedy.
He says Non-criminal, perhaps public, inquiries and more effective
regulation of companies' activities might often be preferable to prosecuting
the company concerned.
He also insists that criminal prosecutions of companies should not be
brought in the emotional aftermath of disasters simply to placate the
public.
It is too early to judge the prospects of reform. Two years ago Davies
Arnold Cooper presented ministers with proposals which would have enabled
directors and managers with poor safety records to be banned from the
management of any business where they could endanger the lives of others.
This, it said, was not anti-business, but pro-safety. Its proposals met with
a polite but firm rebuff from ministers.
The provisional recommendation of the Law Commission is that companies
should be subject to a special regime under which they are judged according
to whether they should have been aware that their operations had a
significant risk of death or injury. This would avoid the legal pitfalls of
the company's 'mind' and aggregation.
The commission says effective prosecutions for corporate manslaughter might
then be more possible.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Safety strategy at BR 'changed'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail is no longer in favour of the introduction of an automatic
system to prevent trains passing signals at danger, a senior railway manager
disclosed yesterday.
Mr David Rayner, Railtrack's director of safety and standards, was giving
evidence to the public inquiry into the latest fatal BR crash, the head-on
collision at Cowden in Kent on October 15 in which five people died.
Mr Rayner outlined a series of alternative ways of improving safety, which
Major Kit Holden, the inquiry inspector, suggested amounted to a hotchpotch
of ideas and 'a jam tomorrow syndrome'.
General provision of automatic train protection, to prevent trains passing
signals at danger, going too fast or running into buffers, was recommended
by Sir Anthony Hidden in his report on the inquiry into the 1988 Clapham
disaster in which 35 people were killed.
The report's recommendation was accepted by BR and the government at the
time.
But Mr Rayner told the public inquiry yesterday that the situation had
changed.
Pilot schemes on the Great Western main line and the Chiltern line showed
costs were much higher than expected. He said: 'It was therefore concluded
that it was difficult to justify a complete system installation using that
form of technology.'
Mr Rayner said the main alternatives were a variation of the automatic train
control system adopted on high-speed trains in France and Japan, and
introducing systems to give some of the benefits of the BR automatic system
to particular areas.
He said this view was passed to the government in March.
Maj Holden said he was sceptical about the prospects of seeing any benefits
from the proposed systems in less than about 10 years.
Questioning Mr Rayner about the local options, he said he was concerned that
there would end up being what he dubbed 'slightly unfairly' a hotchpotch of
ideas at various sites on the railway.
He added: 'It would become very difficult to analyse the benefits of any
single one of these options.'
Mr Rayner disagreed. It was normal for signalling to vary.
The inquiry, in East Grinstead, West Sussex, also heard from Mr David
Burton, director of product quality for BR's south and east passenger group.
He said he believed the cost of the crash was higher than the savings made
by making the line single track in 1990.
Reducing the 26-mile Oxted-Uckfield branch line to single track saved Pounds
1.1m compared with renewing double track. He confirmed that there had been
no assessment of the risk of accidents when the project was considered -
such techniques were 'not available' at the time.
Questioned by Mr Allan Gore, counsel for the train drivers' union Aslef, Mr
Burton said he did not know the cost of the crash. Nor did he know the costs
of recovering the trains and track, the internal and current public inquiry,
and the likely compensation for those involved.
Mr Gore said: 'I suggest to you that if you take all of these factors into
account they will be larger than the perceived cost savings in choosing
between the options for this line's future.'
Mr Burton said: 'I believe that to be correct.'
The inquiry continues

FT  13 DEC 94 / PO and union clash over strike impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER, Employment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Post Office managers and the postal workers' union clashed last night about
the impact of yesterday's 24-hour strike, which shut more than 100 main
offices.
Managers said the walkout was a complete flop, saying only 800 workers
joined in. The Union of Communication Workers said the response was
tremendous and accused the Post Office of using managers and casual workers
to cover for strikers.
The strike was in protest at the closure of hundreds of main offices since
1989 and their transfer to franchised stores or supermarkets.
The union said yesterday that franchised post offices made more mistakes
than the main offices they replaced. The UCW said a leaked document covering
south-east London showed cash accounting mistakes in a franchised post
office in the three months to July were 78 per cent worse than the Post
Office's target.
Mr Alan Johnson, general secretary of the UCW, said: 'It is ridiculous for
the Post Office to claim that by shunting our post offices into the back of
supermarkets, service is improved. They are misleading the public and their
own documents prove it.'
The union said it had overwhelming public support for the strike and for the
campaign to halt closures.
According to the UCW 95 per cent of those who voted to strike did not work
yesterday, with the action hitting London, Bristol, Glasgow, Liverpool,
parts of Wales and Cornwall.
The Post Office said 647 of the country's 764 main offices were open. It
added that the number of main offices was almost exactly the same as four
years ago, with those moving to retail outlets frequently opening longer and
having better access.
The union has complained about 'back-door privatisation'. It says half of
the country's main post offices have closed since 1989. Mr Johnson said:
'Hundreds more will close by 1999 unless the rot is stopped. We are
demanding a complete halt to all closures from today.'
Collections and deliveries of Christmas post were not hit by the industrial
action, which the union is threatening to repeat in the new year.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Banks' risk assessment under scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England has established a specialist supervisory team to assess
individual banks' ability to monitor how much risk they take on in their
securities business.
The team, set up in August, will not be making formal assessment visits
until January 1996, but it has been making 'prototype visits' to examine the
extent to which banks monitor their own risks.
A Bank official said: 'Our overall impression is that the standards of risk
management are satisfactory but we need to look at them very carefully.'
Banks with inadequate practices will not be allowed to carry on securities
business until their risk-measurement and monitoring are improved.
The unit will be looking at the models used by banks to measure how the
value of their securities holdings change with other market movements such
as interest rates. While bigger banks with strong information technology
systems are likely to monitor risk closely, there is concern that some risk
measurement systems are rudimentary.
The Bank of England will not tell banks what model to use. Instead, it will
evaluate whether the model is sufficient to measure the risks that the
individual bank is likely to take on, and the rigour with which it adheres
to that model.
The creation of the new unit was prompted by the advent of the capital
adequacy directive, an EU move to standardise the capital requirements which
banking and securities institutions must hold in respect of the risks they
take on.
For the first time, UK banks will have to hold capital in respect of
so-called 'market risks', the risks that the value of securities they hold
will fall or rise sharply in line with interest rates.
Until now the Bank of England has been concerned mostly with 'counterparty
risk', the risk that a debtor will not repay on time, and with the risk
inherent in foreign exchange positions.
The securities and futures authority, which monitors the securities
positions of securities and investment banks, has been evaluating its own
members' risk models for some time.
Where regulators feel those models are inadequate, the models will have to
be changed.

FT  13 DEC 94 / More dialogue planned for spending round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury hopes to improve the system of negotiating the annual public
spending round by stepping up its early contacts with the spending
ministries, Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Treasury chief secretary, said
yesterday.
He told the Commons Treasury and civil service committee that negotiations,
particularly in the preliminary stages of the round, were rather like a
'choreographed Victorian minuet', with some meetings 'a bit like those
between North Korea and South Korea'.
He said it would be more helpful if there was greater dialogue between
ministers and officials from the Treasury, and spending ministers and their
officials, before the round started in earnest in September. He hoped to
introduce 'away days or listening days' for ministers and officials from
both sides.
Mr Aitken had to answer charges levelled by Labour, Liberal Democrat and
Tory MPs, that the government's achievements in controlling public spending
were more apparent than real.
He rejected suggestions that the government had failed in its objectives
because the control total of departmental spending was expected to increase
in real terms in the 1994-95 financial year compared with plans in last
year's Budget for a fall.
Mr Aitken stressed that the increase reflected lower than expected inflation
in the current financial year, which resulted in spending plans fixed in
cash terms showing real increases.
To change these plans during the year to take account of low inflation would
'cause chaos' for managers in areas such as the health service.
Mr Aitken was also downbeat on the prospects for cutting a swathe through
the burgeoning social security budget. Reforms such as changes to
unemployment benefit, statutory sick pay, invalidity benefit and housing
benefit would have a positive effect in the long term, he said.
But cutting social security was not like cutting defence. About 90 per cent
of non-cyclical social security spending was entitlement-driven while 44 per
cent comprised pensions and income support for the elderly, which was
covered by manifesto commitments.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Redwood criticises quango for past lapses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An inquiry commissioned by the Welsh Development Agency has shown what Mr
John Redwood, Welsh secretary, described yesterday as 'serious lapses in
management control over its joint venture activities'.
The report, by Grant Thornton, the accountancy firm, looked at the agency's
involvement two years ago in a development project in Aberdare, Mid
Glamorgan. It had been alleged that the agency competed with the private
sector for land.
A joint venture board had been set up in 1991 between the WDA, Cynon Valley
borough council and Mid Glamorgan county council. Grant Thornton said the
agency should have considered a joint venture with a private developer,
rather than be seen to displace the private sector. It considered the agency
failed to ensure the best value for money in buying land subsequently sold
for a Tesco superstore.
Mr Redwood told the Commons in a written answer that the report showed 'no
evidence of improper pecuniary gain or collusion by any of the parties'. But
he said Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, who became WDA chairman last year, 'agrees
with me that the former management's conduct fell short of the standards we
expect'. The WDA was chaired at the time by Dr Gwyn Jones.
Mr Barry Hartop, who became WDA chief executive this year, said yesterday:
'The criticisms of the agency's former procedures are accepted and we have
already taken remedial action to improve controls and ensure transparency on
dealings involving third parties.'
The Welsh secretary noted that Cynon Valley council had not allowed Grant
Thornton access to certain papers. 'I hope those concerned will study the
report carefully and, where appropriate, carry out their own investigation.'
He said it would be for the district auditor to respond to requests for an
inquiry into the council's activities. The council did not comment last
night.
Mr Redwood said Mr Hartop had informed the Commons public accounts committee
about other past matters, including the underwriting of share issues, the
engagement of consultants, redundancy and pension payments, procurement
issues and breaches of delegated authority. He said: 'Some of these
instances of non-compliance have continued until earlier this year.'
It has been disclosed that the WDA made a net loss of Pounds 150,000 on
underwriting share issues of privatised and Welsh companies. Underwriting
stopped in 1991. Mr Redwood said he had told the WDA that this was not an
appropriate role.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Benn warns Commons on sleaze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The House of Commons is on trial over its handling of recent allegations of
sleaze against MPs, Mr Tony Benn said last night as he tried to persuade MPs
not to vote to remove him from the powerful Commons privileges committee.
The veteran leftwing Labour MP said the real issue at stake was not his
removal from the committee, which is investigating allegations of
misbehaviour against two Tory MPs, but whether it was right for the
committee's deliberations to be reported.
'If the House decides to retreat behind its traditional practice of working
in secret, it will be making a very great mistake that could damage
parliament and public confidence in us,' he said.
'It is the House which is ultimately responsible for having set itself such
low standards of public conduct.'
Speaking before the vote, Mr Benn set out a six-point blueprint for raising
standards in public life. He called for the use of 'parliamentary influence'
in return for payment to be treated as a breach of privilege and for the
rules governing the private interests of ministers to apply to all MPs.
He said the powers to investigate MPs charged with a breach of these rules
should be transferred to the courts. It should be made illegal for any
outside company or organisation to pay MPs for 'parliamentary services
designed to win influence'. It would put 'a complete stop' to the peddling
of influence.
The former Labour cabinet minister said if the steps he proposed were taken,
it would not prevent MPs from maintaining their professions. Nor would it
prevent political contributions being paid to candidates or parties - 'under
proper safeguards'.
Mr Benn was voted off the committee last month by the 17 MPs who sit on it
after he gave the press an account of the discussions at its last meeting.
He can only be formally removed after a vote by the entire House.
It is understood that only two MPs - Mr Bill Michie, the MP for Sheffield
Heeley, and Mr Benn himself - voted against the expulsion. One Labour
committee member said that he backed the principle of opening up some
committee sessions but Mr Benn's policy of giving the press an account of
private sessions could not be justified.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Brazilian Supreme Court acquits Collor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRASLIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Fernando Collor, who resigned the Brazilian presidency in 1992 amid
corruption allegations, was yesterday cleared of such charges by the
country's Supreme Court.
The acquittal is likely to strengthen his determination on a political
comeback next century. An earlier ruling still bars Mr Collor, 45, from
public office until 2000.
He was cleared of the charge of 'passive corruption' by five of the eight
judges hearing the case. The three dissenters agreed with prosecutors that
Mr Collor and the man then his campaign treasurer, Mr Paulo Cesar Farias,
were in an influence-peddling scheme which offered political favours for
financial contributions.
Mr Farias, now in jail for tax evasion, was also cleared of the passive
corruption charge, but he faces four other charges.
Judges ruling for Mr Collor said prosecutors had failed to provide proof
linking him to Mr Farias's fund-raising. The case against the former
president was further weakened when some prosecution evidence was ruled
inadmissible because it had been seized without a court order.
Mr Collor's acquittal is a severe embarrassment for Congress, which stripped
him of his political rights and tried to impeach him. He resigned as
president during the impeachment procedure.
Several leading politicians said they were disappointed by the court's
ruling, which they described as being based on 'technical' legal reasons.
Mr Collor, who by the end of his term in office was so unpopular that
thousands of protesters massed on the streets, did not attend the judgment.
Public resentment has turned to apathy and a recent newspaper survey found
that, although most people thought Mr Collor was guilty, less than half
thought he would be so judged.

FT  13 DEC 94 / IBM loses law suit over computer upgrade market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IBM yesterday lost another round in its nine-year battle against an
anti-trust law suit brought by a competitor in the US market for overhauling
and upgrading mainframe computers.
The US Supreme Court refused to review a decision by the federal appeals
court in Philadelphia that overturned an earlier verdict in IBM's favour and
ordered a new trial of the anti-trust case.
The suit was brought against IBM by Allen-Myland, which claimed that IBM had
abused its dominant position in the market by manipulating the price of
parts and in effect illegally tying customers to using its own upgrading
services.
Allen-Myland said that this shut it out of the upgrade market, which at
times in the 1970s was as large as the market for new mainframes.
Allen-Myland at one point accounted for half the upgrades performed on IBM
mainframes.
The Philadelphia appeals court overturned the lower court ruling in IBM's
favour on the grounds that the judge had erred in his definition of the size
of the market in which Allen-Myland claimed IBM was holding a dominant
position.
The new decision could have ramifications for IBM's efforts to escape from
the terms of a consent decree which it negotiated in 1956 with President
Eisenhower's Justice Department. This required IBM to stop offering its
computers for lease only, rather than outright sale, and to separate its
service business from its manufacturing.
Although IBM is clearly no longer dominant in the broadest definition of the
US computer market (it slipped this year to fourth place in sales of
personal computers), the issue of whether it still dominates the mainframe
market could depend on a precise definition of that market.

Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who is set to take office as Brazilian
president on January 1, yesterday won the backing of the country's largest
political party, the left-of-centre Democratic Movement party (PMDB), writes
Angus Foster in Braslia.
The PMDB's support, which was formally pledged during a meeting with the
party president, Mr Luiz Henrique, should help Mr Cardoso to build a big
enough coalition in the Congress due to take office next month to make
several constitutional changes next year aimed at modernising the national
economy.
The PMDB holds about 125 seats in the 514-member Congress. If these are
added to the 210 seats held by the alliance which elected Mr Cardoso, he
looks able to count on the necessary three-fifths support needed to change
the constitution.
According to most analysts, changes are urgently needed in the tax and
social security systems in order to keep the government's budget in balance
and to underpin Brazil's latest anti-inflation currency, the Real.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Work to stop on last nuclear power plants: End of an era for
electricity generation in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An era of nuclear energy will draw to a close in the US next year when the
Tennessee Valley Authority, a government-owned electricity generator, halts
work on the last three nuclear reactors under construction in the US.
The TVA announced yesterday that it would not complete a half-built reactor
at Watts Bar in Tennessee, or two reactors at Bellefonte in Alabama, though
it expects to start another virtually complete Watts Bar reactor next
autumn, joining three reactors already in operation.
'We are still in the testing phase for Watts Bar 1. I believe that will be
the last stand for this generation of nuclear power in the country,' said Mr
Craven Crowell, the TVA chairman.
The authority will decide next year what to do with the three reactors, one
of which is 88 per cent complete.
Mr Crowell said that he had a duty at least to look for financial partners
who might want to complete the reactors, though he thought it improbable
that he would find any.
'I don't hold out great hope,' he said. 'It just costs too much to build a
nuclear plant.'
The partially completed plants could be converted, however, to another
energy source such as natural gas.
The decision to halt construction was driven by the need to do something
about the TVA's heavy debt burden, which now totals Dollars 26bn (Pounds
16.6bn). Perhaps Dollars 17bn of that can be attributed to the ambitious
nuclear construction programme which the TVA began in 1966.
'One third of our operating costs goes towards paying interest on our debt,
and the debt has been driven by nuclear construction,' Mr Crowell said.
Under the new policy announced yesterday, the TVA will stop adding to its
total debt no later than October 1997, and will maintain an internal debt
cap about Dollars 2bn to Dollars 3bn below the ceiling of Dollars 30bn set
by the US Congress.
Nuclear reactors are usually more expensive to build than fossil fuel
electricity generation plants but they use less fuel. Even so, ever tighter
safety standards have increased construction costs, and also have required
utilities to spend more money on adding safety features to their existing
reactors.
In addition to that, the federal government's inability to come up with a
long-term storage site for highly radioactive nuclear waste has left nuclear
generators wondering what to do with their spent fuel.
The nuclear energy industry, however, argues that advanced reactor designs
can provide competitively priced electricity and are essential to the
long-term US energy security.
Mr Crowell, however, says that the TVA cannot continue to pile up debt by
pursuing an out-of-date nuclear policy, and must get its costs down in the
shorter term, in preparation for deregulation of the electricity industry.
He believes that privatisation of the TVA is unlikely, nevertheless, because
of its nuclear division.

Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso (pictured left), who is set to take office as
Brazilian president on January 1, yesterday won the backing of the country's
largest political party, the left-of-centre Democratic Movement party
(PMDB).
The PMDB's support, which was formally pledged during a meeting with the
party president, Mr Luiz Henrique, should help Mr Cardoso to build a big
enough coalition, in the Congress due to take office next month, to make

the constitution.
According to most analysts, changes are urgently needed in the tax and
social security systems in order to keep the government's budget in balance
and to underpin Brazil's latest anti-inflation currency, the Real.
Mr Cardoso was a member of the PMDB until five years ago, when he left to
help found the Social Democratic party (PSDB). This old link, and the fact
the two parties share similar views in areas such as social policy, meant Mr
Cardoso's advisers were always hopeful of gaining the PMDB's support.
However, a powerful wing of the party, controlled by a failed presidential
candidate, Mr Orestes Quercia, remains opposed to Mr Cardoso. Although PMDB
leaders said they would back the new president on most matters, Mr Quercia's
group and some northern deputies are expected to abstain or try to block Mr
Cardoso's reforms.
In return for its support, the PMDB is expected to be given a say on
economic matters, although any advice may not be heeded by the economic team
built up by Mr Cardoso when he was finance minister earlier in the present
administration.
The PMDB is also likely to be given one or two ministries. Most likely is
that of justice, for which the PMDB deputy, Mr Nelson Jobim, is favourite.
He oversaw the unsuccessful attempt to change the constitution earlier this
year and is widely respected in Congress for his legal knowledge.
Mr Jobim decided not to run for re-election to the Congress elected in
October and November, and he is thought to be Mr Cardoso's choice.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Cavallo vows to fight budget battle: We will soon return to
balance, Argentina's economy minister tells David Pilling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina will overcome its temporary fiscal difficulties to produce
balanced budgets both this year and in 1995, said Mr Domingo Cavallo, the
economy minister.
Mr Cavallo, in an interview, hinted that foreign banks and investors had
overreacted to 'early warning signals' of a third-quarter deficit, provoked
largely by 'inertial increases' in social security spending. Stocks and
bonds have been depressed since Mr Cavallo announced in October that there
would be a deficit, while some international bankers have questioned
Argentina's commitment to continued fiscal discipline.
'Far from being frightened, bankers should be happy to see that the economy
minister will go into battle with the national Congress - with the absolute
backing of the president - precisely in order to avoid future deficits,' he
said. 'We have already taken action in 1994 and are pushing for legislative
changes with a budgetary impact in 1995 so that deficits do not recur.'
Mr Cavallo last month banned all new state spending for the rest of the
year, with the aim of saving Dollars 1.3bn, and introduced legislation to
limit further increases in social security spending, which already makes up
nearly half the federal budget.
He is also pushing for broader powers to control Argentina's purse strings,
entitling him to cut government jobs, merge state bodies and to sell off
more state concerns without consulting Congress. Although congressmen have
refused to discuss these proposals as part of the 1995 budget package, as Mr
Cavallo had wanted, the measures will be re-introduced early next year and
may even be forced through by presidential decree.
Mr Cavallo admitted, however, that two years of big budget surpluses, helped
by the privatisation of most state assets, were probably over. 'We are now
resigned to having (merely) balanced budgets in both 1994 - which is about
to end - and in 1995.'
But, 'that is to say, there will be no deficit'. Argentina was 'one of the
few countries of the world that has fiscal equilibrium'.
On the question of high unemployment, another potential concern for foreign
investors and domestic voters alike, Mr Cavallo said he would not 'dare to
make predictions'. Many economists believe that the jobless rate, which may
be as high as 13 per cent, could creep up further as companies intensify
efforts to become more productive.
Mr Cavallo said that reforms of Argentina's antiquated and inflexible labour
laws were vital if structural unemployment were to be defeated. Although
jobs were being created at an annual rate of 1.3 to 1.5 per cent, the number
of job seekers - swelled largely by immigrants and women joining the labour
force, according to Mr Cavallo - had risen at more than double that pace.
The problem 'is clearly not lack of growth' given that the economy had
expanded by 33 per cent since 1990. But, during this time, the job pool had
only grown by 5.5 per cent because small and medium companies - which in
normal circumstances rely more heavily on labour - 'have been discouraged
from creating new jobs because of the complexity . . . and high costs
associated with labour norms'.
Legislation to make labour more 'flexible' would be passed in relation to
companies with fewer than 50 workers and later extended to the whole labour
market, he said. Reforms would seek to make hiring and firing easier, to
reduce the role of collective bargaining and to amend legislation on
compensation for accidents at work, which the government says is open to
abuse.
Reforms were part of a three-pronged approach that would also include an
intensification of job retraining, especially for youth, and the launch of
labour-intensive public works programmes. To fund these, the government
would advance with cost-cutting state reforms at federal, provincial and
municipal level, he said.
'You have to bear in mind that these reforms may themselves lead to job
cuts. Therefore, it is probable that this strategy will achieve a change in
the structure of employment in favour of more jobs in the productive
sector,' he said.
But Mr Cavallo said training and public works programmes could not of
themselves tackle the root causes of unemployment. To achieve this, Congress
would have to amend labour laws, he said. 'However much training and
retraining we do, if labour reforms are not passed - at least for small and
medium companies - then it will be difficult for employment to grow
vigorously.'

FT  13 DEC 94 / Vietnam in deal over US embassy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By A Hanoi Correspondent and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The former US embassy in Saigon, once the scene of frantic efforts by staff
to evacuate Americans by helicopter as North Vietnamese tanks smashed their
way into the city in 1975, has become the centrepiece of diplomatic moves of
a rather different nature.
The cheerless white structure in central Saigon, now known more commonly as
Ho Chi Minh City, is one of 36 US government buildings in the city whose
fate has been decided under an agreement between Vietnam and the US.
The deal, details of which were not revealed, took 11 months to negotiate
and included a decision on the future of the former South Vietnamese embassy
in Washington, which occupies a prime site not far from the White House.
The US embassy building in Saigon is just down the road from the
presidential palace in the city's bustling centre. Its current tenant is
Vietnam's state oil agency, and its peeling facade remains in much the same
state as it was at the end of the Vietnam war. However, there are plans for
two large hotels backed by foreign investment on the opposite side of the
street and the site itself has attracted attention from developers. 'It's an
interesting piece of real estate,' said one Vietnam-based US businessman.
'That's going to be the most interesting strip in Saigon.'
US State Department officials say this clears the way for the opening of
diplomatic liaison offices in the two countries' capitals by the end of the
year, a target set by Hanoi and an important step in establishing full
relations.
President Bill Clinton removed the US trade embargo in February, but
settling the issue of outstanding governmental and commercial claims had to
come before any initiative on closer relations, Hanoi-based US officials
say.
Commercial assets seized by victorious communist forces and worth about
Dollars 230m include offices owned by US banks such as Citibank and Chase
Manhattan, as well as insurer American International Group.
Caterpillar, the construction equipment maker, estimates that hundreds of
its earth-moving vehicles are still in use in the southern part of the
country. Diplomats say agreements on commercial assets would be settled
shortly, although this has not held up US banks' moves into Vietnam.
Chase Manhattan last week received approval to open a representative office
in Hanoi. Citibank and Bank of America were awarded full branches for Hanoi
late last month.
It is unclear what will become of the former US mission building, as US
diplomatic representation will be focused on the capital Hanoi. The last job
handled by US diplomats in Saigon was to try to co-ordinate the evacuation
of the city's few remaining Americans and some Vietnamese from the
building's rooftop. The operation quickly dissolved into a panicked struggle
for places on departing helicopters. An Air America official was pictured
punching one Vietnamese clutching at a helicopter footplate as it was taking
off.
Reuter adds: Vietnam's central bank said it had appointed Bank of Tokyo and
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group as advisers on the restructuring of
the country's medium- and long-term commercial bank debt.

FT  13 DEC 94 / UK, China seek accord on Hong Kong appeal court: Simon
Holberton on the background to tomorrow's talks as Britain seeks
clarification of Beijing's attitude
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When British and Chinese officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs assemble
tomorrow in the ornate state rooms of the Foreign Office in London, the
question the British will want answered is what Mr Lu Ping, China's top
official on Hong Kong matters, meant by his recent comments about the
colony's future court of final appeal.
An attempt to establish such a court in Hong Kong before the 1997 handover
to China has been an object of British and Hong Kong government policy since
1988.
Both these governments regard the early establishment of the court - which
will replace the judicial committee of Britain's Privy Council - as vital to
their aim of ensuring the continuity of the legal system in Hong Kong.
The court is at the top of the agenda for the London session of the Joint
Liaison Group, a bilateral body set up in 1995 to handle the detailed
implementation of the handover. China was given a copy of the draft bill for
the creation of the court in May and the Hong Kong government has been
anxious for Beijing's response.
Time is running out. The Hong Kong government, which had hoped to establish
the court last year, wants to see it up and running by the summer of 1996.
To meet this commencement date a bill will need to be introduced into the
Legislative Council (LegCo), the colony's law making body, during February
and passed by July.
At the weekend, Mr Lu doled out succour and woe in equal measure. He
reassured Hong Kong officials by saying that China still stood by a 1991
agreement with the British and hoped it could be implemented.
This provided for the establishment of the court before 1997 and specified
that only one of the court's five judges could come from a foreign common
law jurisdiction.
But the remainder of Mr Lu's comments will have Mr Hugh Davies, the UK head
of the JLG, pressing Mr Zhao Jihua, his Chinese counterpart, for
clarification.
Mr Lu said that the judges appointed to the court would have to be
reconfirmed by Hong Kong's post-1997 government.
This question over the judiciary's continuity would appear to run counter to
Article 93 of the Basic Law - Hong Kong's post-1997 constitution - which
states that judges appointed before the handover 'may all remain in
employment'. Furthermore, under the 1991 deal, Britain conceded China's wish
to restrict the number of foreign judges on the court in exchange for the
court's early establishment and passage through 1997.
A senior Hong Kong official overseeing policy towards the court said Mr Lu
might have been suggesting by his comments that the post-1997 government had
to be seen to have authority - 'it needs to make appointments'.
He conceded, however, that in Beijing 'there is tremendous touchiness about
sovereignty' of which the remarks about judges may be just another example.
'That's what we've got to get sorted out (in London) this week.'
One western diplomat saw in Mr Lu's comments simply delaying tactics. 'I
expect it is more in China's interest to have the court established after
1997 than before. Then they can have who they want on it,' he said.
The uncertainty generated by Mr Lu's comments is just one of the many
problems facing the Hong Kong government. Its proposal for a court of final
appeal has been opposed by the Hong Kong Bar Association and many members of
LegCo. In 1991 LegCo voted down the Anglo-Chinese deal on the court, only
weeks after it was secured, by a margin of 34 to 11.
The Law Society, which represents solicitors, has supported the government's
initiative.
The opposition of the barristers and legislators turns on the nature of the
1991 Anglo-Chinese deal. They say it is in violation of the 1984 Joint
Declaration and the Basic Law, both of which said the court 'may as required
invite judges from other common law jurisdictions' to sit on its benches.
The lawyers say the word 'judges' meant more than one of the five could come
from a foreign jurisdiction. The government denies this, adding that the
1991 agreement was an elaboration of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law
and so supersedes both.
Mr Ronny Wong QC, president of the Bar Association, will have none of this.
'We see any violation of the Joint Declaration and Basic Law as
fundamental,' he said.
'We believe that the spirit of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law was
to allow flexibility and that it is opportunistic to accept the 1991
agreement,' he said.
'Some cases may not need any overseas judges, such as New Territories land
claims, whereas other cases, such as marine, may need more than one.'
Mr Martin Lee's Democrats, the pro-democracy party in LegCo, has vowed to
amend the government's bill and substitute the wording concerning local and
foreign judges with the more acceptable text from the Basic Law. It has also
won support from some of the pro-business Liberal party politicians.
Mr Lee believes that it is not in Hong Kong's interest to set up what he
regards as a bad court. If the government's bill ever reaches LegCo he may
prevail, at least until 1997.

was 77 and had served in many posts, including head of the State Planning
Commission and of the leading group in charge of finance and the economy
under the Communist party Central Committee. He had also been a member of
the politburo standing committee. Like many of his colleagues Mr Yao, a
graduate of Beijing's prestigious Qinghua university, was purged at the
onset of the Cultural Revolution in 1966. In latter years he was seen as a
conservative voice among older leaders, urging caution in economic reforms.

<TEXT>
Mr Lee Kuan Kew, Singapore's elder statesman, has filed a civil suit for
damages against Mr Christopher Lingle, a US academic, and executives of the
International Herald Tribune newspaper over an article Mr Lingle wrote, a
Tribune official said yesterday. On Saturday the Tribune published an
apology to Mr Lee and to the Singapore judiciary over remarks in the October
7 article by Mr Lingle, who was then a professor at the National University
of Singapore. The suit is in addition to a contempt of court action by the
Singapore government over Mr Lingle's opinion piece. The contempt case is
scheduled for a Singapore high court hearing on January 9. A court date has
not been set for Mr Lee's civil suit, the Tribune said.
Mr Bruce Singer, the paper's spokesman, said Mr Lee claimed he had been
libelled. Mr Lee, now senior minister, was prime minister from 1959 to 1990.
He has brought the suit against Mr Lingle as well as Mr Michael Richardson,
the paper's Asia editor, and Mr John Vinocur, the executive editor and vice
president, Mr Singer said. In its December 10-11 edition, the paper
apologised over remarks in the article that, among other comments critical
of Asian governments, referred to unnamed 'intolerant regimes' and attacked
their judiciaries.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The New Zealand Reserve Bank will continue to lean towards monetary
restraint because of the country's strong economic growth, running at 6.1
per cent, the governor, Mr Don Brash, said early today. The Reserve Bank is
facing its most testing time since it was placed in charge of monetary
policy in 1989 because of strong growth and concerns about inflation
pressures. Mr Brash, who has signed a price stability contract with the
government under which he must keep inflation below 2 per cent, agreed his
'job was on the line' if his handling of monetary policy failed. He said he
had decided against further tightening monetary policy at present because of
sharp rises in interest rates over the past two weeks. Short-term rates have
risen by around 1.25 points to 10 per cent, matched by a strong lift in the
value of the dollar. This followed a statement to market dealers in late
November that the bank wanted firmer monetary conditions.
'By enforcing restraint the bank is aiming to ensure more steady and
sustained economic growth and avoid the disruptive boom-bust cycle New
Zealand has endured in the past, ' Mr Brash said. He told a news conference
he expected trading banks would now lift their home mortgage rates, but it
was up to them to decide much.

came two days before a meeting in Paris of western donors which will examine
Kenya's economic performance in the last year and, if satisfied, pledge aid
for the next year. The president said such investment would not exceed 20
per cent of total company share capital. Mr Moi said he had also directed
his minister of finance to allow private foreign exchange bureaux from

FT  13 DEC 94 / Bosnia dominates Islamic conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The crisis in Bosnia is expected to dominate the summit meeting of the
Islamic Conference Organisation which opens in Casablanca today, but
disputes over Middle East issues are already threatening to sour the
atmosphere.
Bosnian representatives were confident yesterday that the 52-member
organisation would adopt a strongly worded resolution, including a call for
the dispatch of military aid.
Mr Nerkuz Arifhodzic, the Bosinian ambassador to the Maghreb states, said
the draft resolution also outlined a plan of diplomatic, political and
economic action.
'I have no doubt that it will meet with a very good response at the summit
and help define a concrete and effective programme of action,' he said.
The ambassador added that there was a determination among the member states
to help Bosnia 'in its legitimate self-defence and to give it the right to
resist'. Members of the ICO have been urging the west to lift the arms
embargo on Bosnia, although few have advocated breaking it unilaterally.
Mr Amr Moussa, Egyptian foreign minister, said yesterday that it was immoral
to prevent the Bosnians being given the right to defend themselves. He added
that the conference would repeat its previous offer to send peacekeeping
troops to the area.
However, rows between Iraq and Kuwait, and between Jordan and the Palestine
Liberation Organisation over their roles in the future of Jerusalem, have
proved difficult to resolve in the preparatory ministerial meeting.
Kuwait is pressing for a strongly worded resolution confirming that
sanctions against Iraq should not be lifted, while the Baghdad government
was demanding a reference to the suffering of its people as a result of the
sanctions.
Jordan is meanwhile asking the conference to affirm its historic role in
administering the Islamic sites in Jerusalem until such time as the
Palestinians 'are able to assume their sovereignty over the city'.
Representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organisation have countered that
such a declaration would jeopardise their claim to the eastern half of
Jerusalem.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Iran gains in scramble for central Asia: John Barham and
Scheherazade Daneshkhu on strategic struggle with Turkey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM and SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision last month by the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan to give
Tehran a share in a Dollars 7.4bn international consortium to develop its
oil fields in the Caspian Sea was a triumph for Iran but a setback for
Turkey as the two historical enemies compete to extend their influence over
the young republics of the Caucasus and central Asia.
Iran was not involved in the deal at first but after a visit to Baku by Mr
Gholamreza Agazadeh, Iran's oil minister, Azerbaijan, which holds 20 per
cent of the shares in the consortium, agreed to transfer a quarter of them
to Iran - giving Tehran a 5 per cent stake in the consortium - in exchange
for financial and technical assistance.
Turkey has been trying to raise its 1.75 per cent stake in the consortium,
which includes British Petroleum, Russia's Lukoil, and US oil companies.
Apart from outmanoeuvring Turkey, Iran's involvement has caused 'great
concern' according to a Russian foreign ministry official because of fears
that Iran and other littoral states of the Caspian Sea will conclude a
pipeline deal to carry oil through Iran and outside Russia's control.
Iran's deal with Azerbaijan highlights the limits of Turkey's much-vaunted
cultural, linguistic and religious ties with central Asia. After the Soviet
Union collapsed, Turkey hoped the republics - Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan - would form a sub-regional bloc
under its leadership. President Suleyman Demirel envisaged a new regional
sub-bloc under Turkish leadership. He spoke of 'a Turkic world stretching
from the Adriatic Sea to the Great Wall of China'.
In October he hosted a second summit of regional leaders in Istanbul.
However, officials realise nowadays that expectations on both sides were
raised too high, acknowledging that Turkey is financially and technically
unable to meet many of the republics' needs.
Mr Mumtaz Soysal, who resigned as foreign minister last week, said Turkey's
interest in the region was 'mainly sentimental'. Policy was being developed
'under pressure from public opinion and does not yield much profit. It is a
drain on our economy for the time being.'
Troubles at home - high inflation, Kurdish insurgency and growing Islamic
fundamentalism - have not helped. Yet Turkish officials still view central
Asia as a strategic and trade priority. The Caucasus and central Asia are
rich in oil, gas and minerals and could yet develop into an attractive
export market.
Turkish companies have signed Dollars 3.7bn-worth of construction contracts
there in the last three years and trade has risen rapidly to Dollars 640m a
year. Ankara has a Dollars 100m a year aid budget. Turkey broadcasts to the
region from its new Turksat satellite. Over 10,000 students from the
republics study in Turkey.
The west viewed positively Turkey's drive to extend its influence in the
region because it feared that Iran would export militant Islam to the
republics. But the Iranian government has shown greater pragmatism than
this. Its strategic aim is to ensure that Turkey, and through it the west,
does not gain enough of a foothold to pose a security threat. Tehran has
also operated cautiously for fear of fanning secessionist tendencies within
its own borders.
It has sought to exert political influence by trying to revive the old Silk
Route with a series of transport and trade agreements with these landlocked
states. Here it has an important advantage over Turkey, since it shares a
long border with the central Asian states and with Azerbaijan.
Its initiatives include a number of oil and gas agreements. Iran and
Turkmenistan have signed a co-operation agreement to lay a pipeline to carry
Turkmen gas to Europe through Iran. An agreement has also been signed for
the transfer of 2m tonnes of crude oil from Kazakhstan through the Caspian
Sea to Iran and the two countries are also discussing an oil pipeline.
Weekly flights between the capitals of the republics and Tehran have been
established, more than 10 new border crossings have been opened, roads have
been repaired and projects for bridges and new roads prepared.
Construction has begun of a railway from Tedzhen in Turkmenistan through the
Iranian border city of Sarakhs to Mashhad, where it will connect with the
rest of the Iranian railway system leading west towards Europe or south to
the Persian Gulf. Ports are also being built or expanded along the Caspian
Sea, and new shipping routes created.
The route of future pipelines carrying oil and gas from the region to
markets in Europe is vital. All three rivals believe infrastructure links
will help determine strategic and trade links. With Russia, Turkey and Iran
all competing, Russia has the advantage because of its continued
relationship with the central Asian states since the break-up of the Soviet
Union.
Despite Turkey's declared interest in the area, the Azerbaijan-Iran oil deal
shows it still lacks clear means of implementing its objectives. Mr Sami
Kohen, a veteran Turkish foreign affairs columnist, says the post-Soviet
world offers 'new opportunities for Turkey to emerge as a regional power.
But first it must put its domestic house in order.'

FT  13 DEC 94 / Ousted former premier joins Thai coalition: Chatichai's move
comes after defection by five parties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
General Chatichai Choonhavan, the former Thai prime minister whose
government was overthrown in a military coup d'etat on the grounds of
corruption in 1991, yesterday agreed in principle to bring his Chart Pattana
(National Development) party into the coalition government.
Mr Chuan Leekpai, the present Democrat party prime minister, was forced to
woo Gen Chatichai after one of the five parties in the ruling coalition
defected last week.
The defection of Gen Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's New Aspiration party left Mr
Chuan in charge of only a minority of the seats in parliament. Without an
alliance with one of the opposition parties, Mr Chuan would probably be
obliged to dissolve the assembly and call an early general election.
Yesterday's provisional deal - an agreement on the cabinet seats to be
allocated to the new coalition partner has yet to be finalised - has raised
eyebrows among even those Thais used to the byzantine negotiations that
characterise the country's corruption-prone politics.
Only days ago, Chart Pattana solemnly declared along with other opposition
parties that it would never join Mr Chuan's coalition, and yesterday's
announcement prompted accusations of hypocrisy and betrayal from Gen
Chatichai's former opposition colleagues.
Mr Chuan and Gen Chatichai are longstanding rivals, but the two sides are
justifying their plans for an uncomfortable marriage of convenience by
pointing to the need for stability. 'Foreign investment and economic
development have been disrupted by the halting of government,' Gen Chatichai
told reporters yesterday. 'So we decided to help to uphold the stability of
government in the national interest.'
Stock market investors have been watching the political situation nervously,
and on Friday the Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 2.4 per cent
following Gen Chavalit's defection and reports that he had held talks with
fellow army generals. The market was closed yesterday for a holiday.
Yesterday's provisional agreement marks the end of a two-year period during
which political parties were divided into 'angels' or 'devils' in the Thai
press, depending on whether they supported or opposed pro-democracy
demonstrations in 1992 during which 50 protestors were shot dead by Thai
troops.
Mr Chuan's coalition, elected in September 1992 for a four-year term
following the violence in May, was composed largely of 'angelic' members of
parliament. In spite of having being overthrown by the armed forces a year
earlier, Gen Chatichai and his supporters were pro-military 'devils'.
Even before the coalition's deal with Chart Pattana has been finalised,
commentators are starting to predict its collapse because another party  -
Palang Dharma (Buddhist Force) - will have profound differences of opinion
with Gen Chatichai and his followers.

<TEXT>
Police have arrested a top company official in the biggest corruption case
in the history of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Mr Zhu Jianping, 48, deputy
general manager of Shanghai Rubber Belt, allegedly earned Yn800,000 (Pounds
60,000) by selling shares in his own company. The announcement of his arrest
adds to the woes of a market tarnished by speculation and battered by a wave
of selling in the past several months. 'He's nothing more than a worm in the
reform process,' one prosecutor said.

<TEXT>
Japan's new opposition party faced its first electoral test on Sunday - and
failed it spectacularly. The New Frontier party, formed by the merger of
nine opposition groups, was crushed by the Liberal Democratic party in local
elections in the eastern prefecture of Ibaraki, near Tokyo. Voters in the
traditional stronghold of the LDP rejected the message of reform preached by
the NFP despite the recent arrests on bribery charges of both the
prefectural governor, and a former construction minister and national
parliamentary representative from Ibaraki.

Due to the introduction of the Single Market, EC countries are currently
changing to a new system of compiling trade statistics. All trade
figures are seasonally adjusted, except for the Italian series and the
German current account. Imports can be derived by subtracting the
visible trade balance from exports. Export and import data are
calculated on the FOB (free on board) basis, except for German and
Italian imports which use the CIF method (including carriage, insurance
and freight charges). German data up to and including June 1990, shown
in italics, refer to the former West Germany. The nominal effective
exchange rates are period averages of Bank of England trade-weighted
indices. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA from national government
and central bank sources.

FT  13 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Japan, US settle flat glass dispute -
Tokyo to monitor distribution networks but avoids numerical targets

Japan and the US yesterday settled a long-standing trade dispute over
Tokyo's flat glass market by agreeing measures to improve foreign access.
Japan's flat glass market had been one of the last unresolved issues in the
bilateral framework trade negotiations launched a year and a half ago.
Vehicles and vehicle parts remain the most pressing dispute.
To the clear satisfaction of the Japanese government, the agreement is in
line with its insistence that numerical targets not be used and that all
benefits be on a most favoured nation basis.
'Japan and the US, which make up 40 per cent of the world's GNP, have great
responsibilities in managing the world economy,' Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto,
Japan's trade and industry minister, said yesterday as he announced the
agreement.
'Our government will continue to reject managed trade and will continue to
contribute to the world free trade system through the transition to World
Trade Organisation and the Japan-US framework talks,' he emphasised. Mr
Hashimoto was referring to US demands that the Japanese government agree to
set specific targets for foreign market access, which Japan has criticised
as akin to managing trade.
Ms Charlene Barshefsky, deputy trade representative, said although were no
numerical targets the pact was explicit that the opening of the distribution
system should proceed progressively and that 'token changes' with increased
imports from overseas Japanese affiliated companies would not be sufficient.
Ms Barshefsky said the deal would be monitored by a 'complex data system'
overseen by Miti. 'The agreement ensures that Miti will have a direct role
with respect to helping insure that the diversification process takes
place.'
The flat glass dispute arose following US claims that the Japanese market
was, in all practical respects, closed to foreign suppliers as a result of
the dominance of three large producers and their close relations to the
country's wholesalers.
A broad agreement on flat glass trade was reached at the end of September
when the two countries agreed on measures to improve foreign access to
Japanese government procurement programmes and the insurance market.
However, the issues of numerical targets and foreign suppliers remained
unresolved.
Yesterday's agreement calls for the Japanese government to use foreign-made
flat glass products in construction projects which it funds. Such projects
would introduce the benefits of foreign glass to a wider Japanese audience.
Mr Steve Farrar of Guardian Industries, one of the largest US glass
producers, said the agreement was 'a good deal' because Japan's distribution
system would be 'opened up'. He was also pleased that Japan would need to
demonstrate that Japanese manufacturers and distributors had fulfilled their
statements of intent.
The issue of capital affiliation of foreign companies which increase their
imports to Japan, another sticking point, was also resolved to Japan's
satisfaction.
'I would like to stress that we have consistently carried out our position
of observance of basic free trade principles and international trade and
investment rules ensuring national treatment,' Mr Hashimoto said.
The US had been concerned that overseas subsidiaries of Japanese companies
would be the main beneficiaries of any increase in glass imports and had
been calling for a way to identify the capital affiliation of importers.
Japan argued that this would discriminate against Japanese subsidiaries and
other foreign companies.
Following the glass agreement, access to Japan's vehicle and vehicle parts
markets is the last sectoral issue in the framework negotiations.
Vehicles and parts are perhaps the most contentious issue as they make up
two-thirds of the US trade deficit with Japan.

SKF, the leading manufacturer of roller bearings, yesterday announced plans
to build a factory in China in a joint venture with Shanghai Bearing Corp.
The Swedish group will hold 60 per cent of the new company, SKF Automotive
Bearings, and invest a total of SKr100m (Dollars 13.3m). The venture expects
to supply car makers in China. The new factory will be in Shanghai and
should be operational by mid-1995. SKF says the unit should enable its
Chinese sales to double from this year's SKr280m by the end of the decade.

United Technologies (UTC), the US aero-engines, helicopters, lifts and
air-conditioning group, is forming another 13 joint ventures in China. The
new ventures are in several regions of China and follow 10 existing UTC
ventures. For the first time the ventures will include Pratt &amp; Whitney,
UTC's aero-engine producer, and Sikorsky, its helicopter company. UTC's
sales in China soared from Dollars 79.1m in 1989 to an estimated Dollars
520.6m this year, with the Otis lift and escalator business accounting for
Dollars 213.3m. Otis and Carrier, the air-conditioning company, currently
have four Chinese joint ventures apiece, and are each in the process of
forming three more. UTC claims Chinese market shares of 24 per cent and 20.5
per cent for elevators and air-conditioning respectively. Mr George David,
president and chief executive, predicted strong growth for both businesses
in China. P&amp;W's sales in China have risen from Dollars 29.3m in 1989 to an
estimated Dollars 198.8m this year. Mr David said there was not room for
'three engine companies on one wing' - a reference to the fierce battle
between P&amp;W, General Electric of the US and Rolls-Royce of the UK for engine
orders on the Boeing 777.

Africa's newest airline, Alliance, was launched yesterday in Dar-es-Salaam,
Tanzania, as a joint venture between the Tanzanian and Ugandan governments,
their national carriers, and South African Airways. The initiative is one of
the first concrete benefits to other African countries following South
Africa's reintegration into the continent. Alliance was first mooted seven
years ago as a joint venture between Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia but did not
get off the ground until SAA was approached following Zambia's withdrawal.
SAA will hold 40 per cent of the new company, with Air Tanzania and Uganda
Airlines owning 10 per cent each and the two governments 5 per cent each.
The remainder will be held by east African private investors. The South
African carrier will be responsible for equipment and maintenance, and
provide crew. Alliance plans to operate services to and from various east
African destinations. Its first flight is scheduled for March 1995 and
initial international routes will be to London, Bombay, Dubai and
Johannesburg.

Daewoo Electronics of South Korea will build its biggest foreign production
complex in Poland as part of its strategy to capture 10 per cent of the
European market for consumer electronics by 2000. The production site at
Pruszkow, 25km west of Warsaw, will manufacture consumer electronic goods,
home appliances and electronic components.
Production will amount to Dollars 200m in annual sales with 60 per cent of
output being exported to the rest of Europe. Construction at Pruszkow, where
Daewoo already makes colour televisions, will be completed by 1996. Plans
include the annual production of 100,000 washing machines, 200,000
refrigerators and 200,000 car audio systems. Colour television production
will be increased from 400,000 to 600,000.
It is the second largest recent investment in Europe by a Korean electronics
company, following Samsung's decision to build a manufacturing plant in
north-east England at a cost of Dollars 700m. Daewoo, which produces VCRs in
Northern Ireland and colour televisions, picture tubes and microwave ovens
in Lorraine, France, said it selected Poland because of its low-cost skilled
labour, good industrial infrastructure, political stability and central
location in Europe.

<TEXT>
Tariff protection for Indonesia's first olefin products plant is emerging as
a test case of Indonesia's commitment to free trade.
The debate on protection for the petrochemicals plant follows last month's
Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation summit hosted by President Suharto, at
which he emerged as an enthusiastic supporter of free trade.
The Apec declaration, signed by heads of state from 18 governments including
the US, agreed to draw up concrete plans in the next year for free trade and
investment in the Pacific rim region by 2020.
Mr Peter Gontha, a well-connected entrepreneur, has submitted a request to
the Indonesian government for tariffs of between 35 and 40 per cent on
imports of olefin products, petroleum-based chemicals widely used to
manufacture textiles.
The tariffs would protect the Chandra Asri plant, due to come on stream next
year, from cheaper Singaporean, Malaysian, Japanese and South Korean olefin
imports. Mr Gontha argues the protection is necessary because it will take
several years before Chandra Asri becomes profitable.
However, many economists say protection would undermine President Suharto's
commitment to free trade and the government's efforts to liberalise the
economy. The issue is further complicated because President Suharto's son,
Mr Bambang Trihatmodjo, is a shareholder in the Chandra Asri project.
The issue of protection for the plant has become a hotly debated topic among
government ministers. Mr Mar'ie Muhammad, Indonesia's minister of finance,
has made clear he is not in favour of the proposal.
The private sector has also been protesting. P T Teijin Indonesia Fibre, a
Japanese synthetic fibres manufacturer, said its competitiveness would be
hampered if President Suharto decided to impose import duties as high as 35
per cent or 40 per cent on olefin imports.
'If the government wants to satisfy Chandra Asri, which wants to rake in
profits easily, just go ahead. But the government has to be ready if
intermediate and downstream industries drop off one after another,' Mr Kikuo
Hori, Teijin's president, was quoted as saying.
Officials at Teijin are asking the Indonesian government to consider the
matter seriously . A hearing on the protection is scheduled for today.

FT  13 DEC 94 / World Trade News: China pinches Brazilian shoe exporters -
Lucrative US market is being undercut by eastern suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Calcados Tropicalia , a medium-sized shoe manufacturer in the small town of
Franca, 400km from Sao Paulo, has laid off more than a fifth of its
workforce since July.
For the area's shoe exporters it is likely to get worse. 'As exports
continue to fall there are going to be more job losses in Franca,' warns
Tropicalia director Mr Paulo Henrique Cintra.
The job cuts stem from a dramatic turnaround in the prospects for Brazil's
shoe export industry. After years of growth, climaxing last year with
exports of nearly Dollars 2bn, overseas sales are being squeezed by growing
Chinese competition and local currency appreciation.
While Brazil's exports face growing pressure at the cheap end, its middle
range niche, where it specialises in women's shoes, appears to be safe in
the short term because of competitive advantages of relatively cheap labour,
good quality and established distribution networks in the key US market.
However, to protect its position in this middle market analysts warn that
Brazilian manufacturers must continue to cut costs and improve productivity,
which will probably mean more job losses and contracting out of services.
Last year Brazil produced 562m pairs of shoes, behind only China and Taiwan,
and exported 183m, 80 per cent to the US where it was the third largest
exporter. Exports were Dollars 1.95bn compared to Dollars 1.47bn in 1992.
This year, however, companies expect sales to fall 12-15 per cent. Next year
business could be even worse as the effects of a 15 per cent appreciation in
the new Real currency, launched in July, feed into higher export prices.
In response, many exporters are switching attention to the local market,
where demand has increased with a fall in the inflation rate. But
manufacturers believe the current high demand will slip back by early next
year, putting more pressure on exporters.
These companies, who began to sell abroad in large numbers in the 1970s
following export incentives from Brazil's military governments, have
benefited from cheap labour and a large local supply of leather.
But today they are looking over their backs at even lower-cost rivals such
as China which are targeting the bottom end of the market, often sandals and
cheap shoes with an export price of Dollars 5-Dollars 8 supplied to US
chains like K-Mart. This market represents a quarter of Brazil's shoe
exports.
Because of the appreciation of the Real, many Brazilian exporters have
recently raised prices by 10-15 per cent. However, higher prices are losing
Brazil export orders.
Mr Peter Mangione, president of the New York-based Footwear Distributors and
Retailers of America, warns: 'The bottom end of the market is extremely
price sensitive and these price increases mean buyers are switching to China
or India.'
The problems have led to dozens of factory closures and the loss of about
10,000 jobs this year in Vale dos Sinos, a shoemaking centre in the southern
state of Rio Grande do Sul, where about 75,000 workers are employed.
In the middle range market, in which export prices are about Dollars 10 and
US retail prices Dollars 40-Dollars 50, Brazil still occupies a competitive
position. In this market, which represents half its shoe exports, Brazil is
ahead of the Chinese on quality and the Europeans on price.
Although these competitive advantages have allowed Brazilian companies to
pass on some of their higher costs, the longer term outlook is less secure.
'Unless there is a severe adjustment by Brazilian industry in the next few
years, the Chinese will catch up with them or the Italians and Spanish will
target that middle range niche,' says Mr Mangione.
Industry appeals for more government help have not been answered, partly
because a strong currency is part of the government's anti-inflation
strategy. Also, the opening of the economy since 1990 has meant a reduction
in government protection of industry.
Companies believe the only way forward is to continue the process of
improving quality and productivity by, for example, increasing the
contracting out of jobs like sewing. In Franca the number of unofficial
family-run workshops serving factories has jumped more than threefold to
about 1,000 in the last three years.
Exporters are also attempting to improve quality and the variety of models.
'Our advantage is that because of our long experience in dealing with the
overseas market we have become very versatile in design and we can respond
quickly to requests for different models,' says Mr Miguel Heitor Betarello,
a director of Franca's biggest shoe exporter Calcados HB.
The company sees itself competing more with Europeans at the upper end of
the market in the future. This, Mr Mangione believes, would be a mistake.
'The industry should stick to the Dollars 50 retail market where it is
competitive. As you move up the price spectrum the volumes are much smaller
and the competition from the Europeans is extremely tough,' he says.

Hungary's Socialist-Liberal coalition government won all but one of the
country's 19 counties as well as several large towns in Sunday's nationwide
local elections, but fell short of the resounding 72 per cent victory it
achieved in last May's general elections, according to partial results
released last night. With 94 per cent of votes counted, the ruling Socialist
party and its junior coalition partner, the Free Democrats, looked set to
win a two-thirds majority in two counties and in Budapest and to win a
simple majority in all other counties except for one. In Budapest, where 20
per cent of Hungary's 10.5m population lives, Mr Gabor Demszky, a Free
Democrat, was easily re-elected for a second four-year term as mayor. The
Socialists won 32 per cent of the capital's general assembly, with the Free
Democrats and centre-right parties, which, for the first time, fielded joint
candidates, in joint second place, both with 29 per cent. Independent
candidates were the big winners in mayoral contests in the rest of the
country, taking more than 80 per cent of the 3,150 posts nationwide.

President Leonid Kuchma yesterday dismissed Ukraine's senior energy official
for failing to make payments on arrears of Dollars 713.5m (Pounds 457m) owed
for gas supplies from Turkmenistan. By sacking Mr Mykhailo Kovalko, chairman
of the state oil and gas committee, Mr Kuchma sent a strong signal, both to
his own bureaucracy and to the west, that he is serious about pursuing the
radical economic reforms he unveiled in the autumn. Ukraine has won
substantial foreign aid to back these reforms, much of it earmarked to help
pay for the fuel it receives from Russia and Turkmenistan. Mr Kuchma accused
Mr Kovalko of failing to make payments due under a seven-year debt
rescheduling agreement Ukraine reached with Turkmenistan last month. Kiev
has since paid Turkmenistan Dollars 41m, using some of the Dollars 371m in
aid from the International Monetary Fund.
Ukraine also owes Russia about Dollars 1.4bn, much of it to Gazprom. The
Russian gas giant has no choice but to supply Ukraine because 97 per cent of
its gas exports flow through a Ukrainian pipeline - a serious defect in the
eyes of potential western investors. Mr Kuchma has insisted that he will not
tolerate corruption in the potentially lucrative energy sector.

<TEXT>
Mr Erik Jarve, the president of the Oslo stock exchange, was yesterday
dismissed by the board because of irregularities connected to his work. The
move took the market by surprise but was not announced until after trading
had closed. The bourse said Mr Jarve's irregularities had nothing to do with
securities transactions or with the bourse's function in the securities
market. Mr Kjell Froensdal, executive vice-president of the bourse, has been
appointed interim president until a replacement for Mr Jarve can be named.
He said yesterday the board had only in the past few days uncovered the
irregularities connected to Mr Jarve and hinted they had to do with Mr Jarve
mixing his own business with that of the bourse. KPMG Peat Marwick, the
auditor, has been engaged by the bourse to undertake a thorough review of
the allegations, but Mr Froensdal could not say if the matter would be
referred to Norwegian police for investigation. Mr Jarve joined the Oslo
bourse 26 years ago and was appointed president in 1977. He sought to end
the bourse's reputation for insider trading and was also instrumental in
modernising the exchange's rules, regulations and technical functions to
bring it up to the latest European standards. Foreign investors have long
complained of the risks associated with investing in Norwegian securities
because of an alleged high rate of insider trading cases in a small business
community with many cross-board representations and cross-shareholdings.

<TEXT>
A former French presidential aide, who was being investigated in a
wiretapping scandal, has been found hanged, police officials said yesterday.
Mr Pierre-Yves Guezou, a retired officer in the paramilitary Gendarmerie
police, was one of five former aides of Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand to be suspected of illegally tapping telephones in a case which
dates back to the mid-1980s. Mr Gilles Menage, chairman of the state
utilitity Electricite de France and former head of President Mitterrand's
private presidential office, is among those being investigated. The
investigation centres on alleged invasion of privacy in connection with the
tapping of telephones of journalists, politicians and an actress by the
anti-terrorist unit of the Elysee palace between 1983 and 1986. Last week,
an investigating magistrate informed the five former aides that they were
under formal investigation, a first step towards a possible trial. The death
of Mr Guezou follows other suicides among the entourage of President
Mitterrand, whose term expires next spring. Last April, Mr Francois de
Grossouvre, a former security aide to the president and latterly in charge
of the Elysee's hunting estates, was found dead. In May 1993, Mr Pierre
Beregovoy, the former Socialist prime minister, killed himself.

France yesterday gave the green light to several airlines, including TAT
European Airlines, an affiliate of British Airways, to operate some of the
country's most profitable internal air routes. A statement from the
transport ministry said that TAT could operate services between Marseilles
and Orly airport in southern Paris and from Toulouse to Orly from January
next year. AOM, the French domestic airline, has been granted a licence to
fly between Marseilles and Orly, while Air Liberte won approval to operate
the Toulouse-Orly route. The approval follows a protracted battle between
the carriers and the French government, which has resisted the deregulation
of domestic routes. An order from the European Commission, however, and a
rejection of an appeal from the French government by the European Court of
Justice, forced the liberalisation of the routes. The French transport
ministry said it was also considering a request by Euralair, the small
domestic carrier, to operate the Orly-Toulouse route. According to
officials, the airline needs to supply further financial information before
approval can be granted.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Soares seeks battleground for last fight: Portugal's
Socialist president has declared war against the centre-right government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The opposing politics and contrasting personalities of President Mario
Soares and prime minister Anibal Cavaco Silva embody conflicting sides of
the Portuguese psyche. For almost a decade they achieved a precarious
harmony that resulted in a lasting and fruitful stability.
But the fragile unity collapsed this month when Mr Soares, a Socialist,
marked his 70th birthday with a vehement attack on the centre-right
government. Portugal's political institutions are now openly at war,
upsetting the country's balance as it prepares for a general election next
October and a presidential ballot in early 1996.
In an interview in the Diario de Noticias newspaper, Mr Soares said nine
years of majority government by Mr Cavaco Silva's Social Democratic Party
(PSD) had placed 'excessive powers in the hands of one man'. He was
concerned over a growing perception that Portugal was slipping towards a
'dictatorship of the majority'. Dictatorship is an emotive word in Portugal.
Mr Soares's comparison of today's political climate with the 1926 revolt
that ushered in 48 years of authoritarian rule was more than the PSD could
bear. Mr Cavaco Silva summoned party leaders who produced a statement
amounting to an official declaration of hostilities with the president.
Mr Soares had abandoned the role of neutral arbiter for which the country
elected him, the PSD said, and was actively intervening in party politics to
try to influence the outcome of the general election. He was persecuting the
PSD, promoting instability and dividing the country.
After nine years of smiling deference towards each other - widely advertised
as being for the good of the nation - Mr Soares and Mr Cavaco Silva are
locked in a bare-fisted political combat in which few holds are likely to be
barred.
Mr Cavaco Silva, 56, has an active political future at stake. He is expected
to seek re-election as prime minister next year, but may decide to run for
the presidency instead. But Mr Soares is not eligible under the constitution
for a third consecutive term as president and appears more concerned about
posterity.
The president and the prime minister speak from opposing sides of both the
political debate and the national temperament - and each has equal
legitimacy to do so. Mr Cavaco Silva's government has won two successive
single-party majorities that Portugal's political system was never expected
to produce.
From a hard-working, provincial Roman Catholic family, the prime minister is
valued as a pragmatist who gets things done. Although sometimes dour and
inflexible, he is regarded as honest, upright and frugal. Without making
political comparisons, these are traits the Portuguese have prized in
leaders such as Salazar and General Antonio Ramalho Eanes, president from
1976 to 1986, and who is widely expected to enter the contest to succeed Mr
Soares.
Mr Soares has chosen to close his career with a stinging attack on how he
fears Portugal is evolving. The PSD party machine has taken over the state,
he suggests. Parliament is a powerless mouthpiece of the government and
people cannot get a job unless they belong to the PSD.
Using contested figures, he says the economic gap between Portugal and
Europe is widening, not diminishing as the government promised. The
Portuguese should reflect carefully before electing another majority
government.
But Mr Soares's anti-government ferocity in not an unalloyed gift to Mr
Antonio Guterres, leader of the opposition Socialists. The president's
domination of the political debate has made him a hero of many disaffected
opposition figures but leaves the Socialist party leaders on the sidelines,
looking ineffectual.
Opinion polls put the Socialists only slightly ahead of the PSD, far from
the commanding lead that would make Mr Guterres a strong contender for the
post of prime minister. Mr Cavaco Silva may have lost a good deal of
support. But it is far from clear that Mr Guterres has yet gained enough
credibility to replace him. Mr Soares's chief weapon under the
semi-presidential system is the power to dissolve parliament and call an
early election. He describes this as his 'atomic bomb'.
The president is toying with that bomb more menacingly today that at any
time since he came to office. A spring election would theoretically favour
the Socialists as the economic recovery forecast for next year would still
be immature. But the only concrete grounds for a such a measure is that a
company linked to the Portuguese armed forces is alleged to have serviced
Angolan military aircraft, damaging Portugal's neutrality in its former
colony's civil war.
It would be difficult for Mr Soares to justify an early election on this
issue alone. But dropping hints that he is considering a dissolution of
parliament is an effective way of undermining confidence in the government
as the election campaign gets underway. In this climate, Mr Cavaco Silva may
decide his best tactic is to call the president's bluff and offer his
resignation.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Economic Watch: French prices remain stable
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
France's provisional consumer price index was unchanged in November after a
0.3 per cent rise in October. The November provisional year-on-year increase
was 1.6 per cent, the National Statistics Institute said yesterday.
Analysts' average expectations were for a 0.2 per cent rise for the month
and a 1.7 per cent rise year-on-year. In October consumer prices rose by 0.3
per cent, giving a year-on-year rise of 1.7 per cent. A breakdown of
November's data shows that food prices dropped 0.7 per cent from October,
private sector manufactured goods prices dropped 0.1 per cent, while private
sector service prices rose 0.2 per cent.
Unemployment in Sweden fell to 7.2 per cent in November from 7.4 per cent in
October.
Unemployment rose in Spain from 16.72 to 16.79 per cent of the workforce in
November.
Consumer prices in the Czech Republic rose 0.5 per cent in November from
October and 10.7 per cent from 1993.

<TEXT>
Poland is considering guaranteeing bond issues by companies that win
contracts in the country's motorway programme, Mr Richard Pazura, a deputy
finance minister said at a Financial Times conference on the programme. The
programme aims to build 2,600 km of highways under Build Operate and
Transfer (BOT) agreements at an estimated cost of Dollars 10 bn (Pounds 6
bn) by the year 2010. Already Poland, advised by JP Morgan, the investment
bank, is preparing to launch Dollars 200 m worth of bonds in the country's
first entry into the foreign bond markets.  However, this is the first time
that an official has said the government is looking to private investors and
international financial institutions to provide 85 per cent of the financing
for the programme, Mr Boguslaw Liberadzki, the transoport minister, told the
conference. Preliminary bidding for BOT concessions is expected to open next
February,  with the granting of the first concessions expected early in
1996. The toll highway programme would provide a link across Poland between
the European Union and the countries of the former Soviet Union as well as
between Scandinavia with central Europe and the Balkans. It reflects the
fast growth of car ownership in Poland.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Political fears hit Italian currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The lira fell to a new low against the D-Mark yesterday, as confidence in
the Italian currency was shaken by concerns about the country's public
finances and increasing political instability.
There was uncertainty about the outcome of the Milan magistrates'
interrogation, due today, of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, in an
atmosphere of heightened tension between government and judiciary.
The questioning concerns the alleged payment of bribes to members of the
Guardia di Finanza, the financial police, while Mr Berlusconi was running
his Fininvest business empire. Mr Berlusconi said last night he was
convinced the questioning would establish his innocence and that he had no
intention of resigning.
Financial markets were also concerned that the weak and divided rightwing
coalition was increasingly unlikely to pass a convincing 1995 budget through
parliament. The International Monetary Fund, which last week concluded a
routine review, is understood to have reached the same conclusion.
The lira fell to L1,040 against the D-Mark, from a midday Bank of Italy
fixing of L1,036, and L1,032 on Friday. Share prices on the Milan bourse
fell more than 3 per cent and Italian government bonds also weakened. In
recent days, government ministers have admitted that the 1995 budget
objectives have been rendered impossible by higher than expected interest
rates and unforeseen costs.
But the government's calculations have also been undermined by removing
pensions reform measures from the budget to head off a general strike. The
coalition has failed to hold together on pensions and last week the populist
Northern League pushed through further amendments which will burden the
treasury.
Parliament is due to approve the 1995 budget by the end of the year. But
prominent commentators like Professor Mario Monti, due to become an EU
commissioner in January, have warned that immediate corrective measures will
be necessary. To keep the public deficit close to the planned 8 per cent of
gross domestic product, a minimum of L20,000bn (Pounds 7.8bn) will have to
raised, almost certainly through fresh taxes.
A new twist in the confrontation between Mr Berlusconi and the judiciary
came yesterday with the resignation of Mr Arnaldo Valente, a senior judge
heading a division of the Italian appeals court. He resigned in protest at
the public criticism directed at him following
his ruling that an inquiry by Milan magistrates into corruption in the
Guardia di Finanza must be moved to nearby Brescia to avoid a potential
miscarriage of justice. The Guardia inquiry centred on a widespread practice
of the police receiving bribes from companies in return for benign tax
assessments and favourable inspections of balance sheets.
When announced on November 30, the decision was seen as an attempt to slow
the inquiry, as Brescia lacked the personnel to take on the investigation.
The transfer contributed to the resignation last week of Mr Antonio Di
Pietro, the country's best known magistrate.
Mr Valente claimed he had been victimised by political commentators for a
normal judicial decision. But over the weekend, press reports said the judge
had a son working in the Guardia di Finanza and that he should not have
handled the case.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Estonia takes Treuhand sell-off route: About 80 per cent of
the young Baltic state's enterprises are in private hands after a
German-style search for new investment and management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   BY MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tallinn's Polumeer basketball factory was a central planner's dream. Rubber
mixers, vulcanisers, moulders and weaving machines were imported from Japan
to produce a million balls a year for the Soviet Union.
Alas, before a single orange Polumeer could be made, political winds shifted
and newly independent Estonia's Polumeer lost its guaranteed basketball
market. The plant is now up for sale along with 41 other large state-owned
enterprises under the northernmost Baltic country's fifth and last
international tender.
'One million basketballs a year is a little too much for Estonia (which has
a population of only 1.5m),' says Mr Vano Sarnet, director of the Estonian
Privatisation Agency. 'And the export market is very competitive, divided by
major players long ago. Even Russia only wants western basketballs.'
The two-year-old privatisation programme, based on Germany's Treuhand model,
has sought to salvage just such companies with fresh investment and new
management. 'Through direct sales we can bring effective owners into our
economy much faster than through voucher privatisation,' says Mr Sarnet.
A good bid for Polumeer would include a price estimate, employment and
investment guarantees, and a business plan on how a rubber ball plant can
compete, he says. The agency then selects the winner and monitors the
contract.
By this method, 192 companies have been sold for Dollars 98.2m, putting
about 80 per cent of state property in private hands, excluding transport
and public utilities infrastructure. A further Dollars 65m in capital inputs
has been pledged and 24,400 jobs guaranteed. Foreigners account for about 40
per cent of investment.
The agency plans to finish its work by next year. Public utilities, train
lines, harbours and oil shale industries are to go up for sale then, too.
The World Bank this spring praised Estonia's progress, after a slow start.
But the system has its critics. Mr Ardo Hanson, an American economist who
helped put together Estonia's currency board system, says the privatisation
programme is too subjective and bureaucratic and is ill-suited for
relatively dynamic Estonia.
Once a contract is signed, adds Mr Hanson, 'it's not clear what happens when
the buyer wants to change conditions'.
The World Bank was also worried that the Treuhand model might keep 'leftover
items' from successful privatisations on state books too long  - such as the
basketball factory, whose parent company was broken up and sold off last
year.
The agency has therefore moved to put these companies on the market.
The investor most interested in Polumeer Basketball is Polumeer Toys, a
privatised offshoot of the parent company.
Unlike Russia or Lithuania, where a preferential employee voucher programme
enabled many old directors to keep control over their old factories, in
Estonia they must submit a competitive bid.
Mr Ulo Uisk, who runs the rubber department at Polumeer Toys, is guardedly
stoic. He only concedes that, 'since this is the biggest rubber
manufacturing in Estonia, it is important to keep it going in Estonian
hands.'
While very open to foreign investment - it is the only former Soviet
republic that permits foreigners to own land - Estonia has felt a ripple of
political backlash in recent months.
A public opinion poll this month found that the privatisation agency and the
police were Estonia's least-trusted institutions.
An Estonian analyst notes this stems not only from the large flow of foreign
investment, which doubles every six months, but also from the perception
that criminal domestic groups are legally capitalising on the bid scheme.
Last week Mr Indrek Toome, Estonia's last Soviet prime minister and now
active in real estate, was arrested for offering a Dollars 2,400 bribe. His
role in privatising the large Viru Hotel in central Tallinn fed public
discontent about privatisation.
Under political pressure, the Estonian government last month went ahead with
a voucher privatisation programme, against Treuhand's advice.
Shares in the large Tallinn Department Store were offered on November 9, and
three other prominent companies are due on the market early next year. A
single core investor still will keep a majority in these companies to
provide the corporate governance the Estonian programme's supporters say the
country's neighbours to the east and south lack.
Another benefit from voucher privatisation is an expected boost to Estonia's
fledgling equities market. Mr Alvo Reiner, who runs the Exchange Association
of Estonia, expects the input of capital into the market, not only into
companies, to help open a real stock exchange in a year.
Mr Sarnet defensively says Estonia's scheme at first helped bring in capital
and restructure inefficient companies, such as Polumeer, but adds new
methods may now be needed.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Strong recovery in car sales: Signs of growth in Germany and
Italy boost European figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
West European new car sales increased by 11.9 per cent year-on-year in
November to 926,000, the European motor industry's strongest performance
since the early summer.
The rebound last month was supported by clear signs of recovery in Germany
and Italy combined with continuing strong growth in France, Spain and
Scandinavia.
New car sales in the first 11 months rose by 5.4 per cent to an estimated
11.1m.
In Italy, where sales in the first 11 months, were still 5 per cent lower
than a year ago, new car registrations rose last month by 18.9 per cent
year-on-year to 135,600 according to estimates from the Italian Ministry of
Transport.
German sales rose last month by 8.6 per cent to an estimated 249,000
according to figures from the European Automobile Manufacturers'
Association. In the first 11 months they were virtually unchanged at 2.97m,
an increase of 0.1 per cent.
Sales have continued to rise strongly in France and Spain, where the
governments introduced financial incentives early this year to encourage
scrapping of old cars. In France sales rose by 21.4 per cent in November to
190,700, and by 20.1 per cent year-on-year in Spain to 66,600.
Overall new car sales in November were higher than a year ago in 13 of 17
west European markets. The pace of the recovery was weakened only by the
slowdown in the UK.
The UK new car market was leading west Europe out of recession in the first
half of the year, but sales have declined year-on-year in each of the last
two months.
The strongest growth among the Europe's big six volume carmakers has been
achieved by the PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault groups of France, which have
benefited from the sales recovery at home and in Spain.
PSA Peugeot Citroen raised sales by 10.1 per cent in the first 11 months and
market share to 12.8 per cent from 12.3 per cent a year ago.
The Volkswagen group of Germany, which includes Audi, Seat and Skoda, has
lost ground this year in west Europe, but it staged a strong recovery in
November helped by the recent launch of new models.
VW group registrations rose by an estimated 18.5 per cent last month. It was
outperformed, however, by the Fiat group of Italy, which increased November
sales by 34.9 per cent.
Japanese carmakers continue to lose market share with sales falling by 0.7
per cent in November despite the 11.9 per cent rise in the overall market.

FT  13 DEC 94 / FDP closes ranks around Kinkel: Leader calls confidence vote
after chorus of criticism from party members

<TEXT>
Germany's Free Democrats, desperate to reverse a string of election defeats,
yesterday closed ranks behind Mr Klaus Kinkel, party leader and foreign
minister, after he called a surprise confidence vote at a special party
congress.
Mr Kinkel, who was assailed for weak leadership at the congress on Sunday,
called a snap vote early yesterday morning following an emotional speech in
which he appealed for unity. 'It was very bitter. Very bitter. The words I
heard from the delegates,' he told the packed congress hall in Gera, in the
eastern state of Thuringia.
Despite the unprecedented hostility to his keynote speech on Sunday
afternoon, Mr Kinkel, instead of resigning, threw down the gauntlet to the
delegates. More than 65 per cent of the delegates (390) voted for him, while
185 abstained. 'The vote is acceptable,' a clearly relieved Mr Kinkel said
later.
Members of the party presidium said Mr Kinkel had seriously considered
resigning. But Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister who
had personally chosen Mr Kinkel as his successor and backed him as party
leader, had persuaded him to remain on, at least until June when the party
holds a special congress. The conference has also set up a a commission to
examine whether the same person should be party leader and a minister.
Senior FDP members said they were concerned that if Mr Kinkel had resigned,
a new party leader might try to distance the FDP from the coalition in a way
which could potentially undermine the fragile stability of the government,
which has a majority of only 10 in the Bundestag, or lower house.
But few delegates believe the vote for Mr Kinkel will resolve the
fundamental problems facing the FDP, the junior partner in the coalition
headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union since 1982.
'We should have voted him out,' said Mr Heinrich Sander from the North
Rhine-Westphalia party organisation which faces state elections in May. 'We
have lost time. We will never get ourselves ready in time for the February
elections in Hesse.'
Mr Horst Vetter from Berlin said the party had shown that it did not have
the courage for a new beginning. 'The party was afraid. The old party hands
rallied behind Kinkel because, at the moment, there is no alternative to
him,' he said.
Mr Werner Brandler, a delegate from Thuringia, said: 'Regardless of this
vote, the crisis is not over. Wait until June. The party will face the same
problems. Where can we go? How many more elections can we afford to lose?'
In 10 consecutive elections throughout the past 18 months, the FDP has
failed to be re-elected to state parliaments, failed to be elected to the
European parliament, failed to have its presidential candidate elected, and
barely scraped back into the Bundestag in October's parliamentary elections.
But the last two days in Gera represent more than the culmination of a
series of election defeats. Rather they are the climax of a long crisis in
the FDP which started in 1982 when the party, which had been in coalition
with the Social Democrats, withdrew and then joined a coalition under Mr
Kohl's conservatives.
'That was the beginning of the crisis,' said Mr Michael Goldmann from Lower
Saxony. Thousands of party members, particularly the professionals and
intellectuals, left the party in disgust. Some completely withdrew from
political activity while, over the past decade, others joined or voted for
the Greens as they became the liberal alternative to the FDP. The FDP in
west Germany has only 50,000 members, the party in east Germany has less
than 30,000.
'The problem is that we have lost our identity as a liberal party because we
have had to make too many compromises with the CDU,' said Mr Walter Klein
from North Rhine-Westphalia. 'We are the lap dogs of the CDU at the expense
of defending our liberal political and economic traditions.'
Grassroots members believe the parliamentary party has compromised on too
much of its liberal programme: cutting bureaucracy, reducing taxes,
promoting greater economic liberalisation, and allowing easier access to
citizenship.
The party managed to paper over the cracks after 1982 largely because it had
powerful personalities, such as Mr Genscher and Mr Otto Lambsdorff, party
leader until June 1993 when he was succeeded by Mr Kinkel.
'With Genscher the party never bothered to question its direction,' said Ms
Cornelia Schmaltz-Jacobsen, head of the federal office for foreigners'
issues. 'Time and complacency have caught up with us.' The party yesterday
set itself the task of building a new structure, improving the grassroots
organisation, establishing more open communication between the central
leadership and the local level, and electing Mr Guido Westerwelle, a party
functionary, as the new general secretary.
But, as these decisions were being debated, there were few delegates who
believed that those motions, and the show of support for Mr Kinkel, would be
enough to rescue the party from defeat in Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia.

FT  13 DEC 94 / France, US urge tougher UN stance in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
France and the US yesterday redoubled their support for the UN mission in
Bosnia, and suggested reinforcing it with more men and weapons, or tougher
rules of engagement.
The Franco-American statement was in contrast to recent suggestions by
several western countries that a UN pullout may only be weeks away because
of the deteriorating situation on the ground. US officials have been dubious
about the effectiveness of the UN's role in Bosnia, and the suggestion that
the forces there be reinforced marks a clear change in the US line.
The message from Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, and Mr Francois
Leotard, French defence minister, was issued as contingency planning for a
possible UN pullout gathered pace, and four Bangladeshi peacekeepers were
injured in northern Bosnia.
Mr Perry said after meeting Mr Leotard in Washington that both were agreed
on 'the very valuable function' the 24,000-strong UN force was discharging.
The UN should consider 'not only more troops and arms but new rules of
engagement.' Mr Leotard suggested heavy protection for a 'humanitarian
corridor' along which convoys could travel from the Adriatic to Sarajevo.
In Brussels, senior military officers yesterday began a week of intensive
discussions on how precisely a UN withdrawal from Bosnia would be organised,
and protected from the warring parties, with the help of Nato ground troops.
Mr Perry goes to Brussels today to meet his counterparts from the 14
countries which make up Nato's military wing. France belongs to Nato's
political arm but not its military structure.
Nato's plan for a UN withdrawal are expected to provide for temporary
deployment of up to 25,000 extra combat troops in the war zone. Another
20,000 might be involved in providing logistical support, but no more than
5,000 of these would be deployed in Bosnia itself.
The US has offered to provide about half the personnel needed to organise a
pullout, but Mr Perry will be under strong pressure to give more details
when he meets his opposite numbers in Brussels.
UK officials have warmly welcomed US willingness to help, viewing it as a
sign that America wants to avoid a repeat of last month's diplomatic spat
over the abrupt US withdrawal from enforcing the arms embargo against
Bosnia.
Diplomats said the US commitment to providing cover for a withdrawal would
make the US administration more likely to support a continued UN presence.
Bosnian Serbs yesterday for the first time in over three weeks allowed
passage of a convoy carrying 30 tonnes of fuel for UN forces in Sarajevo.
But a UN spokesman said this 'tiny amount' would not be sufficient for the
UN to carry out its mandate.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Greeks strike over curbs on tax evasion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Greece yesterday felt the first impact of the finance ministry's new effort
to reduce tax evasion by self-employed workers: taxi drivers, truckers and
bus drivers staged a nationwide 24-hour strike.
The union of professional drivers threatened to hold more strikes over the
Christmas holidays unless the government drops measures designed to increase
tax paid by the owner-drivers who control most of Greece's road transport
industry.
The drivers' walk-out launched a wave of strikes ahead of Friday's
parliamentary debate on the 1995 budget, which restricts public sector wage
increases and attempts to broaden the tax base by setting objective
indicators for assessing incomes in the private sector.
The drivers object to a directive making the purchase of a new taxi, truck
or bus an indicator of their income level. They also refuse to pay a 30 per
cent tax on transfers of vehicle operating licences and a one-off tax on
income earned over the past 10 years.
A finance ministry official said: 'Road transport has escaped proper
regulation because it's seen as a public service, and the drivers have taken
advantage of this. Like other self-employed workers, they have to start
contributing their share.'
The self-employed, from doctors and lawyers to plumbers and drivers, make up
about 20 per cent of the Greek workforce. They sustain an underground
economy estimated at more than 30 per cent of gross domestic product,
according to the finance ministry.
However, the main tax burden is carried by public sector workers and
pensioners whose taxes are deducted at source.
The finance ministry is counting on a successful crackdown on tax evasion
next year, together with settlement of more than 700,000 pending income tax
disputes, in order to boost budget revenues by more than Dr300bn (Pounds
790m).
The Greek trade union federation has called a 24-hour strike for tomorrow in
protest against next year's income policy, which restricts increases for
public sector workers to 6.1 per cent, against a projected inflation rate of
almost 8 per cent.
The civil servants' union has called a four-hour work stoppage the same day
which is expected to shut government ministries, public utilities and
state-controlled banks.

FT  13 DEC 94 / Maurice Saatchi in row over Pounds 5m share option plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Maurice Saatchi's future as chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising
group he founded, hangs in the balance following an explosive row between
the company and leading shareholders over a proposed Pounds 5m option
package for Mr Saatchi.
Shareholders controlling a third of the group's shares, led by Harris
Associates of Chicago, were so angry to learn of the so-called 'super option
scheme' that last week they put three proposals to the company's board:
That Mr Saatchi's option allocation be scaled back radically;
That the company consider changing the name of the holding company, so that
the 'Saatchi' brand should be used only by the operating subsidiary, Saatchi
&amp; Saatchi Advertising worldwide;
That the company consider whether Mr Saatchi should stand down from the
board altogether, to work instead for the operating subsidiary.
Last night the company refused to comment on the shareholders' action,
although it is understood that its board will, in the next few days,
consider the proposals. Shareholders could call an emergency general meeting
if Saatchi's board does not follow their wishes.
'The option proposal was the final straw for us,' said one shareholder. 'We
do not believe that Mr Saatchi's continued presence on the board is in the
company's interest.'
The super-option scheme, designed to reward executive directors and other
senior executives, was drawn up by the group's remuneration committee,
chaired by Sir Peter Walters, formerly chairman of the oil company BP and
present chairman of pharmaceutical company SmithKline Beecham. It would give
Mr Saatchi a Pounds 5m profit in three years, if the company's share price
doubles in that period.
Leading shareholders, which have been briefed privately on the scheme by the
company, are furious about Mr Saatchi's allocation, because - unlike for any
other executive - it is based on his old salary of Pounds 625,000, not his
new one of Pounds 200,000.
Mr Saatchi's salary was slashed earlier this year, following shareholder
pressure, but under the scheme he would be entitled to shares worth eight
times his old salary.
Another element in the option scheme which angered shareholders was that Mr
Saatchi would be able to exercise all his options in three years, whereas
the chief executive, Mr Charles Scott, would only be able to exercise half
of his entitlement at that time, and would have to wait for five years to
realise the entire amount.
The protesting shareholders, which collectively control 32 per cent of the
shares, are four US investment institutions - Harris, the State of Wisconsin
Investment Board, General Electric Pension Trust of the US, and Tiger Fund
Management - and M&amp;G of the UK.
Saatchi has two main international advertising networks, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Advertising and Bates Worldwide, together with a variety of other marketing
companies. Some directors, backed by the dissident shareholders, believe the
development of companies such as Bates, which do not have the Saatchi name,
is being held back because whenever they win a new client, the success is
often described as a 'Saatchi' achievement.
'That annoys Bates's management and it also annoys clients of the Saatchi
network,' said a shareholder.
Demerging or selling Bates, a strategy favoured by Mr Saatchi, is opposed by
many board members because they fear that it does not make financial sense.
Mr Saatchi has told colleagues he will fight to preserve his name on the
holding company's masthead.

FT  13 DEC 94 / TUC drafts radical blueprint for overhaul of labour laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A radical plan for a new system of employee rights involving the creation of
workplace committees at large and medium-sized British companies has been
drawn up by the TUC.
Union leaders believe the blueprint, representing a sharp break in TUC
attitudes towards labour law, is likely to win the backing of Labour leader
Mr Tony Blair, and could form the basis for a new industrial relations
framework promised by the party if it wins the next election.
Drafted by a TUC task group chaired by Mr Bill Morris, the TGWU general
secretary, it will be presented tomorrow to the TUC's executive committee
which is expected to approve it.
The move towards continental European practices follows a visit to Norway,
Sweden and Germany last month by union leaders led by Mr Morris.
In the past, the TUC has been mainly concerned that only workers belonging
to trade unions could enjoy full legal representation and it opposed
over-regulation in workplace organisation. It relied on voluntary agreement
through bargaining between employers and unions.
Unions will be asked for their views on the proposals, which will be
discussed at a special TUC conference on March 2. Each union will have to
decide its position at its summer conference. Leaders hope the changes can
be agreed at next autumn's Trades Union Congress.
The task group's proposals appear to have united union leaders from the left
and right. They include:
The legal right to workplace representation for all employees, through an
independent trade union or workplace committee, and the right to elect such
a committee.
The establishment of elected negotiating bodies responsible for creating, if
possible through agreement with employers, the new workplace committees. If
employers refuse to co-operate, the law would provide a back-up election
procedure compelling workplace representation. A legal obligation on
employers to consult employees - not just union members - on issues such as
redundancies, equal opportunities, training, hours, new work or production
methods.
Companies would also have to inform employees over corporate strategy,
financial matters, production, sales and employment and any restructuring
plans. The introduction of legal protection for union members and officials
against employer victimisation. Employer blacklists of workers would be
outlawed. Safeguards would prevent discrimination against an individual for
previous union activities.
The creation of new trade union legal rights, including the calling of
meetings in the workplace and provision of outside officials to recruit and
campaign inside companies. Employers would be required to provide facilities
for workplace representatives and give time off for their duties.
The creation of a public agency to enforce the legislation.

FT  13 DEC 94 / PM moves closer to accepting EU poll may be held
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday moved the government substantially closer to
accepting a referendum could be held on further integration of the European
Union.
Mr Major told the Commons in a statement on the EU summit in Essen: 'I have
indicated that the circumstances might be appropriate to have a referendum,
and if they are, we will.'
Officials said the prime minister's statement was in line with previous
Commons comments recognising that a referendum might be appropriate in some
circumstances.
It was unclear whether Mr Major was referring to the possibility of UK
participation in a single European currency, or the outcome of the 1996
inter-governmental conference.
However, Mr Major's comments amount to his clearest endorsement yet of the
increasingly widespread view on the Conservative backbenches that a
referendum before further constitutional change has become inevitable.
His statement followed strong support for the principle of a referendum on
the outcome of the inter-governmental conference from Mr John Prescott, the
deputy Labour leader.
Mr Prescott told BBC radio that Labour would 'definitely' support a
referendum if the conference resulted in significant constitutional changes.
He stopped short of committing the party to a referendum in any
circumstances, pointing out that the decision on whether to go ahead would
have to await the outcome of the talks.
But in Labour's warmest declaration of support so far, he said: 'An issue we
think is of constitutional significance should be put fairly to the people -
have the debate and a referendum.'
The cabinet remains split on the issue, with pro-Europeans such as Mr
Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, in a rare alliance against a referendum with Mr Michael Portillo,
the Eurosceptic employment secretary.
However, there were indications that Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary,
is preparing the ground for a formal shift of policy. Officials said he was
not thinking 'beyond Christmas'.
Backbench divisions on the issue re-emerged at a meeting of the rightwing 92
group at which several MPs opposed a referendum unless the government first
committed itself to a firmly Eurosceptic approach to the intergovernmental
conference.
'I favour a referendum, but not in a policy vacuum,' said Mr Edward Leigh, a
former minister. Eurosceptics said a referendum would ignite tensions over
Europe by suggesting that Mr Major was trying to stifle debate.
Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, said Mr Major should rule out a
referendum. He told ITN: 'The only way forward is for him to show he is in
command.'

FT  13 DEC 94 / Chechen talks fail to agree deal: Clashes near capital -
Russia told conflict may spread to other regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VLADIKAVKAZ, NORTH OSSETIA, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Peace talks between Russia and the breakaway Chechen republic broke up last
night without agreement after a day of clashes between invading Russian
troops and forces loyal to the republic.
Leaders of the delegations at the talks, held at Vladikavkaz, the capital of
North Ossetia and close to the Chechen border, said there would be a further
meeting today. Mr Vyacheslav Mikhailov, the Russian deputy nationalities
minister, said: 'We agreed the most important thing is to stop the bloodshed
in Chechnya.'
The two sides said they had 'agreed in principle' to resolve the conflict
peacefully and that the Russian demand for the Chechens to disarm and
re-establish constitutional order had been 'received with understanding'.
However, it is understood that an attempt to agree a simultaneous withdrawal
of the Russian forces with a handing over of arms by the Chechen forces and
the Russian-backed groups opposed to them has foundered on an inability to
agree the mechanisms of such a move. The Chechens have also drawn attention
to the low rank of the Russian team.
Yesterday Russia continued to pour troops into the region. The conflict,
which began when Chechnya declared independence three years ago, took a
violent turn at the weekend when Russia set out to crush the rebel state.
Russia's intervention in the volatile region has sparked fierce opposition
from many Russians, who fear the country is being drawn into a 'second
Afghanistan'. But yesterday Russian president Boris Yeltsin, who is in
hospital recovering from a minor operation, reissued an ultimatum that all
armed forces in Chechnya must disband by Thursday.
Russian forces, which launched a three-pronged assault on Chechnya, have met
stiff resistance both from the Chechens and other people in the north
Caucasus. The Russian intervention also appears to have, at least
temporarily, united the Chechen government and its armed domestic opponents,
who jointly formed the delegation at yesterday's talks.
Fighting was reported early today, with witnesses claiming to have heard a
series of explosions near Grozny, the Chechen capital. The most serious of
yesterday's clashes came at Dolinskoye, about 15 miles north-west of the
city, involving a four-hour battle. The Russians said there had been more
than 40 casualties after Chechen forces launched rocket attacks on advancing
Russian troops, prompting retaliatory air strikes by helicopters and
bombers.
The Russian forces advancing from Dagestan to the east of Chechnya met with
stiff resistance and at least 47 of their soldiers were said to have been
captured. To the west, Russian units were fired on in the neighbouring
region of Ingushetia prompting a furious reaction from Moscow.
Mr Pavel Grachev, Russia's defence minister, accused Ingushetia of 'waging
war'.
Mr Ali Aliev, speaker of the parliament of the Confederation of Caucasus
People, which unites all the non-Russian nationalities in the region, warned
Russia that all Caucasus people were prepared to rally to Chechnya's aid.
The intervention also sparked heated political debate in Moscow and about
5,000 people protested in Pushkin Square yesterday.
Leading politicians, headed by democratic party leaders Mr Yegor Gaidar and
Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, attacked the use of force. However others, such as Mr
Boris Fyodorov, the former finance minister, supported Mr Yeltsin's tough
approach.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Kinkel pressed to resign as leader of Germany's FDP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GERA, GERMANY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Klaus Kinkel, leader of Germany's Free Democrats and the country's
foreign minister, last night faced mounting pressure from his party to
resign following a hostile reception by delegates attending a special
meeting in Gera in the eastern state of Thuringia.
The party's presidium was expected to meet in emergency session last night
to decide whether it would ask for Mr Kinkel's resignation. Other senior
party members have already suggested that Mr Wolfgang Gerhardt, party leader
of Hesse, is a possible successor to Mr Kinkel.
'He is under extreme pressure to resign. That is no surprise given the
string of electoral defeats,' said Ms Irmgard Schwaetzer, the former
construction minister. 'He will sleep on it tonight. But we should know
tomorrow if Kinkel will stay or resign.'
Mr Kinkel's address to the conference was aimed at restoring the party's
confidence after it failed to be re-elected to nine state parliaments over
the past two years, and even failed to enter the European Parliament.
It scraped back into the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, in
October only through tactical voting by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democrats. The FDP won only 47 seats, two fewer than the Greens, and 32
fewer than the 1990 elections.
Delegates said they believed that Mr Kinkel, if he remains as leader, could
be forced to resign next June during another FDP congress if the party
cannot reverse the string of election defeats. Mr Kinkel has been FDP leader
since 1992.
'We need time, patience and persistence to modernise our party,' Mr Kinkel
told the 662 delegatee who repeatedly interrupted his hour-long speech with
boos and whistles. Applause at the end was lukewarm.
In a bid to stem the flow of support away from the FDP, especially to the
environmental movement, Mr Kinkel singled out the Greens for compromising
their principles in order to re-enter the Bundestag in October.
'The Greens are the lap dogs of power,' said Mr Kinkel. But several
delegates muttered that the FDP were the lap dogs to the ruling Christian
Democrats.
The first test following October's federal elections will take place in the
state of Hesse, which goes to the polls next February, followed by three
other elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Bremen. Hesse is
currently governed by the Greens and opposition Social Democrats.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Domestic funding for Borneo dam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The funding for a controversial hydroelectric dam to be built in the heart
of Malaysia's tropical rainforest will be generated from domestic sources,
according to the company in charge of the project.
The Bakun dam, described by its developers as the the world's biggest
private power scheme, is being built in a remote jungle area of Sarawak on
the island of Borneo. Preliminary estimates put the cost of the project at
MDollars 15bn (Dollars 5.9bn).
Ekran, the listed Malaysian conglomerate which is developing Bakun, said
sufficient financial resources were available in the domestic market. Nearly
MDollars 6bn has been raised on the domestic market this year for projects
associated with Malaysia's plans to privatise a large part of its
electricity industry.
Financiers have questioned whether the Malaysian capital market has the
capacity to extend further loans of the size needed for the Bakun project.
There are also fears the local market might be becoming too exposed to one
sector.
The Bakun project involves building a dam nearly twice the size of the Aswan
dam in Egypt and flooding an area larger than Singapore.
Plans are to transmit the bulk of Bakun's power output to peninsular
Malaysia, first by 670km of overhead cables within Sarawak and then through
650km of cables under the South China Sea. Bakun poses technical challenges.
It is being built at a site more than 500km up-river from Sarawak's coast
and the journey involves crossing treacherous rapids. New roads will have to
be built through dense jungle to bring in building materials and engineering
equipment.
An area of more than 80,000ha, much of it tropical rainforest, will be
cleared to accommodate the dam and more than 8,000 tribes people will be
resettled.
Opponents of the project say the dam will be 'an ecological time bomb'. Dr
Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, has said Bakun will be a
catalyst for industrial growth in Malaysia. It would meet the needs of
Malaysia's industrialising economy, and turn Malaysia into a regional power
exporter.

Mr Bernard Tapie, the left-wing French politician and businessman who is
fighting bankruptcy, yesterday resigned as president of Olympique Marseille
football club and said he would sell his majority holding in the club. Mr
Tapie, who was banned from running the club by French football authorities
following the alleged rigging of a league match against Valenciennes last
year, said he would be giving up all his shares in the club next week. Mr
Tapie at present heads the company owning two-thirds of the club, which won
five consecutive French championships and was the first French team to win
the European cup. Marseille were relegated to the second division last
season because of the rigging scandal and bankruptcy. Mr Pierre Cangioni, a
former television anchorman, will take over as president.

Rabin visits Tokyo
Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin (left) visits Tokyo - the first visit
to Japan by an Israeli premier. While in Japan, Mr Rabin is expected to sign
two agreements: one on cultural exchanges and another on co-operation in
science and technology. The visit is expected to herald a landmark in new
relations between the two states after years when Japan took a pro-Arab line
because of its overwhelming dependence on Arab oil. On Wednesday, Mr Rabin
travels on to South Korea.
Swiss and European Commission officials begin bilateral negotiations this
morning on matters that would have been settled if the Swiss people had
agreed two years ago to join the European Economic Area.
Talks will initially focus on relatively easy issues: mutual relations in
research, public procurement and elimination of trade restrictions. But
Brussels will insist that the Swiss cut farm subsidies to European Union
levels and allow EU nationals freedom of movement in return for giving
Swissair equal access to the EU open skies. The talks are unlikely to
advance quickly.
Peace talks aimed at ending the five-year-old war in Liberia resume today in
the Ghanaian capital, Accra. In attendance are the member states
contributing to the West African peace-keeping force, Ecomog, which is
dominated by about 10,000 Nigerian troops. The August 1993 Cotonou peace
accord between the provisional government and the rebel leader Charles
Taylor failed to achieve disarmament.
A recent UN mission to the region expressed concern at the deteriorating
security in Liberia which, apart from the capital Monrovia, is in the hands
of a growing number of rival militias.
European parliament begins a plenary session in Strasbourg (to Dec 16). It
will review the results of last week's Essen summit, consider a report on
the work of the outgoing German presidency, and is expected to give its
assent to the Gatt Uruguay Round.
A ticklish issue today is the integration of Spain and Portugal into the EU
fisheries policy, as Spain is threatening to block the accession to the EU
of Austria, Finland and Sweden unless restrictions on the Spanish fleet are
lifted.
Bangkok: The United Nations International Drug Control programme sponsors a
world non-governmental organisation forum on drug demand reduction.
Holidays: Kenya, Mexico, Thailand (Constitution Day), Venezuela.
Tuesday 13
Decision on Efta's future
The future of the shrinking European Free Trade Association will be decided
by ministers in Geneva (to Dec 14). Efta will be reduced to four members -
Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein - when Austria, Finland and
Sweden join the European Union in January. Switzerland is the only Efta
member outside the European Economic Area.
Islamic summit: Leaders of the 51-member Islamic Conference Organisation
meet in Casablanca for their seventh summit. The talks are likely to be
dominated by the Bosnia crisis and by the desire of many members to counter
the image in the west of Islam as a religion dominated by fudamentalists.
The issue of Jerusalem and the progress of Middle East peace talks will also
be high on the agenda.
Ethiopia's central supreme court in Addis Ababa starts the trial of leading
members of the country's former regime. Exiled ex-president Mengistu is to
be tried in absentia.
BCCI: A planned settlement for creditors of the failed Bank of Credit and
Commerce International, put forward by the liquidators Touche Ross, goes
before the courts in London. Further ratification of the deal, based on a
Dollars 1.8bn contribution from the government of Abu Dhabi, is needed in
Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands. An earlier deal fell on appeal in
Luxembourg.
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in Cairo resume stalled talks on
arrangements for eventual Palestinian elections in Gaza and the West Bank.
The talks will centre on Palestinian demands that Israel proceed immediately
with redeployment of its troops from population centres in the West Bank.
Israel, citing security worries, has said it wants to examine whether it
would be possible to proceed with elections without large scale
redeployment.
Ireland's parliament is due to reconvene to vote on a new government. Last
week talks broke down between Fianna Fail and Labour, the outgoing coalition
partners. The most likely alternative is a coalition between Fine Gael, the
main opposition party, Labour and one of the smaller parties. If talks fail
again, Ireland will face a general election.
New Zealand's Reserve Bank is due to publish its six monthly monetary policy
statement, and most analysts expect it to be cautionary.
Saleroom: Relics of the Battle of Trafalgar are offered at Sotheby's in
London, when the Earl of Northesk sells mementoes of his ancestor, Admiral
Lord Northesk, third-in-command at the Battle. Among the items are a letter
from Lord Nelson giving Northesk the order of battle, and a gold naval
medal, one of three awarded after Trafalgar and the only one still in
private hands.
Wednesday 14
Nato mulls Bosnia options
Nato defence ministers begin a two-day meeting with the question of
contingency planning for a possible withdrawal of UN troops from Bosnia high
on the agenda. Diplomats expect US defence secretary William Perry to be
pressed hard on the question of how big a force Washington would provide in
the event that Nato has to cover UN forces during a contested pullout.
Al Gore, US vice president, visits Russia (to Dec 16) for a meeting of the
Gore Chernomyrdin Commission, the group designed to boost commercial ties
between the US and Russia. It has also become a vital back channel between
Moscow and Washington for sensitive non-commercial matters.
Belfast hosts an international investment conference, aimed at attracting
business to Northern Ireland in the wake of the paramilitary ceasefires. The
conference, to be opened by John Major, UK prime minister, and attended by
Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, is expected to be attended by about 50
foreign companies.
Sweden's prime minister, Ingvar Carlsson, starts his first visit to Finland
since returning to power in September (to Dec 15). Top of the agenda in
Helsinki will be the entry of both countries to the European Union next
year.
Germany hosts the third round of talks on the so-called stability pact, a
European Union initiative to help prospective members in eastern Europe
resolve bilateral disputes about borders and the status of ethnic
minorities.
Gatt: The French National Assembly is due to ratify the Gatt world trade
agreements on Wednesday, though the French government is still hoping that
when the European Council of Ministers comes to approve Gatt next week it
will adopt new Commission proposals to stiffen European defences against
unfair commercial practices.
London's transport:
The closing date for bids to build the Pounds 100m-Pounds 130m privately
financed extension of the Docklands Light Railway across the Thames to
south-east London. At least five consortia, some international, are likely
to submit preliminary bids. The contract is expected to be awarded next
autumn.
UK economy: Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, will be hoping for
good news from today's clutch of economic statistics. The headline annual
inflation rate is expected to have stuck at 2.4 per cent in November, while
unemployment is forecast to have fallen by a further 30,000.

Loyalists in Ulster talks
Ulster loyalist representatives are due to open exploratory talks with
British officials in the first step towards inclusive talks with the other
constitutional parties involved in the search for a settlement.
UK by-election: Polling takes place in the constituency of Dudley West, with
the opposition Labour party hoping to take the seat from the ruling
Conservatives for the first time since 1979. At the last election, the
Conservatives had a majority of 5,789.
Sweden's Social Democratic government is due to decide whether to order the
raising of the ferry Estonia, which sank in September with the loss of more
than 900 lives. The maritime authorities say it is technically possible and
many relatives of the dead are pressing for the ship to be lifted. But the
huge cost, proposals to declare the wreck a sea grave and advice from divers
that many bodies can be recovered without a full salvage may persuade the
government not to proceed.
The Bank of France unveils monetary policy goals and targets for 1995 which
are expected to be roughly in line with those of 1994. The central bank,
which a year ago was made independent of the government in monetary policy,
has said its priority is to maintain stability of prices and of the franc.

Mercosur leaders convene
The four presidents of the Mercosur customs union of Brazil, Argentina,
Paraguay and Uruguay arrive in the Brazilian city of Ouro Preto for their
last meeting before the agreement comes into force on January 1.
They are likely to finalise details of the customs union, decide which
products are to be exempted from a common external tariff, and may also
discuss recruiting further members.
Greece's finance minister Alex Papadopoulos presents his 1995 budget to
parliament. Despite calls by the European Commission for revenue-
raising measures, the budget contains no new taxes. It hopes to boost
revenues almost 20 per cent through a crackdown on tax evasion by Greece's
800,000 self-employed workers.
Finland's pulp and paper industry, its biggest export earner, faces an
all-out strike unless efforts to arbitrate a settlement of the trade unions'
annual wage claim are successful.
Bank of Japan governor Yasushi Mieno retires, to be succeeded by Sakura Bank
chairman Yasuo Matsushita, who is expected to continue Mr Mieno's cautious
monetary policy.

Gulf foreign ministers meet
Foreign ministers of the six Gulf Co-operation Council states, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar, meet in Manama,
Bahrain, on Saturday to discuss the agenda for the annual GCC heads of state
summit at the end of the month. This is likely to focus on joint security
arrangements for the Gulf.
South Africa's African National Congress, the dominant party in the
country's government of national unity, begins a five-day national
conference in Bloemfontein on Saturday. The conference, the party's first
since 1991, is expected to formulate a new set of official policies on
everything from housing to foreign affairs. Closely watched will be
elections for party officers, in particular whether incumbent
secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa, a possible successor to President Nelson
Mandela, will stand for re-election.
Bulgaria faces early general elections on Sunday, which are expected to end
the country's political crisis. An early poll follows the refusal of the two
biggest parliamentary groups, the Socialists and the Union of Democratic
Forces, to form a government to replace the non-party cabinet of technocrats
which resigned in September. Recent opinion polls indicate that the
Socialists could emerge from the elections as the largest single party.

Monday: UK producer price figures will give a further clue to inflationary
pressures. Manufacturers' input prices are forecast to be up 7.5 per cent in
the 12 months to November, but the markets will watch more closely what has
happened to output, or factory gate, prices. The annual rise of this measure
is expected to be a more muted 2.5 per cent.
Tuesday: The Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey
will be the week's first clue to consumer confidence. The survey relates to
November; since then, the retail sector has had to absorb both the Budget
and last week's interest rate rise.
Thursday: Official figures on November's retail sales are published today.
Friday: Having achieved a surprising surplus in October, the UK's public
sector borrowing requirement is expected to slip back to a Pounds 2bn
deficit in November. The markets were disappointed that the Chancellor only
cut the 1994-95 forecast to Pounds 34.5bn in the Budget.
Also published today will be the CBI's industrial trends survey, which is
closely watched by the Bank of England, particularly with regard to price
intentions.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: Hopes fade on Wall St for year-end rally -
New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes for a year-end rally are fading on Wall Street as bad news seems to
overtake the market every time it tries to edge up.
With little economic news out last week, the market tumbled on Thursday and
held flat on Friday amid uncertainty about the implications of the largest
municipal bankruptcy in US history.
Worries surrounding Orange County, California's financial troubles may be
overtaken this week by fundamental economic data.
Investors will take close note of the consumer price index for November to
be released on Wednesday.
Although most data shows rising raw materials prices, such increases have
yet to pass through to consumer levels. So far this year the CPI has held
relatively steady at an average of 0.2 per cent a month.
Economists are once again predicting the CPI figure will show an increase
and many remain puzzled that it has remained so low.
Mr Bill Sharp, an economist at securities firm Smith Barney, foresees an
increase to 0.3 in November's figure. But he is quick to concede that his
firm has predicted an increase in the CPI figures since September, although
it stayed even in that month and declined in October.
Private sector economists are not alone in their belief that inflationary
pressures will ultimately work their way into consumer prices. Last week Mr
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said the same to Congress's
joint economic committee.
In that testimony, Mr Greenspan implied that the Fed was not averse to
further monetary tightening to keep inflationary expectations under control.
Most economists now believe there will be another rate increase by early
next year, and few rule out the possibility that the Fed could move after
the December 20 meeting of its open market committee.
In addition to the CPI data, the Fed and the market will take cues from
figures on November producer prices and capacity utilisation due out Tuesday
and Wednesday respectively.
Although producer prices showed a decline in October, economists believe the
figures will pick up again for November on the assumption that car and truck
sales - which fell in October, dragging down the overall index - will have
increased for November.
Perhaps more telling will be the capacity utilisation figures. Economists at
Chemical Securities, a unit of Chemical Banking, predict the data will show
85 per cent of the economy's capacity being used for the production of
goods, the highest level since 1979.
There is no way to judge how the market would react to such news. In recent
weeks it has alternately risen and fallen amid signs of inflationary
pressures.

Details of machinery orders in October and wholesale price index for
November will be released tomorrow, writes Robert Patton. Analysts expect
the WPI data to show a year-on-year decline, while machinery orders should
be higher, if only because last October's orders were extremely weak.
The Bank of Japan will release November's money supply data on Thursday, the
day before its governor, Mr Yasushi Mieno retires. He will be succeeded by
the chairman of Sakura Bank, Mr Yasuo Matsushita.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd's Weekly Economic Survey on Friday noted that the
'main theme of (governor Mieno's) last six months was bank balance sheet
reconstruction and this should also be the main thrust of the new
(governor).'

The market looks set to fall further this week as fund managers continue to
wind down their positions in Asian markets ahead of the year end, writes
Louise Lucas.
Brokers tentatively put the next resistance point for the Hang Seng index at
7,500, after a week that saw some 5.3 per cent sliced off its value, taking
cumulative declines since the January peak to some 36 per cent.
On Friday alone, the index lost 279.24 or 3.5 per cent, to 7,789.07. The
downward plunge is attributed largely to redemption pressure on US funds,
with portfolios worldwide dumping Asian stocks as desperately as they were
buying them at this time last year. Asian markets are no longer repositories
of the world's only growth story, and funds are being freed to plough into
other equities and fixed income instruments.
Fears of rising interest rates, exacerbated by Mr Alan Greenspan's comments
last week, also continue to plague sentiment.

With the reporting season largely over in South Africa, the stock exchange
is preoccupied with dividends - mining house Gold Fields of South Africa is
due to release details this week - and trying to decide whether the current
bull market has largely run its course, writes Mark Suzman.
South African stocks have weathered the global downturn in equities better
than most markets and both gold and industrial stocks have had a good year.
However, with its p/e ratio edging up to 19 and only moderate growth of 3
per cent to 4 per cent expected over the next year, some analysts are
predicting a limited correction before the JSE can resume its upward climb.
Others, however, remain bullish, particularly on industrial stocks, in light
of the market's expanding international profile.
The optimists cite a recent report by Banque Paribas which predicts that
Dollars 2bn - Dollars 3bn could flow in over the next 12 months because of
South Africa's size relative to other emerging markets, while pessimists
point to probable currency depreciation as a disincentive to foreigners.
However, no major movements are expected until after the holiday season.

Poland's state-owned Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy (BPH) goes on sale today,
with the government offering 50.2 per cent of the equity to private
investors at a minimum price of 700,000 zlotys a share, writes Christopher
Bobinski.
The offer comes as the local stock market continues in the doldrums, with
the government taking the unprecedented step of telling investors buying up
to 16m zlotys worth of BPH shares that they can offset the purchase against
income tax next year.
Officials are also looking to foreign investors and underwriters to salvage
a sale worth 4,130bn zlotys (Dollars 170m), if the minimum price is
accepted.
This compares with the 8,500bn zlotys worth of new share offers and rights
issues absorbed by the market in the first half of this year and overall new
equity sales worth 5,300bn zlotys in the third quarter.
Mr Krzysztof Kalicki, the deputy minister responsible for the sale, has said
he is talking to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development as
well as two other foreign institutions about guarantees for the offer.
The privatisation of the bank by mid-January is a condition, set by western
governments, of a Dollars 600m grant to help finance a domestic corporate
debt reduction scheme which last year allowed the state banking sector to
improve its balance sheets.
Polish Life Improvement, a privately-owned provincial retail chain going
public today with an offer of 5m shares has, by contrast, slashed its share
price to 55,000 zlotys from the original 110,000 zlotys.
This comes after an initial public offer by the Jutrzenka chocolate maker
was largely left with the Bank Handlowy and the Bank Zachodni, which
underwrote the issue. Also, the Vistula garment maker in Krakow has reported
scant interest in its latest rights issue, which looks likely to go to
underwriters.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: Mainland offers get cold shoulder from the
US - Chinese issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shandong International Power Development has become the latest victim of a
tendency for Chinese companies to be given the cold shoulder by US
investors.
The power group admitted on Friday that its flotation, involving an issue of
American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) and a listing in Hong Kong, will not now
take place until early next year. The listing had been scheduled for
November.
Another recent victim was Concordia Paper, which produces recycled packaging
and paper. It originally planned to raise up to Dollars 56m with an initial
public offering via Lehman Brothers and SG Warburg, but scaled it back to
Dollars 20m.
The smaller offering was a success, with shares issued at Dollars 10 a week
ago trading on Nasdaq at that level on Friday. 'The company now has an
audience to go back to,' said a banker close to the deal.
SIPD is looking to raise around HKDollars 2.7bn with its planned offering,
which will be jointly brought by Goldman Sachs and Peregrine Capital.
The company blamed poor market conditions for its delay but while this may
be true in the Hong Kong market, where the shares will be listed, it is more
likely that SIPD has its eyes on the US market, where it had planned to
issue ADRs.
The performance of ADRs issued by fellow China power companies Shandong
Huaneng and Huaneng Power International has not suggested an enthusiastic
welcome from US investors.
ADRs in Shandong Huaneng, the first mainland state-owned enterprise to seek
a primary listing on Wall Street, were issued at USDollars 14.25 on August 4
and on Friday were trading around Dollars 9.25. CS First Boston acted as
global co-ordinator of the deal, which represented 27 per cent of the
outstanding share capital.
Huaneng International Power, which hit Wall Street on October 6 after
slashing the price of its stock some 27 per cent over the course of the
roadshow, has seen its ADRs fall from the issue price of Dollars 20 to
Dollars 15.25 on Friday.
Until Shandong Huaneng, there were four mainland companies listed on the New
York Stock Exchange: Brilliance China, China Tire, Ek Chor Motorcycle and
Shanghai Petrochemical. In October Huaneng Power, an associate company,
became the sixth US listed mainland company.
The experience of the latest two China companies on Wall Street has been the
same as that of their predecessors, all have seen weak performances and
lacklustre volumes.
The US cold-shouldering of mainland stock trading on Wall Street has
prompted the Chinese regulatory authorities to explore means of encouraging
dual primary listings in the US and Hong Kong - as achieved by Shanghai
Petrochemical and its sponsors Merrill Lynch Hong Kong and Peregrine Capital
last year.
This would enable companies to widen their investor base with a US listing,
while recognising that the bulk of demand, for now, will be in Hong Kong.
In turn, this may mean two of China's biggest overseas listings earmarked
for New York might dovetail their flotations with Hong Kong offerings. They
are China Southern Airlines, being brought to market by Goldman Sachs, and
China Eastern Airways, being arranged by Morgan Stanley.
US investors are likely to give them a cooler welcome than a year ago. The
US investor's view of Chinese investment may also have been affected by news
that Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, is suing three of China's
biggest trading companies for allegedly failing to pay nearly Dollars 100m
in debts.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: More progress for '95 less and less likely -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON

<TEXT>
Any market that can survive relatively intact after a week which included
news of a significant defeat for the government in the House of Commons, a
half percentage point rise in UK interest rates, a mini-budget featuring big
tax increases in consumer areas, and the threat of another base rate rise in
the US has to have very solid foundations.
Whether the UK equity market can build on such solid ground in the short
term is another thing.
More than ever, markets appear to be at the mercy of a Wall Street showing
increasing volatility and being hit by a succession of hammer blows.
With each blow confidence is draining away from Wall Street and worries
about the US are gnawing at London's fragile grip on the 3,000 level.
Not even the prospect of a bid battle triggered by the merger discussions
between two of the financial world's biggest names - SG Warburg and Morgan
Stanley - could check stock market slides across Europe on Friday.
The woes affecting Wall Street last week came from three different
directions.
First, Fidelity Investments' Magellan Fund, one of the biggest mutual funds
in the world with assets of Dollars 35bn, said it would not make a year-end
distribution to its 3m investors, causing ripples of unease across world
markets.
Second, the local authority in Orange County, California, filed for
bankruptcy, prompting fears that it may be forced to liquidate its Dollars
20bn bond portfolio.
Third, and most importantly, the prospects of another interest rate rise in
the US grew strongly after Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, testified to
the Joint Economic Committee of Congress that the US economy was growing
faster than expected and that the financial markets apparently still doubted
the Fed's determination to fight inflation.
The Federal Open Market Committee meets on December 20 and Mr Greenspan's
remarks can only be interpreted as a strong indication that US rates will
rise again, only a month after the last increase.
The response in London to the government's defeat over the second stage of
the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel and the subsequent interest rate rise
was impressive, as it was initially to the increases in taxes on alcohol,
tobacco and fuel.
However, with the Conservative government lurching from crisis to crisis and
Wall Street unnerving even those with the strongest of constitutions, it is
looking increasingly unlikely that UK equities can make much progress before
the end of the year.
Unless of course, there are more big bids in the pipeline and the Warburg
saga developes into something of an auction.

The most prominent feature of recent movements in the US Treasury market has
been the flattening of the yield curve, as investors buy long-term bonds in
the belief that inflationary pressures will be driven out of the economy
next year.
That belief was strengthened last week when Federal Reserve chairman Alan
Greenspan made clear that more increases in short-term interest rates were
in store, and probably soon.
Will the trend continue? The market's nerve could be shaken over the next
few days in what is slated to be a busy week for economic data. Some of the
figures could lead to worries that, in spite of the recent increases in
interest rates, economic growth is failing to cool off in the way the Fed
would like.
For example, the retail sales figures for November, due out on Tuesday, are
expected to show a solid gain of 0.5 per cent as a result of buoyant
consumer confidence.
Also on Tuesday, a rebound in energy and vehicle prices is likely to have
contributed to a 0.4 per cent increase in the producer price index for
November, compared with the 0.5 per cent decline in October.
And there could be more bad news on Wednesday with the publication of
November's consumer price index: Salomon is predicting a surge of 0.4 per
cent, the largest advance in 13 months, led by increases in clothing and
housing costs.

Japanese government bonds rebounded on Friday when the Bank of Japan's
quarterly Tankan survey showed business confidence was growing, but at a
modest rate.
The yield of the benchmark 10-year bond fell to 4.58 per cent, ending the
week at the lowest level in two months. Non-government bonds also gained,
with 4 per cent bank debentures trading at 4.04 to 4.05 per cent, compared
with 4.075 per cent on Thursday.
Friday's announcement that, for the first time since the war the government
would finance a bail-out of two failed savings institutions, was viewed as
positive for the bond market and sparked an early rally.
This was further supported when the Tankan later confirmed traders'
expectations that the business recovery was restrained.
Other credit union type savings institutions in Japan, which have been
crippled by a potentially lethal infusion of bad debt, are likely candidates
for future rescue operations. If credit were tightened now, such rescues
would be much more difficult and costly.
The Tankan showed some improvements in the environment for corporate
financing and the BoJ predicted that credit would remain easy for corporate
borrowers. Major companies polled in the survey plan to cut capital spending
by another 3.9 per cent after two consecutive years of decreases.

Gilt traders hoping to get on with their Christmas shopping will have a host
of economic statistics to distract them this week. With producer price
figures today, the markets will have the chance to assess the state of
retail sales, unemployment, average earnings and the public sector borrowing
requirement. The most significant number will be November's retail price
inflation on Wednesday.
Mr Mark Reckless, UK economist at SG Warburg, thinks the market has some
rather demanding expectations for the week's statistics, particularly on
inflation, and this could result in disappointment and an adverse impact on
gilts.
But Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International
(Europe), is optimistic about gilts. 'At the start of the week, the
government appeared to be losing their authority on the fiscal front,' he
says, following the defeat on the VAT vote. 'But they've now regained that
authority and also moved firmly on the monetary front with the rise in
rates.'
The main factor likely to hold back gilts in the short term, Mr Richardson
says, is the relationship with other bond markets. The spread over German
bunds was only around 120 basis points on Friday, and the US bond market
could be affected by further fall-out from the Orange County bankruptcy.

FT  12 DEC 94 / World Bond Markets: Global success bodes well for domestic
issues - South African bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The resounding success of South Africa's Dollars 750m global bond offering,
launched last week, suggests that international investors have discovered a
taste for South African debt. They should now focus on the country's
domestic bond market, where the returns are attractive and the signs are
that it is poised to rally.
This has been a bad year for the South African government bond market, as it
has for bond markets worldwide. Yields on long-dated government bonds
climbed from below 12 per cent in January to 17 per cent in October. They
have fallen back slightly in recent weeks to around 16 1/2 per cent.
The sharp rise in yields was due partly to the adverse international bond
market environment. But it was also due to concern among investors that the
new Government of National Unity, dominated by the African National Congress
(ANC), would spend excessively as it embarked upon its plan of
reconstruction and development.
Furthermore, inflation began to turn upwards as the country's economic
recovery gathered momentum.
The new government's ability and willingness to keep a tight control on the
budget deficit continues to be watched closely by international investors.
After all, the country's outstanding public debt amounts to a relatively
high 55 per cent of gross domestic product.
'It is here that the ANC is expected to have its greatest difficulties, and
it is here that people are expecting results,' said Mr Nicolas Blancher, an
economist at Societe Generale, the French bank, in Paris.
However, progress is being made. Tax revenues are growing and the government
is likely to achieve its target for a budget deficit of 6.6 per cent GDP in
1994. The prospect is that it will fall further next year.
What is more, although price pressures have been strong - inflation recently
jumped to an annual rate of around 10 per cent - much of this was caused by
a surge in food prices following the 1992-93 drought.
Excluding food prices, inflation is running at a rate of about 7 per cent.
In addition, there has been a dramatic turnround in the capital account of
the balance of payments. The country's foreign exchange reserves came under
pressure in the run up to April's elections as many foreign investors closed
their books on South Africa.
Since then, however, trade credits have been renewed and capital for project
finance has begun to flow again. Net foreign exchange reserves have risen by
R9bn since the election.
To add to this, the success of the global bond offering is likely to
precipitate a flood of bond issues from some of the country's major public
and private institutions, as well as further offerings from the government
itself.
'The capital account seems assured of performing very well,' said Mr Graham
Bell, of Baring Securities in London. 'All the concerns about the bond
market are gradually being eased.'
As ever, the extent to which South African government bonds can make any
progress will depend on the general sentiment in international bond markets.
But with signs of stability emerging in the US and Europe, the outlook is
encouraging. 'Rand bonds are poised to rally,' said Mr Bell.
His view is shared by Mr Paul Abberley, head of fixed-income at fund
managers Lombard Odier in London.
'The domestic market offers good value with attractive real yields and a
relatively stable currency. There is always a political risk and the
currency could come under pressure, but we're looking to buy back into the
market,' he says.
The greatest obstacles blocking foreign investment in South Africa have been
the country's dual exchange rate system and exchange controls.
Foreign investors wishing to buy domestic bonds must do so through the
financial rand, a relatively illiquid and volatile second-tier currency
which trades at a discount to the commercial rand, the currency which is
used for all regular balance of payments transactions. However, the
government says it wants to merge the currencies and lift controls.
The prospect of that happening is likely to lead to a further strengthening
of the financial rand against its commercial counterpart.
That is another reason to buy South African bonds now, says Mr Bell, since
investors will benefit from an appreciating currency. The gap between the
two currencies has already narrowed significantly.

The strength of Germany's economic recovery has taken economists and the
financial markets by surprise, with last week's third-quarter GDP figures
showing a further acceleration of growth in the western states.
This further weakened expectations that the Bundesbank would cut interest
rates again - according to Industrial Bank of Japan's Adolf Rosenstock, it
dealt them a 'lethal blow' - though it did not eliminate them altogether.
Capacity utilisation in industry is approaching levels which threaten to
push inflation higher, although prices have risen by a mere 1 per cent (on
an annualised basis) in the past three months.
Among those taking a cautious line on German rates is BHF-Bank, which sees
no pressing grounds for an early rise. Falling unit labour costs and weak
private consumption should make for a risk-free economic outlook in 1995.
But a rise in short-term rates in the second half cannot be excluded in
order to guard against inflation beyond next year, BHF feels.
The GDP strength took the market by surprise, but the reaction was mild;
inflation and money supply trends have been bond-positive, notes NatWest
Markets. With 10-year bund yields now around 7.30 per cent, Trinkaus Capital
Management expects an easing to 7 per cent in mid-1995.

FT  12 DEC 94 / World Bond Markets: Investors take Greenspan at his word -
US Treasury bonds
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week was tumultuous for the bond market, but not even unsettling events
such as the largest municipal bankruptcy in US history swayed the bond
market from believing the Federal Reserve will hold the line against
inflationary pressures.
The yield curve, one of the key indicators of market sentiment about the
economy, is nearly flat, with the spread between yields on two-year notes
and the long bond only 35 basis points. It is, therefore, giving a clear
message that investors have taken Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal
Reserve, at his word when he says he will not let inflation or inflationary
expectations get out of control.
It is something he has been promising since the start of the year, when the
spread between the long bond and the two-year note was 210 basis points.
Even five increases in the US base rate only brought the spread down to 110
points by early November as investors demanded high yields to counter the
risk of holding a 30-year bond through a potentially inflationary period.
Then came the November 15 move, when the Fed pushed up base rates by 75
basis points to 5.5 per cent. With the market expecting a rate increase
close to a 50 basis points, the central bank's action jolted the market into
the realisation that the Fed meant business and the yield curve began almost
immediately to flatten.
Part of the reason may be that US investors are bringing back money they had
in European and Japanese securities and putting it into longer-term
securities, including 10-year Treasuries, according to Mr Richard Gilhooly
of Paribas Capital Markets in New York.
But while economists believe the trend toward flattening or even inverting -
an indication that the market expects recession - will hold, they warn
against counting on steady flattening in the near-term.
Ms Janet Showers of Salomon Brothers believes the curve will be flat to
slightly inverted by late in the first quarter of next year, but refrains
from trying to explain contortions it may go through before then.
'The market is confident of the Fed being able to control inflation and
moderate growth,' she says. 'The market can also quickly change its mood
with the next numbers that come out.'
Ms Showers points out that on Monday the yield curve was at its flattest
level in more than four years after strong employment figures led investors
to conclude that the Fed would raise interest rates soon.
Toward the middle of the week, however, the curve reversed course after
Orange County, California, declared bankruptcy and the market decided the
Fed would refrain from further tightening to stave off more losses.
By the end of the week, the curve had flattened again after Mr Greenspan
told a Congressional panel that Orange County's losses not deter him from
more tightening.
This week, the market will look closely at figures on producer and consumer
prices and capacity utilisation to determine when the Fed is likely to raise
rates again.
A consensus is building that base rates will go to 6.5 per cent by the end
of March, but opinion is divided about whether the central bank will tighten
immediately after the December 20 meeting of its open market committee.
Mr Stephen Slifer of Lehman Brothers believes that there may be some
intermediate steepening of the yield curve in the short term.
The market has factored in a December rate increase, Mr Slifer says, and if
the Fed fails to do that the two-year/30-year spread could increase by 25 to
30 basis points.
'I don't disagree with the trend, but I think we've gotten a little ahead of
ourselves,' he says. While he foresees a 100 basis point interest rate
increase by March, he thinks the Fed will have to be careful if it is to
avoid recession and an yield curve inversion.
'If you start talking about a serious inversion with the Fed really
hammering away (at rates) then you're talking about recession and then you
avoid any chance of a soft landing,' he says.

Martin Currie Investment Management is raising an open-ended fund of at
least Dollars 50m to invest in Taiwan shares, reports Laura Tyson in Taipei.
At least half of the funds will be invested in smaller companies with market
capitalisation below Dollars 300m. These offer faster earnings growth at
lower ratings than the blue-chips targetted by most Taiwan funds.
The fund will also invest in companies listed on the over-the-counter
market, which the government seeks to develop. The OTC market is slated to
be opened to foreign investors in early 1995. The closing date for the fund
is 16 January 1995.

Salomon Brothers has forecast that Asian stock indices will rise by a
average of 20 per cent next year, agencies report.
Salomon said that while trading condition in 1995 were likely to be
difficult, following depressed activity throughout this year, higher index
levels were still likely.
Growth in earnings per share should be strong, but lower than in 1994, with
valuations remaining near the upper end of historical ranges.
The liquidity outlook was not as favourable, with fund inflows more modest
than in 1994, Salomon said.
Salomon added that it expected volatile market movements in the near term,
an early rally in the new year triggered by the next rise in US rates and a
steady bond market.
There would be stronger and more sustained gains as confidence returned once
US rates reached their peak.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Emerging Markets: China's entrance switches to exit - The
Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At one stage on Friday during the Hong Kong stock market's dizzying 3.5 per
cent fall a colleague of Mr Ian McEvatt, chief executive of Indosuez Asset
Management, asked what to do. 'Put on crash helmet and sit in the corner,'
said the garrulous Irishman who has nearly Dollars 3bn under management.
Mr McEvatt's colleague was not the only fund manager reaching for crash
helmets.
Since the beginning of the year when the Hang Seng Index of leading Hong
Kong stocks reached its all time high of 12,201.09 the index has shed more
than 36 per cent of its value, making Hong Kong the worst performing market
this year.
On Friday it closed at its low for the year of 7,789.07.
Six percentage points of this year's decline occured last week as investors,
mainly US and European mutual funds, cut their exposure to Hong Kong stocks.
A combination of fears about higher US interest rates, and concern about
China have made international investors chary of committing too large a
proportion of their portfolio to the colony's bourse.
Amplifying the size of the price change has been the ease with which
investors can reduce their holdings of Hong Kong equity when, as happened
last week, the taste for Asian equity turned sour.
Asset allocators in the US and Europe may take a regional perspective when
investing in Asia's emerging markets. However when it comes to reducing
their exposure to the region, Hong Kong is the market which often bears the
brunt of the selling as it is a deeper and more liquid market than any
other.
Last year the colony was touted as the gateway to China. Recently it has
fulfilled this role in an unintended way. It has become many investors' exit
from China.
Underlying this change in sentiment is the performance of the Hang Seng
China enterprise index, a new index which measures the price performance of
Hong Kong's so-called 'red chips'. It has nearly halved in value this year
from 1,947.43 to 1,002.61 on Friday.
Concerns about the Chinese economy, especially the apparently uncontrollable
rises in inflation, have been with investors for most of this year. What has
changed, however, is the perception of China risk.
'The mood surrounding China has changed from over optimism to greater
reality,' said Mr Danny Truell, head of Hong Kong and China research at SG
Warburg in Hong Kong.
From being 'maximum bullish', investors, especially international investors,
have become moderately concerned.
Lehman Brothers' Dollars 100m law suit against three leading state
companies, problems with the lease of MacDonalds, the fast food chain, in
Beijing, and evidence that commercial banks are becoming wary about lending
to China have all served to undermine investors' belief in the 'China
story'.
But Mr Truell, like others, believes that foreign investors may have
overstated China's problems.
Mr Richard Witts, managing director of United Mok Ying Kie, a local
brokerage, believes that inflation in China next year will fall
significantly from current levels of about 27 per cent.
The factors which boosted prices this year, such as grain price deregulation
and changes to China's exchange rate regime, were 'one off' and would not
affect prices in 1995.
What concerns most analysts in Hong Kong is interest rates.
The colony's rates follow those set by the US Federal Reserve because of the
Hong Kong dollar's fixed link to the dollar. As the Fed has tightened
policy, investors in Hong Kong have seen a turnround from sharply negative
real rates at the beginning of the year to mildly positive real interest
rates today.
Most analysts believe that share prices do not have much chance of advancing
until the top of the current interest rate cycle becomes apparent, and that
may not be until the second quarter of next year.
In the meantime analysts are attempting to assess the impact on corporate
earnings of the change in the interest rate environment.
Mr Truell believes that Hong Kong's stock market has become much more
sensitive to interest rates over recent years. He estimates that 64 per cent
of the market's earnings will derive from property and banking in 1995,
compared with 51 per cent in 1991. Banks and property companies perform
better when interest rates are falling rather than rising.
Over the course of the past three months earnings forecasts have been
trimmed. In the summer analysts were looking forward to 1995 earnings growth
of 16 to 18 per cent. That was cut in November to 14 to 16 per cent. Some
analysts have reduced their forecasts further in recent weeks to 10 to 13
per cent.
With earnings expected to grow next year by this latter amount the Hong Kong
market is trading on a prospective p/e ratio of 9.5 to 10. This is toward
the bottom of the market's historic trading range, leading many to believe
that the market may not have that much further to fall before it begins to
improve.
Ms Janice Wallace, head of equity research at Goldman Sachs Asia and a
consistent bear of the Hong Kong market for most of 1994, believes that the
market may be due for a correction. 'Perhaps we have overdone things on the
way down,' she said.
She is forecasting the Hang Seng at 9,500 for the end of 1995 - a 20 per
cent gain from current levels. 'But I expect most of it in the second half
of 1995,' she said, adding that further rises in US interest rates would
depress prices in the first half.
For perennial bulls such as Mr Witts the conclusion to draw from last week's
stock market rout is obvious: 'I think we are in deep buying territory,' he
said.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Emerging Markets: Market focus on US data - Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Traders will this week focus on the deluge of US data to be released in the
run-up to next Tuesday's policy meeting of the Federal Reserve.
Expectations that the Federal Open Markets Committee would raise interest
rates hardened last week after an appearance before Congress by Mr Alan
Greenspan, the Fed chairman.
The picture was subsequently muddied by the financial troubles of Orange
County, California, prompting fears of systemic financial instability. This
raises the prospect that the Fed will decline to tighten policy, to avoid
aggravating financial weakness with higher interest rates. This could
undermine the dollar, which has been supported recently by expectations of
higher rates.
Some observers argue that even on economic grounds the case to tighten is
not proven. Mr Dave Munro, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics in
New York, says the 1 per cent pace of unit labour cost inflation, and the
sluggish PPI and CPI, 'give the Fed leeway to let its past tightening work
into the economy'.
He also predicted joblessness and capacity utilisation were likely to steady
soon at levels which did not constitute an inflationary threat.
This week will provide ample data to help investors form a view. Retail
sales and PPI figures will be released tomorrow, with CPI, industrial
production and current account figures on Wednesday.
The UK faces a similarly congested week of data, including producer and
consumer prices, distributive trades and monthly trends surveys from the
CBI, retail sales and labour market figures. The edge has been taken off
these figures, however, by last week's decision to raise the base rate to
6.25 per cent.
Higher rates and good economic fundamentals have lent support to sterling,
but its progress is hampered by political uncertainty.
In Germany, as with the US, the key event comes next week, with the
pre-Christmas Bundesbank council meeting.

FT  12 DEC 94 / The Markets: Weakness on the R&amp;D front - Economics Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We live in an age of breathtaking technological change. Yet recent
statistics point to a surprising weakness in research and development by
businesses in the industrialised world.
The newly-published annual review* of industrial policy in the 25 developed
countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
reports a 'remarkable decline' in industrial R&amp;D growth rates in recent
years.
In 1992, the latest year for up-to-date statistics in most countries,
business sector R&amp;D actually fell in real terms in Japan, France, Germany,
Spain and Britain. In the US, spending rose by 2.5 per cent in 1992 and
continued to grow at a modest 1.5 per cent in 1993. But these increases
followed a drop of nearly 6 per cent in US business sector R&amp;D in 1991 and
smaller falls in the two preceding years.
Admittedly, the early 1990s saw recession or severe economic slowdown in the
OECD countries. But, according to the Paris-based organisation, the recent
real decline of business sector R&amp;D was unprecedented in the last 20 years.
In the mid-1970s, R&amp;D continued to grow, although slowly, at a time of
recession and falling investment. In the early to mid-1980s, business sector
R&amp;D was effectively decoupled from output and physical investment in most
leading economies and grew more strongly than production. The reason for
this, according to the OECD, was 'the shift to more knowledge intensive
production'.
The good news now is that R&amp;D spending is increasing in the OECD countries
that emerged first from recession. The organisation believes R&amp;D, having
reached higher levels in the late 1980s, will in future track the business
cycle more closely and that the recent real declines will prove to be
temporary.
But having made these points, the OECD does not delve deeper into the
apparent increased cyclicality of R&amp;D.
This is a pity because the OECD's 1993 annual review of industrial policy
observed that 'expenditure on physical investment and on research and
development in the business enterprise sector plays a crucial role in
determining the relative competitiveness of countries in the medium and the
long term.'
Of course, R&amp;D is not the be-all and end-all of economic progress. Dubious
past UK achievements such as the Concorde supersonic airliner and the
advanced gas cooled reactor are reminders that R&amp;D has to be geared to the
demands of the market.
Production is also important: the most successful research business will run
into trouble if it fails to turn its inventions quickly into marketable
products.
Structural changes, such as the decline of defence spending in the US, UK
and other leading arms producers, are doubtless depressing figures of
business sector R&amp;D.
But the apparent tendency of R&amp;D spending to match rather than buck the
business cycle may be telling us something about the changing nature of
capitalism in the industrialised countries. This in turn raises questions
about how best these countries can maintain competitiveness in the face of
competition from more dynamic industrialising nations in Asia and elsewhere.
As another OECD study**** makes clear, R&amp;D differs from most other
investment activities in that the investor often enjoys only limited direct
benefit from the investment even where patent protection is available.
'Spillovers are high and social returns often greatly exceed private
returns, probably by as much as 30 to 50 per cent', it says.
Put another way, R&amp;D may not produce the sure returns that modern hard-nosed
businesses require.
The recent downturn in business R&amp;D in countries such as the US and UK
coincided not only with recession but also with increased pressure to boost
rates of return and shareholder value in companies.
The accompanying chart shows how business enterprise R&amp;D has declined as a
percentage of gross domestic product in five of the biggest industrialised
countries. Perhaps significantly, the decline set in first in the US and UK,
the two countries where individualism and capitalism enjoyed their strongest
revival in the 1980s. Only Japan, Sweden and Switzerland among OECD members
have R&amp;D to GDP ratios above 2 per cent.
The US and UK have also been in the lead in reducing numbers of R&amp;D
researchers, scientists and engineers in the business enterprise sector.
'The decline is particularly pronounced in the UK where the number of
researchers, scientists and engineers in the business sector declined
considerably for four years in a row', the OECD writes.
Could it be that the forces which have given us heavy lay-offs for many, and
telephone-figure salaries for a few, may also be limiting business R&amp;D in
some of the leading OECD countries?
Meanwhile, countries outside the OECD are investing heavily in R&amp;D. South
Korea's economic plan provides for an increase in R&amp;D expenditure to between
3 and 4 per cent of gross national product by 1998 against 2 per cent in
1991. Singapore's national technological plan aims to bring R&amp;D up to 2 per
cent of GDP next year.
The coming years will show which course bring greater overall prosperity.
But there must be some risk that a reluctance to invest in R&amp;D will
accelerate the relative decline of the OECD's industrialised nations.

FT  12 DEC 94 / The Markets: A less than stabilising exercise - Global
Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the second half of the 1980s, Japanese investors, encouraged by
government officials, played a remarkable stabilising role in the US
currency and capital markets. Their reward was a domestic equity market
bubble and a crash that rivalled Wall Street's in 1929. Small wonder that
they have been reluctant to repeat the trick in this year's troubled
markets.
Yet with the dollar perking up and the US bond market looking
uncharacteristically cheerful, speculation is mounting that Japanese private
capital outflows are accelerating. Are dollar assets coming back into
fashion? And will UK gilts enjoy some of the leftovers?
The case now being made by many analysts is straightforward enough. With the
three-month interest rate differential between New York and Tokyo at around
four percentage points, there is a powerful incentive to recycle Japanese
capital. Historically, the dollar has always risen when interest rate
spreads have been at this level. Once short-term private flows underpin the
dollar, portfolio capital might be expected to follow into US assets.
Up to a point this has already happened. In the first half of this year
Japanese purchases of foreign bonds, in which the US usually accounts for a
disproportionate share, were running at an annualised rate of Dollars
46.5bn, usefully higher than in 1992 and 1993. Yet in practice the issues
are more complicated than these arguments imply, because of profound
structural upheavals taking place in the capital markets of both the US and
Japan.
If the case for an accelerating outflow from Japan currently looks
plausible, it relates as much to the behaviour of US investors as the
Japanese. In the first half of the year American fund managers led the
foreign stampede into Japanese equities. The inflow, at an annualised rate
of Dollars 95bn, dwarfed long-term Japanese portfolio outflows. This
reflected US investors' new-found enthusiasm for international
diversification.
The Tokyo market, which accounts for a big chunk of the global equity market
capitalisation, did not share in the upturn experienced elsewhere in 1993.
Fund managers were underweight in Tokyo and worried that a rise there would
cause them to underperform badly. They promptly became bigger buyers of
Japanese equities than the Japanese.
Much of this flow seems likely to reverse, because the foreign investors
have allowed themselves to be suckered. For the structure of the Tokyo
market is perfectly designed to make a nonsense of the theory of portfolio
diversification - not least because the market is currently being used, in
true Japanese style, as an instrument of government policy.
Confronted with a banking crisis similar to the one in the US, the Japanese
authorities felt constrained by their experience of the bubble economy from
following the Federal Reserve's approach to restoring bank profits and
capital. Instead of reducing interest rates and encouraging the banks to
invest low-yielding deposits in higher-yielding government bonds, they
rigged the equity market in what is jocularly known in Tokyo as the Price
Keeping Operation. This encouraged overstretched financial institutions to
sell low-yielding equities to invest in higher yielding bonds.
The logic of this operation, perceptively analysed in a recent circular by
Andrew Smithers*, rests on the banking and insurance systems' excessive
exposure to an equity market overvalued on fundamental grounds. The banks
hold equity investments whose value is greater than their own capital. By
selling shares to invest in less risky, higher-yielding assets, they can
usefully reduce exposure to an inflated stock market as they struggle to
overcome their bad debts in property.
So, too, with the Japanese life companies, which are insolvent in the sense
that they have promised policyholders a higher return than than they are
able to earn currently on their investments. They are thus diversifying out
of equities that yield less than 1 per cent into bonds that yield more than
4.5 per cent.
Like the banks, they are able to do so largely thanks to the buying activity
of the state-run postal savings and insurance institutions and the state
pension funds, which have allocated an annual Dollars 57bn for the task. By
a happy accident, foreigners started buying in bulk late last year, just
when these funds were running low. The result is that the market is largely
independent of the economy; and any attempt at a significant equity rally
always runs into heavy selling. To buy Tokyo on the expectation of economic
recovery is thus pointless.
It is doubly pointless, as Andrew Smithers argues, if people allocate
foreign assets on the basis of the standard global market indices, which do
not allow for the overweighting of Japan that arises from the high incidence
of cross-shareholdings.
As foreigners realise they are stabilising Japanese markets for no
satisfactory return, they are bound to repatriate funds - just as the
Japanese did after their experience stabilising US markets. They are almost
certainly doing so already. For their part, the biggest Japanese
institutional investors, the life companies, face new regulatory constraints
in the aftermath of the bubble.
Both equities and foreign bond holdings now carry a capital penalty relative
to domestic bonds. This reduces the attraction of the healthy yield premium
on US Treasuries and UK gilts in a more stable currency environment, which
might otherwise be helpful in addressing the insurance companies' mismatch
of assets and liabilities. In effect, the penalty on foreign holdings gives
life companies a powerful incentive towards short-term trading rather than
long-term investing. It follows that Japanese capital outflows may prove
less stabilising than many hope.

FT  12 DEC 94 / The Markets: Japan hungry for platinum - Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan may have trouble next year satisfying its hunger for platinum and its
sister metals, palladium and rhodium, as South African supplies continue to
slow. So it will be particularly anxious about the outcome of talks starting
today with Russian officials.
A mission from Almazyuvelirexport, the Russian platinum group metals export
agency, in Tokyo to negotiate export contracts for 1995 with Japanese
customers, is likely to find itself in a seller's market.
The Japanese are expected to want a 15 to 20 per cent increase in shipments
of the metals. But Russia, which has little room for expansion of output,
will have to make further and heavier releases from its stockpiles to
satisfy this extra demand.
The Reuters news agency reported recently that South Africa's Impala
Platinum Holdings had cut platinum contracts with Japanese buyers for 1995
to enable it to meet obligations to the US.
Other events this week include the publication today of the International
Primary Aluminium Institute's October stocks assessment. Today also sees the
start of a four-day meeting of the Association of Natural Rubber Producing
Countries, the first since this month's decision to roll over the
International Natural Rubber Agreement into another year.
On Wednesday the International Cocoa Organisation's executive production and
consumption committees begin three days of talks to assess the market
situation and study proposals for curbing supply by 350,000 tonnes over the
next five years.
Commodity exchange officials from around the world will gather in Beijing on
Thursday for a two-day seminar on futures trading being held by the city's
commodity exchange.
Also coming on Thursday is the publication of official figures for
Malaysia's palm oil stocks, exports and output. This will follow the issue
of private forecasters' assessments on Wednesday.

FT  12 DEC 94 / International Company News: Digital decoders for Canal Plus
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canal Plus, the French pay-TV company, has moved nearer the launch of
multimedia services by placing orders for digital decoders for satellite
broadcast transmissions.
The company has ordered decoders from five manufacturers - Philips, Pioneer,
Sony, Thomson-TCE and Eurodec, an affiliate of Canal Plus which
manufacturers the current decoders.
The digital decoders, which will be introduced in June next year, will be
used for the usual TV and video inputs and will also be compatible with
personal computers and telephones, enabling Canal Plus to offer interactive
services.
According to Canal Plus, its so-called Digital Project, which will offer
interactive services, will be launched in the last quarter of next year.
The company has declined to give details of the project, but analysts expect
it to include games and video on demand. It will also allow multiplexing, by
which a variety of programmes and services can be offered on the same
channel.
Canal Plus has already reserved transmitters on the Astra1E and Astra1F
satellites for the launch of its digital services.

FT  12 DEC 94 / International Company News: Seita to be sold in first
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government intends to privatise Seita, the state tobacco group
which makes Gauloises and Gitanes cigarettes, in the first three months of
1995, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, has revealed, raising some
FFr5bn - FFr6bn.
Expressing confidence that he would meet his target of raising FFr55bn
(Dollars 10bn) from privatisation in 1995, Mr Alphandery said in an
interview that Seita and Assurances Generales de France (AGF) would be sold
'at the start of next year, if market conditions allow'. He would not say
which sale would be first.
While the AGF privatisation has been ready for some time - indeed the sale
was at one point expected to precede that of Renault - this is the first
confirmation of Seita's imminent sale.
Hitherto, the only step the government has taken is to choose Credit
Lyonnais as its adviser, while Seita has retained the advisory services of
Societe Generale and Credit Commercial de France.
In another sign of Seita's accelerated sale, Mr Alphandery will today put
before the French Senate a bill to remove the civil service status of Seita
employees and to enable France's 35,700 tobacconists to buy shares in the
company on the same favourable terms as Seita's workforce.
Once that bill is passed, the government only needs to pass a simple
privatisation decree to launch Seita's privatisation.
The government intends to put 47.5 per cent of the shares on the open
market. This will leave about 2.5 per cent for the tobacconists, 5 per cent
for Seita employees, a residual 10 per cent stake for the state, and around
35 per cent for a 'noyau dur' core of institutional investors.
Foreign tobacco manufacturers are to be excluded from the 'noyau dur' to
maintain the neutrality of Seita in distribution. Seita has a de facto
distribution monopoly, supplying other brands of cigarettes as well as its
own.

FT  12 DEC 94 / International Company News: Bidding closes on an 'efficient
dinosaur' - Europe's biggest steelworks, has bowed to privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The steelworks at Taranto - located inside the heel of southern Italy - now
claims to be that rarest of beasts, an efficient dinosaur.
Certainly, the world will not see Taranto's like again. With an installed
production capacity of more than 10m tonnes of crude steel a year (before
EU-inspired capacity cuts), and a surface area of 1,500 hectares, it is the
biggest steelworks in Europe, and possibly the biggest in the world outside
Russia. No government could now afford to build a similar monster.
That is partly because of the cost of caring for such animals. In its
30-year lifetime, Taranto and its parent company Ilva have ravened up
thousands of billions of lire of state subsidies, including one last gulp,
reluctantly endorsed a year ago by the European Union, of nearly L5,000bn
(Dollars 3bn).
Further subsidies are politically and financially impossible; privatisation
is the only way forward.
Hence, at noon today IRI, the Italian state holding company, will close the
bidding for Ilva Laminati Piani (ILP), the flat steels subsidiary which owns
Taranto and its sister plant at Novi Ligure in Piedmont.
A year ago, Taranto's public image would have deterred even the bravest
punter from betting on a sale before the EU deadline of December 31.
Demonised by the European Commission and attacked almost daily by
unsubsidised German steelmakers for its rampant inefficiency, Ilva was
supposed to be the villain of the overcapacity problem blighting the
European steel industry.
Mr Nicola Muni, director of the Taranto plant, is still indignant about that
treatment. The overall EU plan to rescue the industry has withered.
European demand has picked up and other producers have said they will wait
for the next recession to make the capacity cuts everybody once deemed
essential.
However, Mr Muni claims that Ilva, and Taranto in particular, is one of the
few European steelmakers to have met its commitments under the original EU
plan.
Taranto has already closed down two reheating furnaces, cutting overall
capacity by some 1.2m tonnes a year, and has prepared the way, with the help
of EU funds, for 2,500 voluntary redundancies, taking the workforce below
10,000 for the first time in the plant's history.
Mr Muni points out that Italy is the biggest consumer of steel in Europe
after Germany, and yet ILP supplies only 45 per cent or so of the country's
requirements.
'It's obvious that the other producers in Europe had the objective of
closing ILP because then they would have had the Italian market to
themselves,' he says.
'It's a strategic, essential plant, not only for Ilva, but also for Italy,'
adds Mr Romolo Vescovi, responsible for international relations at ILP.
Not only that, it is a source of pride and income for the neighbouring town
of Taranto, which sits in the shadow of the plant's chimneys, furnaces and
piles of ore and coke.
The town is said to benefit each year to the tune of L1,100bn in wages and
services from the presence of the steelworks. Workers like to remind you how
the people of Taranto streamed into the plant last year to form a symbolic
human wall around one of the three reheating furnaces that Brussels had
originally wanted to close.
However, the Taranto works claims to have achieved more than an emotional
turnround in the past five years. Analysts agree that from being only a
middle-ranking steel producer in terms of efficiency, the company has moved
into the top five in Europe, belying the criticisms of the Commission and
competitors.
Mr Bill Scotting, an analyst with CRU International, the UK-based metals
industry consultancy, estimates that Ilva's net operating costs for the
production of hot-rolled coil - the dominant product emerging from Taranto -
fell by 14 per cent between 1990 and 1993.
Even stripping out the positive impact of the September 1992 devaluation of
the lira on ILP's performance, the company has cut costs by nearly 7 per
cent over the same period.
Mr Muni, a Taranto director since 1989, estimates that between 1993 and 1994
industrial costs will come down another 3 per cent, while workforce
reductions next year should improve the cost base still further.
Other European steelmakers may still smart from the way Italian politicians
delayed the restructuring of the state-owned industry, and there are dark
hints that ILP may still be receiving hidden subsidies, but IRI is at least
talking about ILP returning a profit this year.
Whether that makes the company an attractive prospect for buyers is a
different matter.
Taranto is a comparatively modern plant; it is well-sited next to a deep-sea
port for raw material deliveries; and its great size is not necessarily a
disadvantage as demand for steel improves.
The hot steel process used at Taranto also has a certain edge over the
much-vaunted 'mini-mills', which are sometimes hampered by the scarcity and
cost of the scrap on which they depend.
But firm bids have been hard to come by. Over the past six months, most of
Italy's private steelmakers and many of the world's largest producers have
been mentioned as possible buyers.
Within the last fortnight, at least one consortium has broken up and another
was only just finalising its offer before the weekend.
IRI has gambled that by setting a December 12 deadline, it will have time to
strike a deal before the end of the year. But if the offers tabled today are
not satisfactory, the state company may have to open a second, high-pressure
round of negotiations.
Meanwhile, Taranto will hope to convince potential new owners that it really
has shed its tarnished dinosaur image, and is living up to the metre-high
exhortatory slogans placed around the plant: 'Efficienza - Produzione -
Qualita'.

FT  12 DEC 94 / International Company News: Inmarsat in global phone plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The owners of Inmarsat, the London-based satellite communications
organisation, have approved plans to develop a Dollars 2.6bn worldwide
mobile phone service.
Inmarsat, which pioneered maritime voice and data services in the early
1980s, is owned by leading telecommunications organisations in some 75
countries, most of them state monopolies. Last week's decision, therefore,
implies approval from a broad spectrum of governments.
Finance still has to be found for the project. Each owner has until December
16 to decide whether to put up a share of the Dollars 1bn for the first
phase.
Inmarsat is in competition with other consortia. The most advanced is
Iridium, in which Motorola, the US company, is the principal partner. It has
completed its funding.
Globalstar is being developed by Loral, the US defence group. A newcomer is
Odyssey, which takes in TRW, the US aerospace manufacturer and Teleglobe, a
Canadian telecoms services provider.

Randgold, the troubled South African gold mining company, has signed a
mining convention with the government of Senegal and begun exploration in
Burkina Faso ahead of the planned listing of its west African mineral rights
next year.
Mr Peter Flack, Randgold executive chairman, said the accords and listing
represent the company's faith in the strong portfolio of mineral rights it
has acquired in the region over the past two years.
'There is a unique window of opportunity in west Africa at the moment which
Randgold is exceptionally well positioned to utilise,' he said. 'After many
centuries of neglect, gold mining there is now on the brink of a
renaissance.'
The most developed of Rangold's west African operations is in Burkina Faso,
where it recently secured a further 1,000 sq km to complement its 2,500 sq
km joint venture with Newmont.
It also has prospecting and mineral rights in Senegal, Ivory Coast and
Gabon.

<TEXT>
Provigo, one of Canada's top three food distributors, has written off
CDollars 152m (USDollars 110m) to cover the loss on the sale of its
California unit last month.
The write-off took the third quarter net loss to CDollars 139m, or CDollars
1.62 a share, compared with a loss of CDollars 74m, or 88 cents, after
special items a year earlier. Sales were little changed at CDollars 1.4bn.
Provigo is being restructured and on an operating level is staging a
turnround after several years of poor results.
For the nine months ended November 5, its loss was CDollars 113.2m, or
CDollars 1.37 a share, against CDollars 59.1m, or 79 cents, on sales little
changed at CDollars 4.2bn.
Provigo said its remaining Canadian business was profitable and was now
concentrating on improving performance.

FT  12 DEC 94 / International Company News: London acquisition fund to buy
Swedish group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Iro, the Swedish company which is the world's biggest producer of yarn
feeding equipment, is being bought for SKr620m (Dollars 83m) by CWB Capital
Partners, the London-based acquisition fund.
CWB, which specialises in acquiring market-leading manufacturing companies
in northern Europe, is buying Iro from Handel och Industri, the industrial
holding company of Sweden's Svenska Handelsbanken.
Iro, which is expected to have turnover this year of SKr815m, created the
market for yarn feeders, which are used on weaving and knitting machinery.
It has 750 employees and manufacturing plants in Ulriceham, Sweden, Biella,
Italy and Dornstetten, Germany.
Mr Nigel Doughty, CWB's chief executive, said Iro's profits were rising, but
would not disclose details.
The company is well-positioned to benefit from the upswing in the textile
machinery investment cycle as US, European and Asian economies pulled out of
recession, he said.
As part of the transaction, Iro's management is taking a 10 per cent stake
in the company, and Mr Hans-Eric Ovin is staying on as non-executive
chairman.
Financing is being provided by Mezzanine Management, a UK-based specialist
provider of mezzanine finance. Dresdner Bank will provide local working
capital facilities in Germany.
Handel och Industri was formed by Svenska Handelsbanken following the
bankruptcy in the early 1990s of Kongsbo, controlled by the Swedish
financier Mr Anders Wall. Kongsbo had owned Iro and other industrial
companies.
CWB has offices in London, Frankfurt and Stockholm, and its shareholders
include Standard Chartered Bank and WestLB. Its biggest acquisition was last
year's SKr3.46bn buy-out, in partnership with Goldman Sachs, of Tarkett
International, the German flooring company.

FT  12 DEC 94 / UK Company News: New growth ambitions for a 'disciplined' BP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Petroleum will announce new growth targets this week, its first
since the boardroom coup that tilted it into crisis 2 1/2 years ago.
Mr David Simon, chief executive, will set out to City analysts the company's
objectives for key financial indicators over the next two years: earnings,
capital spending, and debt reduction.
These will reflect the directors' belief that BP's financial health has been
restored to the point where it can develop new growth ambitions.
But with memories of the recent crisis not entirely eradicated, the stress
will be on 'discipline' and a strong balance sheet.
On dividends, Mr Simon is expected to say that increases will be paid when
justified by the company's improved performance.
In an interview with the FT, Mr Simon - who will take over as chairman of
the company next summer - said: 'We now have a 2 1/2 -year track record.
However, the group remains totally committed to performance improvement.'
The recovery was only 'a gateway to disciplined growth', Mr Simon added.
The earnings target will suggest that the company sees substantial scope to
boost its earnings well beyond the Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) a year target
it set in 1992.
The key to improved performance will be volume growth, improvements in
internal processes and continued cost cutting, according to Mr Simon.
Both Mr Simon and Mr John Browne, the current head of exploration who will
take over as chief executive in July, believe there are attractive growth
options in the upstream and downstream segments of the business. The capital
spending target is therefore likely to show an increase over this year's
Dollars 3.8bn as the group seeks to expand the business once again.
BP will continue to pay down its Dollars 10bn debt until it reaches the
level of comparably sized oil companies such as Chevron and Mobil of the US.
Mr Simon said BP was uncomfortable with debt levels which caused it to stand
out among its peers. 'We want to get back into the woodwork,' he said.
Mr Browne emphasised that BP was determined to restore its international
reputation: 'It's the heart of our business.'

FT  12 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Potential Lloyd's investor pulls out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nervousness about structural upheaval at Lloyd's of London has led to a US
investor pulling out of a plan that would have provided Pounds 50m in
corporate capital for the insurance market next year.
The decision is a setback for Brockbank, one of the largest managing
agencies. It had hoped to announce a new investment company last week,
supplying funds for the syndicates it runs, in time for the 1995
underwriting year.
It is also a disappointment for Lloyd's, reducing the total funds raised by
corporate investors for next year to about Pounds 320m. This is in addition
to the Pounds 900m invested in 1994.
Brockbank has not named the investor but agreement is understood to have
been close enough for funds to have been lodged with Lloyd's before the
November 30 deadline for those planning to invest in 1995.
Last minute problems are believed to have occured because the investor was
worried about the knock-on effects if Lloyd's failed in its attempts to
'ring-fence' all liabilities for 1985 and before as part of its plans to
create a 'clean' insurance market for future investors.
There were also problems in drawing up a contract that would accommodate the
investor's interest in acquiring half of the Brockbank managing agencies
business. Lloyd's rules restrict ownership to 25 per cent, though the market
is expected to relax regulations next year.

<TEXT>
There was a slight fall in pre-tax profits of Lyons Irish Holdings,
Dublin-based food manufacturing offshoot of an Allied Domecq' subsidiary for
the 28 weeks ended September 17.
From turnover, also down, at IPounds 13.8m against IPounds 13.9m, the
interim surplus came out at IPounds 4.43m (Pounds 4.35m), compared with
IPounds 4.59m previously.
Operating profits were unchanged at IPounds 3m and the directors felt this
was a 'good achievement' at a time of intense competition.
The pre-tax figure was after lower interest income - because of less
favourable rates - of IPounds 1.42m (IPounds 1.57m).
Earnings per share were 12.11p, against 13.43p, while the interim dividend
is increased from 3.45p to 3.65p.

FT  12 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Lion stops new business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Lion, the lossmaking London market insurer, is to cease writing all
new and renewal business with immediate effect.
The move follows a 'strategic decision' to withdraw from active underwriting
in the London market, the parent company, China Merchants Group, the Chinese
state-owned shipping and investment concern, said on Friday.
Scottish Lion suffered pre-tax losses of Pounds 11.6m last year and the
directors said they expected a further deterioration in underwriting results
this year.
Mr Richard Williams, finance director, said, however, that the company
expected no difficulties meeting claims on existing policies.

FT  12 DEC 94 / UK Company News: KPMG fee income advances 5% - Strong growth
reported in all sections except for corporate recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, recorded a 5 per cent growth in fee
income from Pounds 491.8m to Pounds 516.4m for the year to September 1994 in
what could be its last set of results in the traditional partnership format.
It is consulting clients, investors, and regulators on a plan to create a
limited company to audit its public limited company clients.
The firm has said that if it went ahead it would not only publish financial
results for the audit arm but for the whole UK business. These would include
bottom-line profits and earnings per partner.
In its results published today the firm showed strong figures for all parts
of the business except corporate recovery, a reflection of the drop in
insolvency work during the economic recovery.
KPMG said that its core audit and accounting business grew by 6 per cent and
reported new audit customers in Booker, Hepworth, North West Water, and
First Choice Holidays.
Senior partner Mr Colin Sharman said: 'We have won audit proposals, often
when not the lowest tender, by demonstrating a combination of high quality
technical and client service.
'Accountancy is coming out of the doldrums and provided we continue to
deliver a highly professional service and value for money then next year
should see even stronger fee growth.'
The corporate finance business showed 15 per cent growth as the firm
reported increased involvement in mergers, acquisitions, management
buy-outs, privatisation work and new issues. The firm acted as reporting
accountants for 55 company flotations.
Since the start of the decade corporate finance has grown 50 per cent and
now represents 14 per cent of fee income.
Fee income from tax services rose 4 per cent to Pounds 108.5m. Growth was
seen in tax work linked to corporate transactions, international tax, profit
related pay, and international executive tax.
If incorporation of the audit arm does go ahead, and a decision is expected
in the new year, then next year's results for audit will themselves be
independently audited. Other large accountancy firms, some of which are
discussing incorporation, will await the results with interest.

FT  12 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Enterprise consolidates Norwegian side
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil Norge, a subsidiary of London-based Enterprise Oil, has
consolidated its presence in the Norwegian North Sea oil sector through a
series of disposals and acquisitions, for which it did not disclose
financial details.
Enterprise said that it had agreed to sell to Statoil, the Norwegian state
oil company, a 10 per cent stake in licence PL-034 in the Norwegian Sea
covering two blocks which comprise the Smoerbukk field, situated on the
Halten Bank.
The field contains estimated reserves of 3.3 trillion feet of gas and 230m
barrels of oil and condensate.
Enterprise said the disposal amounted to less than one per cent of the joint
Smoerbukk, Smoerbukk South and Midgard fields for which Statoil next year
will seek approval for a joint NKr35bn (Pounds 3.3bn) development.
'We decided that to remain in the forthcoming Halten Bank development
project with our very small participating share would not be making the best
use of our resources. We will therefore use the cash raised in this sale to
actively pursue exploration and development opportunities where we have a
stronger presence elsewhere on the Norwegian continental shelf,' explained
Mr John Bullough, general manager of Enterprise Oil Norge.
Statoil recently increased its shareholding in the area and took over
operational responsibility from Saga Petroleum, Norway's biggest independent
oil company, following a complex series of deals.
Enterprise also announced a separate series of transactions in which it
boosted its shareholdings in three Norwegian North Sea exploration licences
through farm-in arrangements in blocks where the company considers there
exists significant potential for oil discoveries to be made.
In block 30/8, where drilling has started and which Enterprise considers to
be of high quality, the company lifted its stake from 10 per cent to 15 per
cent, while in block 1/3 Enterprise doubled its stake to 20 per cent. The
company said an appraisal well is scheduled for 1995.
In block 24/9, where an oil discovery was recently appraised successfully,
Enterprise increased its shareholding to 40 (30) per cent.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Company News (This Week): Buy-backs set to enhance returns
for shareholders - Electricity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dividends will be on everyone's minds when seven of the 12 regional
electricity companies report next week. Analysts are expecting average
growth of about 20 per cent, a trend which has already been set by the
handful which have reported in recent weeks.
The RECs are able to deliver such healthy increases partly because most of
them have been busily buying back their shares over the last year. By
spreading the same amount of cash over fewer shares, they have found a
reasonably economical way of enhancing shareholder returns.
A few companies such as Eastern and Southern have not been as active in
share buy-backs, so their dividend increases will be of special interest.
Forecasts are for pre-tax profits of about Pounds 85m for Eastern and Pounds
92m for Southern and dividend increases of almost 20 per cent. Eastern's
propensity for surprises has some market observers hoping for news of a
special pay-out. Yorkshire, which is forecast to report profits of about
Pounds 98m, is also a promising candidate.
Northern Electricity is expected to show one of the larger dividend
increases with a rise of about 22 per cent. The market is anticipating
pre-tax profits of about Pounds 61m. South West and London are likely to
trail behind with dividend increases of about 18 per cent. Forecasts are for
interim profits of Pounds 46m at SWEB and Pounds 85m at London.
Few expect the RECs to divulge much about plans for the flotation of the
National Grid in the spring. The companies are waiting for the government's
response to proposals on sharing flotation proceeds between customers and
shareholders.
Some investors are hoping for clarification on another subject from Manweb,
with expected profits of about Pounds 53m. Questions are likely to be asked
about the abrupt departure of Manweb's finance director this year.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Warburg sets out to tempt investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley are likely to seek ways of paying UK
shareholders sterling dividends on shares in the merged investment bank they
want to create, although it will probably be a US company.
The move is being considered by Warburg's to convince shareholders of the
plan's benefits, even though they will not be offered the premium for shares
they would receive in a takeover.
Mercury Asset Management, the fund management company which is 75 per cent
owned by Warburg, is to announce today that it has appointed the merchant
bank Lazard Brothers to advise it on the merger offer.
Warburg's only outside adviser is its corporate broker Cazenove &amp; Co,
although it recently employed the US bank JP Morgan to advise it about
obtaining a credit rating from the agency Standard &amp; Poor's.
One of the most contentious issues of the merger, the terms of which are
expected to be announced shortly, is whether Morgan Stanley and Warburg will
make a preferential offer to buy out MAM's minority shareholders.
Without a preferential offer, MAM minority shareholders could reject the bid
on the grounds that the merged banks are not paying full value for a company
that contributes Pounds 1bn of Warburg's market capitalisation.
However, a preferential offer could be resisted by Morgan Stanley directors.
It could also undermine the deal's logic because minority shareholders would
receive a higher price for MAM shares than Warburg.
Warburg directors are thought to be trying to bring forward an announcement
originally planned for next week giving preliminary terms of the merger, as
well as details of how operations would be combined.
There was considerable volatility in Warburg's share price on Friday
following the announcement on Thursday because of speculation about the
motives for the merger and the possibility of a counter-bid.
The merged investment bank will probably be a US company, but listed in New
York and London. However, directors believe UK institutions may prefer to
receive dividends in sterling.

Potential buyers have until noon today to table their bids for Ilva Laminati

FT  12 DEC 94 / Countdown to Stanhope decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks which loaned Pounds 140m to Stanhope, the property developer headed by
Mr Stuart Lipton, meet tomorrow to decide whether to put the company into
receivership.
Stanhope's existing loan facility runs out a week today. The 16 bank
syndicate led by Barclays can either appoint receivers or give the company
more time to come up with an acceptable rescue plan.
The two main rescue proposals come from British Land, the property
investment company, headed by Mr John Ritblat, which already has a 29.9 per
cent stake in Stanhope, and Postel, the post and telecommunications pension
fund run by Mr Alastair Ross Goobey.
British Land has offered the banks a cash-plus-paper deal for Stanhope's
main asset, its half share in Broadgate Properties, which owns the most of
Broadgate and Ludgate office developments in the City of London.
Mr Ross Goobey's proposal would involve a massive Stanhope rights issue
enabling the company to repay the banks and buy the other half of Broadgate
Properties from the receiver of Rosehaugh, Stanhope's former development
partner.
The cost of the Postel proposal would be around Pounds 250m, against
Stanhope's current market capitalisation of Pounds 22m. Postel and another
UK pension fund would underwrite the rights issue.
Mr Lipton, chief executive of the company he founded in 1983, would have a
nominal role in a recapitalised Stanhope.
However, the British Land and Postel proposals involve the banks taking a
write-down of more the 20p in the pound on their loans to Stanhope. It is
unclear whether the syndicate, advised by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, is willing
to accept such a write-down.
The Postel plan may require the support of 75 per cent of Stanhope's
shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting, depending on the form of
the issue, allowing British Land an opportunity to block the deal.
For the Postel plan to succeed, it also has to agree on a price for the
other half of Broadgate Properties with Rosehaugh's receiver, Mr Roger
Oldfield of KPMG Peat Marwick.
According to Broadgate Properties' last accounts, published in October, the
net asset value of the company was Pounds 232m, split equally between
Stanhope and Rosehaugh.
Mr Oldfield is thought to be asking at least Pounds 110m for Rosehaugh's
share and has said that he would rather wait for the property market to
improve than sell Broadgate cheaply.
While the banks agree that unifying Broadgate under a single owner would be
the best way of realising value, this could also be achieved by putting
Stanhope into receivership under KPMG.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Profits drop causes global ripple of fear: Hoist with its
own petard - Southwest Airlines tumbles as fare war takes its toll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Southwest Airlines is hardly among the biggest or best-known airlines: yet
the extraordinary influence of this Texas-based US carrier was felt around
the world at the end of last week.
Global airline stocks took a battering after Southwest announced that
fourth-quarter profits were going to be 'substantially below' its net income
of Dollars 38.4m (Pounds 23.4m) a year earlier. In Europe, KLM's shares
dropped nearly 4 per cent on Friday, and Lufthansa's fell by 2.2 per cent.
On the face of it, the reaction was unjustified: Southwest's problems stem
from conditions peculiar to the US domestic market. But investors were left
wondering: 'If Southwest, of all airlines, is in trouble, what hope is there
for the rest of them?'
Southwest's fourth-quarter downturn ends a remarkable period of profits
growth for the company - remarkable because it has contrasted so sharply
with the heavy losses suffered by the rest of the US airline industry in
recent years.
Southwest has prospered because of its low costs. The airline specialises in
short-haul shuttle services on high-density routes in the US. There are no
in-flight meals or other frills; flights are frequent and turnarounds are
fast; and employees are hard-working, flexible and enthusiastic. As a
result, South-west's operating costs per available seat mile are just 7.1
cents - 19 per cent below the US industry average of 8.8 cents.
Low costs have enabled Southwest to grow rapidly in the deregulated US
market by charging rock-bottom fares. Expanding from its home territory of
Texas, it has spread across the southern states and has become the biggest
flight operator within California. Last year it began an assault on the
north-east by offering flights on the Baltimore-Chicago and
Baltimore-Cleveland routes at up to 85 per cent less than existing fares.
Southwest's strategy has led to a revolution in US air travel, at least on
short-haul routes. It has turned flying into a low-cost, high-volume
commodity business. Taking a flight on many routes in the US today is like
catching a bus: seats are unassigned and the service is rudimentary, but the
fare is cheap.
The trouble for Southwest is that other US carriers have responded to this
transformation by trying to mimic its formula. In markets where Southwest
operates, they have slashed fares in an attempt to keep market share. In
California, United Airlines has set up an operation called United Shuttle to
compete directly with Southwest. On the east coast, Southwest is slugging it
out in a three-cornered contest with Continental Airlines and USAir.
Until recently, the main victims of these fare wars had been Southwest's
competitors. Forced to match Southwest's low fares but lacking Southwest's
low costs, they had incurred heavy losses on routes where the competition
was strong.
The other US carriers, however, are working to get their costs down. A year
ago, South-west's operating costs per available seat mile were 26 per cent
below the industry average. Today, at 19 per cent, the gap is still wide,
but it is narrowing.
So does the fourth-quarter profits downturn indicate that the party is over
for Southwest? Not according to the company. On Friday, it said the biggest
factor behind the downturn had been the cost of integrating Morris Air, a
regional carrier based in Salt Lake City which it bought a year ago but
which has only recently been absorbed at an operational level.
Still, Southwest acknowledged that fare competition had played a role. Other
airlines were matching its fares on routes where they competed, the company
said, so it had held a number of special offers during the quarter. 'This is
as close as you can get to war in a peacetime environment,' a spokesman
remarked.
Southwest said some of its fare cuts had probably been too steep and it
would not be repeating them; and with Morris Air now fully integrated, it
expected profits to bounce back in next year's first quarter. 'We feel very
confident that growth will be back in line with what shareholders are used
to,' it said.
In the longer term, Southwest insists that it will remain one jump ahead of
other airlines by getting its own costs even lower. Next month, for example,
its pilots will be asked to ratify a highly unusual 10-year labour contract
under which they will get no wage increases for the next five years, instead
receiving share options.
Whether or not Southwest's optimism is justified, the outlook for the rest
of the US industry remains poor. With too many aircraft chasing too few
passengers, cut-throat fare competition looks set to continue and only the
lowest-cost carriers have any hope of doing well.
To the extent that the US air travel market today offers a glimpse of the
rest of the world's tomorrow, the reaction of global airline stocks to last
week's events was perhaps, after all, understandable.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Brussels told to rethink on computer research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's leading computing services companies have told the European
Commission that funds earmarked for basic computer technology research would
be better spent on information services to run on the 'digital
superhighway'.
The Services Informatics Expertise advisory group (SIX) says that unless
resources are made available quickly, Europe will fall behind countries,
such as the US, in laying the foundations of the information society.
The advisory group's 11 members include Cap Sogeti Gemini and Sligos of
France, Sema Group and Logica of the UK, and Finsiel of Italy. Together,
they have some 60,000 employees and annual revenues in excess of Ecu 6bn
(Pounds 4.6bn).
Their proposals are a response to a report by Mr Martin Bangemann, industry
commissioner, which encouraged Europe's information technology companies to
seize opportunities presented by the information society.
The Commission has already agreed to spend Pounds 2.6bn over the next five
years on basic research in information technology.
SIX's chief proposal is that funds should be available to pump prime the
early stages of large projects. Governments, companies and customers should
work together to identify service needs. If there is no obvious customer for
a service, the commission should take that role to help create demand. The
type of project might include a system to exchange environmental information
held on different databases.
Acceptance of the SIX proposals would mean an abrupt change of strategy for
the Commission, whose Framework research programme provides 50 per cent
funding for 'pre-competitive' research, to provide a common pool of
knowledge and expertise.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Aid unlikely for main rail lines: Government subsidies to be
aimed at rural and branch services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's main line rail services will be expected to pay their own way so
that government subsidies can be concentrated on maintaining rural lines and
branch services, an announcement on Wednesday is likely to make clear.
The details of the passenger service requirements - the minimum timetable
that must be run to win government subsidy - are expected to create a
political furore because they will be seen as reducing services.
The timetable regulations to be unveiled by Mr Roger Salmon, railway
franchising director responsible for the sale of British Rail's passenger
train service, will show that operators must provide only an hourly service
on their main inter-city routes compared with the present half-hour
frequency on many main lines.
But Mr Salmon will argue that the train operators will have a commercial
interest in running services as frequently as possible and that services
will be maintained at least at present levels. InterCity services were the
most profitable part of BR.
If the franchising director were to expect train operators to guarantee a
half-hourly service, he would also have to promise to subsidise them if they
proved unprofitable. This would drain funds from the rural and branch lines,
many of which require considerable subsidies.
The timetable requirements are also expected to show that the franchising
director is not prepared to subsidise continuation of all sleeper services
between Scotland and England.
The franchising director has been allocated government subsidy to meet the
Pounds 2.2bn of track access charges to be paid by the 24 train operating
companies being created from BR.
Critics of rail privatisation have predicted the break-up of rail services
will lead to a decline in the quality and frequency of services. Sir Bob
Reid, BR chairman, and train user groups say the bureaucracy involved in the
new fragmented railway and the impact of the signalworkers' strike have
already led to reduced services.
But Mr Salmon is expected to point out that there has been no guarantee of
levels of services in the past and that the timetable arrangements included
in passenger service requirements represent an improvement on the previous
situation. The service requirements lay down frequency of trains and the
time of the first and last service.
If the timetable is laid down in excessive detail, Mr Salmon believes, train
operators will not have sufficient commercial freedom.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Chile invited to join trade zone with US, Canada and Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MIAMI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The leaders of the US, Mexico and Canada yesterday invited Chile to join
them in the North American Free Trade Agreement, in what they described as
the first step towards a free-trade zone covering the Americas.
The announcement capped a three-day summit at which leaders from 34
countries in the Americas and the Caribbean promised to complete
negotiations for the creation of the Free Trade Area of the Americas
stretching from Alaska to Argentina by the year 2005.
Mr Jean Chretien, prime minister of Canada, said talks would begin in the
new year and full negotiations on Chile's accession to Nafta would start by
May.
'For one year now we have been the three amigos. Starting today we will
become the four amigos,' he said, adding that Chile would lead the way for
other countries to join Nafta.
US president Bill Clinton said the agreement was 'further proof of our
intentions to complete the free trade area of all the Ameri cas by 2005'.
Mr Eduardo Aninat, Chile's finance minister, told journalists: 'We are very
optimistic that we can have a signed, fully-fledged accord 14-15 months
after starting talks in January.' The existing Nafta members will meet next
week to assess Chile's readiness to join the accord, with four-way talks
starting in January.
The Free Trade Area of the Americas, to be built on the foundations of
existing agreements such as Nafta, was the central element in a five-page
declaration of principles signed by the leaders of 34 countries in America
and the Caribbean at the end of their three-day summit in Miami.
In a 23-point plan, the leaders also spelt out specific follow-up actions to
ensure their declarations do not turn out as empty as those made at the last
Americas summit in Uruguay 27 years ago.
The leaders also endorsed development goals, and promised steps to
strengthen democracy and combat drug trafficking. Some Latin American
leaders castigated Mr Clinton for the US failure to do more to stop drug
consumption.
However, the tenor of the conference was positive. Bolivian president
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada said the summit represented a 'sea change' of
formerly antagonistic attitudes between the US and Latin America. Yet some
delegates wondered whether Mr Clinton - who even before his party's defeat
in last month's congressional election only narrowly won approval of Nafta
and Gatt - would be able to pursue his commitment to free trade and the
'partnership for development and prosperity'.

FT  12 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Japanese rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report
calling for a cut in Japanese interest rates was out of date. Compiled in
the summer, the study argued that although nominal rates were at a historic
low, in real terms rates were too high. That was because of Japan's negative
inflation, currently running at about minus 1.5 per cent. However, the need
for a cut has been obviated by Japan's continuing, if unspectacular,
economic growth and the yen's recent depreciation against the dollar
following US interest rate rises.
Nevertheless, the OECD's argument that the yen's strength is the biggest
threat to Japan's tentative recovery remains compelling. While interest
rates may not need to be cut again, the Bank of Japan should certainly not
increase them. The rise in overnight call rates suggests the Bank is tempted
to raise rates in an effort to maintain pressure on the corporate sector.
In theory, an increase in the cost of capital and an appreciation of the yen
would oblige Japanese companies to address their three surpluses: capacity,
stocks and staff. But an increase in rates could damage domestic demand as
well as jeopardise the prospects of Japan's exporters. With the yen higher,
Japanese exports to the US and Asia could struggle as these economies revert
to more normal growth rates next year or in 1996. Guiding Japanese interest
rates will not be easy: Mr Yasuo Matsushita, who starts as Bank of Japan
governor at the end of this week, has a difficult task before him.

FT  12 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Law of the jungle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Morgan Stanley/SG Warburg merger, if consummated, will be like the
arrival of a new species in a jungle. Other species will need to adapt or
risk extinction. Some will seek to become integrated global investment banks
too. Others will redefine the niches in which they operate, the better to
defend themselves against competition from the emerging global houses. Over
time, the industry will polarise.
A few firms - notably Goldman Sachs and, perhaps, Merrill Lynch - are
already well on the way to achieving global status. To a lesser extent, so
are the other US 'bulge bracket' houses: Salomon Brothers, CS First Boston
and Lehman Brothers. Many European regional groups have similar aspirations.
In their struggle to become global, they could provoke a wave of mergers,
acquisitions and alliances. Much of the action will be transatlantic, but
both US and European houses will be aiming to fill holes in Asia too.
The prime movers may be commercial banks with medium-sized investment
banking arms: Deutsche Bank via its Morgan Grenfell subsidiary; Barclays
Bank with BZW; HSBC via James Capel and Samuel Montagu; and Union Bank of
Switzerland. They have sufficient capital to buy all or part of another
investment bank, if they wish. But some commercial banks - National
Westminster, for example - may need to consider whether their investment
banking subsidiaries are so far from making the global grade that they would
do better to retrench or even divest.
Which banks will be wooed? Kleinwort Benson looks an obvious target since it
is trying to compete in the big league with a relatively small capital base.
However, for European banks anyway, the priority will be to acquire US
distribution capability. So some association with a Smith Barney or a
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette may have greater appeal. Jardine Fleming and
Peregrine Capital would be attractive partners for those looking to boost
their Far Eastern presence.
Mergers or acquisitions will be risky. Putting together two or more cultures
is hard. In the process, good employees may be lost and managers may be so
concerned with internal matters that they take their eyes off the ball. At
worst, standards will slip and reputations will be lost.
There is also a risk that, if many firms chase the same goal, margins will
be squeezed. That risk will rise if commercial banks, which have a habit of
following fads, pour vast amounts of capital into the industry.
More specialised rivals may seek to comfort themselves with such thoughts.
They may reflect that even successful global houses will not devour
everything in the investment banking jungle: some of the pickings will be
just too small to arouse interest.
But specialised houses would be unwise to rest on their laurels. The
emerging integrated global houses are out to poach their biggest deals and
clients. They have strong sales pitches. Corporations are wooed with the
idea that they can cut their cost of capital by tapping a wider base of
international investors. Investors are told they can reduce their risk by
building diversified cross-border portfolios. And those buying or selling
businesses are encouraged to think they need a bank that can scour the world
for opportunities and keep in touch with shareholders in multiple
jurisdictions.
Unless they raise their game, the more focused houses could find themselves
left with just the small local deals. The likes of Schroders, NM Rothschild
and Lazard currently earn good livings by concentrating on advisory work.
Their edge comes from the attention they pay to relationships. But they also
need to arrange finance for their corporate clients - otherwise they become
little more than management consultants - and that means plugging into
securities distribution networks. For how long will they be able to access
such networks if these are part of integrated houses owned by rivals?
Schroders, at least, has an insurance policy with its Wertheim securities
operation in the US.
Similarly, Cazenove and Smith New Court make good profits from running UK
distribution networks. For the moment, they are protected from the full
onslaught of foreign competition by practices such as rights issues and
quote-driven trading systems. But US houses are fighting to bring in
American practices such as book-building and order-driven trading. There is
already some support in official circles for such changes. If the
Warburg/Morgan Stanley merger proceeds, the pressure will intensify.
None of this means that every merchant bank and broker must rush to become
one of a new species of global house. There is a role for many types of
beast in the investment banking jungle. But the jungle of the future will be
more competitive than the jungle of the past.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Personal View: Airports owner bad for its customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RUPERT DARWALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA, the privatised company that owns London's three airports, has been a
profitable investment for its shareholders. Its share price has risen
fourfold since BAA was privatised in 1987. What makes it especially
attractive is the virtually guaranteed return on capital allowed to the
company by its regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority.
But while BAA's shareholders have done well, the same cannot be said for its
customers. Airport charges and rents are generally higher in the UK than in
the US. All airport revenue ultimately comes from airline customers, whether
passengers or cargo, in higher air fares.
High charges also hit airline profitability, which is often lower than that
of the airports they use. Last year, for example, Heathrow airport's return
on capital was 26 per cent higher than that of British Airways. This is
despite heavy revaluations of BAA's assets such as runways and terminal
buildings that have much longer operational lives than aircraft.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission was dissatisfied with the
effectiveness of regulation when it last reviewed BAA in 1991. The
commission concluded that it would be useful to reconsider whether 'to
substitute a degree of competition for the present system of regulation'.
One commission member, Mr Graham Mather, went further, arguing that BAA
should be forced to divest one of the London airports 'sooner rather than
later'.
But it is doubtful whether simply breaking up BAA in this way would be the
answer, since it is hard to introduce competition in the airport market.
Different airports are not comparable products: demand for extra capacity at
Heathrow cannot be satisfied by offering lowercharges at Gatwick or
Stansted.
Furthermore, the planning system limits the extent to which capacity can be
increased to satisfy demand. Whoever owns Heathrow, can effectively act as a
monopolist.
International conventions such as the Bermuda 2 agreement between the US and
the UK specify that airport charges should not be set by supply and demand.
The fundamental principle of the 1985 Airports White Paper was that
'airports are not an end in themselves: they exist to support air services'.
Airport charges should therefore be cost-related and allow for only
'reasonable' profits.
Deciding what is a reasonable level for profits depends on the cost of
capital that BAA is allowed to assume in setting charges. BAA told the MMC
in 1991 that it was a high-risk business, an argument the MMC appeared to
accept in allowing a generous price cap for airport charges between 1992 and
1997.
In assessing reasonable profits, the MMC looked to the dividend yield on
BAA's shares. But this is like looking into a mirror; investors value highly
the regulator's implied guaranteed rate of return and push up the share
price. To the regulator, the high share price implies that investors require
higher profits. A false market is thus created.
The MMC sets the maximum charges for the London airports on the assumption
that BAA needed a return on the current cost of its capital of 8 per cent.
This is the same as nationalised industries, where the Treasury uses
demanding current cost targets that force them to finance investment from
user charges as far as possible.
But this is not appropriate for a private company which can finance
investment from borrowing. Unusually for such a company, BAA has been able
to finance its airport investment programme from cashflow. Since 1991, BAA's
capital expenditure has totalled more than Pounds 1bn, equivalent to
operating cash flow after net interest payments, all of which comes from the
airlines and their customers. There has been an increase in external
financing - mainly borrowings. But this is much the same as the amount paid
by BAA to its shareholders.
The regulator should review BAA's position as a monopoly supplier of capital
to its London airports. One answer is market-testing to find out whether
other companies would be prepared to accept a lower return on capital than
BAA to finance airport improvements.
This could be done using techniques being developed for the government's
private finance initiative, by inviting bids for new projects from outside
investors and banks. If this led to lower costs of capital, it would put
downward pressure on airport charges and help improve airline profitability.
If BAA were to be privatised today, it would be in a very different form.
Simply putting BAA in the private sector with a quasi-guaranteed return on
an ever-expanding asset based is not a long-term answer.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Leading Article: The danger for Russia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Today is the first anniversary of the adoption of Russia's post-Soviet
constitution. It has been marked by the introduction of troops into
Chechnya, the break-away region in Russia's Caucasus.
The intervention is uniformly seen by Russian liberals as heralding disaster
for the country's wobbly democratic structures. Their evidence for this is
strong.
First, they see in President Boris Yeltsin's recent actions a man
increasingly inclined to lean towards those of his administration who are
counselling a crackdown: on crime (epidemic by any standards); on corruption
(universal throughout the bureaucracy); and on business. The incident 10
days ago, when the bodyguards of Mr Vladimir Gusinsky, chairman of the Most
financial group, were assaulted by members of President Yeltsin's own guard,
has raised fears that the crackdown will take the form of identifying and
persecuting high-profile capitalists.
Second, liberals are more and more depressed by the evidence in recent
regional elections that the Russian people have retreated from political
life in disgust, either refusing to produce the required 25 per cent turnout
or, when they do, electing communists and extreme nationalists. Of all of
the liberal parties, only that of Mr Yegor Gaidar has remained in rather
desperate support of Mr Yeltsin.
Economic reform
Third, liberals see a government and a president openly inclined to postpone
elections indefinitely. They are at best sceptical of the Kremlin's will, or
its ability, to push through serious economic reform, believing it is
bidding for western aid with no real intention to use it to stabilise the
economy.
The playing of the military card in Chechnya is seen as confirmation that
the men of force and suppression are in the ascendant, and that the
flickering flame of pluralism is guttering out. Russian liberals believe
that the Russian Federation cannot be held together by force. They fear that
tiny but fiercely anti-Russian Chechnya could prove as formidable and
humiliating an opponent as Afghanistan. They are concerned that a bloody war
in Chechnya would make Russia a pariah abroad and authoritarian at home.
Educated people
Much of this is incontrovertible. However, Chechnya is not Afghanistan, but
a part of Russia: it chose to express its aspirations to independence
unilaterally, without any attempt to negotiate a split. No state leadership
can merely acquiesce in such moves. The first word from the Kremlin is that
the troops and armour will ring, not attack, the Chechen capital, and that
negotiations should then start. It is possible that a deal might be struck.
The verdict on Russia is not yet in. The private economy is chaotic and
criminalised, but it is growing and providing, for some Russians, a standard
of living undreamt of in communist days. Extremist parties are popular, but
they are not yet in charge, and Russia today is a freer country than ever
before.
Russian democracy is too easily pronounced a corpse. It is not: it is a
living organism, sick of many ailments and unsteady on its legs, but still
sustained by an educated, sceptical if wearied people and by politicians who
are often corrupt but in crucial instances animated by a desire to recreate
their country as a 'normal' one. Chechnya is dangerous for Russia, but it is
not yet the harbinger of totalitarianism revisited.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Referendum required
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major no longer rules out a referendum on a single European
currency. This is clearly a change from his previous hostility on principle
to 'referendums in a parliamentary democracy'. He still wants to 'consider
the constitutional implications for British democracy of referendums
generally', but now sees advantages as well as disadvantages.
Inevitably these remarks have been greeted with cynicism by Mr Major's
opponents, as evidence of a classic deathbed conversion. And Mr Major would
not have altered his thinking on this point if he were still in full control
of his party and backed by a solid parliamentary majority. Agreement to
differ about Europe, leaving the most divisive issue to be settled by
popular vote at a later date, may be the only way the Conservatives can
reunite and hold together from now until the next election.
That would perhaps be a good enough reason for Mr Major to change his mind.
It would not in itself make a referendum a good idea. Indeed, there is no
guarantee that it would have the desired effect. The single currency is not
the only European issue which divides the Conservatives; and feelings
against Mr Major are now running so high that his continued leadership may
in itself have become an unsurmountable obstacle to party unity.
Profound importance
There is, however, a much better reason for holding out the promise of a
referendum, which is the same reason that induced Mr Major, quite rightly,
to promise a referendum in Northern Ireland on any change in its
constitutional status. The issue is one of confidence between rulers and
ruled in the short term, and one of the legitimacy of political institutions
in the long term.
Britain's relationship to the European Union is not a problem for the
Conservatives alone. Indeed, Conservative MPs would not be tearing their
party apart over it if they did not sense that it is an issue of profound
importance to the country as a whole. It may not evoke such an immediate
popular response as the poll tax. But many British people remain unconvinced
that the country has benefited from its 20-year membership of the European
Community, and many more are aware that a single currency, along with some
other changes currently canvassed on the continent, would transform the
nature of the Union and mark a further very significant pooling of state
sovereignty.
That does not mean there is a settled majority opposed to such changes.
Indeed, if a moment comes when the government of the day is convinced that
Britain's main partners will go ahead with a new stage of European
integration and that Britain's national interest is to be involved rather
than to stand aside, it should be able to impart that conviction to a
majority of the British people, and would probably be helped in doing so by
the leaders of the other political parties.
Political expediency
But constitutional change of this magnitude will lack legitimacy without the
'full-hearted consent of parliament and people', as Sir Edward Heath
recognised when he led the country into the EC in the early 1970s. He did
not hold a referendum then, but it proved necessary to hold one
retroactively in 1975. That too was in part a matter of political expediency
for the party then in power, but it also served to legitimise the decision
taken by a previous parliament, and effectively ended the argument about
British membership of the Community as it then existed.
The UK is indeed a parliamentary democracy, but parliament has difficulty in
delivering the consent of the people on European issues in a convincing way,
because Europe cuts so sharply across the party lines on which general
elections are held. One can imagine - though without relish - a massive
restructuring of British politics, with attitudes for and against European
integration replacing 'left' and 'right' as the permanent defining issue of
party loyalties. Short of that, a device other than a general election has
to be found to enable the electorate to give its verdict, and that can only
be a referendum.
That does not mean holding a referendum on every decision affecting the EU;
only on a decision which radically alters the constitutional status of the
UK. Monetary union would be such a decision. A federal constitution for
Europe would be another, if such were to be the outcome of the 1996
intergovernmental conference - which at present seems far from likely. The
Maastricht treaty as passed last year, without a final commitment to
monetary union, was a borderline case.
It would be wrong to reopen that issue now, but ministers must be aware that
the less-than-full-hearted consent they obtained for the treaty has tainted
the legitimacy of the Union to which it gave birth. The British public have
become suspicious that a federal Europe is being imposed on them by stealth,
much as the majority in Northern Ireland fear that Irish unity is being
constructed behind their backs. The solution, in the one case as in the
other, lies in assuring them that no fundamental change will be made without
their consent being explicitly sought and obtained.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Restored to health with new ambition: David Simon and John
Browne describe BP's business strategy to Robert Corzine and David Lascelles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Healing can be a slow process in the business world. It has taken British
Petroleum two-and-a-half years to recover from the crisis of mid-1992 that
led to the dramatic ousting of its former chairman Mr Robert Horton.
Then, the UK's leading oil company cut its dividend as it struggled to
reduce a Dollars 16bn (Pounds 10.6bn) debt mountain and saw its share price
plummet.
This year, BP's shares have soared to record highs as the company paid its
first dividend increase since 1992.
Much of the credit for the turnround goes to Mr David Simon, the chief
executive, who took over from Mr Horton after the boardroom coup. He
describes the company as fully restored to health, but one with new
ambitions.
Since 1992, Mr Simon and his colleagues have kept a deliberately low profile
while they worked to rebuild profits, repay billions of dollars of debt,
sell off non-core businesses and refurbish the group's tarnished reputation.
In contrast to the expansiveness of the Horton era, he prefers to use words
such as discipline, teamwork - and even boring - to describe his style.
Two weeks ago, BP announced a top-level reshuffle in which Mr Simon will
become non-executive chairman, replacing Lord Ashburton who retires from the
board. The new chief executive will be Mr John Browne, head of the company's
exploration and production division who is credited with orchestrating a
marked improvement in the division's results.
The changeover marks a new phase in BP's recovery strategy in which the
group will set itself more demanding performance targets, including higher
earnings, more debt reduction and modest growth in capital spending. The
targets are indications of BP's renewed self-confidence - 'the gateway to
further disciplined growth', as Mr Simon describes it.
These financial targets will be achieved through increases in oil and gas
volumes, continued cost-cutting, and improvements in internal organisation
to break down barriers between the company's divisions.
The company is also committed to further changes in its corporate culture to
enhance its competitiveness. This is driven by BP's belief that it will get
little help from changes in the external business environment such as higher
crude oil prices or wider refining margins, at least in the near future.
The company assumes, for example, that oil prices are likely to remain in
the Dollars 16-Dollars 18 a barrel range, around current levels. To be on
the safe side, it uses a much lower figure, Dollars 14, when testing the
economics of new oil fields. 'We have to build in performance under all
market conditions,' says Mr Simon.
BP also acknowledges that any technological lead it might have in certain
areas, such as operating in the deep water west of the Shetland Islands or
developing new fuel specifications, is likely to be short-lived in an
industry where partnerships and the sharing of information is the rule. The
company's competitiveness rests on its ability to get greater efficiencies
from its operations.
'Anybody can copy a formulation or your technology,' says Mr Simon. 'But
your competitors cannot ape your process.'
One of biggest changes that both men want to see is closer co-operation
between the exploration, refining and marketing sides of the business. BPX,
the exploration unit, 'was in a world of its own five years ago,' says Mr
Simon. Its focus was on a 'series of massive projects consuming huge amounts
of capital,' with no direct linkage to market concerns. 'Now they are fully
integrated into BP.'
But the aim is to push the integration even further, especially in the
fast-developing international markets in Asia and Latin America that BP is
keen to enter.
Mr Simon says 'the old mind-set among the explorers was to find the oil and
build a pipeline'. But the new emphasis in selected countries will be on
whether BP can 'feed in other businesses behind the upstream operation'.
Mr Browne says such a strategy also fits in with changes in the way
developing countries view international oil companies. 'Governments don't
look to us just to drill holes but to help them grow their economies. Now we
ask ourselves whether BP can become a part of the countries in which it
operates.'
One of Mr Browne's main tasks will be to oversee the diversification of BP's
production base away from its current US/UK bias. BP's production is
overwhelmingly based on giant fields such as Prudhoe Bay in Alaska and
Forties in the UK's North Sea.
Its most publicised recent forays have been in politically risky areas such
as Azerbaijan, Colombia and Vietnam. Mr Browne, however, rejects the
argument that growing involvement in such countries will increase the risk
of supply disruptions: any shift away from politically stable countries will
be 'very slow', he stresses.
There is considerable scope for BP to 'strengthen and deepen' its
involvement in existing areas, he says. 'Ten years from now, two-thirds of
our production will still come from existing members of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development.'
BP is also keen to build up its production in the fast-growing natural gas
market, a business in which the company has lagged behind many competitors.
The company has experimented with gas trading in the US and become involved
in the emerging spot market for liquefied natural gas by shipping LNG from
Australia to Spain.
Mr Browne says the company is also thinking about entering the gas-fuelled
power generation business in developing countries, although any move would
be in co-operation with a partner experienced in the sector.
Existing partnerships include a long-standing exploration venture with
Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company. BP's fastest-growing exploration
partnership is with Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil group.
The selection of partners is a priority for Mr Browne, who says the company
spends as much time assessing future partners as it does selecting senior
executives. 'We keep an eye on the list of competitors to make sure the
balance is right,' he says.
Acquisitions of assets will continue under Mr Browne's leadership, but there
are unlikely to be big structural changes to the company. The divestment of
non-oil and gas assets is virtually completed, and he is content that the
portfolio of potential oil and gas fields contains a good mix of
opportunities.
As for investments in other oil companies, Mr Browne has ruled out the
possibility that BP will cement its preferred partnerships by taking equity
stakes. 'We're not interested in collecting investments,' he says. 'We would
rather do the business directly.'
Creating a harmonious relationship between Mr Simon and Mr Browne will be
vital in making a success of BP's growth strategy. The two men's experience
appears to be complementary: Mr Simon's strength is in marketing, while Mr
Browne made his reputation as first BP's treasurer and then the
widely-respected head of exploration and production.
Those familiar with the company say they also complement each other on a
more subtle level. Mr Browne has a reputation for experimentation, a
tendency that can create breakthroughs in such a technologically-driven
business. It can, however, create tensions among more traditional executives
in an organisation that is still in the midst of a bruising restructuring.
Analysts say Mr Simon represents that more traditional BP culture, which may
reassure those who have to be persuaded of the need for change. He is also
the one person at BP whom Mr Browne defers to.
While Mr Simon will be a part-time, non-executive chairman, he concedes he
is unlikely to give up a lifetime habit of 'thinking about BP seven days a
week'. That is likely to suit the other BP board members, who are reluctant
after the Horton years to put all the responsibility in the hands of one
man.
There should, in any case, be plenty of work for both men. BP may be
restored to health, but it will require continuing efforts for the company
to succeed in a business where the global competition is unremitting.

Regular users of Miami's Biltmore Hotel are happy to see the back of
Argentine president Carlos Menem; his block-booking of the hotel during the
Summit of the Americas monopolised the golf course.
Others are still smarting at the three-day event. The Conch Republic -
motto: We Have Seceded Where Others Failed - announced its departure from
the US on April 23, 1982, protesting against Drug Enforcement Administration
agents' cutting off an 18-mile stretch of road between Florida and Key West.
The republic then asked - without any luck - for Dollars 2bn of US foreign
aid. Its secretary-general, Peter Anderson, argued that if his government
had been represented at the summit, it would have called for humour to be
applied to ease world tensions.
He would also have pushed the republic's application to join the North
American Free Trade Agreement: 'We're in favour of free everything.'

Ho Chi Minh still lives - on the streets of Calcutta. Though probably not
for much longer.
West Bengal state, long a bastion of Indian communism, is trying to shed its
hard-line image in an effort to attract private capital. The authorities
have therefore invited companies based in an electronics park to have local
streets named after their founders.
Siemens - which helped instal the first telegraph connection between
Calcutta and London 126 years ago - was approached first.
One of the few cities left in the world that still celebrates the
anniversary of the Russian October revolution with posters of Marx and
Lenin, Calcutta is now to have a new street - Werner von Siemens.
Names of communist worthies adorning other streets are so far intact; Jyoti
Basu, the veteran chief minister, must tread carefully.

The cookies are not crumbling John Major's way these days.
As if the British prime minister hasn't enough troubles, he may this week
discover that one of the Conservative party's biggest supporters has had
enough.
The board of United Biscuits, donor of more than Pounds 1m in the past 25
years, meets on Wednesday to decide what to give in 1994. The expected
figure is - zero.
In the wings, sadly shaking his head, will be Lord Laing, UB's life
president, who stepped down from the board in 1990 after 18 years as
chairman.
Laing long championed the party's cause, being rewarded for his pains with
the job of joint Tory party treasurer between 1988-1993.
UB has in any case been scaling-back, reducing to Pounds 40,000 its 1993
donation from Pounds 130,000 in 1991 and 1992. Unless the company's
non-executives - including former Tory minister Lord Prior, as well as Lady
Howe, wife of Lord Howe - kick up a fuss, the zero figure will be nodded
through.

We falsely imagine German politicians rather dour dogs, particularly about
their own profession.
How pleasant therefore to see the main opposition leaders now betting each
other over how long Chancellor Helmut Kohl's centre-right coalition, with a
10-seat majority, will survive.
Joshka Fischer, leader of the Greens has bet Rudolf Scharping, head of the
Social Democrats, that there will be a grand coalition - an alliance between
Kohl's Christian Democrats and Scharping's lot - before next summer.
No way, said Scharping, accepting Fischer's wager for an unspecified number
of bottles of red wine. Sounds like Scharping wins either way.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Observer: Summers' bright day?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Not all Washington DC gossip focuses on the doings of the Clintons.
Sometimes it stoops to such things as the World Bank.
The town's movers and shakers reckon that Lewis Preston, 68, will soon step
down as the bank's head; he had heart surgery last year.
Jostling to replace Preston is Larry Summers, US treasury undersecretary for
international affairs and a youthful 40. Summers, a former Harvard economics
professor and chief economist at the World Bank, obviously has useful
experience, having advised governments in far-flung places such as Indonesia
and Mexico.
But has he the necessary diplomacy? His brusque manner sometimes upsets
people. Moreover, is his contacts' book fat enough? Summers is not Wall
Street's favoured candidate. The bankers apparently desire one of their own,
when the time comes for Preston to retire.
Australian-born James D Wolfensohn is thought to fit the bill. Wolfensohn is
a good tennis-player; a skilled fisherman; he fenced for Australia in the
1956 Olympics; and a serious amateur cellist.
More to the point, he has powerful allies in the financial world, numbering
in his circle both Sir David Scholey, SG Warburg's chairman, and Paul
Volcker, former US Federal Reserve chairman.
In 1987 Wolfensohn hired Volcker as chairman of his eponymous boutique
merchant bank. Wolfensohn even took out US citizenship in 1980. What more
could be asked?

FT  12 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Burden of fuel tax on Northern
Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr PAT MCGREGOR and Mrs PAT MCKEE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan (December 8) maintains that the imposition of the
standard rate of VAT on fuel would not have been detrimental for low-income
households since 'this would have been more than offset by the benefits
package'.
This assertion may be true for the average low-income household in the
United Kingdom but not for those in Northern Ireland. Average fuel
expenditure in the province according to the 1992 Family Expenditure Survey
was Pounds 15.24 a week compared with Pounds 13.02 for the UK as a whole.
If the 1992 survey is used (as this is the most recent one available at the
level of individual household) then the net change from the imposition of
VAT on fuel for households in the lowest quintile is a loss of about Pounds
1.20 per week. (The estimate assumes that the 1992 consumption pattern does
not alter in the face of the tax rise.)
Now, a loss of Pounds 1.20 may be considered of little consequence to the
average citizen, but when average gross incomes are Pounds 82 the concern is
understandably more acute. The MPs from Northern Ireland all voted against
extension of VAT in a refreshing display of solidarity.
In the light of the above I hope that Mr Samuel Brittan was not including
them among the 'unprincipled small parties'. The threat of losing the vote
prompted a proposal from the government to extend the compensation scheme -
we would assert that the countering of the threat was the only principle
that motivated the government.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Prosperity renews demand for gold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs HB JUNZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lex (December 6) concludes, on the basis of macro- and micro-economic
fundamentals: 'For the gold price, the worst of all possible worlds seems to
have materialised.'
Investors may wish to be made aware that the fundamentals of the reasoning
on which this conclusion is based leave something to be desired.
The supply/demand balance for gold, according to the latest update by Gold
Fields Mineral Services, portrays a different scenario to that depicted by
Lex. In the first half of 1994, mine production plus scrap recovery fell
short of fabrication demand, and this excludes any additional demand for
physical bar hoarding.
Furthermore, the market overhang created during the investment boom of 1993
has largely been worked off with the closing out of many forward
commitments. Market trends indicate a continued tight supply/demand balance.
The supply deficit has arisen in part because the macro-economic
fundamentals cited by Lex affect only a small part of the global market.
In the current long period of disinflation, gold clearly has not been
demanded as an inflation hedge. With 80 per cent of gold off-take going into
jewellery, both for adornment and store of value purposes, demand has been
driven by rising prosperity, especially in the far east, and by the more
recent cyclical upturn in the industrial countries. Accordingly, the macro-
and micro-economic fundamentals seem to be pointing in a very different
direction to that suggested by Lex.
With regard to the ability of investors to use sophisticated derivative
instruments as effective ways of offsetting dangers, one should perhaps take
heed of other articles in the Financial Times citing the woes of
Metallgesellschaft, Procter &amp; Gamble and Orange County.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Picking up the pieces: Orange County's bankruptcy will have
far-reaching repercussions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Viewed from the waterfront at Newport Beach, the notion of Orange County
being hard-up seems preposterous. The scene is simply too opulent: the big
houses among the palm trees, the yachts at their jetties. Pelicans flap over
the blue water and the Californian sun shines down relentlessly. Orange
County, surely, should be the last place in the world to go under.
This, of course, is just the point. When the county filed for bankruptcy six
days ago, it did so because it had borrowed Dollars 12bn (Pounds 8bn) to
play the financial markets and had lost upwards of Dollars 1.5bn in the
process.
Even in Wall Street terms, Dollars 12bn is a lot of money. The banks that
lent it did so because they thought Orange County could afford it.
The county's treasurer, Mr Robert Citron, who resigned 10 days ago, had
borrowed the money to buy investments that pay a higher return as interest
rates fall. The banks held these securities as collateral for their loans,
and when rises in interest rates forced Mr Citron to default, several of the
banks, led by CS First Boston, cancelled the agreements and sold the
securities, precipitating the crisis.
According to Mr John Moorlach, who stood unsuccessfully against Mr Citron in
the election for treasurer in the spring, it will be 'a miracle' if the
losses end up less than Dollars 2bn. They could, he says, be as high as
Dollars 3bn.
Whatever the name suggests, Orange County is in no sense quaint or rural. It
is part of the suburban sprawl of southern California, an up-market
extension of Los Angeles.
On the direct flight from New York to the county's John Wayne airport - a
large, imposing affair of glass and near-marble - every other passenger
seems to be an investment banker or lawyer, with laptop on knee and suit
hanging wrinkle-free in its leather case.
Not all of Orange County is as wealthy as Newport Beach, however. The
Vietnamese quarter in the town of Westminster is scarcely flashy; in the
county seat of Santa Ana, some of the Hispanic areas look almost
impoverished. Disneyland, in the town of Anaheim, is surrounded by streets
that in a less benign climate might seem positively dreary.
And indeed, all is not well with the Orange County economy. Like the rest of
southern California, it is unhealthily dependent on defence and real estate.
Its biggest employers are McDonnell Douglas, Rockwell and Hughes Aircraft,
all of which have been badly hit by cuts in defence spending. Even
Disneyland - another big employer - has been suffering poor attendances
lately.
Orange County house prices have fallen every year since 1991 and are still
falling. According to economists at the local Chapman University, real
estate values have dropped by Dollars 22.5bn since 1991. The county lost
29,000 jobs in 1991, then another 28,000 in 1992-94. At 6 per cent, the
local unemployment rate is a touch above the national average.
Given that the rest of southern California has been worse hit by the same
problems, the county could never expect help from outside. The average house
price in Orange County is still almost Dollars 250,000, the median family
income Dollars 54,000.
Internally, too, the county administration has been constrained in what it
could do to raise cash. Ever since 1978, California's Proposition 13 has
restricted the freedom of local authorities to put up taxes. When Mr Citron
sought a high return on Orange County's investments, he was not simply being
irresponsible. The county needed the money to balance its books.
The other way of raising cash was through the municipal bond market. The
county did so with a vengeance. The Los Angeles Times calculates that last
year alone, Orange County municipalities and various public agencies raised
Dollars 4.9bn in a total of 121 bond issues.
The county's calamitous losses on its investment portfolio are therefore
doubly damaging. The losses could severely limit the county's future access
to the municipal bond market, where buyers are typically, risk-averse small
investors. They are unlikely to see Orange County as a prudent investment
after the past week's torrent of publicity.
The reaction of Orange County's inhabitants to all this is still slightly
dazed. Judging by the letters and calls to the local newspaper, the Orange
County Register, the growing tide of anger is directed less against Mr
Citron, and more against the county's board of supervisors. Like Mr Citron,
these are elected officials. If they had done their job of supervision, they
ask, how could Mr Citron have invested some Dollars 8bn of borrowed money in
the course of the past year alone?
There is also growing resentment over the role of Wall Street and the big
broking houses that profited handsomely by financing Mr Citron's
speculations and then pulled the rug out from under the county.
The bankruptcy, desperate measure as it was, represented an attempt to stop
holders of Dollars 10bn of Orange County investments from selling them after
CS First Boston sold some Dollars 2bn of securities it held as collateral on
a loan to the county. Most of them went ahead anyway, despite the county's
insistence that they were breaking the law.
Owing to the unprecedented nature of Orange County's bankruptcy, the point
has yet to be tested in the courts. A prominent bankruptcy lawyer quoted in
the Los Angeles Times last week could scarcely conceal his relish.
'There are kids running around in Orange County in junior high (school)
today', he said, 'who will be joining this case once they get through law
school.'
The liquidation of these investments means that the county's losses,
previously on paper, are being realised. In Orange County, this seems like a
classic case of Wall Street taking it out on California.
In New York, however, there is a different perception. The scale of events
is such that even hardened investment bankers are shaken.
The dumping of billions of dollars of investments in the space of a few
hours is not to be taken lightly, especially if there is a lingering
suspicion that they belong to someone else.
More generally, there is the feeling that the Orange County affair is the
high-water mark of a certain type of speculation. Under the benign eye of
the US Federal Reserve, the early 1990s were a time when betting on falling
interest rates was money for old rope. The damage when rates rose, as they
did in the spring, was inevitable.
Most of the cases already publicised have attracted less sympathy than that
of Orange County. A company such as Procter &amp; Gamble is a commercial
organisation, and seen as able to take care of itself if it chooses to
become involved with highly complex derivatives.
As the embittered taxpayers of Orange County point out, however, the money
in their fund was not there to gamble with. It was to build roads and
schools and pay the wages of the county's workers.
Now that Orange County is left to pick up the pieces, it has made a
promising start in the choice last Thursday of Mr Thomas Hayes to take over
the financial reins. Mr Hayes, aged 48, was auditor-general for the state of
California for 10 years. Then, for two years, he did Mr Citron's job on a
bigger scale, as California's elected treasurer in charge of the state's
Dollars 20bn investment fund.
A cautious, conservative financial specialist, Mr Hayes did a decent and
cautious job, by all accounts, achieving a reasonable but not spectacular
return.
When he stood unsuccessfully for re-election in 1990, his caution was turned
against him. Look how meagre his results were, his opponent is reported to
have argued, compared with Orange County.
If the voters of California had known where Orange County might end up, the
result might have been rather different.
For now, however, Mr Hayes must do the best he can to protect the citizens
of Newport Beach and the rest of the county from the consequences of the
losses incurred by Mr Citron's investment strategy.

<TEXT>
Sir, If Nato is to survive ('In search of a unifying threat': December 7),
it must introduce convincing post-cold war security concepts and
perspectives.
Only clearly thought-out objectives such as Article Five of the Washington
Treaty should be included in its strategy. The alliance must stop paying lip
service to commitments it has no intention of fulfilling. Rivalry between
the west's security alliances (UN, CSCE, WEU and Nato) has resulted in the
farce of interblocking rather than interlocking security institutions. Nato
must also define its position on enlargement. If Nato fails to address these
challenges, the 'No action together organisation' may become a more
appropriate title.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Life after the revolution: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a strange sensation. I take a short break from writing this column and
return to find the Washington political landscape altered beyond
recognition.
I used to write almost apologetically about the late Ludwig von Mises, the
Austrian proponent of entrepreneurial capitalism. Hardly anyone, I assumed,
would have heard of him. Now I discover that Mises - who regarded Milton
Friedman as a wimp - is fast becoming a mainstream author. He is one of the
intellectual heroes of Dick Armey, the Texan libertarian who takes over as
majority leader in the House of Representatives next month.
To grasp what this means, remember that Armey replaces Dick Gephardt, a
'liberal' Democrat so far behind the times that he led the abortive
congressional campaign against the North American Free Trade Agreement. It
is a shift from a politician who distrusted markets to one who is passionate
about them.
Yet Armey's elevation is receiving relatively little attention because
Washington's political elite is transfixed by his boss, Speaker-elect Newt
Gingrich. It is impossible to conceive of a greater contrast than that
between Gingrich, a conservative firebrand who fizzes with ideas, and Tom
Foley, his decent but deadly dull, predecessor. The Senate is admittedly
undergoing less of an ideological upheaval, although the intellectual space
separating Bob Dole from former majority leader George Mitchell is not
inconsiderable. Dole in any case will be dragged to the right by Trent Lott
of Mississippi, his new deputy and an ideological soulmate of Gingrich and
Armey.
On balance, this unexpected shift of political power will be good for
America. It is not healthy in a democracy for one party to monopolise any of
the levers of power. After 40 years in the cold, House Republicans deserve a
chance to prove themselves. So far they are doing remarkably well. Gingrich
is managing a difficult transition more adroitly than have most former
presidents.
He is biting the bullet on procedural reform by rationalising the
labyrinthine House committee structure, cutting staff, liberalising debate
rules and curbing the powers of committee chairmen. Political analysts
sympathetic to the Democratic cause, such as Thomas Mann at the Brookings
Institution, ruefully concede that such valuable reforms would never have
occurred under Foley and Co. If nothing else, US democracy looks set to
function more efficiently.
Gingrich's policy goals are more controversial. In the media he is
frequently portrayed as a batty reactionary, hell-bent on recreating
Dickensian orphanages and other 19th century horrors. Having read his
manifesto, the 'Contract with America', I find most of the assessments
puzzlingly negative. Without agreeing with everything Gingrich says, he
strikes me as having a better sense of the direction the US needs to take
than either the Clinton White House or the Democratic Party at large. Unlike
most politicians he is not a prisoner of the policy assumptions of past
decades.
Contrary to the knee-jerk reaction of Keynesians, Republicans are not
foolish to favour a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal
budget. In a myopic political system beholden to special interest groups,
there is an overwhelming temptation to finance current spending by borrowing
from future generations. A constitutional prohibition may be the only
plausible long-run solution; unlike past expedients, it would be a roadblock
that Congress itself could not remove at will. Critics who complain that
Gingrich has not specified a route to fiscal balance miss the point: once
the destination is unavoidable, a way will be found.
Much else in the reviled contract makes sense. Is it backward-looking to
want to stimulate entrepreneurship by reducing capital gains tax rates
toward international norms? Is it daft to want to reform a chronically
inefficient legal system and hence reduce the economic burden imposed by
crushing litigation costs? Is it, indeed, so very foolish to argue that the
child of a 15-year-old crack addict might be better off in a well-run
institution? Gingrich's rhetoric is often astringent, but the themes that
preoccupy him - personal responsibility, economic opportunity and so forth -
do not strike me (or, apparently, the American voters) as anachronistic.
In any case, there are no dictators in US politics. Gingrich will have to
compromise if he is to get legislation through the more moderate Senate and
avoid the veto of an enfeebled president. The value of the contract is as a
spur to public debate. Washington is now abuzz with ideas. There is, for
example, a spirited debate under way about the advantages of replacing
income tax with a progressive tax on consumed income - what is known in the
UK as an 'expenditure tax'. No such idea would ever have emerged from the
Clinton White House, yet it has a powerful logic in a country with a
chronically low national savings rate.
And, thanks to the congressional Republicans, there is serious talk of
transferring responsibility for many social functions from Washington to the
states. This seems eminently sensible: if nobody really knows how to reform
welfare, why impose a single blueprint on the whole nation? Why not try
several different policies? Again, the Clinton administration ought to be
sympathetic: budget director Alice Rivlin proposed just such a devolution of
power to states in her 1992 book, Reviving the American Dream.
Gingrich's November revolution has turned Washington upside down. In every
sphere the unthinkable is becoming thinkable. The old politically-correct
reading lists are waste paper. Keynes is out; Mises is in. It is a great new
world.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Why Japan and the US are streets
ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From JOHN HARTLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While it is true that under the Prometheus programme ('The new road
sense': December 8) European companies have done a reasonable amount of
research into navigation and other intelligent guidance systems, there has
been a woeful lack of follow-through into manufacture.
By contrast, Rockwell of the United States already dominates the market for
the electronic engines for navigation systems used in boats and cars, and
since it developed the specialised chips itself, is likely to remain so. It
gained its knowledge as the architect of the satellite-based Global
Positioning System (GPS) for the US Department of Defence - paid for by the
US taxpayer, but turned into a big business. This is now the heart of all
car navigation systems.
Several US companies are already producing navigation systems for cars, and
as Toyota's chairman Shoichiro Toyoda pointed out, over half a million such
sets have already been produced and sold in Japan.
In addition, there is already a system in which information is sent to
subscribing drivers about traffic congestion in Tokyo. The information is
verbal, but the network of beacons for a more advanced system is already
planned.
By contrast, the Philips Carin system becomes an option on the BMW 7 Series
next spring. Clearly, Europe is years behind in this area.
Apart from the Dollars 200m US automated highway project mentioned, several
other projects are under way in the US, including one to determine the
protocols for all traffic information - this is sorely needed in Europe.
TRW and Amerigon are among the US companies that are ready to supply radar
units as the heart of collision avoidance or intelligent cruise control
systems. Amerigon claims its model will cost less than Dollars 10 a unit. US
companies are not just talking research, they are investigating the
practical and legal implications of such systems, and readying them for
production - and so are the Japanese.
When it comes to turning electronics projects into production and profits,
the Japanese and Americans are miles ahead of the Europeans.

Mondays tend to be disturbing on television - in a deliberate,
thought-provoking, thoroughly worthy way. Tonight's double dose of
perturbation starts with World in Action (8.30pm ITV). Those who are
sceptical about the art of 'psychological profiling' will be intrigued by
this encounter with Paul Britton, apparently nicknamed 'Cracker' by his
colleagues (after the Robbie Coltrane character, I hasten to add). His role
in the trial of Colin Stagg for the murder of Rachel Nickell sparked
controversy about the role of this American neo-science. The whole practice
comes over as a new and still untried toy open to abuses unless rigorously
controlled.
Control is desperately needed in the killing of wildlife in Nepal (among
other places). In the Wild (9pm ITV) engineers a meeting between Bob Hoskins
and the tiger. Regrettably perhaps, Hoskins' chances of survival are
considerably healthier than the quadruped's. The programme ranges through
the pressures on the big cats and reminds us that species have already
become extinct in the past quarter-century.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Arts: The women on top - A new generation of arts
administrators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jennifer Page is to be the new chief executive of the Millennium Commission.
She will have the pleasurable task of handing out over Pounds 1bn pounds of
National Lottery money during the next six years to ensure that the
millennium is well and truly celebrated. The current acting chief executive,
Heather Wilkinson, becomes her deputy.
Page is a good if rather surprising choice - good because in her previous
incarnation, as chief executive of English Heritage, she was that rarity,
someone able to work well with its chairman, the rumbustious Jocelyn
Stevens; surprising because the commissioners dropped their first (male)
chief executive because they considered he was too independently minded.
Jennifer Page is no walk over.
What is not surprising is that the commission should have turned to a woman
to help master-mind the politically sensitive task of selecting which
projects should qualify for millennium funding. Women are everywhere in the
British arts and heritage worlds. Page will have frequent dealings with the
director of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, Georgina Naylor. She will
also be in close contact with the secretary general of the Arts Council,
Mary Allen. If Mary Allen is engaged, her deputy will stand in - Sue Hoyle.
Mary Allen, who has spent the last few days deciding how to divide up the
1995-96 grant of Pounds 191.5m between the nation's arts companies, is the
most powerful woman, if not person, in the arts. 'The issue of gender does
not arise in the arts.' she maintains. 'Throughout my career the
organisations I have worked with have been indifferent whether I was a man
or a woman'. It does seem that, true to their liberal principles, the arts
are blind to sexual differences.
'The fact that so many women are coming through is just a reflection that
ten or 15 years ago women started to go into the arts as administrators.'
says Mary Allen. They now account for over 70 per cent of the arts
work-force and are in an excellent position to take advantage of the
unprecedented boom in the arts industry of the last decade.
No institution shows this impartiality more blatantly than the Arts Council.
The head of dance is Hilary Carty; of music, Kathryn McDowell; of touring,
Kate Devey; of the visual arts, Marjorie Allthorpe-Guyton; and of education,
Maggie Semple. These are major jobs: the holders, most of whom have been
appointed in the last year, are largely responsible for the health of their
arts forms throughout the country.
The power of women is not confined to London. Sue Harrison has just been
given the task of sorting out the problems at North West Arts. There is
another woman, Sue Robertson, running Southern Arts. And the Arts Council of
Scotland is topped by Seona Reid.
So far women have made their mark more as administrators rather than
artistic directors, but this is changing. The largest recent theatre
project, the West Yorkshire Playhouse, was entrusted to Jude Kelly and she
has been successful enough to be considered a potential successor in 1997 to
Richard Eyre at the Royal National Theatre.
The current number two at the National is Genista McIntosh, and she, in her
turn, is a possible choice for one of the biggest jobs in the arts, director
of the Barbican - following on, of course, from yet another woman, Detta
O'Cathain. Elsewhere in theatreland Ruth Mackenzie has built up a
considerable reputation at the Nottingham Playhouse; Barbara Matthews runs
the highly acclaimed Cheek by Jowl; Jenny Topper at Hampstead has produced a
succession of West End transfers while Thelma Holt is a producer with an
international reputation (as well as a seat on the Arts Council).
Among the museums and galleries only Elizabeth Esteve-Coll at the Victoria &amp;
Albert has risen to the very top, but among the more avant garde subsidised
art galleries, women are everywhere - Julia Peyton-Jones at the Serpentine;
Elizabeth-Anne McGregor at the Ikon in Birmingham; Catherine Lampert at
Whitechapel; Jenny Lomax at Camden. They are in a good position to take over
the big national institutions next time round.
There is one area where women have lagged behind - music. Of course Sian
Edwards is music director at the ENO, and Louise Honeyman (London Mozart
Players) and Louise Badger (BBC Symphony) run orchestras, but music
generally remains a masculine stronghold. Jennifer Edwards of the National
Campaign for the Arts believes 'the contract nature of the music scene puts
women off.' Those with children find the frenzied schedule of touring
difficult.
Of course the achievements of women in the arts are not without problems.
Some feel that they have to be tougher than the men to impress their
organisations and to stamp their will. Elizabeth Esteve-Coll struggled at
the V &amp; A before her vision of a more accessible museum won through; Detta
O'Cathain did wonders for the balance sheet at the Barbican but at the cost
of a disaffected work force. And in the arts, people are everything.
Despite the headline-hoggers, women are still used in the arts as cheap
labour: their desire for a job in the arts, any job, is exploited. A 1990
survey suggested that almost 60 per cent of women in arts administration
earned less than Pounds 12,000 a year. But perhaps these foot soldiers were
right in thinking that getting a step on the ladder at least offers some
chance of advancement. They have already contributed sufficient officers to
ensure that the arts world reflects society more truly than most other
industries: which is just as well, since one of the main duties of the arts
is to hold a mirror up to our lives.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Arts: Bubbling and fizzing around a bitter centre - The
Libertine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH HEMMING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the opening of Stephen Jeffreys' riotously funny new play, The Libertine,
the Earl of Rochester - the infamous Restoration degenerate of the title -
taunts the audience with a little prologue. 'You will not like me,' he
assures us. 'No, I say you will not.'
Rochester (David Westhead) then proceeds to charm us with an outrageously
frank advertisement of his sexual availability, but the combination of pride
and self-loathing of that opening speech returns to haunt you throughout the
play. With it, Rochester has set a challenge to the audience, and Jeffreys a
challenge for his play. Can we like this man? Can we ignore him? But, above
all, can we find out what made him tick? Why was this evidently charismatic,
brilliant wit so resolutely self-destructive? Did his determinedly bad
behaviour spring only from scorn of his age, or did it reveal a deeper
disillusionment with life itself?
Rochester is thought, of course, to be the inspiration behind Dorimant, the
heartless rake in Etherege's The Man of Mode, and Max Stafford-Clark's new
company Out of Joint is performing Etherege's Restoration comedy alongside
Jeffreys' new play. The double-bill offers a fascinating two-way mirror on
Rochester and his age, allows plenty of opportunity for playing theatrical
games (in The Libertine, Etherege is shown in a not altogether flattering
light) and also provokes deliberation about the validity of art.
At one point in The Libertine, Etherege taunts Rochester with the fact that
he has not written a great play. 'I have caught the scent and flavour of our
age and set it down for all time,' crows Etherege (a pinch-faced, bitchy
little fellow in Jason Watkin's fine performance). Rochester's defence is
that he is too busy living his life to chronicle it.
In a sense, Jeffreys has written Rochester's play for him. But while
Etherege may have caught the age in its hedonistic heyday, with Rochester at
the helm living to excess, Jeffreys presents another view: the morning
after. His portrait is altogether more sour. Here the king is beginning to
worry about money, while the writers of the age spend their time drinking,
bitching, whoring and brawling.
On this detritus Rochester floats, rubbishing everything with devastating
wit. And Jeffreys incorporates some of Rochester's bawdiest, most graphic
and scurrilous writings, suggesting that they were every bit as revealing
about the age as Etherege's play.
But while the shallowness of the waters in which Rochester swam were
provocation enough for his cynicism, and the physical damage of his
lifestyle was enough to darken his mind, neither fully explains his
destructiveness. In Jeffreys' play, it is Elizabeth Barry (a glowing
performance by Katrina Levin), the actress with whom Rochester fell
passionately in love, who puts her finger on his more profound despair. So
determined herself, she represents a positive life force that he has turned
his back on and can no longer reach.
Around this bitter centre, the play bubbles and fizzes like a glass of
champagne. Jeffreys writes with enormous exuberance, achieving an eminently
credible cod Restoration style, and the dialogue drips with wonderful
witticisms and bawdiness. Max Stafford-Clark's crystalline, effortless
production trips along, is full of enjoyable performances, and embraces the
excesses of Rochester's writings with great gusto (it will be a long time
before I forget the dance of the dildos). At the centre of it all reigns
David Westhead's excellent squat, hammer-headed Rochester - now boorish, now
charming, now petulant, he is always compelling, conveying the many sides of
this bundle of contradictions.
In the end, the play does not quite answer its challenge. Though we
understand him better by the end of Jeffreys' play, Rochester finally
remains an enigma. This is frustrating - but I suspect it is the point, for
to pin down Rochester completely would clearly be an insult to the hard work
he put in to staying out of reach.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Media Futures: Wanted - superhighway cops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The imminent arrival of traffic cops and tax inspectors on the information
superhighway has been forecast by one of the UK's leading technologists.
Looking ahead to some of the less obvious consequences of the emergence of
what he describes as 'infobusinesses', John Taylor, head of
Hewlett-Packard's European laboratories, says new laws could be needed to
regulate a technology which takes no heed of barriers of space and time.
What are infobusinesses? Operating in the 'information marketplace' they are
similar to today's physical businesses, but the customer travels
electronically around the marketplace and his or her purchases are delivered
electronically. Taylor gives as examples tele-healthcare, tele-learning and
tele-brokering and trading.
'We shall need,' he says, 'the ability to monitor and audit transactions in
the information marketplace, which inevitably means that we need the
electronic equivalent of the police to detect and prosecute crime, evasion
and fraud.'
He thinks, however, that the information marketplace will not truly arrive
until its transactions can be taxed like any other business area. 'This is
patently not the case today,' he says.
'There are probably hundreds of millions of dollars worth of intellectual
property criss-crossing national borders every year without paying any
customs duties or taxes.
'This is happening not just on the Internet, but on thousands of private and
commercial networks all over the world. We have not yet invented the
electronic customs inspector for electronic objects moving at the speed of
light over the invisible superhighways'
Intellectual property rights and privacy were issues which demanded further
attention. Once an intellectual property like a book or picture is connected
to an information network, it loses its financial value because it becomes
freely available to everybody on the network. 'No pop video company would
connect its current top 50 video albums on-line to the Internet at the
moment, because there is no way of ensuring a copy sold to someone and sent
to them on the net is not replicated a million times by the purchaser, and
sent electronically around the world.'
Taylor is fascinated by the idea of the ubiquitous distribution system of
small, inexpensive video cameras. Some might be used to promote peace of
mind - 'did I leave a saucepan on the gas?', while others might monitor
speeding drivers, automatically sending messages across the network to debit
their bank account on a scale equivalent to the magnitude of the offence.

FT  12 DEC 94 / People (Names in the News): Bruno on a roll at Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Egidio Giuseppe Bruno, managing director of Credito Italiano (Credit),
it must seem a long time since November 1993, writes Andrew Hill. That was
when he led a road show to London to promote the privatisation of the
Milan-based bank; it is even longer since the 1950s when he first joined
what was then a staid, state-controlled institution.
In the last year, IRI, the Italian state holding company, has successfully
sold its 67 per cent stake in Credit, Bruno has added the titles of deputy
chairman and chief executive and he now finds himself in the front line of a
battle for control of Credito Romagnolo (Rolo), the Bologna bank. The staid
state bank has become a hungry private company.
There is no doubting Bruno's knowledge of the peculiarities of the Italian
banking system. He is on the executive committee of the Italian banking
association and is a director of Mediobanca, the secretive and influential
Milan merchant bank.
But for more than a decade he has also been prominent in international
banking circles, one reason (apart from his fluent English and excellent
French) why he is always a key member of international road shows promoting
the Italian financial markets.
In the 1980s, Bruno managed Credit's London branch - established in 1911 as
the first London offshoot of an Italian bank - and was chairman of the
Association of European Banks and the Association of Foreign Banks operating
in the City. Returning to Milan eight years ago, he quickly accumulated
responsibility for the Americas and Asia, for international business, and
eventually for the management of the whole Credito Italiano network in Italy
and abroad. If anybody can convince Rolo's shareholders of the advantages
which a deal with Credit would provide at home and abroad, it is probably
Bruno.

FT  12 DEC 94 / People (Names in the News): On a wing and a profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European tour operators should be keeping an eye on Vassilis Plevris, writes
Kerin Hope. The chairman of Cretan Airlines, a charter operator based on his
native island of Crete, runs the only Greek carrier making a profit.
Plevris started out as a theology teacher on Crete after paying his way
through university by working as a bell-hop at one of the island's first big
hotels. Now he owns two luxury hotels near Heraklion, the capital.
Together with a group of Cretan hoteliers and travel agents, Plevris decided
two years ago that there was room for a local airline to carry package
tourists to Crete from Germany, their main market. So the moment Greece
permitted private airlines to start competing with Olympic, the state
carrier, Plevris and his friends leased two Airbuses from Adria, the
Slovenian airline, and started flying.
No matter that their German agent, the tour operator Mit Uns Reisen, went
bust this season, owing Cretan Airlines Dr800m (Pounds 2m); Cretan now
controls 5 per cent of the total package tourist market to the island and
forecasts modest profits this year of around Dr32m. There is room for
growth: next year, more than 3.6m tourists are expected to visit Crete, a 20
per cent rise on this year.
Cretan already offers scheduled flights to Athens at lower prices than
Olympic. Its 3,000 shareholders are encouraged to fly the flag - Cretans are
notoriously chauvinistic about their island. Cretan also lays on charter
flights to Paris for locals in winter - the time of year when islanders have
the time to spend the money they make out of tourism.
The ebullient Plevris is an archetypal Zorba the Greek character; board
meetings are likely to continue at the cafeneion to the accompaniment of
Cretan cheeses and generous measures of tsikouthia, the island firewater.
Plevris now wants to start island-hopping routes across the Aegean for
tourists based on Crete. Cretan is acquiring two new Dornier 30-seater
aircraft. Eventually, he wants Cretan to become a regional carrier for the
south east Mediterranean.
Now that Olympic is finally being restructured, plenty of experienced
airline executives are available. Plevris expects to reinforce Cretan's
technical and marketing arms with energetic managers keen to take early
retirement from the public sector.

FT  12 DEC 94 / People (Names in the News): Humer homes in on Roche
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, has once again shown its
opportunistic flair for snatching a top executive from a rival, writes Ian
Rodger.
This time it is Franz Humer, a becalmed number two at Glaxo, who will move
to Basle next year to head Roche's drugs division. Humer will replace the
retiring Armin Kessler, whom Roche grabbed from its Basle neighbour Sandoz
in 1982. Jurgen Drews, R&amp;D director, is also a Sandoz alumnus.
Humer, 48, an Austrian turned Swiss, is also a member of another group:
graduates of the Schering-Plough European executive apprenticeship programme
in Lucerne.
In the 1970s, Max von Dach, then head of Schering Europe, started the
practice of hiring a promising young graduate as his personal assistant.
Humer, a graduate of the University of Innsbruck and Insead, was the first
of several to go on to distinguished careers.
He was followed by Peter Simon, head of Roche pharmaceuticals until last
month, Jean-Pierre Garnier, chairman of SB Pharmaceuticals, Jean-Charles
Tschudin, former president of Syntex in Europe, and Hans-Jorg Kummer, the
boss of Schering-Plough Europe.
Humer has gone to ground since last week, but former colleagues and
acquaintances describe him as being demanding with a touch of arrogance. 'He
is good at getting what he wants. Roche's country managers will find him
more difficult than Peter Simon,' one said.
Max von Dach recalls that Humer was 'always ahead of the others', and seemed
confident he would adjust to life at the austere Roche. 'He is a very
flexible guy. At least he was when I knew him.'

FT  12 DEC 94 / Media Futures: Now TV mouths match words
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thanks to computer technology, Robert Redford and Meryl Streep may soon be
able to speak Japanese effortlessly. A new system, developed by a Chicago
computer specialist, should remove the main flaw with dubbing television
programmes into different languages - the lips move in often ludicrous and
inappropriate ways in relation to the words.
The flaw has prevented the broadcasting of thousands of hours of
high-quality programmes, because English-speaking TV audiences are hostile
to sub-titling, and do not much care for work that is too obviously dubbed.
The new system, developed by Mr Richard Blomstein and his small company,
Dynamic Refilming, bridges the gap between the words and lip movements.
The process, which has been patented in leading markets, will be marketed
and distributed worldwide by Primetime, a leading UK independent producer
and programme distributor.
Richard Price, the Primetime chairman, said yesterday the first commercial
use of the new dubbing technique would come within the next six months in
London. The mouth of the actor dubbing a programme is filmed as he or she
records the new sound track. The tape is then fed through a computer program
that lines up this film with the original actor's mouth movements.
'The original actor's mouth is moved electronically so that the lip
movements are in sync with the mouth movements of the dubbing actor,' says
Price.
Existing dubbing techniques are fine for long- and medium-range shots. On
Average, the close-ups which would be electronically reworked make up about
eight to 10 minutes of an hour-long drama. Using the new technique would
typically double the Pounds 20,000 dubbing costs of a 90-minute film.
'What I am hoping is that this will open up a vein of marvellous German,
French and other foreign-language programmes, so that we can put them into
(English-language) TV and cable channels,' says Price. The technique could
also be used to make dubbing more realistic in any language.
At the moment, Price is concentrating on TV, but the same principle could be
used for feature films, although high-definition tape would probably be
needed to get prints of sufficient quality.
'You are going to have the opportunity to move programmes between languages
more easily and open up this mine of material to meet the increasing
requirement for quality programmes,' says Price, who plans to start
marketing the technique in March.

FT  12 DEC 94 / People: Attacked by 'party of war' - Vladimir Gusinsky fears
Russia is swinging right
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most,' says Vladimir Gusinsky, 'is a test case - of whether or not there can
be civil society here, a development of democracy and of a business
culture.'
Founded in October 1991 by Gusinsky, its president, the Most group includes
a bank, investment and construction interests and, most controversially,
media interests: the Sevodnya daily newspaper, the Echo radio station and
NTV, a TV channel.
Most's backing has given Sevodnya, NTV and Echo a financial independence
which is unique in the Russian media, and they have capitalised on it to
become the Kremlin's most outspoken liberal critics. Over the past 10 days,
the state has struck back: Gusinsky's bodyguards were brutally and publicly
beaten by President Yeltsin's personal security forces and border guards
sought to detain Gusinsky when he left for a weekend in London.
Gusinsky fears that the government attacks on Most are part of a more
general swing to the right.
'Russia today is at the crossroads,' he says. 'We have a party of war and a
party of peace, and it is not clear who will win.' It is the party of war,
Gusinsky believes, which was behind the recent attacks on Most. The war
party won another victory yesterday, when Moscow unleashed its army against
the break-away Chechen republic.
His media interests have been fiercely opposed to fighting a war in Chechnya
and Gusinsky warned over the weekend that: 'You cannot win in Chechnya
without killing every man, woman and child. If we start a war there we might
end up killing democracy in Russia.'
It is a dramatic warning, from a businessman with the flair of the
theatrical director he trained to be. Where many of the new private business
people practice discretion, he appears to say what he thinks.
In a country where most Jews still play down their ethnicity, he mentions
his own Jewishness naturally. Where links between business and politics are
mostly subterranean, his closeness to Yuri Luzhkov, the Moscow mayor, is
treated as a public issue (his bank has a large part of the Moscow city
account) - though how far each benefits from the patronage of the other is
unknown and unsaid.
Ten days ago, Gusinsky learned that, in Russia, prominence still has a high
price. Early in the day, armed men in paramilitary gear, but with no
distinguishing badges, appeared at his dacha, in the elite Uspenskoye area
just outside of Moscow. At mid-morning they went to his office and asked his
guards questions. At around five o'clock, as tension grew, the unidentified
paramilitaries seized some of the Gusinsky's bodyguards and drivers, forcing
them to lie face down on the snow covered ground for two hours.  Ivan
Latvinenko, head of the Bank's security, was so badly injured he was sent to
hospital.
Gusinsky called Yevgeny Sevostyanov, head of the Federal
Counter-Intelligence Service for Moscow. Sevostyanov sent his officers and
learned that the unidentified paramilitaries were members of the
presidential guard. Their commander is General Alexander Korzhakov, a man
who, on President Boris Yeltsin's own admission, is one of his closest
confidantes. Within hours of this identification, Sevostyanov was fired - a
result, he has since said, of naming the 'guilty men'.
The presidential guard later said it was their duty to arrest 'unidentified
armed men' on President Yeltsin's normal route to work. Gusinsky says he has
been travelling that busy road, with an armed bodyguard, for over a year.
President Yeltsin has expressed regret about the incident. But Gusinsky's
fellow bankers have protested vigorously. Says a fellow banker, a friend and
admirer of Gusinsky's: 'Volodya (Vladimir) was taught who's boss.'
In his office on Friday, his usual bubbly jokiness gone, Gusinsky said: 'It
is on a knife edge, whether it gets worse and whether we are under even
greater threat.'
Most is already hyper-careful over security. It has some 3,000 men under
arms, many working as guards for the bank's branches, and in some cases big
clients. But Gusinsky has been advised to take even more care. Flying to
London, he eschewed his own aircraft in favour of British Airways, but
expressed fears that even a commercial flight might not be safe. At
Sheremtyevo in Moscow airport on Friday night, border guards initially
forbade him from leaving the country - a ban that was only lifted after his
colleagues contacted the president's office.
Gusinsky is deeply worried. He believes next year will be the most dangerous
facing Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union. 'People again fear to
speak out, to be identified, to cross the president. It goes back to our
past. The country has to make a choice, whether to live freely, or to lose
that freedom.'
He does not blame President Yeltsin for the attack on Most, but says the
course Russia will take 'all depends on the president. He has so much power
now, concentrated in his hands.'
The security guards affair was, he says, an attack on Most and its media
interests, although he insists 'we are interested in the mass media, because
we are interested in making money from it. We have no particular policy. We
are against communism and against fascism, that's about it.'
This is disingenuous. His paper, his radio station and his TV channel are
liberal - in the Russian context, very liberal. Their views cannot be choked
off by being deprived of funds.
Gusinsky has done nothing by halves. The party last month to celebrate Most
group's third anniversary took over the public rooms in Moscow's grandest
hotel, the Metropole. His headquarters are in the middle of political
Moscow, inside city hall. The director of his small private army is General
Bobkov, formerly the head of the KGB's fifth directorate, which dealt with,
among other things, dissidents. This appointment has earned Gusinsky much
criticism. Most's KGB connections were the subject of a fiercely critical
article in the Wall Street Journal. Gusinsky is taking legal action over the
story.
Gusinsky has close business connections with Moscow's mayor Luzhkov, a
powerful, domineering figure, and one increasingly spoken of as a
presidential contender. Gusinsky's describes him as 'a personal friend.'
Their links have inspired allegations of corruption, though none have ever
been proven.
Most observers believe the attack on Most was meant to cut Gusinsky down to
size and warn Luzhkov off standing in presidential elections, due in 18
months.
Above all, Gusinsky has learned again - as he must have already known - that
business is inseparable from politics. All he can do is hope he can save
himself from being a political victim. To be a political innocent is not a
choice.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Media Futures: Systems groups push for more cash from the EC
 -SIX says money should be switched from research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe has been pondering for almost a decade on the need to develop
community-wide computer networks to promote and encourage its local
information technology industry. It was the troubled hardware manufacturers,
Siemens Nixdorf, of Germany, Groupe Bull, of France, and Olivetti, of Italy,
which seemed the most likely beneficiaries of plans to build a
computer-based 'nervous system' to co-ordinate government activities in the
EC.
As multimedia and the information superhighway have grown in importance,
things have changed. Now it is the computing services companies which are
claiming the right to build Europe's information future.
The SIX (Services Informatics Expertise) Advisory Group represents Europe's
top computing services companies - Cap Sogeti Gemini and Sligos, of France,
Sema Group and Logica, of the UK, Finsiel, of Italy, and six more. They are
asking the commission to divert funds intended for pre-competitive research
into hardware and software development into support for projects such as a
system for the exchange of environmental information covering some 15,000
databases.
Pier Paolo Davoli, chairman of SIX and chief executive of Finsiel, argues
that a new model, involving close collaboration between governments,
companies and customers, is necessary to develop applications for the
superhighway. SIX believes that it is in a unique position to understand the
kind of systems - applications - which would be of value, because services
companies traditionally collaborate closely with their customers. They have
to understand their business needs in order to develop effective software
and systems. Computer hardware suppliers and telecoms operators have rarely
formed such close links.
The group argues that Europe's taxpayers have not had value for money from
the EC's 'Framework' research programmes. These traditionally provide 50 per
cent funding to encourage companies and educational establishments to
collaborate on pre-competitive research, basic research which can be used by
any of the partners to develop commercial products. The EC has already
agreed to spend Pounds 2.6bn over the next five years on basic research in
information technology, as part of the fourth Framework programme.
Davoli says there is no need for research to develop more computer hardware
or software. Technology already in existence is adequate to build systems
which will meet the needs of Europe's citizens and act as models for
tomorrow's information society.
He gives as an example the Europe-wide Social Security Network (SoSeNet).
This was developed by a consortium, including Cap Volmac, of the
Netherlands, Finsiel and Sema, with the aim of facilitating the free
movement of people, especially migrant workers, through improved exchange of
data between Europe's administrations. The network is now up and running,
although exchanging limited data at present.
Davoli says: 'It is time for industry, the European Commission and investors
to unite to realise an information society for Europe.' He adds that the
SIX's plans do not involve new money; he envisages pump-priming funds being
diverted from the existing Framework programme.
The SIX proposals are contained in a submission to Martin Bangemann, the
industry commissioner, who earlier this year issued a report setting the
scene for the development of multimedia and the information superhighway in
Europe.
The SIX is in broad agreement with the Bangemann report, which emphasised
that time was short and that nothing would happen automatically. It also
said that the private sector and market forces should be responsible for the
creation of the information society, adding that existing public funding
should be refocused to target the new requirements.
The SIX group makes four specific proposals:
Ways have to be found to bring together, at an early stage in a project,
groupings of users and suppliers to identify priorities, establish market
demand, define applications and test the feasibility of applications with
potential customers. SIX is floating the idea of a 'User Club' as one way
forward.
SIX argues that new partnerships will have to be established between
customers, suppliers and investors if large projects are to be realised. It
is, however, against the conventional consortia approach, led by Europe's
large companies, which lacks flexibility and entrepreneurial flair.
It says there must be a clear customer for each project, to drive it forward
and ensure it is commercially attractive. This touches on the argument at
the heart of the superhighway debate: what services will customers be
prepared to pay for? SIX says: 'Where market research suggests demand will
be there, but customers are not ready for the service, then the EC or a
supplier must act as a 'customer' throughout the project. It is vital for
Europe to take the opportunity soon.'
Funding is, SIX accepts, a difficult issue. It has to support and stimulate
the players without simply subsidising them. It says the present practice of
part-funding research and development projects will not create the momentum
needed for commercially-realistic pilots and trials which could be expected
to grow into full-scale superhighway applications: 'There needs to be more
EC funding at the start of projects, to establish momentum. After this, the
private sector will be better placed to invest,' SIX concludes.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Business Travel: Magic needed for Cinderella airports - UK
prospects outside London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES JENNINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When will Britain's regional airports lose their Cinderella status? Mr Brian
Mawhinney, UK transport secretary, has said they will be part of 'the
largest unilateral air transport liberalisation' programme Britain has seen
 -thrown open to any UK or US transatlantic carriers who want to use them.
Yet his announcement was greeted in areas such as Glasgow and Leeds with
only muted enthusiasm. 'Realistically,' says a spokesman for Glasgow
airport, 'I don't see a lot coming from Brian Mawhinney's changes.'
In order to expand and to offer the transatlantic or far eastern
destinations which would attract more passengers, the regional airports will
have to entice some cautious long-haul carriers to move to what, in aviation
terms, is the middle of nowhere.
The difficulty is that the carriers will not move until there is proven
demand outside London. And there will not be a proven demand until the
carriers offer the flights.
At present, many regional airports are able to offer only feeder flights
into London and limited services to the rest of Europe. Business travellers,
therefore, tend to see them as mere staging-posts, rather than useful in
their own right.
'Even when we've got the services,' says one airport operator despairingly,
'quite a lot of the time, the local business community doesn't know our
services exist.'
Changing travellers' perceptions could be tough. Leeds/Bradford airport,
which has just been granted permission to operate 24 hours a day from next
spring, has embarked on a Pounds 7m scheme to enlarge its facilities and
install all-weather landing equipment.
At present, only about 800,000 passengers a year pass through
Leeds/Bradford, taking scheduled flights to some 12 destinations - more than
half of them within the UK. A large proportion of its flights go to London
Heathrow or Gatwick. The number of passengers compares with 5.4m who use
Glasgow annually and 50m a year who pass through Heathrow.
A Leeds/Bradford airport spokesman admitted: 'Businessmen would still rather
put up with having to fly to a bigger airport and change, so as to have the
greater frequency of flights.'
Even at Glasgow, US airlines United Airlines and NorthWest recently
discontinued transatlantic services, because demand no longer justified the
expense of keeping them going.
However, prospects are not all gloomy for regional airports. American
Airlines, for example, plans a service to Chicago from Birmingham
international airport from next summer.
Birmingham has a lively expansion programme, called Vision 2005. It includes
new terminal capacity and a longer runway, and is intended to raise
passenger levels from 4.5m to 10.5m by 2000.
In this, Birmingham is fighting not only the London airports, but also a
regional rival: Manchester.
Indeed, Manchester is Britain's star regional airport, handling 13m
passengers annually, which puts it third in the league table of UK passenger
volumes after Heathrow and Gatwick. Also - crucially - it boasts daily
flights to New York (British Airways) and Chicago (American).
'We're lobbying hard for more transatlantic routes, with a possibility of
services to Miami and Detroit,' says a spokesman. 'We've also had
indications from far eastern airlines of interest in long-haul flights, but
we're waiting for Brian Mawhinney to announce the same open-skies policy for
the far east as he did for the US.' (Manchester already offers a regular
service to Hong Kong.)
Manchester also plans to build a second runway, giving it the same potential
capacity as Heathrow and raising passenger numbers to 30m in the next 10
years.
The tide may even be turning in Manchester's favour, as Heathrow finds
itself at the limits of its capacity, with no third runway in sight.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Architecture: In the spirit of Brunel - Colin Amery gives
his opinion on Britain's Building of the Year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An amusing architectural conversation took place on the BBC Today programme
the other day. On the one hand was Nicholas Grimshaw, architect of the
Eurostar Terminal at London's Waterloo Station, on the other was Giles
Worsley, editor of the architectural magazine Perspectives.
They were there to discuss the award of 'Building of the Year' to the new
Waterloo Terminal, in the hope that 'high-tech' and 'traditionalist' would
conduct a fierce battle of the styles. It was not to be - perfect harmony
reigned. Waterloo Terminal, as we had all noticed, was as traditional as St.
Pancras Station. The blood of Isambard Kingdom Brunel flowed in the veins of
Nicholas Grimshaw, and all the fuss about the naive ugliness of the
'high-tech' style, or the absence of any referential language in modern
architecture, was forgotten.
Does this mean that the polarised arguments about contemporary architecture
are over? Will modernists and traditionalists lie down together like lambs?
I do not think it is as simple as that.
The fact that the new Waterloo Terminal has won a place in hearts of the
different factions is a recognition of certain common denominators of
quality. It is also a recognition of the fact that Grimshaw's big curved
shed at Waterloo is based firmly upon designs from the past. It does not
break any structural records; it succeeds because it is a pragmatic solution
to a series of functional problems. Whether it is great architecture is
probably more debatable.
The most difficult problem for the architect at Waterloo was to design a
roof to cover five railway tracks with no space for any platform on the
outermost edge of the station. This means that on one side the track is
right up against the side of the shed. To deal with this the roof is made up
of two beams that apparently lean on one another as they span the platforms.
As the platforms curve and the roof also gets narrower as it comes to the
end of the longest platforms, the whole thing takes on the character of a
sinuous blue worm that almost appears to move and wriggle to accommodate
itself to the awkward site.
Much of the credit for this building should go to the engineer Anthony Hunt,
who worked so closely with the architect. Between them they managed to turn
what might have been seen as the insuperable disadvantages of the difficult
site into clear benefits for the design. What I particularly admire are the
vigorous joints. Where the great beams hit the ground or each other they are
linked by giant three-pin metal fixings.
The whole roof can turn at these hinges as the metal expands, or if a
hurricane blows. There is also movement in the platforms. As a train arrives
the platform moves because it is resting on a series of steel plates,
allowing it, and the roof, to roll imperceptibly. Such ingenious engineering
deserves to win prizes. But the title 'Building of the Year' was awarded
also because the terminal building is popular with travellers. Whether it
will work so well when there are more frequent trains and more crowds with
more luggage will take time to prove.
What has been successful at Waterloo is the simple fact that the place still
feels like a railway station. The wish to make travelling by train as much
like flying as possible has been almost totally resisted. Certainly there is
a real sense of arrival at Waterloo, which is in marked contrast to the very
low-key atmosphere at the Gare du Nord.
What was the competition for this 'Building of the Year' award? There was
another railway station - Manchester Airport Station by Austin Smith: Lord
and Partners. There was the brilliant conversion of the Gas Hall in
Birmingham into an exhibition space by Stanton Williams; the Tate Gallery at
St. Ives by Evans and Shalev and the opera house at Glyndebourne by Michael
Hopkins and Partners. There was also a surprising number of new churches and
libraries - and a marked absence of new commercial offices.
The growth of fundholding general medical practitioners has also caused a
considerable increase in the number of new, and frequently well-designed
medical practice buildings. One of the best was the Oswald Medical Practice
in Chorlton cum Hardy in Manchester. This is a clever mixture of old and
new. The basis of the practice is a Victorian house which has been partly
restored but has also been added to, with very striking modern additions
that contrast rather than adapt to the context. The architects are Hodder
Associates.
Perhaps the clue to the new catholicity in architecture and the almost
worrying agreement between all parties to the stylistic debate is in the
willingness to adapt the new to the old. Recently, talking to one of the
very best architects in the world who is based in London we shared our
disappointment that so many of the schemes applying for help from the
Lottery or the Millennium Fund are not brave new buildings but adaptations
of old ones. But perhaps that is not such a bad thing - the Waterloo
Terminal demonstrates how much the new can learn from the old, and how the
result can still be both original and popular.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Business Travel: New York bans smoking
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
New York City took a big step last week towards enacting one of the US's
toughest smoking bans.
The city council's health committee voted to approve the ban and the entire
council is expected to approve it on December 21.
Under the ban, smoking would be limited to the bar area in restaurants
seating more than 35 people, and nearly eliminated in office buildings. It
would also prohibit smoking at open-air sports arenas and zoos. Outdoor
cafes must provide no-smoking areas.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Business Travel: Shanghai ring road
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shanghai was celebrating last week. Flags flew and multi-coloured bunting
hung from tall buildings.
The cause of the joy was the opening of the city's elevated ring-road in
China's largest city.
Traffic jams are probably the biggest headache in Shanghai, which is why the
Liberation Daily devoted its front page to the story under the banner
headlines 'A Glorious Historical Monument Appears'.
The four-lane road loops over the Huangpu river that divides Shanghai's old
Puxi district from the fast-emerging Pudong development zone. It connects
with two suspension bridges.

More than two in five British travellers are still worried about visiting
Florida, despite its new anti-crime measures, according to a survey last
week.
However, the 'Florida fear' figure of 41 per cent was down from 50 per cent
a year ago, according to the survey from travel insurance company Home &amp;
Overseas.
There have been a number of attacks on tourists in Florida, including the
killing of a British holidaymaker.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways is to tighten up ticketing procedures after a reservations
clerk allegedly worked a scam which gave him Pounds 160,000 worth of free
trips.
The clerk allegedly made fake reservations on BA's Concorde booking computer
which enabled him and a friend to qualify for the airline's frequent- flyer,
free-travel incentive scheme, Air Miles.
The tickets were not paid for or collected and were in a false name. After
the flights took off, the clerk allegedly changed details on the
reservations computer so it showed the pair had been aboard.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Business Travel: In time for Eurostar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A reader has telephoned the FT, furious about the treatment he received from
Eurostar, the new cross-Channel train service, writes Michael Skapinker.
The reader had booked his journey from London to Paris through a travel
agent, paid his fare, received his ticket and arrived to board his train at
Waterloo Station.
He was stopped at the gate by Eurostar staff who told him he could not board
because he was too
late. He protested that the train had not yet left, but Eurostar staff
insisted he did not have enough time to board it. He was supposed to arrive
at least 20 minutes before departure.
The aggrieved reader says he was not told about the 20-minute rule.
However, Eurostar insists that its staff were acting according to proper
procedures. Eurostar passengers must arrive at least 20 minutes before
departure so that they can go through security.
A notice on the ticket wallets makes the 20-minute rule clear.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Business Travel: Get on your bike - Smart Guide / Amsterdam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is the best area in which to stay?
Definitely stay in the city centre. Amsterdam is compact, so even if your
meeting is at one of the new office complexes on the outskirts, you'll be
able to get there in 20 minutes or less by taxi.
The ritziest hotel is the five-star Amstel, which attracts royalty, pop
stars and the seriously wealthy. A single room costs Fl 650 (Pounds 241) a
night, a double Fl 750. For those who want to be even closer to the main
canals, popular choices for business folk are the Pulitzer, with
single/double prices of Fl 395 and Fl 455, and the SAS Royal Hotel, at Fl
400/Fl 470. A smaller and more intimate hotel, one popular with repeat
visitors and those on longer stays, is the Ambassade on the Herengracht
canal, room prices Fl 225/Fl 275, suites Fl 365/Fl 390.
Restaurants?
Dinner is no problem. A stroll around any of the main hotels will yield a
variety of restaurants. Lunch, however, is more of a struggle. There is no
lunch culture to speak of, so even some of the best restaurants can be
deserted and lifeless in the afternoon.
One exception is Cafe Roux in The Grand, a luxurious hotel in what used to
be the city hall. Brasserie Luden, on the Spui, a lively area of bars and
restaurants, also attracts lunch-goers.
Across the street is Kantjil, an Indonesian restaurant with an informal,
modern interior but a traditional range of specialities, including
rijstafel. If the weather is good (a not-too-frequent occurrence), try lunch
in the garden of the Het Tuynhuys restaurant, in the street behind the
flower market.
The advantage of this Dutch aversion to lunching is that you won't need a
reservation to get a table. Be warned that a lunch-time meeting at someone's
office can mean a couple of cheese rolls, a glass of milk and an apple or
banana.
How about entertainment?
Dutch bars open early, close late and come in many varieties. An Amsterdam
institution is the bruin cafe, or brown pub, a result of wooden furnishings
and years of cigarette-smoke. Try the Molenpad on the Prinsengracht canal if
you want to combine 'brown' ambiance with good, informal food. The Spui is
home to a number of packed bars and cafes, including Luxembourg and Hoppe.
There is also a casino, located near the Leidseplein. Entry costs Fl 5.
Identification is required (driver's licence or passport), and sports shoes
are not allowed.
Most nights there is something on at Amsterdam's famed Concertgebouw. Ticket
prices are quite cheap, compared with London, Paris or New York, because of
generous state support for the arts.
Quirks of local business?
The Dutch are punctual, straight-talking and relatively informal at the
office. It is normal to be introduced to an executive's secretary or
assistant before a meeting. Everyone, from the chairman to the chairman's
secretary, will shake hands. When in doubt, proffer your hand in greeting.
The Dutch are also family-orientated and protective of their free time.
Breakfast or late-evening meetings are generally not appreciated.
Suppose I have a spare day?
The cities of Leiden, The Hague and Rotterdam are an hour or less away by
train - all three are on the same rail line.
The countryside is best explored by bicycle. Bikes can be hired by the hour
or day at most train stations. The town of Castricum is a good starting
point for exploring the dunes and sea defences of the North Sea coast.
The compactness of the Netherlands is a boon to those in transit between
flights at Schiphol airport. Holland Tours Schiphol (tel: Amsterdam
653-4745) has recently started tours lasting a couple of hours or even
several days for transit passengers. They use six-seater luxury vans. A
popular destination in April and May is expected to be the tulip fields and
flower show at Keukenhof, about 20 minutes south of Schiphol.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is time to start thinking about that crucial soundtrack to the Christmas
dinner; and thanks to the extraordinary commercial success of religious
music over the last 12 months, record companies have provided us with a
bewildering choice.
For those who helped put Gregorian chants at the top of the classical charts
for much of the year, Eternal Peace: Gregorian Chant for Christmas (Deutsche
Grammophon) provides a timely seasonal top-up of spiritual sustenance. The
choir of the monks of Montserrat Abbey sing the 12 Responsories of Matins at
Christmas, while the First Mass for Christmas is performed by the
Benedictine Abbey at Munsterschwarzach.
Christmas with the Academy (Decca) is more of a mixed bag: Sir Neville
Marriner conducts the Academy of St Martin in the Fields in a performance of
popular classics such as 'Ding Dong] Merrily on High' and 'Hark the Herald
Angels Sing'. More adventurous is Carols from the Old and New Worlds
(Harmonia Mundi), in which Paul Hillier and the Theatre of Voices superbly
rattle through a host of unfamiliar arrangements of much-loved tunes.
On the splendidly-priced Naxos label, Jeremy Summerly directs the Oxford
Camerata in Medieval Carols, a collection which includes 'Ave Maria',
'Gaudete Christus est Natus' and Hildegard of Bingen's haunting monophonic
'O Viridissima Virga'. The historical archive label Nimbus joins in the fun
with The Spirit of Christmas Past; highlights include Caruso singing
'Cantique de Noel' and the awesome Ernestine Schumann-Heink's 'Stille
Nacht'.
For those who find it inconceivable to think of a Christmas without the
likes of Slade (above) and Gary Glitter, The Best Christmas ..Ever (Virgin)
runs through 42 pop classics (including the pleasant surprise of Miles
Davis's 'Blue Christmas'). Older generations in search of easy listening for
a difficult day will prefer, on the same label, Yule Cool featuring Perry
Como, Dean Martin and Nat King Cole.

Chelsea and Arsenal, the last two English clubs left in European

Cup draw on Wednesday. Good news for Chelsea last week when striker Mark
Stein scored in a reserve game against Watford. Stein has been out of action
since this year's FA Cup Final. Being English, his return will help Glenn

FT  12 DEC 94 / This Week: Film/Video
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The week's glossiest offering is the live-action/animation movie The
Pagemaster. Macaulay 'Home Alone' Culkin is a boy caught up in a magical
world while wandering a library. A hint of sorcery; a whiff of dragons; and
our hero is hurled into the twilight zone between reality and fantasy.
Most of us feel we are already there by this time of year. Buffeted by
conflicting bids for our Yuletide attention, we scarcely know which is the
way to cosy naturalism and which to state-of-the-art make-believe.
The Pagemaster, promising on paper but flimsy on film, prompts another
question. Why is Britain getting all the feebler seasonal fare from
Hollywood, while the good films - writing from Tinseltown, I can identify
them as I speak - stay in the States keeping our ex-colony happy? The smash
hits here at present are Disney's cheerful Father-Christmas-is-amongst-us
whimsy The Santa Clause, everything that Miracle On 34th Street isn't; the
bright, if mildly barmy, sci-fi romp Stargate; and Star Trek Generations,
which may be old hat but at least wears its headgear with a flourish.
Britain has Junior, fast slipping down the world charts; it has Lord
Attenborough in whiskers (in Miracle on 34th Street), prompting the thought
that we get enough of that at home; and it has the glorious but one-year-old
The Nightmare Before Christmas. The week's new UK openings add to
Scrooge-like feelings. They include the grimly self-explanatory Never Ending
Story III and the wholly dispensable Dennis Hopper film Chasers.
With the video year entering bleak midwinter, where to turn for comfort?
Those seeking the perfect cassette present - and having command of unlimited
funds - could shun the choice of re-issued movies and go for something
completely different. Why not buy the entire set of Monty Python TV shows,
repackaged this year for the team's 28th anniversary? Re-viewing highlights
recently, I found myself still dissolving into helplessness at dead parrots,
AC/DC lumberjacks, ill-equipped cheese shops and all those other things that
make life with Python - and should make Christmas with Python - worthwhile.

FT  12 DEC 94 / FT Guide to UK telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The telephone business used to be dull and predictable; suddenly it's
exciting and confusing. What has happened?
Two things; first, the privatisation of British Telecommunications and the
subsequent liberalisation of the telephone business back in 1984. The
government created first a duopoly - BT plus Mercury Communications - to
bring an element of competition into what had been a monopoly. In 1991,
after a duopoly review, it decided to open the market further, allowing
other companies to bid for operator's licences. Some 57 new licences have
since been granted. At about the same time, changes in the rules allowed
cable television companies to offer telephone services.
Second, an explosion of technological advances, including digital - computer
language - transmission, which is making possible affordable services, such
as call waiting, call diversion and call barring, not to mention video
telephony and multimedia.
So if cable companies can offer telephone services, BT can transmit
television programs, I suppose?
Not quite. The concession to the cable companies was necessary to encourage
them to make the big investment in the infrastructure required. Allowing BT
to transmit TV programmes would destroy that advantage. So BT is forbidden
to broadcast entertainment until at least 2001. But it is allowed to
transmit on-demand services, hence its experiment in the south east of
England with video-on-demand, home shopping and home banking.
Mercury seems to be in trouble; how did it get it so wrong?During the
duopoly period, Mercury concentrated on skimming the cream from business
traffic on long-distance and international routes, helped by BT's ponderous
inflexibility at that time. But BT was handicapped by a formula which
required it to hold its prices to a number of percentage points below the
rate of inflation (currently the retail price index minus 7 1/2 per cent).
The price cap encouraged efficiency at BT, which now offers prices little
different from Mercury's. Mercury neglected to exploit other, potentially
lucrative market niches. Small fleet-of-foot competitors have emerged to
occupy niche markets Mercury could have cultivated. Now, squeezed on all
sides, it is forced to cut staff and services.
Who are these new companies in the telecoms business?
Cable companies such as Cable London, which covers the area around Camden
and Hackney in London, or Northwest Cable, covering Wigan and Barnsley, are
one category. Their network provides the connection to the home or office
and they use a carrier, typically Mercury, to provide long-distance
services.
Then there are utilities looking for a way into the telecoms market;
Energis, for example, set up by the National Grid Company, provides
long-distance services over fibre-optic cables wound round its power lines.
WorldCom is representative of a third category. A US company, it set up in
London in 1991 and resells international lines to big business at a
discount.
What about BT's position in the market?
BT remains the dominant player with over 80 per cent of the UK market. It
alone has a mature network covering the entire country with connections into
most homes. It complains bitterly about the regulatory restraints on its
behaviour and pricing freedom. Oftel, the telecoms regulator, has little
sympathy with this view.
Is telecoms becoming an international business?
Inevitably yes, driven by the communications needs of large international
companies. There is a race to become the leading 'global supercarrier',
managing telecoms around the globe for these companies. The leader is
probably Concert, operated by BT and MCI of the US, but AT&amp;T's Worldsource,
and Atlas, operated by US Sprint, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom is not
far behind.
What does last week's Oftel document mean?
The regulatory regime, designed to promote competitiveness in the UK market
in an orderly fashion, has not been fully overhauled for a decade. The Oftel
document is meant to open up a discussion which could lead to a more open,
competitive market, where BT would have more freedom to set prices but all
the players would have to obey new, tough competition rules.
And the future?
Prices have fallen substantially over the past decade and are likely to
continue downwards, driven by competition and technology. There is a much
interest in Ionica, a Cambridge company promising even cheaper voice
telephony through radio links into the home.
But customers might not find their telecoms bills decreasing as much as they
might anticipate; every operator is looking for new and attractive services
to encourage more telephone calls.

FT  12 DEC 94 / This Week: Cape Town's bid on the table - Sport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Surveyors carrying out the soil-engineering checks for the planned Olympic
stadium were left in no doubt as to the main priority. Whichever site was
chosen, Table Mountain had to be full-frame from the TV position on the roof
of main stand.
Cape Town is not about to hide its unmistakeable landmark come 2004. No
visitor to the city is left in any doubt that securing the Olympics is a
hugely important goal for every group in this self-proclaimed Rainbow
Community.
Street banners, advertising, and conversations all proclaim a burning urge
to combine the South African love of sport with the ultimate symbol of
rehabilitation and reconciliation into the international community.
From the other side of the deal, the proposal looks more complex. South
Africa's bid to host the games a decade from now represents one of the most
fundamental decisions the Olympic movement has been faced with. In some
respects, President Samaranch and his International Olympic Committee team
in Lausanne are increasingly coming to resemble a prosperous multinational
corporation - IBM, for example, in its glory days - with a turnover measured
in billions of dollars.
Yet here they are, marketing men and spin-doctors, being asked to risk
sport's top 'brand' and all its global success on a country with minimal
infrastructure, shakily emerging from two decades of internecine warfare.
As if to throw the risks into sharper relief, Cape Town's current principal
rival for the nomination is Paris; prosperous, glamorous and safe.
Those South Africans who saw presidents Mandela and Samaranch together
during the latter's recent private visit to Cape Town are gleeful. They say
the septuagenarian chemistry is excellent, the rapport impressive. And it is
increasingly clear that the IOC president wants to use the unrivalled
political and commercial power of the Olympics in an interventionist way
during his last few years of office, before standing down in 1997.
One can point to two landmark games in the post-war era, and discern a
political and economic impact out of all proportion to a fortnight's track
and field. Tokyo in 1960 had an enormous effect in bringing post-war Japan
back into the international community. Seoul in 1988 was an essential
ingredient in Korea's progress from dictatorship sweatshop to democratic
tiger-economy.
'After the euphoria of the elections there's now a realisation that there
isn't going to be a Marshall Plan for South Africa,' says Kevin Kevany, a
leading strategist in the Cape Town bid committee. 'The money that's come in
is just a show of support, and it's largely over.
'We're spreading the gospel that the Olympics is our own Marshall Plan. It's
an unparallelled two-week spotlight that will motivate the rest of the world
to come and spend time here.' There are two connected themes here. One is
that tourism is the Republic's fastest-growing industry. Cape Province alone
has had 30 per cent more visitors in 1994 than last year. Every Europe-bound
jumbo into or out of Malan airport is packed to the doors. The second is
that in global terms eco-tourism is the growth sector.
The affluent world has grown tired of beaches. Travel with a purpose,
whether it is saving whales or visiting game parks, is the target. With its
spiritual feel-good factor and abundant natural beauty, South Africa cannot
lose in this respect. The games would be the icing on a perfect cake.
Even the bid team evokes a certain hopeful warmth. Co-chairmen Raymond
Ackerman and Ngconde Balfour are definitely the odd couple. Ackerman is the
archetypical entrepreneur capitalist, founder of a hugely successful
supermarket chain. Balfour is a black political activist who was repeatedly
detained during the apartheid years. Part of that era he spent exiled in
Australia, working on Melbourne's unsuccessful bid for the 1996 games.
'It hurt me that I was not doing it for South Africa, but I knew the
experience I was gaining would come in useful one day,' comments Balfour.
As a member of the ANC, one of his prime tasks is to convince the black
population that the Olympics is not be some grandiose white benefit. 'We
have to make it clear to people, time and again, that the Olympics will not
take money from areas that are worthy of development funding,' he adds.
With a symbolism that has been lost on neither Samaranch nor any other
visitor to Cape Town, the bulldozed rubble from the houses of District Six,
razed under the old group areas law, will form the foundations of the new
Wingfield Olympic stadium.
District Six will be redeveloped as one of the games sub-sites. Economic
models from previous Olympics, particularly Barcelona, point to a tenfold
overall return on a total investment that could reach R6bn (Pounds 1.8bn).
Sure it is a vast sum, says Kevany, but what other project imaginable could
generate those returns for the community? As Beijing's possible repeat
candidature for the games sinks into a drug scandal, the Cape Town group see
the dream coming closer.
'People are starting to see it as our shot to become a second-world country
rather than half first world and half third,' says Kevany. 'With the
Olympics we could do it in a decade, rather than tottering along for 50
years before we finally get there.'

FT  12 DEC 94 / Management: Pioneers and Prophets - Thomas Watson Sr
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART CRAINER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few business people create companies in their own image which then thrive
after their departure. Most plummet after the final farewell from the great
leader, unable or unwilling to carry on as before. Thomas Watson Senior
(1874-1956), the man behind IBM, is one of the rare exceptions. Under
Watson, IBM became the stuff of corporate and stock market legend.
Watson created a corporate culture which lasted. IBM - Big Blue - became the
archetypal modern corporation and its managers the ultimate stereotype with
their regulation sombre suits, zeal for selling and company song. Beneath
this, however, lay a belief in competing vigorously and providing quality
service. Later, competitors complained that IBM's sheer size won it orders.
This was only partly true. Its size masked a deeper commit-ment to managing
customer accounts, providing service and building relationships. These
elements were established by the demanding perfectionist, Watson.
'He emphasised people and service - obsessively,' noted Tom Peters in
Liberation Management. 'IBM was a service star in an era of malperforming
machines.'
IBM's origins lay in the Computing-Tabulating Recording Company which Watson
joined in 1914. Under Watson the company's revenues doubled from Dollars
4.2m (Pounds 2.6m) to Dollars 8.3m by 1917. Initially making everything from
butcher's scales to meat slicers, its activities gradually concentrated on
tabulating machines which processed information mechanically on punched
cards. Watson boldly renamed the company International Business Machines.
This was, at the time, overstating the company's credentials, though IBM
Japan was established before the second world war.
IBM's development was helped by the 1937 Wages-Hours Act which required US
companies to record hours worked and wages paid. The existing machines could
not cope and Watson instigated work on a solution. In 1944 the Mark 1 was
launched, followed by the Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator in 1947.
By then IBM's revenues were Dollars 119m and it was set to make the great
leap forward to become the world's largest computer company.
While Watson Sr created IBM's culture, his son, Thomas Watson Junior
(1914-1994) moved it from being an outstanding performer to world dominance.
Yet, the strength of the original culture remained intact. Indeed, Watson Jr
fleshed it out, creating a framework of theories round the intuitive and
hard-nosed business acumen of his father.
'The secret I learned early on from my father was to run scared and never
think I had made it,' he said. And, sure enough, when IBM thought it had
made it the ground slipped beneath its previously sure feet.
In A Business and Its Beliefs, an extended IBM mission statement, Watson Jr
tellingly observes: 'The beliefs that mould great organisations frequently
grow out of the character, the experience and the convictions of a single
person.' In IBM's case that person was Watson Sr.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Management: France puts her 'affaires' in order - David
Buchan examines a growing debate about corporate governance and better
boardroom practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
French companies are beginning to punch back a bit, after the general
hammering they have taken for corruption from magistrates, international
investors and the press.
The Patronat employers federation has called on its members to suspend
contributions to political parties, and some larger ones, particularly
France's big utilities suspected of winning municipal contracts by underhand
means, have already stopped writing cheques to the politicians.
The fact that the French national assembly is now considering legislation to
ban companies giving to political parties robs the Patronat appeal of some
of its import. But in a report concluding its own study on anti-corruption
reforms, the Patronat is also asking for a revision of some of the penal
provisions of French company law and for better protection for businessmen
under investigation from press leaks, as well as calling on its member
companies to adopt ethics codes and set up ethics committees.
Already the corruption scandals, usually referred to in ambiguous French
understatement as 'les affaires', are affecting the way some French
companies are managed. The most striking example concerns the Schneider
group, whose president, Didier Pineau-Valenciennes, is the subject of an
international arrest warrant issued by a Belgian judge. The warrant was
issued after Pineau-Valenciennes failed to return to Belgium to be
investigated further on fraud charges. The Schneider president has since
taken to running his multinational engineering group through
tele-conferences from Paris and letting the head of his international
division travel in his stead to countries that might honour the Belgian
warrant.
In addition, most members of the French public works contractors'
association have taken a pledge not to bribe to obtain contracts.
Individually, Lyonnaise des Eaux says it has reinforced its ethical
practices, while Generale des Eaux has put its chief legal officer in charge
of a new committee to provide ethical 'guidance' to managers.
Most important of all, the publicity surrounding 'les affaires' has also
given new prominence to the debate about how far France should import
Anglo-Saxon models of corporate governance and change the balance of power
and control between management, boards and shareholders in its companies.
There is a feeling that one of the reasons why French companies have got
into trouble with the law is that their over-powerful bosses are not
properly controlled by their boards and shareholders.
This impression is reinforced by the fact that the charge most commonly
levelled against company chiefs is 'abus des biens sociaux' (literally,
misuse of corporate funds). But the idea that top executives have been
generally acting against their companies' interest is false, says the
Patronat. The employers federation wants magistrates to stop using the 'abus
des biens sociaux' charge as a catch-all, and to redefine it as including
some element of personal enrichment. It is perhaps true that some directors
and shareholders were ready, at least in earlier times, to turn a blind eye
to executives using company money to pay bribes, provided these were a
cost-efficient way of bringing in contracts, but not to feather their own
nests.
However, it is really foreign investors who have brought the corporate
governance debate to France. Their voice is strong. At the end of last year,
foreigners held 36 per cent, or FFr444bn (Pounds 52.8bn) worth, of quoted
French companies' stock exchange value and 27 per cent or FFr1,063bn worth
of their bonds. 'This voice has to be listened to,' recognises Jean-Francois
Thedore, president of the Paris Bourse.
Many of these foreign, particularly Anglo-Saxon, investors have been
influenced by the 1992 Cadbury recommendations in the UK for company boards
to include more independent, non-executive directors, building on similar
practices in the US. Broadly, they would like to see in France more
accountability of chairmen/chief executives to their boards, greater
involvement of boards in the setting of strategy, auditing of accounts and
nominations, a phasing out of cross-directorships held by representatives of
big companies who all sit on each others' boards, and more rights for
minority shareholders. This last point is particularly important for
Anglo-Saxon institutional investors and pension funds, because for
prudential reasons they hold only minority stakes in companies in whose
management they do not want to be directly involved.
Business reaction in France is mixed. Some are highly positive. Andre
Levy-Lang, the head of Paribas, enthuses about 'exemplary' boards in the US
such as that of Schlumberger on which he sits. For others, it is a question
of swimming with the prevailing tide. 'The ever-growing presence of foreign
shareholders in French companies obliges us to go forth into the open sea
and to adopt Anglo-Saxon canons,' says Gerard Worms, president of the Suez
financial and industrial group. The Commission de Bourses, the legal
regulator of the stock market, has campaigned for the past 10 years for
French company boards to create audit committees, arguing that a regular
dialogue between specialised directors and outside auditors would enhance
the credibility of annual accounts and boards.
Others are more reserved about any wholesale import of Anglo-Saxon
practices, particularly in the form of new legislation. 'We don't need a
revolution, because practices are already gradually evolving,' says
Jean-Louis Beffa, head of the St. Gobain glass-making and industrial group.
'Improvements in behaviour (of company boards) are more pertinent than new
rules,' he stresses.
The classic example of a law which changed nothing was that of 1966,
allowing a two-tier structure, with a supervisory board presided over by a
chairman on top of a management board headed by a chief executive. Less than
2 per cent of French companies have adopted this model. It is possible for
the posts of president (chairman) and directeur-general (chief executive) to
be held separately within a single board structure, as in the US.
But this obviously does not appeal much to France's presidents-directeurs
generaux (PDGs), as Beffa, who holds both posts at St. Gobain explains.
'When a company has separate chairmen and chief executive officers (CEOs),
one always wonders who is the real boss,' he points out. 'This separation
can have its uses in a crisis, when for instance in the US the chairman
stays to assure continuity, while the CEO changes. But is it such a bad
thing for both posts to change in a crisis, as happens in France when the
top man goes?'
Rather than reducing PDGs' power, there is more support for increasing
boardroom control over them. But in a recent survey of directors conducted
by the head-hunting consultancy Vuchot Ward Howell, 53 per cent said they
did not have enough information to exercise control properly. Seventy per
cent reckoned an individual director could not stop a PDG from taking
'dangerous decisions'. Only a minority (40 per cent) believed resignation
was an effective form of protest, a view anecdotally confirmed by the
failure of Jacques Calvet to carry out his threat to resign from the board
of Generale des Eaux on the parachuting in of the young 38-year-old
Jean-Francois Messier as heir to Guy Dejouany, veteran PDG of the giant
utility. If the outspoken and powerful head of Peugeot is not going to carry
out a resignation threat, who, in France, is?
The survey reinforced the feeling that a board's power lay in it acting
collectively. But this, too, was judged difficult because most directors are
co-opted on to boards by the PDG acting alone or sometimes with major
shareholders.
Indeed, it is the big shareholders dominating the boards of leading French
companies who often give foreign or minority shareholders the impression of
facing a closed oligarchy. A study by a pair of academics, Michel Bauer and
Benedicte Bertin-Mourot, showed that the 1,161 directorships of the top
private-sector 100 companies in 1990 were occupied by 797 people. The
proportion of people holding multiple cross-directorships is probably no
less now, because of the 'cores' of institutional French investors which
have been established in recently privatised companies.
One possible remedy is to introduce more non-executive directors,
independent of management and of shareholders, as the Cadbury report
preached in the UK. But this idea draws sharp criticism from some quarters.
Bernard Dumon, PDG of the Saint-Louis food, textile and paper group,
believes it to be 'a British solution to a British problem', and not
transferable to French boards which by law were never allowed as many
in-house executive directors as in the UK. Directors representing large
shareholders make for a strong and attentive board, Dumon argues, precisely
because they have to consolidate any losses into their own accounts.
By contrast, French companies seem much more open to putting board members
on audit committees, rather than just remuneration committees; the latter
are popular mainly because if pay is fixed in sub-committee, as distinct
from the full board, it does not have to be published. But the COB recently
complained that these audit bodies 'do not have the true independence of
real auditing committees made up of outside directors and chaired by one of
them'.
However, Rene de La Serre sees change as inevitable from his role as
president of the Conseil Des Bourses des Valeurs, the stock exchange's
governing body. 'In the long run, it will doubtless be necessary to limit
this practice (of cross-directorships),' he recognises.
'This is a goal we could fix ourselves, in parallel to the development of
our financial markets and therefore of the progressive disappearance of
cross-holdings.' He contests the idea that minority shareholders are
victimised in France, but says that in the long run, too, he sees the need
for 'every director to represent all shareholders collectively'.
Until recently, 'there was no notion of the protection of minority
shareholders in France', says Herve Thibaut of Deminor, a Franco-Belgian
consultancy that has made a business out of championing the small
shareholder. He cites the rough ride minority shareholders have had in
Eurodisney, and in such operations as the takeovers of La Redoute by
Pinault-Printemps and of Wagons-Lit by Accor. The only time French companies
are required to commission an independent 'fairness opinion' of their bid is
when they hold 95 per cent and can launch a compulsory 'squeeze-out' of the
remaining 5 per cent.
But the tide is turning. Last summer saw the passage of new legislation to
allow shareholders to band together to force company managements to answer
questions at annual meetings, to provide specific financial advice or to
query auditors reports. To qualify for these rights, shareholders in these
associations must hold 'nominative' shares (not very popular for tax evasion
reasons) for two years and represent 1 per cent of bigger companies' equity.
But it is a start.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Management: An explanation for advertising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I had cocktails the other evening with a living national treasure. Well, not
exactly cocktails. He drank Scotch and I drank tomato juice, though after 1
1/2 hours they seemed quite sophisticated.
In Japan, I think it is, they have an official system of numbering their
LNTs. Thus a poet in Fukuoka might be Living National Treasure Number 29,
while a master potter in Nayoro might be No 137.
If Britain had such a system, Jeremy Bullmore would be a designated LNT for
his contribution to the world of advertising and thus to the world of
business. He is a businessman's businessman. He was 65 recently, and has
lost none of the charm, wit and incisiveness that are the trademarks of
London's most famous adman.
I used to think that his distinguishing talent was his ability to explain
what advertising is about to outsiders. But his real significance, probably,
has been his ability to explain what advertising is about to admen - what it
is and isn't, what it can do and can't. He has been the conscience of
advertising, as well as its inspiration.
And not just in Britain. He joined the London office of the J Walter
Thompson agency in October 1954, and retired from it in December 1987. He
started as a trainee copywriter, became a writer-producer, and eventually
creative director. From 1976 to 1987 he was chairman of Thompson in London.
He was also a member of Thompson's international board, and for six years
chairman of the UK Advertising Association. Since 1988 he has been a
non-executive director of The Guardian and Manchester Evening News, and of
the WPP Group, which owns Thompson.
I caught up with the LNT on his home territory in Mayfair, in a tiny pub in
Farm Street a few doors along from WPP and only a stone's throw from his
former agency.
I had wanted to ask the LNT if he had ever known a period in business like
the present one, when the word 'boom' appears to be a dirty one.
I said: 'Advertising is booming, isn't it? In the first half of this year UK
advertising enjoyed real growth close to 8.5 per cent, and is expected to
continue at something like that rate for quite a while.
'When I was a reporter covering the ad business, in the early 1980s,
agencies would have been ecstatic at growth like that - which, of course,
they were used to. There were parties every day, people rolling in the
street, joy unconfined. But now it's all so quiet. People working slavishly,
too busy to count the money. Have you ever known a period like it?'
'No,' said Jeremy, 'not in 40 years, but then you are using boom in the
technical sense, extracting it from the figures, whereas it doesn't feel
like a boom and nobody's got the time even to mention the word - partly or
even mainly because of fear of nemesis, God and downfall. No one is tempting
fate. Even the go-for-its aren't mentioning the boom word.'
'Go-for-its?'
'Yes. In business there is always a struggle between the go-for-its and the
tooth-suckers. This is especially true in advertising. At present, the
go-for-its are in thrall to the tooth-suckers. And the longer the
tooth-suckers remain in the ascendancy, the longer the pain will last.'
'Are you a go-for-it?'
'Not at all. I am an in-between. Call me a finger-crosser. I hated a lot of
that stuff in the 1980s. It takes the joy out of life if you have to be
mindlessly expansionary all the time, always saying go-for-it, whereas the
present mood suits me. I quite like caution. At present there is a good
balance between optimism and caution which suits my temperament. For
advertising, it's healthy. It came to a point in the 1980s when some clients
were telling their agencies that what they wanted was famous advertising -
advertising that people would talk about.
'It was a vanity thing, and really quite preposterous. Somehow, advertising
had become confused with 'creativity' and the winning of awards - a minor
art form instead of part of the commercial process. Believe it or not, there
were debates going on about whether agencies should be 'marketing' or
'creative' shops. The reason for advertising was being lost sight of.'
'And that reason is?'
'The only reason for advertising is that your client is better off having
spent his money with you than he would have been if he hadn't'
The collected thoughts of Jeremy Bullmore can be found in his book, Behind
the Scenes in Advertising (NTC Publications). Chapters include: What sort of
family does this Jaffa cake come from?, The hair restorer that didn't, High
noon at Elkhart, Indiana, and Never use irony in Chicago.
It has a sensationally brief introduction by fellow adman David Ogilvy,
which starts: 'I read this book in bed last night. Fascinating.'
But pay no heed to Ogilvy. Behind the Scenes in Advertising is one of the
best books on the business you are likely to find or need. Just what you
would expect from an LNT.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Escape from the scrapheap: Motoko Rich on how Workstart
helps the long-term unemployed by paying subsidies to employers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Mike Taylor went to Devon Waste Management's site in Plymouth for an
interview at its revamped recycling centre last August he was not really
expecting a job.
He is a former dockyard and city council employee and has been unemployed
for nine years, during which he had only been asked to four interviews.
'I never thought I would work again,' he said. 'You wouldn't, not after nine
years.'
But Devon Waste Management took him on and he has been sorting garden waste
for compost. Mr Taylor said he was delighted at the chance to work again.
He was one of six people hired by the company in August as a result of
Workstart, a pilot scheme to help the long-term unemployed back to work.
In the Budget Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said the scheme would be
expanded in further trials around the country and promised to allocate
Pounds 5.5m in 1995-96 to create 5,000 jobs. This week an independent
evaluation of the scheme is expected to be published by the Institute for
Employment Studies.
Under the scheme, which has been tried out since last year in Devon and
Cornwall, East Kent, south and south-west London, and Tyneside, employers
are given a subsidy of Pounds 60 a week for 26 weeks per candidate, and
Pounds 30 a week for a further 26 weeks. Anyone who is hired under Workstart
must have been unemployed for two years or more.
Between June last year and this month the Department of Employment invested
Pounds 3.4m in the project and filled 1,474 places.
In Plymouth, identified by the government as a deprived inner-city area, the
unemployment rate is 10.4 per cent in a population of 250,000. With
industrial work at the city's naval dockyards shrinking every year companies
such as Toshiba, British Aerospace, Plessy and GEC have been unable to take
up the slack in the labour market.
The employment service for the area estimates that about 19.3 per cent of
its unemployed have been on the dole for more than two years. For many of
them Workstart has been the first government scheme that has actually led to
a job.
Ms Pat Stratton, a Workstart receptionist since September at Fearbuster
Business Centre, a government funded training centre in Plymouth, said she
tried other government job-search assistance programmes while she was
unemployed for two years.
Other schemes such as Employment Training and Job Clubs, designed to give
the unemployed basic job-hunting skills, were 'utter rubbish'. She said: 'I
used to sit in a room and just drink coffee and smoke all day. We got Pounds
18 extra a week for that.'
After two years of applying for 'stacks' of jobs, she went to Fearbuster to
train in office computing skills. When its manager, Mr Tom Harvey-Robinson,
heard about the Workstart subsidy he offered her a job as a receptionist and
conference organiser.
The weekly payments also helped Devon Waste Management, which is part of
Devon County Council, to expand its recycling business. But Ms Sandra
Craddock, personnel manager, said the subsidy did not influence the
company's hiring decisions inordinately. She said: 'We would have taken the
six on anyway. The kind of people we were looking for matched the people on
the scheme.'
Ms Frances Hart, Workstart co-ordinator for Plymouth and Torbay, said Devon
Waste Management, a relatively small business with low-skilled jobs, was the
kind of company the scheme targeted.
She said: 'Small businesses are more open to funding and are more flexible
about taking on someone who has been unemployed for more than two years.
There is a great psychological barrier that employers have in taking on the
long-term unemployed.'
Fuelserve, a fuel and lubricant distributor for Esso based in Plymouth,
hired two telephone sales employees through Workstart. Mr Tony Jackson,
managing director, said the subsidy helped the company overcome its
prejudice against the long-term unemployed.
He said: 'Without that cash incentive it would be another mark against a
person who had been out of work for a long time. It is easier to take
someone who has only been unemployed for less than six months because they
have not got out of the habit of work.'

FT  12 DEC 94 / MPs to hear of WDA share deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, will make a statement to parliament
today about how the Welsh Development Agency acted as underwriter in
privatisation share issues.
The government-funded WDA lost Pounds 50,000 on the British Petroleum
flotation, although overall it made a profit of Pounds 19,000 on
privatisations. The agency lost Pounds 168,000, however, in underwriting the
share issues of Welsh-based companies, including Laura Ashley.
The underwriting, which stopped in 1991, was not made public at the time and
has been uncovered by investigations by the agency's new management team.
The Welsh Office said last night: 'The secretary of state has made it clear
to the board that he no longer regards this as an appropriate role for the
agency.'
Mr Redwood is expected to refer to the outcome of other WDA investigations
into its past, including a report commissioned from Grant Thornton, the
accountancy firm, into a complex land deal at Aberdare.
Mr Barry Hartop, who was appointed chief executive of the WDA earlier this
year, will tell the Commons public accounts committee today of the results
of the inquiries.
He said last night: 'We have been working hard to get all the skeletons out
of the cupboard and we do believe they are now out of the cupboard. We look
forward to a new start.'
Mr Rhodri Morgan, MP for Cardiff West and a Labour frontbench spokesman,
said yesterday he was 'absolutely stupefied' that a development agency had
engaged in underwriting government share issues.
'Whose idea was it - how high did it go?' he said. He wished to learn
whether the Welsh secretaries at the time, Mr Peter (now Lord) Walker and Mr
David Hunt, had known. 'Was the Treasury aware of it, or did it take the
initiative?' he said.
Mr Morgan is tabling questions asking Mr Redwood whether the underwriting
had been disclosed in the WDA's accounts. 'If it was not shown, who
authorised the burying of it in the accounts?' he said.
The WDA has been revamped since the publication last year of a damning
report by the public accounts committee, which fuelled the controversy over
the accountability of quangos. New board members have been appointed and
nearly all the senior managers replaced by outsiders.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Directors with bonuses 'get more in basic pay'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Managing directors who receive bonuses get more in basic pay than those with
no bonuses, according to a salary survey published today.
The report, by the Reward Group and the Institute of Directors, found that
in parent companies managing directors receiving no bonus pay received
Pounds 60,000 on average in annual basic pay. Managing directors in similar
companies who received bonuses - of Pounds 15,000 a year on average - had a
higher average basic pay of Pounds 72,000.
The same phenomenon was apparent in single companies and in subsidiaries.
The report said: 'The conventional wisdom prior to undertaking this research
was that those who do not have any additional pay would generally have a
higher basic salary. This is demonstrably not the case.'
The IoD said it was unable to shed light on the apparent discrepancy other
than to suggest that high performing directors, already on high salaries,
might be in the best postion to demand profit-related bonuses.
The survey of 5,000 directors across a broad range of company sizes said
annual pay increases for directors averaged 3 per cent in the past 12
months.
This is substantially less than the findings of other recent surveys, most
of which were putting the pay rises of directors, managers and executives in
the past year at about 6 per cent.
More than half of the respondents to the latest survey had pay rises of 3
per cent or less with 17 per cent having no rise. Only 1 per cent had a pay
cut.
Most directors forecast pay rises of 3 per cent in the next 12 months
although 10 per cent of them expected to get no increases.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, director-general of the IoD, said the survey put
directors' pay rises into perspective.
He said: 'It confirms that the high profile salaries and rises are not
representative and give the wrong impression about directors' salaries and
pay rises.'

FT  12 DEC 94 / MMC's impact to be assessed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A powerful committee of MPs is to investigate the effectiveness of the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the competition watchdog.
The Commons trade and industry committee intends to look at developments in
a number of markets to assess the impact of past MMC rulings.
Areas covered will include new cars, compact discs and beer. The cross-party
body is expected to start its probe early in the new year.
The inquiry comes after a year in which the government's competition policy
has come under fire from consumer groups and others.
In July Mr Stephen Locke, director of policy at the Consumers' Association,
said competition policy was in urgent need of review and warned that the MMC
 -which has an annual budget of Pounds 5.5m - was 'gradually diminishing
into a toothless watchdog'.
His comments came about two months after it emerged that senior officials at
the Office of Fair Trading were increasingly concerned that the Department
of Trade and Industry was softening its stance on competition policy to help
create strong UK champions capable of competing globally.
Last month it was announced that Sir Bryan Carsberg was to step down early
as director-general of fair trading, after three years in which his strong
advocacy of consumers' interests increasingly put him in conflict with the
MMC.
In August Mr Neil Hamilton, then corporate affairs minister, said that a
review by Price Waterhouse, the management consultants, had concluded that
the MMC had been effective in its role as an investigative body and had
carried out its responsibilities in 'an independent, professional and fair
manner'.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Labour accuses ministers of short-termism over Northern
Ireland economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday accused ministers of short-termism over the Northern
Ireland economy and called for a degree of government input into private
sector investment in the province, David Owen writes.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said ahead of this
week's international investment conference in Belfast that measures taken on
the economy were crucial to the stability of the peace process. Voicing
concern about the government's economic strategy in Ulster she warned that
an important opportunity would be missed unless ministers thought
'strategically and long term' about economic regeneration and restructuring.
Aid packages from Europe, the US and elsewhere were 'crucial pump-priming
resources', she said. But co- ordination was vital to make sure that money
was not just 'thrown at high-status projects which do not assist
infrastructure growth'.
She said public investment was bearing the brunt of cuts in the government's
public spending plans for Northern Ireland, unveiled last week, which would
result in a Pounds 75m real terms reduction in the budget by 1997-98.

People from ethnic minorities are much more likely to be unemployed than
their white counterparts, although far higher numbers of young ethnic
minority Britons are studying full-time, says a report today by the Equal
Opportunities Commission and the Commission for Racial Equality.
The unemployment rate for ethnic minority women is 16 per cent, compared
with 6 per cent for white women. Ethnic minority men have a 20 per cent
unemployment rate compared with 11 per cent for white men.
The report found that even when members of ethnic minority groups attained
higher qualifications - above A-level or equivalent - unemployment levels
remain far higher than among white men and women.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Support rallies on Channel 4 funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jeremy Isaacs, founding chief executive of Channel 4, has launched a
campaign to overturn the channel's controversial funding formula, Raymond
Snoddy writes.
Campaigners say the effect of a formula intended by the 1990 Broadcasting
Act to protect Channel 4's remit to innovate 'is that a minority channel
subsidises the shareholders of the ITV companies to the tune of some Pounds
50m a year'.
The campaign has the backing of Lord Young, chairman of Cable and Wireless,
who as trade and industry secretary shared cabinet responsibility for the
1990 act. Others backing the campaign, launched in a letter to The Times,
include Mr David Abbott, chairman of advertising agency Abbott Mead Vickers,
and Sir Alistair Grant, chairman of food retailer Argyll.
The letter says: 'Channel 4 now pays more to ITV than it can invest in drama
and film combined. This cannot have been parliament's intention.'
It would not be unfair to make the change now, the former Channel 4 chief
executive says, because by early next year the ITV companies will have
collectively received Pounds 100m. This is 'all they estimated to get from
Channel 4 over the full period of their licences'.

FT  12 DEC 94 / British Coal set to sell fund arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal is expected to ask for offers next month for CIN Management,
its fund management arm, after the trustees of both the industry's pension
schemes agreed the framework for a fully commercial relationship with it.
The sale is expected to attract significant interest among other fund
managers. CIN Management is one of the country's biggest pension fund
managers, with Pounds 16bn to Pounds 17bn under its control.
Most of the managed funds are in equities, predominantly UK shares, but
there are also property and venture capital investments.
British Coal is likely to ask potential bidders in mid-January if they are
interested in pre-qualifying to take part in the bid. Completion of the sale
is expected in April or May.
British Coal is also starting the sales process for its 15 per cent interest
in German Creek, an Australian coking coal company in which Shell Coal also
an interest. Coal users and producers in North Korea, Japan and Taiwan are
likely to be interested.
It expects it to take three to four months to get an offer. Existing
partners in the joint venture will have pre-emptive rights to buy the
shareholding at the final price.
British Coal bought into German Creek in the late 1970s to test machinery
for longwall mining.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Peace primes Irish trade links: John Murray Brown on the
potential for cross-border business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Belfast you can barely find a free parking space for all the cars from
the Irish Republic, bearing their distinctive blue plates. In the wake of
the paramilitary ceasefires the city is buzzing with Christmas shoppers -
and some shopkeepers are even willing to accept Irish punts.
Economists expect a boom in cross-border economic activity if the peace
process holds.
The potential is considerable. Two-way trade was about Pounds 1.2bn in 1992,
with Northern Ireland incurring a deficit of Pounds 357m.
Mr Paul Gorecki, of the Northern Ireland Economic Council, an independent
advisory body set up by the government, says it would be wrong to exaggerate
the differences between the north and south. He said: 'We're not dealing
with East and West Germany or even the US and Canada.'
Both have high unem-ployment, a high birth rate, a shrinking manufacturing
base and an overdependence on exchequer funding, whether from the Treasury
in Northern Ireland's case or European Union funds in the repub-lic's.
Already Northern Ireland Electricity, the privatised utility, is to restore
the north-south interconnector with the Electricity Supply Board. It was
blown up by the IRA in the early 1970s.
This will create savings for the consumer and provide both companies with
trading opportunities. British Telecommunications is understood to be
interested in opportunities arising from the privatisation of Telecom
Eireann.
Private companies are also refocusing on an all-Ireland strategy to maximise
efficiencies. Takeover activity in areas such as food retailing will spur
the process.
There are difficulties, however. One is a lack of shared information on
cross-border trade. Companies also face poor roads and telecommunications.
Other problems are those associated with any foreign investment - the
adverse currency risk and the difficulties in pursuing payment in a foreign
jurisdiction.
Historically the two economies grew apart at partition in the 1920s. Heavy
industry such as shipbuilding, and the manufacturing sectors such as linen,
brewing and distilling located in the north. The southern economy remained
dependent on sales of farm products and commodities and over-reliant on the
UK for much of its exports.
The real constraint is political. The joint framework document which both
governments hope will form the basis for a constitutional settlement for
Ulster envisages greater cross-border economic links. Unionists are
concerned, however, that this could be the nationalists' Trojan horse for
their ultimate goal of a united Ireland.
Investment is particularly contentious because it would involve the
respective government agencies - Northern Ireland's Industrial Development
Board and the republic's Industrial Development Agency.
Mr Kieran McGowan, managing director of the IDA, said joint tourism
initiatives and trade missions would benefit both agencies. He said: 'But
with IDB we are competitors. We would talk about the issues that any
competitors would talk about. If the ceasefire holds, that competition will
intensify.'
The strategies of the two agencies differ markedly - the republic relying on
a 10 per cent corporate tax and the IDB enticing investors with big capital
grants.
So far much of the foreign investment on both sides of the border has been
what Mr Gorecki at NIEC calls 'stand alone - easy entrance and easy exit'.
The challenge for authorities north and south is to persuade existing and
new investors to deepen their roots in the community, through more local
sourcing and research links with local universities, and sharing
subcontractors on both sides of the border.
The private sector is setting the pace. Ulster Bank has an extensive network
in the south - in small towns such as Killarney its branch offices display
the logo in Gaelic.
Monaghan Mushrooms in the republic, which accounts for 25 per cent of the UK
fresh mushroom market, is one of a cluster of food companies near the border
with Northern Ireland. Monaghan provides compost to small farmers on both
sides of the border, buying back the mushrooms.
The operation also provides pizza toppings for Heinz's Dundalk factory in
the republic. Heinz's decision to locate in Dundalk was to take advantage of
IDA incentives, and the proximity to the Larne port in Northern Ireland.
Fruit of the Loom, the US clothing manufacturer, also operates on both sides
of the border.
Mr Gorecki believes with the peace in place, the first question will be
whether the IDB can continue with its generous grants. This will depend on
the IDA's strategy. Currently, the 10 per cent tax incentive in the republic
is assured until the year 2010.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Ulster 'fair jobs' pressure: US investors to demand progress
on equal opportunities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US investors attending this week's international business conference in
Belfast plan to tie future investment to fair employment in Northern Ireland
and cross-community involvement in development projects.
Renewed focus on both issues emerged at a conference held in the US at the
weekend marking the 10th anniversary of the campaign in support of the
so-called MacBride principles, which aim to promote civil rights and equal
opportunity in Northern Ireland.
The US conference was sponsored by Mr Alan Hevesi, the New York City
comptroller (treasurer). He has signalled a plan to channel up to Dollars
100m (Pounds 60m) in institutional funds to Ulster in the form of 'Irish
Peace bonds' and has already made clear his intention of encouraging
companies to adopt employment practices based on the MacBride principles.
The US conference was attended by Mr William Flyn, chairman of Mutual
America, one of the biggest American insurance companies, who has helped
co-ordinate private investor interest on both sides of the Irish border.
At the conference both men made clear that US investor confidence in
Northern Ireland remained dependent on progress in the peace talks and that
any major inflow of capital would have to be tied to a political programme
firmly linked to the promotion of equal rights.
Mr Hevesi said yesterday that he was planning a 'significant expansion' of
the MacBride principles campaign by aiming to influence corporate compliance
with 'positive discrimination' towards Roman Catholics in British companies
in which there was a significant US shareholding.
Until now the campaign, supported by 18 US state legislatures, has played an
important role in influencing the employment practices of US companies with
operations in Northern Ireland.
Mr Hevesi said yesterday: 'The environment for investment in Northern
Ireland has improved dramatically as a result of the peace process, but
progress towards the elimination of discrimination is painfully slow.'
At the weekend conference Mr Flyn renewed his backing for the MacBride
principles, and insisted that discrimination had no place in Northern
Ireland. He was strongly critical of the opposition of the Reverend Ian
Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, to the involvement of the
US in the peace process.
Mr Hevesi and Mr Flyn will be heading a strong Irish-American caucus at the
Belfast conference which is determined to put fair employment and the
continuing involvement of Sinn Fein in the peace process at the centre of
talks with government officials.
The UK government's position is that Northern Ireland's laws provide legally
enforceable remedies against discriminatory practices.
Yesterday Mr Hevesi released the results of a survey on employment practices
of UK companies in Northern Ireland in which New York City has
shareholdings, showing continuing religious imbalance at the workplace.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Obituary of Lord Joseph: The principal architect of
Thatcherism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Joseph, who died on Saturday at the age of 76, was the principal
architect of the monetarist approach to economic policy which came to be
known as Thatcherism.
This was implicitly acknowledged by Mrs Margaret (now Baroness) Thatcher in
her book The Downing Street Years when she described Lord Joseph as her
oldest political ally and 'indeed mentor'.
Both in his public and private life he will be remembered as an immensely
courteous and sometimes surprising man. At Harrow School he spent much of
his time playing cricket. As an opening batsman he twice hit a six off the
first ball, but never became more than captain of the second eleven.
At Oxford he became a fellow of All Souls' and could have had a
distinguished academic career. He could also have run the family business
Bovis, where he was briefly chairman after having insisted on starting on
the building sites and working his way up. Instead he chose politics.
Lord Joseph became a monetarist convert after serving as health and social
services secretary in the cabinet of Mr (now Sir) Edward Heath from 1970 to
1974. He was one of the big spenders when the money supply increased by 25
per cent in a single year under the chancellorship of Mr Anthony (now Lord)
Barber.
In a memorable display of candour when he moved over to the opposition front
bench after Mr Heath had led the Conservative party to its second successive
general election defeat in 1974, Lord Joseph confessed to having been an
'inflationeer'.
He further underlined the significance of the sea change in his approach to
economic policy after the interventionism of the Heath government by saying:
'I have only recently become a Conservative'.
Lord Joseph defined the object of Thatcherism as 'increasing the
inequalities' so as to provide the incentives needed to motivate
entrepreneurs and innovators at the top, and to facilitate the trickle down
effect intended to benefit those at the lower end of the income scale.
But having produced the blueprint Lord Joseph realised that he did not
possess the political steel needed for the lead role in implementing a
policy certain to face formidable opposition from the outset. In spite of
attempts by some rightwing backbenchers to persuade him to change his mind,
Lord Joseph backed away from an earlier intention to challenge Mr Heath for
the leadership of the party. Mrs Thatcher took up the gauntlet instead in
1975, and after replacing Mr Heath she relied heavily on Lord Joseph, who
had overall responsibility for policy and research, in the interval before
she became prime minister in 1979.
Their relationship continued in the seven years he served in her cabinet,
first as industry secretary, then in charge of education and science.
The initial opposition to Thatcherism came from the 'wets' in the cabinet
and on the Conservative back benches, as well as from the other political
parties.
With Mrs Thatcher happily terming sterling a 'petro-currency', the
combination of high interest rates and an over-valued pound had a sharp
impact on much of the corporate sector. Unemployment soared, company
failures increased, and Lord Joseph soon had to contend with opposition from
industry itself.
Feelings ran so high in some company boardrooms that in a speech which he
later came to regret Sir Terence Beckett, director-general of the CBI,
advocated a 'bare knuckle fight' with the government.
From the outset Lord Joseph had recognised the limitations of the policy and
spelt them out in a pamphlet entitled Monetarism is Not Enough. In this he
admitted that whereas cuts in public expenditure rarely materialised,
squeezes imposed on the private sector were 'for real'.
On those grounds Lord Joseph defended the cabinet's insistence that revenues
from North Sea oil should be used to keep down the level of taxation and the
size of the public sector borrowing requirement. He was unmoved by demands
that they should be used to counter the shrinkage in the industrial base
which resulted in Britain becoming a net importer of manufactured goods for
the first time in living memory.
In the wake of sterling's enforced exit from the European Community's
exchange rate mechanism in 1992, Lord Joseph recognised that the
manufacturing and services sector of the economy were 'too slim and too
thin' to provide the jobs and rising prosperity Britain needed. He still
maintained, however, that most of the reasons behind the decline in British
business were due to 'long-standing cultural and attitudinal causes'.
Lord Joseph was a formidable advocate of rolling back the frontiers of the
state, to reverse what he denounced as the 'ratchet' effect of socialism.
Lord Joseph's decision not to seek the leadership of the Conservative party
was also influenced by the fierce reaction to a speech in which he attacked
the 'permissive society' and the moral laxity which resulted in so many
young girls becoming unmarried mothers. He underlined the increase in the
number of births to mothers in socio-economic classes four and five who, as
a result of social deprivation, were least fitted to bring up children.
Lord Joseph's conclusion that 'the balance of our population, our human
stock, is threatened' caused uproar and he was accused of advocating
master-race theories.
His willingness to confront any issue also led him into difficulties in the
Commons when he advocated the return of capital punishment. Lord Joseph
undermined his own case by admitting that for all its deterrent effect
hanging would not be a suitable punishment for the category of murders which
were the cause of the greatest public concern at the time  - those committed
by terrorists.
Lord Joseph never shrank from admitting policy failures. For instance, he
felt deeply about the environmental and social consequences of the high-rise
building developments encouraged during his periods of office at the housing
ministry. He served as a junior minister in that department before becoming
its political head on being promoted to his first cabinet post by Harold
Macmillan in 1962.
Lord Joseph entered the Commons in 1956 after winning the safe Tory seat of
Leeds North East in a by-election.
To those who knew him the question always remained of how such a sensitive,
educated and intelligent man could go into politics and bear the opprobrium
that was thrown at him. But he did, and perhaps his character and continual
asking of questions were more important than any direct political
achievements. Lord Joseph made people think.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Hurd to make statement on Pergau aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, will make a parliamentary
announcement tomorrow on the recent High Court judgment outlawing aid for
Malaysia's Pergau dam, amid indications that he will not appeal against the
decision.
Mr Hurd, due to make an announcement in a written or oral statement to the
Commons, is thought unlikely to appeal because the judgment does not affect
other development projects financed by the UK government.
An application to the Court of Appeal for permission to change the ruling
would have to be lodged by tomorrow at the latest. Whitehall officials have
privately conceded in recent weeks, however, that such a move would be
unlikely to succeed.
An official said last week: 'The basis on which we would be likely to win
the appeal would be that it was right to give aid to unsound projects.
Politically, that is a very hard case to push for.'
It has also become clear that dozens of projects in other countries financed
by the Pounds 100m a year provided under the government's aid and trade
provision scheme will not be deemed illegal under the High Court ruling.
Labour MPs will this week press Mr Hurd to give an assurance that Pounds 35m
of overseas aid money that has already been granted for the Pergau dam will
be restored to the Overseas Development Administration's budget.
They will also seek a guarantee that the remaining Pounds 170m, which
Britain is contractually bound to give Malaysia over the next nine years,
will come from other sources.
Last month the High Court ruled that grants for the Pergau project were
'fatally flawed' because the project was 'economically unsound' and did not
promote the development of a country's economy as required by trade laws.
The High Court has amplified its ruling in a full written judgment which was
delivered last week to the government and the World Development Movement,
the aid pressure group which brought the action.
According to Mr Ben Jackson, WDM's director, the full judgment specifies
that the government must find the funds for the Pergau project from other
sources.
On the financial relief given to Malaysia, the court says that 'unravelling
of some sort will be necessary, but the precise from of that unravelling is
not a matter for the court'.
The judgment also contains a statement from the Treasury solicitor,
representing the government, that 'measures will have to be taken to deal
with the unravelling of the consequences of the unlawfulness of the
decision'.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Revenue seeks views on tax changes for bond repo market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Inland Revenue has published a discussion paper outlining possible tax
changes which could facilitate the establishment of an open
sale-and-repurchase market for UK government bonds.
It intends to establish whether tax changes are necessary to ensure the
efficient functioning of a 'repo' market for government bonds and, if so,
how they should be best made. The possibility of setting up the market was
announced in the Budget last month.
The Revenue consultation runs in parallel with wider consultation by the
Bank of England concerning the market structure and regu-latory aspects of
an open repo system.
Both are requesting comments from market participants by January 31 1995.
A bond repo is an agreement for sale and repurchase of a bond at a
pre-arranged price. When an interest payment falls due, it is usually
received by the repo buyer rather than the security's seller.
To compensate the seller for the 'real' coupon which he has not received,
the buyer pays him what is called a 'manufactured' pay-ment.
Under present law, manufactured gilt interest payments are net of tax.
But while most investors receive their real gilt coupons net of withholding
tax, some are exempt and receive gross interest payments. These include
pension funds and charities, or foreign residents holding gilts, which are
free of tax for residents abroad.
If a repo market were introduced without accompanying tax changes, this
would throw up complications. Some investors who repo gilts across a coupon
payment date would get manufactured interest payments net of tax, even
though they usually receive gross payments.
One option proposed by the Revenue is to allow manufactured interest
payments to be paid gross. Another option is to allow gross payment of real
and manufactured gilt interest payments.
The main drawback of this, however, is a cashflow loss to the Exchequer
because the tax on the interest is collected as part of the general tax
liability of recipients some time after it is received.
To limit the cost to the Exchequer from a move to gross interest payment,
the Revenue offers four possible options: restricting gross payment to
certain gilts; restricting gross payment to certain categories of gilt
holder; introducing a system of quarterly accounting to collect tax on the
gross interest received before it would normally be assessed; or making a
charge on those who choose to receive gross interest payments.

Revenue, Financial Institutions Division, Room 510, 22 Kingsway, London WC2B

FT  12 DEC 94 / Investors warned on Halifax merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Halifax and Leeds Permanent building societies will this week warn
investors that reducing their balances could affect their free share
entitlement when the merged society becomes a public limited company and a
bank.
This is likely to intensify speculation that Halifax, as the merged
organisation will be called, does not want to follow the path set by Abbey
National, the former society, which gave its investors and borrowers 100
free shares each on a 'flat-rate' basis when it converted in 1989.
Adopting a different system runs the risk of a legal challenge since it may
not fall clearly within the terms of the 1986 legislation which governs
societies.
The warning will be made in the first letter the societies are sending to
their 10m members about the merger and flotation plans announced last month.
The letters will tell members who will be eligible to vote at the special
general meetings - planned for the spring - at which the merger must be
approved if it is to go ahead.
Within each society the borrowers and the investors must separately agree to
the deal.
For the borrowers' resolution only a simple majority of those voting is
needed.
For the investors' resolution, however, three-quarters of those voting must
support the move, although there is no minimum turnout figure as there is
for investors to approve conversion.
Halifax is already the UK's biggest mortgage lender and the merger with
Leeds, the fifth biggest society, would create an organisation with about
Pounds 90bn in assets.
Members will have a separate opportunity after the merger to decide whether
the joint society should become a public limited company. The most likely
time for flotation is early 1997.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Tougher rules on insurance solvency urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government plans to urge the introduction of tougher European Union
solvency rules for insurance companies exposed to the greatest uncertainty
about potential liabilities from the cover they provide.
Proposals being drawn up by the Department of Trade and Industry would
require European companies to hold a higher proportion of assets to premium
income if faced with exposure to US asbestosis or professional liability
claims.
Most insurance companies comfortably exceed solvency requirements.
But pressure from financial markets is likely to mean that a change in
official solvency rules would lead to companies increasing, by a
corresponding amount, the assets they hold over and above the minimum
solvency margin.
Mr Ian Clark, insurance partner at accountants Binder Hamlyn, said: 'Any
change of that far-reaching nature would undoubtably affect a lot of
companies in the UK and elsewhere in Europe.'
The move reflects Whitehall concern that UK solvency rules, based on EU
directives, do not distinguish companies according to the type of business
they underwrite.
Insurance company failures are often the result of losses incurred on
'long-tail' policies, such as liability insurance, where claims can take
many years to arise and are difficult to forecast.
The insurance subsidiaries of the London United Investment financial
conglomerate, which collapsed four years ago, underwrote relatively
high-risk liability business, specialising in the insurance of North
American companies and professionals against legal awards.
EU directives setting rules on the solvency for insurance companies are due
for review in 1997. National insurance regulators are expected to start
discussions on possible changes early next year.
Since July European insurance companies have been able to operate across the
EU on the basis of regulations set in their home country so the DTI has an
incentive to ensure solvency requirements are strengthened across the EU.
The UK's proposals, which have yet to be worked out in detail, reflect a
trend across the international insurance industry, particularly in the US,
towards 'risk-based' capital.
A move towards 'risk-based' solvency rules would further complicate existing
DTI regulations which set a minimum amount of assets, as a proportion of
premium income or likely claims, that a company has to hold over and above
its outstanding liabilities.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Visa card issuer sparks OFT probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aggressive marketing by a consumer credit arm of the Ford motor group has
exposed a grey area in Britain's consumer protection legislation.
The Office of Fair Trading is examining a decision by The Associates, a
Windsor-based credit company controlled by Ford's US parent, to issue
unsolicited Visa credit cards.
The issue involves the rights to thousands of in-house store cards acquired
by The Associates earlier this year. Following the acquisition, The
Associates, which specialises in consumer loans, mortgages and hire
purchase, issued fully fledged Visa credit cards to the store cardholders
without their explicit consent.
The Associates said the 'upgrading' was covered by the initial terms of the
retailers' in-house cards. The OFT became involved after many cardholders
complained to local trading standards authorities that they had received
'unsolicited' cards.
According to the OFT it is an offence under the 1974 Consumer Credit Act to
send a credit card to a consumer unless the card has been previously
requested in writing. Mr Dermod Hill of the OFT said: 'A question has
arisen. We are examining it and we must now determine whether it does or
does not contravene the law.'
No one from The Associates was available for comment. It is run by
Associates Capital Corporation of Dallas.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Competition sends a tradition off the rails: ABB's Derby
carriage works are threatened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are plenty of reminders of Derby's 150-year history of train making in
the office of Mr Bo Sodersten, managing director of ABB Transportation's
Derby Carriage Works.
The slow tick of a pre-nationalisation railway clock accompanies the words
of the man who has restructured the company over the past three years. On
the wall above his desk hangs a 1950s painting of activity at the works by
Terence Cuneo.
But the traditions of a proud railway town came under threat last week. On
Thursday London Transport announced that an order worth Pounds 800m to
Pounds 900m for more than 100 Underground trains is to go to rival bidder
GEC-Alsthom.
The contract, one of the first under the government's private finance
initiative, covers not only the supply of rolling stock for the Tube's
ageing Northern Line but also 20 years' worth of maintenance work.
Mr Sodersten said ABB Transportation, formerly British Rail Engineering
(BREL) but acquired in 1992 by ABB, a Swedish-Swiss engineering group, has
only a few months work left at its Derby works. It is completing the
delivery of 700 carriages for the Underground's Central Line and has a small
order to supply carriages for the Royal Mail.
It expects to announce early in the new year the loss of up to 600 jobs out
of the 2,500 currently provided by the carriage works. The repair and
maintenance work which provides jobs for the rest of the carriage works
employees has remained steady.
Mr Eric Drewery, chief executive of ABB's UK operations, said he had no
complaints about the way the Northern Line contract was awarded. But he felt
that the failure to win the order was scant reward for the hard work ABB
Transportation put into improving efficiency at Derby.
'When we first bought into BREL in 1989 there was low productivity, massive
overmanning and inadequate investment,' he said. 'Since then business on all
our sites has been transformed.'
The workforce at Derby, Crewe and York has been reduced from 8,300 to 4,500
and costs have been pared. The company used to have two years' worth of
stocks on average. It now has less than two weeks' worth.
ABB made much of the threat to jobs when making its bid for the Northern
Line contract. Mr Drewery feels it was valid to highlight the importance of
maintaining jobs at Derby to government and customers.
He said: 'In a couple of years, when the train operating companies have been
franchised and the rolling stock leasing companies have been privatised,
there will be a tremendous market for rolling stock. We needed help to
maintain our core competences until the market comes back.'
Mr Drewery said that with a monthly wage bill of Pounds 1.5m for the Central
Line contract, ABB Transportation could not keep on the workforce unless
there was work to do.
Mr Stig Svard, who takes over responsibility for the carriage works from Mr
Sodersten in January, sees parallels with the UK bus industry, which has
been deregulated and privatised. He said: 'The bus industry adjusted to new
orders after two to three years.'
The dearth of rolling stock orders has been one factor in the poor
performance of the UK business recently. In 1993 ABB Transportation made a
loss of Pounds 9.8m on turnover of Pounds 518m, with a Pounds 12.4m charge
for redundancy and other restructuring costs.
Rolling stock orders have continued to come in from around the world,
however. The company won a Dollars 900m (Pounds 550m) order for more than
100 locomotives from the German railway last week.
Mr Svard believes he would approach things differently in future. 'We
wouldn't put all our cards on the table (at the outset).  We would disclose
as much as we needed to.  We know know that we would only need to put in the
principles of our bid and not the figures.'

The governor of California yesterday ordered a team of state auditors to be
sent to bankrupt Orange County to assess the damage done to its devastated
investment portfolio. The auditors should review all activities in the
county's funds since June 30 and all audit reports of the last three years,
Governor Pete Wilson said. Orange County, which estimates its investment
losses at Dollars 1.5bn, last Tuesday became the largest local government in
US history to declare bankruptcy. The California governor said state
auditors should assess the county's income and investment fund balances.

FT  12 DEC 94 / State oil companies dominate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE, Energy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
State-owned oil companies continue to dominate the top rankings of
international oil companies in spite of a spate of privatisations in the
industry. A report published today by Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, a US
newsletter, on the world's top 50 oil companies says that 28 are fully or
partly state-owned. But it predicts that privatisations planned over the
next few years will reverse this. The report shows that Petroleos de
Venezuela has overtaken Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil group, to move into
second place behind Saudi Aramco. Private companies in the top 10 include
Exxon, the US energy group, in fourth place. Two other US companies, Mobil
and Chevron, are ranked 7th and 8th respectively, while British Petroleum is
in 9th place. On the basis of production, however, Gazprom, Russia's
monopoly gas company, moves into second place behind Saudi Aramco, although
it ranks 33rd overall.

Donor nations and agencies have pledged a total of Dollars 2bn (Pounds
1.2bn) in financing assistance to Zambia for 1995. The biggest chunk of the
money, about Dollars 1.2bn, will go toward retiring arrears on International
Monetary Fund loans granted in the 1980s to the struggling African country.
About Dollars 347m will be provided for project and commodity assistance and
Dollars 441m more will be given in balance-of-payments aid. Separately, a
further Dollars 154m has been set aside for debt relief, the bank said after
a meeting in Paris of the consultative group of donor nations, the IMF and
the World Bank. The donors said support would depend on Zambia maintaining
the momentum of its recovery programme.

<TEXT>
Israel and Jordan yesterday opened their respective embassies in Amman and
Tel Aviv hotel suites, setting the seal on their October 26 peace treaty.
Jordan is the second Arab state after Egypt to establish full diplomatic
ties with Israel. The ceremony in Amman's Forte Grand Hotel provoked a
demonstration by more than 400 protesters, who burned an Israeli flag
outside the prime minister's office. Moslem and left-wing militants
condemned the opening as 'a black day'. But Mr Yoav Biran, the Israeli
Foreign Ministry's deputy director-general for Middle East affairs, said he
hoped the Jordanian initiative would inspire Syria and Lebanon to complete
the peace process. The first ambassadors are expected to present their
credentials early in the new year. Four Lebanese Moslem guerrillas and one
Israeli soldier were killed yesterday in an exchange of fire near the South
Lebanese town of Marjayoun. A military spokesman in Jerusalem said five
other Israelis were wounded.

<TEXT>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma yesterday pledged to consult the nation before
changing the constitution, as his ruling Swapo party began to look assured
of a two-thirds majority in parliament after the first post-independence
polls.
The two-thirds parliamentary majority, if confirmed when final results are
announced today, would give Swapo the right to amend unilaterally the
constitution, which it believes favours opposition parties.
With more than 70 per cent of the vote going to Swapo, compared to 22 per
cent for the opposition Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA), the ruling
party's grip on power had tightened. Swapo, which fought a 23-year guerrilla
war against South Africa for control of Namibia, was expected to have 51
seats in the new parliament, compared to the 42 it now holds. Commonwealth
observers and those from the Association of European Parliamentarians said
the poll had been fair.

Israeli and PLO leaders yesterday parted in disagreement over the peace
process, after receiving the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize for their accord on
Palestinian self-rule, Reuter reports from Oslo.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and
Palestine Liberation Organisation leader Yassir Arafat made no breakthrough
in talks on the terms for much-delayed Palestinian elections - the next
stage in the peace process.
The two sides agreed to intensify high- and middle- level talks on the
critical second stage of the deal - redeployment of Israeli troops away from
Palestinian population centres on the West Bank before Palestinian elections
are held.
Mr Rabin said Israeli security concerns must be dealt with in a balanced
way, warning: 'Short cuts might lead to catastrophe.' Mr Arafat, in his
acceptance speech on Saturday, insisted on the withdrawal of Israeli troops
from Arab towns on the West Bank before elections can be held.
Israeli and PLO officials said their delegations would meet again in Cairo
on Wednesday for further talks.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (Sabic) and the British Offset Committee
for the Al-Yamamah programme have agreed to license the building of an
aromatics complex at Yanbu on the Red Sea. The complex will employ the
Cyclar process developed by UOP of the US and British Petroleum. Aromatics
are a key building block for the development of other downstream
petrochemical industries.
The Offset programme relates to the Al-Yamamah project, under which British
Aerospace provides aircraft and support for the Saudi airforce and British
companies have become involved in industrial developments.
Construction of the plant, expected to cost Dollars 500m (Pounds 305m)
according to independent industry sources, will start next year and be
completed by early 1998. Owner and operator will be Arabian Industrial
Fibres, known as Ibn Rushd, in which Sabic has 51.7 per cent share. Other
Saudi private sector companies, including Dammam-based Arabian Industrial
Development (NAMA), Jeddah-based Saudi Industrial Development and the
Alujain group, hold the balance.
Locally available liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) will be used as feedstock to
produce between 300,000 and 350,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) of benzene;
250,000 and 300,000 tpa of paraxylene; and 50,000-100,000 tpa of other
xylenes. These products in turn will provide the raw materials for
downstream sales and marketing, partly to domestic buyers in Jubail and the
eastern province, and partly for two other Ibn Rushd projects at Yanbu which
have already been commissioned.
The first is for Sabic's PTA (purified terephthalic acid) plant being built
with technology from Italy's Technimont; it provides the raw materials for
the second, a PET (polyester fibres and chips) plant licensed with Germany's
Zimmer.
The Sabic/British Offset project represents the first commercial-scale use
of the Cyclar process, according to Mr Colin Craig, financial adviser to the
British Offset Committee and a director of Schroder Asseily, the merchant
bank advising the offset group.
The Cyclar process uses LPG instead of the more expensive naphtha as
feedstock. The successful British marketing of the Cyclar process to Saudi
Arabia follows two years' work by BP at its Grangemouth refinery in
Scotland. UOP is a world-wide supplier of technology to both the refining
and the petrochemical industries.

Algerian security forces yesterday shot dead six Moslem rebels during a

suspected of involvement in several murders, said APS, quoting a statement
by security officials.
More than 400 Moslem militants have been killed by security forces since the
begining of November, according to official statements. Between 10,000 and
20,000 people have been killed in Algeria's political violence since
authorities cancelled in January 1992 a general election which Islamists
were poised to win.

<TEXT>
Angolan Deputy Foreign Minister George Chikoti yesterday urged African
states to send an interim peacekeeping force to his war-weary country until
the United Nations decided to send troops. A shaky ceasefire has been in
force since November 22, two days after the Luanda government and Jonas
Savimbi's Unita rebels signed peace accords in the Zambian capital Lusaka
formally ending the 19-year Angolan civil war.
The UN, which plans to send 7,000 peacekeepers to Angola, has delayed their
deployment until it is sure both sides are serious about peace. It relies on
the war rivals to report ceasefire violations. 'The UN delayed sending them.
They should have been in the country by now. There have been violations of
the ceasefire but we have not been able to give proof because the verifying
force is not there,' Mr Chikotisaid.
The UN has already asked South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe to contribute
troops to the force, but Pretoria's black rulers are wary of getting
involved in Angola given their white predecessors' role on the side of Unita
in the 1980s.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Worldwide increase in pharmaceutical sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong demand in the summer months accelerated sales growth for
pharmaceuticals in several markets, including the US, Japan and France,
according to figures published today. These indicate that spending on
medicines is being maintained, despite efforts by governments to control
healthcare costs.
Drug sales in the world's top nine markets were 5 per cent higher for the
first nine months of 1994 than in the equivalent period in 1993, according
to the latest monthly figures from IMS International, the specialist market
research company.
The US remains the biggest market, with sales to September worth Dollars
36.5bn (Pounds 22.2bn). The US and the UK are the fastest growing markets,
with sales growth of 8 per cent.
The rate of growth picked up in Japan and France, at 2 per cent and 3 per
cent respectively, after sluggish starts to the year. In Japan, prices had
been depressed in April by government action.
Italy, where government reforms had sharply cut the number of drugs
available free on the country's national health system in January, is the
only main drugs market to have contracted this year. Even there, the 6 per
cent decline for the first nine months compares with 8 per cent in the first
eight months.
By therapeutic area, heart drugs continue to show strong growth, up 23 per
cent in Europe to Dollars 7.8bn and 16 per cent higher in North America and
Japan at Dollars 6.4bn and Dollars 2.5bn respectively. The heart drug area
is one where most of the world's top companies are aggressively promoting
rival products in an attempt to win market share.
No single therapeutic sector saw an overall decline in sales compared with
1993, but the pattern of sales in Italy reflects government reforms there.
Sales of hormones fell by 52 per cent to Dollars 117m following a government
policy which included cutting the list of medicines deemed to be
non-essential.
Nervous system drugs, including high-profile anti-depressants such as Prozac
 -made by Eli Lilly the US pharmaceuticals company - were the biggest
growing sector in North America, with sales 17 per cent higher than in the
first three quarters of 1993 at Dollars 6.6bn.
Nervous system drugs remain, by contrast, one of the smallest categories in
Japan, with sales up 5 per cent to Dollars 819m.

FT  12 DEC 94 / World Bank bid to aid Rwanda farming

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank has set up an initiative called Seeds of Hope, to try to
restore agriculture in war-torn Rwanda and prevent large numbers of people
dying from starvation.
The Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.4m) programme represents only the third time the
bank's farming arm has had to re-stock a country's seed banks from scratch.
It previously contributed seeds to Vietnam and Cambodia.
The bank's consultative group on international agricultural research has
prepared seeds from its laboratories to replenish Rwanda's farming base.
These are being sent to nurseries in neighbouring countries - such as
Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Zaire and Kenya - where large volumes of seeds
can be grown and taken overland to Rwandan farmers.
The bank's agriculture consultative group has the largest collection in the
world of genetic material from crops in the developing countries. It uses
these seeds for breeding improved varieties, but they are also available in
case of disaster.
'It's not the kind of programme we want to be doing because it is associated
with a disaster, but it shows that agricultural research can make an
important contribution in a crisis,' said Mr Ismail Serageldin, chairman of
the bank's agriculture consultative group.
Rwanda was virtually self-sufficient in food before the civil war, with 91
per cent of its population involved in farming. But 'granaries have been
looted and burned, and seeds have been eaten by starving people throughout
the country,' Mr Serageldin said. This year's unrest has led to a loss of 60
per cent of the country's harvest of cereals and pulse crops, and to the
loss of 30 per cent of plantains (large bananas).
Mr Serageldin reckons the destruction has been so great that many important
local varieties of seeds have been wiped out. If the Rwandan farmers have no
seeds to plant next year, they will face growing dependence on outside food
aid.
Rwandan farmers also need to be provided with seeds they had before which
are suited to their soil and climate and which resist local pests and plant
diseases. The consultative group will supply seeds for growing beans,
sorghum, maize and root and tuber crops such as potato, sweet potato and
cassava.
Mr Serageldin believes that, if the seeds can be distributed to farmers in
time for the three growing seasons next year, Rwanda's farm production can
be set back on its feet. But after that it will take two to three years to
rebuild the country's agricultural research capacity and outreach system.
The World Bank now depends on the United Nations and volunteer groups to
distribute the seeds within Rwanda as it does not have the capacity to
transport them to farmers.

FT  12 DEC 94 / S Korean groups can visit north

South Korea has granted permission for six domestic companies to send
officials to North Korea to discuss possible investments. The South Korean
companies include the conglomerates Samsung, Hyundai, Lucky-Goldstar and
Ssangyong, and two smaller concerns, Yongsin Trading and Taedong Chemical.
Seoul approved their applications to travel to North Korea in spite of
Pyongyang's refusal to open direct negotiations with South Korea on economic
co-operation. North Korea, however, is encouraging South Korean companies to
invest on a private basis.
However the corporate executives may not be allowed to visit North Korea
until next year since Pyongyang decided last week to deny entry to all
foreigners until the end of the month.
The only apparent exception to the ban is the visit by US senators Mr Frank
Murkowski and Mr Paul Simon, who arrived in Pyongyang yesterday abroad a US
military aircraft in the first such flight to North Korea in 40 years.
The two senators will discuss the improvement in relations between the US
and North Korea and the implementation of the recent bilateral accord to
resolve the North Korean nuclear dispute. The US and North Korea on Friday
agreed to details on establishing low-level diplomatic offices in each
other's capital as part of the recent nuclear agreement.
The diplomatic offices will not be opened, however, until progress is
achieved on several other issues, including North Korea's acceptance of
South Korean light-water reactors to replace its more dangerous graphite
reactors.
Questions also remain over the disposal of North Korea's spent nuclear fuel
rods, which contain weapons-grade plutonium. In addition, South Korea is
demanding that North Korea resume talks with Seoul before it is allowed to
establish diplomatic ties with the US.
It is uncertain why North Korea has banned entry of foreigners, but some
believe it may be related to the possible formal assumption of power by Mr
Kim Jong-il later this month. The travel ban may also reflect disagreements
within the North Korean hierarchy over the extent and pace of opening the
country to foreign investment, according to Mr Song Young-dae, vice minister
for national unification in Seoul.
The military and the committee for the peaceful unification of the
fatherland, the North Korean agency in charge of inter-Korean relations, are
believed to oppose proposals by the government's administration council to
promote foreign investment to solve economic problems.
The internal debate may have delayed the assumption of power by Mr Kim, who
is trying to reduce the influence of the hardliners by removing them from
key positions, Mr Song said.
But this has proved to be a difficult task. Mr Kim may not become
general-secretary of the ruling Korean Workers' party and president until
the reorganisation of the power structure is completed.
Workers from three South Korean motor vehicle companies - Daewoo, Sssangyong
and Asia Motors - have ended their strike protesting against the
government's decision to allow Samsung to produce cars.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Tokyo and Seoul drop rivalry in spirit of business
partnership: Michiyo Nakamoto and John Burton on a turning point in
relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO and JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by Japan's Mitsubishi Motors to buy steel sheet from Korea's
Pohang Iron and Steel on a long-term basis marks a turning point in the
countries' post-war industrial relations.
From the Japanese perspective, last week's contract signals a growing
willingness to set aside national prejudices and to recognise its
neighbour's industrial competitiveness. For the Korean steel industry, it
offers a sweet victory over its most formidable rivals and a strong vote of
confidence from the Japanese motor industry.
Japanese and Korean business relations have long been clouded by intense
rivalry, mutual suspicion and a bitter antagonism that can be traced back
centuries. But changes in the quality of Korean products and the yen's
appreciation, forcing Japanese companies to diversify their sources, have
prompted rivals to become partners.
The older generation of businessmen on both sides of the Sea of Japan often
find it difficult to overcome their deeply ingrained prejudices about the
other. 'Generally, Japanese tend to look down on Koreans,' concedes one
Japanese businessman who works for a major manufacturer. 'Our chairman used
to say there are countries that are likeable and those that are not,' he
says.
'It's a very complex and tangled relationship,' observes a foreign
businessman who works in a leading Japanese electronics company. 'The
general feeling among Japanese businessmen is that you can't work with the
Koreans.'
The Japanese are aware of the bitterness Koreans still feel about the
sufferings inflicted by Japanese soldiers during the second world war.
Korean hostility towards Japanese businesses in the 1960s and 1970s has also
left a scar on Japan's corporate memory.
Cultural differences also play a part. Japanese social etiquette does not
sit easily with the straightforward approach of many Koreans, which many
Japanese consider unduly aggressive .
But the Japanese are also aware that the Koreans are similar in their work
ethic, in their ability to work effectively in groups and their loyalty. The
combination of such strong differences and similarities, and a deep
familiarity with each other's strengths and weaknesses, has added to the
complex feelings between the neighbours.
'The Koreans know the Japanese very, very well and know what irks them, and
that is one of the reasons the Japanese tend to be wary of doing business
with them,' said one foreign businessman in Tokyo.
That fear is supported by the Japanese recognition of the potential threat
Korean industry poses to Japanese industry. Korea has maintained a constant
trade deficit with Japan since diplomatic relations were established in 1965
and the gap is expected to grow to almost Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.3bn) this
year. This reflects Korea's heavy dependence on Japanese capital goods,
including machinery and components. Korea has tried to reduce the deficit by
improving its domestic subcontracting network, and increasing spending on
product research and development.
Seoul has also lobbied Japan to open its markets to Korean imports and
encourage Japanese component manufacturers to establish production
facilities in Korea. But efforts to attract new investment have met with
little success so far. Japanese companies are afraid that increased
industrial investments will strengthen Korea's competitiveness.
On the other hand, Korean fears about Japanese economic dominance were
reflected in the recent controversy over Samsung's entry into the car
industry with the technical help of Nissan of Japan. Critics of the deal
said Samsung's co-operation with Nissan would increase car imports from
Japan and hinder efforts to promote technological independence in the Korean
car industry, which has been dependent on Japanese technology.
Samsung won government approval for the project only after it promised to
increase the local content of its cars from between 70 and 80 per cent in
1998, when manufacturing begins, to 98 per cent by 2003.
Korea banned imports of most Japanese consumer products in the 1970s. Seoul
has agreed to halve by 1997 the number of Japanese products on the 'import
diversification' list which now excludes 250 items.
Executives from the Korean electronics and car industries acknowledge that
the quality and technology of their products often lag behind that of their
Japanese rivals although the gap is narrowing in some fields. In
semiconductors, Korea has overtaken Japan as the leading maker of current
generation 4-megabit dynamic random access memory chips. Japanese officials
are quick to point out that these chips make up only a small part of the
semiconductor market and that Japanese makers are three to five years ahead
in advanced semiconductor technologies.
Nevertheless, 'there is a feeling that the Koreans are doing very well in
D-Rams and that they are very aggressive and formidable competitors,' says
an official at a leading Japanese semiconductor maker.
The yen's sharp appreciation and the structural changes facing Japanese
industry are providing strong incentives for Japanese companies to overcome
their reluctance to rely on Korea.
Electronics companies, for example, are also beginning to recognise that
teaming up with Korean competitors can help them succeed. NEC has agreed to
share information with Samsung on developments each makes on future
generation D-Rams.
The change in generations is also playing a part, as younger Japanese and
Koreans with few memories of the war and similar western views, rise to
managerial positions.
As one mid-level Japanese businessman at a leading company says: 'If there
is a good partner, Korean or otherwise, we would not miss an opportunity to
do business with them.'

FT  12 DEC 94 / Japan's new ship charts a vague course: First political
party in 40 years is big on pzazz and short on ideas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's biggest new political party in nearly four decades, the New Frontier
party, adopted a nautical identity for its launch at the port city of
Yokohama on Saturday, but charted only a vague course.
Thousands of curious party supporters filed into the convention hall to face
a cardboard sail suspended above the podium. They were handed canvas pouches
marked 'my bag, my party' and imprinted with an eight-spoked ship's wheel. A
stirring inaugural poem spoke of fixing Japan's broken compass and all
rowing together. Later, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, who masterminded the party's
creation, pledged to do his best at the start of this long voyage.
The NFP has promised to shake up the old political system, dominated by
party factions, and to make parties more responsive to voters' aspirations.
Yet its audience was left with a suspicion that the NFP was straining to
define newness.
The NFP provides the first serious opposition to the conservative Liberal
Democratic party, which has governed Japan for all but one of the past 39
years. The new party, the result of the merger of nine small opposition
parties, also simplifies Japan's previously fragmented opposition politics.
But what the NFP really stands for is unlikely to make waves among voters.
The NFP's policy document promises 'ceaseless reform and responsible
politics, aimed at bringing about a Japan that is free and wide open to the
world'. Other policies include working for world peace, a 'lively welfare
society', better education and a party in which all citizens can
participate.
This blandness may be unavoidable, given the need to bring on board all
members of a heterogeneous crew, from religious right, through mild
conservative, to social democrat. They need to unite to survive a new
electoral system which takes effect on December 25 and favours large,
well-organised parties over small ones. So policy is, for the time being,
secondary. Yet the platform confirms that the NFP will find it hard to
differentiate itself from the ruling LDP.
Mr Kazuo Shii, secretary general of the Japan Communist party, the only
opposition group not to have joined the NFP crew, argued yesterday that the
new party merely confirmed the division of the LDP over the past 18 months
into two blocks. One is the NFP - former LDP members supported by Buddhists;
the second is the existing LDP, kept in power by the Socialist party.
Certainly, the new party's leadership will be familiar to followers of
old-style politics. Mr Toshiki Kaifu, NFP president, and Mr Ozawa, his
number two, have worked together as LDP prime minister and secretary general
respectively, when they helped the LDP to victory in the 1990 general
election. Over the weekend, Mr Kaifu showed no rush to oust his former LDP
colleagues, pledging to work with the government, so long as it 'moves
towards the creation of a good society.'
The other challenge facing Mr Kaifu is to assert his own leadership. He used
to be taunted by the press as LDP prime minister for being a 'remote
control' leader, allegedly directed by Mr Noboru Takeshita, then in charge
of the LDP's strongest faction.
In one of his first joint television interviews with Mr Ozawa since becoming
NFP leader, Mr Kaifu had to tick off the interviewer for addressing
questions first to Mr Ozawa. The big question now is whether Mr Kaifu will
be able to assert himself and so lend the NFP a vote-winning identity.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Beijing to control HK lawmaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong's laws will be made by a Beijing-appointed legislature for at
least a year after the colony's sovereignty passes to China in mid-1997
under a decision taken by the preliminary working committee (PWC), a
high-level group of mainland officials and Hong Kong personalities who
advise Beijing on practical issues concerning the transfer.
This and other PWC decisions on Hong Kong's legal system and rights of abode
are likely to raise concern in Hong Kong and London that China will reverse
the democratic gains of the recent past. Next September Hong Kong will hold
its first fully democratic polls, but those elected seem certain to be
ejected the day China resumes sovereignty.
The PWC has become the forum for forward-looking discussion and decisions
affecting Hong Kong's future without any British input.
It is headed by Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, who called upon
Britain to co-operate with China on Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty. He
noted that Britain had expressed a wish to co-operate and had 'done a little
bit' in that direction, but said the UK should lift the prohibition on
formal contacts between the PWC and Hong Kong government officials.
The deliberations of the PWC came as British and Chinese officials were
preparing to meet in London today for the 31st session of the Joint Liaison
Group (JLG). When set up in 1985 the JLG was meant to deal with Hong Kong's
transfer to China, but since 1989 has achieved little.
Britain hopes China will respond to a draft bill concerning the
establishment of Hong Kong's court of final appeal, which will replace the
Privy Council when sovereignty changes hands.
The PWC sent out mixed signals on China's intentions towards the court. Mr
Lu said that Beijing stood by a 1991 Anglo-Chinese agreement on its
establishment and that China would welcome the British setting it up before
the handover. However, he included enough jibes and asides to raise doubts
whether China would give its blessing to a court established under British
rule.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Rao poll losses may slow Indian reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India's ruling Congress (I) party has suffered serious defeats in a series
of state elections, which raised fears of a slowing of government pro-market
reforms.
The Congress party in Delhi tried to deflect attacks on Mr PV Narasimha Rao,
the prime minister, by arguing that the polls had turned mainly on local
issues and were not a rejection of the national government or its policies.
Privately, Congress MPs argued that the rural poor had deserted the party in
great numbers because Mr Rao's reforms included cuts in subsidies and public
spending.
When votes were counted this weekend in the four states which held polls
over the past six weeks, Congress suffered its biggest losses ever in the
two large southern states of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, and in the
mountain state of Sikkim. In Goa, Congress also lost its majority but was
trying to form a minority administration.
The opposition called for an early general election, which was rejected by
the government, but the results could undermine Mr Rao's authority and slow
the pro-market economic reforms he has pursued in the past three years.
Mr M J Akbar, editor of the Asian Age newspaper, wrote: 'This is the first
time that the Congress has lost an election because the people believed that
the party's economic policies were targeted against the poor.'
With polls scheduled in another four states early next year and a general
election due by mid-1996, Congress politicians are likely to put great
pressure on Mr Rao and Mr Manmohan Singh, his finance minister, to loosen
the purse strings.
Business leaders said at the weekend that the economic reforms, including
measures to promote foreign trade and investment, were irreversible. But
there was less certainty that the government would be able to keep public
spending under tight control.
The party's worst result was in Mr Rao's home state of Andhra Pradesh where
Congress won only 25 seats in a 292-member assembly. The winner was Mr N T
Rama Rao, a former film star, whose Telugu Desam party took 224 seats. In
Karnataka, victory went to the the left-of-centre Janata Dal.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's new alliance of opposition parties, inaugurated over the weekend,
plans to form a shadow cabinet to prepare to take power from the ruling
Liberal Democratic party, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo.
Mr Toshiki Kaifu, president of the New Frontier party, Japan's second
largest political group, said he planned to work with the government
coalition as long as it worked for the creation of a 'good society.' But he
would propose a parliamentary vote of no confidence if the coalition
deviated from that path.
The NFP, the result of the merger of Japan's nine main opposition groups, is
the first opposition party in recent history to create a shadow cabinet.
This could increase pressure on the government by offering voters a credible
alternative administration. The new party, Japan's second largest, has 214
seats in the upper and lower houses of parliament. The LDP has 295.
However, any concrete policy challenge to the government is likely to be
limited because the NFP's policy platform is almost indistinguishable from
that of the administration.
The new party would pave the way for 'an ideal nation', said Mr Kaifu. His
party's policies received a lukewarm reception from the few non-LDP groups
to have survived recent political upheavals.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Summit of the Americas: Chile to move soon towards Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MIAMI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The first steps towards Chilean accession to the North American Free Trade
Agreement are expected to be made as soon as next week.
The Nafta members - the US, Canada and Mexico - will discuss negotiating
procedures and begin to develop entrance criteria, which will apply to Chile
and subsequent prospective members. The criteria are expected to include
macro-economic performance, adherence to multilateral trade rules, the
openness of the economy, intellectual property and investment protection.
Four-way preliminary talks are expected to begin as early as January, with
formal negotiations after a ministerial meeting to be held no later than
May. Five special committees will be set up to examine issues such as market
access measures, including rules of origin, subsidies and anti-dumping
rules, agriculture and dispute settlement.
The US said no time-frame had been set for concluding negotiations, but
Chile's finance minister, Mr Eduardo Aninat, said he hoped the accession
agreement could be signed within 14-15 months of the January start to talks.
'We think we meet virtually all the requirements to become a Nafta member,'
he said.
The US administration will start working with Congress 'early next year' to
seek 'fast track' negotiating powers. This would only be needed, it said, to
conclude the negotiations, not to begin them.
Negotiations with Chile are unlikely to provoke as much domestic opposition
as did the talks with Mexico. The Chilean economy is less than a hundredth
of that of the US, its southern hemisphere harvests do not clash so much
with those of US agricultural producers, and there are no border issues to
resolve.
Chile is also seeking associate status with Mercosur, the customs union of
Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. Full membership of a separate
customs union is incompatible with Nafta membership, though a free trade
arrangement by Chile and Mercosur is possible. Mr Aninat expressed optimism
that progress could also be made in integration with Mercosur.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Summit of the Americas: Pledging a market partnership -
Stephen Fidler and George Graham sum up a summit of unequals that came good
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a gathering that was being dismissed a few weeks ago as little more than
a grand photo-opportunity, the summit of the 34 elected leaders of the
Americas delivered more of substance than almost anyone had expected.
Its commitments to begin work next month towards negotiating a Free Trade
Area of the Americas, to make substantial progress towards that end by the
turn of the century and to complete negotiations by 2005, were all
unexpected a few weeks ago. The separate announcement that talks would begin
right away to bring Chile into the North American Free Trade Agreement of
the US, Canada and Mexico added substance to the promises.
The host, President Bill Clinton, described a open free trade area that
'will stretch from Alaska to Argentina' as the 'key building block in our
creation of a partnership for prosperity.' If current trends continued, he
said, 'this hemisphere will be the world's largest market  - more than 850m
consumers buying Dollars 13 trillion of goods and services.'
Such high-flown ambitions are customary summit fare. When the presidents of
the Americas last met, in 1967 at Punta del Este in Uruguay, they resolved
to 'create progressively, beginning in 1970, the Latin American Common
Market' which would be 'substantially in operation in 15 years'. Nothing
came of that.
However, the differences between then and now are substantial, not only
because the US is now pledging itself as part of the proposed free trade
zone, rather than as a supportive onlooker in 1967.
Mr Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American Development Bank, was a
young diplomat 27 years ago. He has observed both meetings and says the
difference is profound. Washington, the Uruguayan says, has realised the
potential in its own hemisphere; Latin American states have ousted their
military leaders and have become less hostile to the US and more
outward-looking in economic policy.
Yet these changes do not explain the difference between the summit's outcome
and its dim prospects a few weeks ago. Part of the explanation may lie in
what seems to have been a sincere US wish not to impose an agenda, which
meant that discussions only gelled as the summit deadline approached.
Participants in the pre-summit deliberations suggest that three other
factors were influential: the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec)
forum, the European Union, and the Congressional elections in the US last
month.
US officials say that the decision, by Apec leaders in Jakarta last month,
on the establishment of a Pacific free trade zone, with two target dates of
2010 and 2020, helped to goad larger Latin American countries into accepting
a deadline in their region.
'The mood began to shift at the first meeting after the Apec summit,' a
senior Clinton administration official said.
Furthermore, just two weeks ago, the EU announced its intention to negotiate
a free trade accord with Mercosur, the trade pact which groups Brazil,
Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, and is due to become a customs union at the
start of next year. One sherpa preparing the Miami summit declaration said
that this had galvanised the preliminary negotiations.
But the most significant change may have come via US voting booths. First,
without Congressional ratification of the Uruguay Round of trade talks, not
obtained until 10 days ago, any trade pledges by the US would have looked
hollow. Second, because of Republican party victories in the mid-term
elections last month, the administration may find it easier, after next
month, to win Congressional agreement to extend Nafta to Chile than if the
legislature were still full of fellow Democrats, many of them suspicious of
free trade.
Many issues, of course, remain to be resolved before the summit trade
pledges become a reality. Mr Gert Rosenthal, head of the UN Economic
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, says the 2005 deadline has
little practical effect but the pledge to start talks immediately 'is what
is important.'
In contrast to Apec's vague promises, the talks in the Americas should
involve governments in practical trade discussions at a relatively early
stage and, say officials, keep integration moving forward. 'What we don't
want is to lose momentum,' said the US trade representative, Mr Mickey
Kantor.
Even so, many who have agreed to the date also see it as an ambitious,
perhaps unrealistic, target. It will be hard, for example, to make existing
Latin American trade zones - some of them customs unions with common
external tariffs - compatible with Nafta, although the summit pledged
efforts to reduce the inconsistencies among the various groupings.
Most problematic will be the single-product economies of the Caribbean. Mr
Roy MacLaren, Canada's trade minister, said that, while the small states of
central America want to move quickly into Nafta, 'I sense that some of the
small countries of the Caribbean will have the most difficulty meeting the
timetable,' the minister added.
There is also a likely clash over the Nafta side agreements on environmental
protection and workers' rights. Some Latin Americans are bound to see them
as an excessive invasion of sovereignty, even though there is little
evidence that they have had much practical impact within Nafta.
The US administration fought hard to win the inclusion of labour and
environmental language in the trade clauses of the Miami declaration, and
administration officials say there can be no question of lower standards in
the future free trade area.
'Nafta becomes a benchmark and we build from there. Clearly everyone
understands that Nafta is the floor, in all respects', including labour and
environment, a senior administration official said.
However, while there is consensus among the three Nafta governments that the
main agreement should not be reopened, there are differences about the
importance of the side accords.
Some Republican congressmen have already indicated they back extending the
free trade zone to Chile, but want the side accords dropped.
The administration will seek from Congress, next spring, 'fast track'
negotiating authority to let it negotiate a trade pact without having
Congress tinker with the details later. Before then, the administration must
decide how broad a fast track authority to propose: whether to limit it to
Chile's accession to Nafta, and whether to include the labour and
environmental side agreements.
The worry for Latin America is that its rapprochement with the US has been
forged with a weak administration in Washington. If Mr Clinton cannot win
fast track for Chile, his ability to fulfil the US side of the hemispheric
free-trade agenda will be severely, if not fatally, weakened. Then the
central American president, who said on Saturday that the Miami meeting had
'broken 27 years of solitude', will be forced to eat his words.

Congressman Robert Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat and a promoter of the
Cuban Democracy Act which tightened the US embargo against Cuba in 1992, is
promising legislation in Congress next year to attack businesses in other
countries which work with Cuba.
He said he would introduce a bill requiring the US government to deny visas
to directors of companies which work with 'stolen US property' in Cuba. This
would target particularly UK, Spanish and Mexican businesses that have
bought expropriated assets in Cuban industries, such as cement and oil.

<TEXT>
The US agreed this weekend to start technical talks with Caribbean countries
to try to resolve their dispute over bananas, writes George Graham.
Although the US last week smoothed the path of the Miami summit, by agreeing
to drop its opposition to the European Union's request for a Gatt waiver for
its preferential regime for banana imports from the Caribbean, Mr Mickey
Kantor, the US trade representative, said he would continue an investigation
of the EU banana regime under the US Section 301 rules.
'Our problem is with the discriminatory practices of the European Union, not
with the benefits Caribbean countries have,' Mr Kantor said.
Mr Owen Arthur, the new prime minister of Barbados, said the banana issue
would be 'a clear test' of whether it would be possible for large and small
countries to co-exist in the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas which
has emerged from the summit.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Summit of the Americas: A promise to advance in prosperity
and democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a five-page declaration of principles, the 34 leaders at the Summit of
the Americas in Miami yesterday committed themselves 'to advance the
prosperity, democratic values and institutions, and security of our
hemisphere'.
The declaration of principles promises:
'To preserve and strengthen the community of democracies of the Americas',
by strengthening the Organisation of American States, making government more
transparent and accountable, attacking corruption and fighting organised
crime, drug trafficking and terrorism.
'To promote prosperity through economic integration and free trade', by
beginning immediately 'to construct the 'Free Trade Area of the Americas'
(FTAA), in which barriers to trade and investment will be progressively
eliminated'. Negotiations are to be completed no later than the end of 2005,
but 'concrete progress' is to be made by the century's end. Mechanisms are
to be created to promote investment in the hemisphere, as well as to develop
telecommunications, transport and energy links.
'To eradicate poverty and discrimination in our hemisphere' by improving
access to education and health care, helping indigenous peoples and
strengthening the role of women in political, social and economic life. It
is 'politically intolerable and morally unacceptable that some segments of
our populations are marginalised and do not share fully in the benefits of
growth.'
'To guarantee sustainable development and conserve our natural environment
for future generations' through partnerships to control pollution, protect
ecosystems and encourage sustainable use of biological and energy resources.
The summit also agreed a 23-point plan of action to follow up their
declarations. The plan includes specific and less-specific promises of
action, including:
More support for OAS efforts to promote democracy.
Guaranteed protection for the human rights of migrant workers.
A review of the regulatory framework to facilitate non-governmental
organisations' operations and fund-raising.
Establishing conflict of interest standards for public employees - with
stiff penalties for abuses - and hemispheric arrangements to prosecute or
extradite corrupt officials.
Laws to permit the freezing and forfeiture of proceeds of money laundering.
Striving for comprehensive trade agreements on tariff and non-tariff
barriers to trade, agriculture, subsidies, investment, intellectual property
rights, rules of origin, anti-dumping duties, sanitary standards, dispute
resolution and competition policy.
Guaranteed universal access to quality primary education, with a goal of 100
per cent of the population completing primary school and at least 75 per
cent enrolment in secondary school by 2010.
National plans for a basic package of health services including care for
children and mothers, family planning, immunisation and Aids prevention.
A volunteer corps of people in 'white helmets' to tackle natural disasters,
development needs and emergencies, in their own countries and, at the
request of the UN, abroad.
National plans to phase out lead in petrol.
The action plan calls on the OAS and the Inter-American Development Bank to
take the lead in following up the summit's decisions, and lays out a
programme of meetings of officials and ministers, including meetings of
trade ministers in June 1995 and March 1996 to work on the FTAA. Other
scheduled meetings will cover sustainable energy use, measures to build
confidence in democracy and science and technology in 1995, and energy
industries and sustainable development in 1996.

The Honduran government has signed a letter of intent with the International
Monetary Fund which will open access to Dollars 650m (Pounds 411m) in loans
from Washington-based lending institutions. The agreement follows approval
in October by the US Congress of tax reforms intended to reduce the Honduran
fiscal deficit from 11.2 per cent of GDP to 7 per cent this year, and to 4.5
per cent in 1995. The Honduran economy is expected to contract by 1.5 per
cent this year after suffering drought, energy shortages, and a drop in the
price of bananas, its main export. Without the IMF accord, the government
would have fallen behind with foreign debt obligations.

Three moments in history define the Chechen relationship to Russia: its
decades of struggle against Russian expansion in the Caucasus, culminating
in forced submission in the 1860s; the Soviet repressions of the 1920s,
reaching an apogee in 1943-1944 when the Chechens, with the Karachai, Ingush
and the Balkar peoples, were deported (and many killed) for alleged
collaboration with the Nazi invasion of the Caucasus; and the contemporary
period, when under the leadership of General Dzhokar Dudayev in November
1991, the republic declared independence from Russia.
The first gives a foundation of national pride; the second a pervasive
national grievance; the third, a basis for national independence which,
though compromised by the arbitrary and allegedly corrupt rule of General
Dudayev, appears nonetheless strongly supported by Chechnya's 1m people.
More than any other of the 'small peoples' of Russia, the Chechens have
retained warrior traditions and have invested heavily in their own
institutions - including the Sunni Moslem faith. Reviled by Russians,
especially Muscovites, as criminals, they are also given a wide berth for
their reputed ruthlessness. President Boris Yeltsin is choosing to swat a
formidable fly.
General Dudayev's declaration of independence at the head of a coalition of
nationalist forces was followed by armed Russian intervention. The Russian
troops got little further than the airport and exchanged only sporadic fire
before being withdrawn when the Russian supreme soviet refused to ratify
their involvement.
Since then, the Dudayev regime has become a centre of anti-Russian sentiment
in the North Caucasian region. He gave sanctuary to the deposed president of
Georgia, the late Zviad Gamsakhurdia, and assisted his abortive effort to
re-establish his presidency last year. He strongly backed the Confederation
of Mountain Peoples, which supported the successful efforts of Abkhazia to
break away from Georgia. Within his borders, the 300,000 Russian speakers
dwindled to an estimated 100,000.
Internal opposition became evident in spring of 1993, when an impeachment
motion was put to the parliament - after which Gen Dudayev dissolved it,
quelling a minor armed uprising. Several opposition groups were formed, the
strongest of which gathered round Mr Umar Avturkhanov, who operates from his
home base in the town of Znamenskoye, 40km from Grozny. Mr Dodu Zavgayev,
leader of the Chechen supreme soviet abolished by Gen Dudayev in 1991, is
now a member of Mr Yeltsin's administration and also a focus of opposition,
as is Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the most famous Chechen, former leader of the
Russian supreme soviet and once the Russian president's bitterest enemy.
The opposition forces, with Russian backing, attacked Grozny two weeks ago:
their tanks and troops reached the centre of the capital, but were halted
and thrown back, leaving 21 Russians as prisoners. The prisoners' story -
that they had been recruited from the Kantemirov division by the Federal
Intelligence Service (the successor to the KGB) to act as 'advisers' to the
opposition - inflamed Russian liberal opinion against the Russian
administration's attempts to achieve the downfall of Gen Dudayev by stealth.
The failure of the opposition attack was followed by a harsh decree from Mr
Yeltsin, demanding what amounted to a surrender by Gen Dudayev. Russian
troops poured into bases around the Chechen border.
The past week has been one of wildly differing signals: a strengthening of
the troops and official declarations that constitutional order must be
restored in Chechnya, mixed with a bizarre negotiation between Gen Dudayev
and the Russian defence minister General Pavel Grachev last week, at which
the two were seen to be on friendly terms and the latter quoted as saying
only peaceful means would be used to settle the conflict.
That last seems to have been a feint, either unconscious or deliberate. The
troops are committed. A fourth critical moment in Chechnya's history opens.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Bonn group's tiller loses its steady hand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The announcement that Mr Helmut Ricke, chief executive of Deutsche Telekom,
was to step down two years early came as a surprise for employees of the
German state-owned monopoly. His steady style had been reassuring as the
company prepared for transition from a leviathan, employing 230,000 people,
to an agile, private telecoms operator.
His departure, made public last Friday, is not likely immediately to affect
the planned privatisation but his knowledge of the Bonn-based company and
his part in its restructuring will be sorely missed. 'He leaves behind a
mess in which only he knew his way around,' one observer remarked.
There had been complaints about his indecisiveness and suggestions he lacked
the vision to run one of the world's largest telecoms operators. But Mr
Ricke, who had taken over the helm of the company in 1990, was supposed to
have stayed until the end of 1996 to tie up the loose ends after Deutsche
Telekom becomes a joint stock company - in three weeks' time - and oversee
the partial privatisation through a DM15bn (Pounds 6.1bn) equity issue, one
of the largest in the world. However, at the beginning of December Mr Ricke
told Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the post minister, that he wanted to leave and the
latter did not try to persuade him to stay.
Mr Wilhelm Pallmann, a fellow board member, will take over temporarily when
Mr Ricke leaves at the beginning of January. Mr Pallmann managed Deutsche
Telekom's expansion into former East Germany, a venture regarded as
successful, but he is not expected to stay long, if only because he is
already 62.
That leaves the company searching for a new chief executive. Mr Joachim
Kroske, the finance director, and Mr Gerd Tenzer, who runs the company's
networks, are the favourites on the inside. However, Mr Ricke was brought in
from outside and it seems equally likely that the new chief will come from
private industry.
The decision to leave came after a period when little had been going right
for Deutsche Telekom. The last straw for Mr Ricke was when he discovered
that the new 10-man supervisory board included five political appointees.
But other things have gone wrong. The joint venture with France Telecom,
embarked upon last year and regarded as the cornerstone of Mr Ricke's drive
to internationalise the company, has not yet been approved by the European
Commission and there are signs that it may be blocked because Europe's two
largest operators would have a dominant position.
There are also fears about the joint venture with Sprint, the US
long-distance carrier with which Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom signed
a memorandum of understanding earlier this year. The two sides were supposed
to have completed initial negotiations recently but the deadline has been
extended into early next year, insiders say, suggesting agreement may be
impossible.
Mr Ricke has also been fighting to control the damage from press reports
alleging that thousands of Deutsche Telekom employees were working with
organised criminals and pocketing the money from overseas phone calls.
But Mr Ricke's departure also presents Deutsche Telekom with new
opportunities. Several other members of the nine-man management board are
due to retire or leave early next year, giving Mr Botsch a chance to make an
almost clean sweep.
Mr Botsch is a member of the Christian Social Union - the Bavarian sister
party of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union - which
preaches the gospel of privatisation louder than any other party in Germany.
He may give Deutsche Telekom a stronger dose of that gospel.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Moscow protests greet Chechnya invasion: As Russian tanks
roll into the breakaway republic, democrats fear provocation of another
Afghanistan

<TEXT>
'There is no more important task for Russia's democrats,' wrote Russia's
best known liberal columnist in the Izvestiya newspaper last week, 'than to
ensure that a decision to use military force in Chechnya is not made.'
Mr Otto Latsis drew a parallel with the British struggle against IRA
terrorism in Northern Ireland. But the parallel went only so far. 'A
centuries' old British democracy can survive such a war,' he wrote; 'the
young Russian democracy would not.'
The democrats have failed in the task he described and their disappointment
 -and not only theirs - will dominate the Russian political scene in the
coming weeks. Last night, in the bitter cold, several hundred people
gathered in Pushkin Square - the traditional place of protest in the Soviet
period - to condemn the invasion. Chechen representatives gave passionate
speeches demanding that Russia withdraw its troops, as groups of women wept
and passers-by jeered.
'At the time of the fall of the Soviet Union, the absolute majority of the
Chechen people supported our independence from Russia,' said one Chechen
speaker. 'This action is a return to the terrible times in the relations
between our peoples. The integration of the Chechen people into Russia
should be under a treaty, not by force.'
Russians, too, protested against the use of force. Under a banner
proclaiming 'An end to democracy? No to a second Afghanistan,' one Russian
protester said: 'If we should have learned anything in this country it is
that you cannot solve those problems by military means.'
Is the political class of this mind? Yes and no. At a closed session last
Friday, the Duma, the lower house of parliament, debated the issue with -
from the reports - more heat than light.
Deputies from all sides condemned the government but the condemnation was
centred on the bungling of a covert operation to topple Chechen leader
General Dzhokar Dudayev two weeks ago, rather than on matters of principle.
The revelation by the Russian prisoners taken during that operation that the
Federal Intelligence Service had recruited them to spearhead the 'uprising
by the Chechen opposition' has been grist to many mills, as parties who
dislike the present administration find an issue which, many say, could
destroy President Boris Yeltsin.
Curiously, the one leading politician to say clearly that the troops should
be sent in is a liberal - Mr Boris Fyodorov, the leader of the Liberal
Democratic Union (not to be confused with Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal
Democratic party). Mr Fyodorov said at the weekend: 'Chechnya is part of
Russia. There are bandit groups operating on its territory. It persists in
an unlawful regime. Of course the administration must act. Only why has it
taken so long?'
Others would not disagree with that, but would add that the action now
courts a much wider war than merely a limited military operation in
Chechnya.
The instability of the Caucasus, the common grudge of many in the region
that they were deported (and murdered) by Soviet troops during the war and
their common Moslem religion, could draw them together, overcome their
notoriously bitter and perpetual feuding and present them as a united front
against Russia - as they were, for a time, in the mid 19th century.
The parliamentary debates have shown, too, that the politicians as a whole
are more concerned to destabilise the Yeltsin government and administration
than to offer an alternative strategy for the solution of the Chechnya
problem - beyond appealing to 'more negotiations' and 'a peaceful way'.
The other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States are likely to
keep well clear: only Mr Vafa Guluzade, the foreign policy aide to President
Aliev of Azerbaijan, also a Moslem, Caucasian state, commented: 'It's very
sad: Russia many times said it would avoid bloodshed.' Their interests are
in keeping friendly with Russia: they will make neutral noises as long as
they can.
Although Mr Yeltsin's order signed on Friday made possible yesterday's
intervention, the president is as usual inscrutable in this matter; indeed,
he was in hospital yesterday awaiting what was described as a minor
operation. The democrats say they believe he has been taken over by the
militarists but his aims so far seem limited to forcing Gen Dudayev to
negotiate in front of a cannon.
