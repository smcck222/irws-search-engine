FT  12 DEC 94 / Delors: I'm no Socialist miracle worker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Without their acclaimed emperor, the French Socialist party has few clothes.
Mr Jacques Delors' dramatic decision to end weeks of mounting suspense by
announcing on prime-time television last night that he would not be their
candidate for the presidency has left the Socialists looking pretty naked.
Before last night's announcement, some in the party who had predicted the
European Commission president's answer would be no were already regretting
that he felt compelled to give it so soon. One Socialist MP had appealed to
Mr Delors not to accelerate the timetable of his answer so as 'not to
shorten the suffering of the right'.
But while the right may have last night breathed a collective sigh of relief
at seeing the front-runner in the opinion polls rule himself out of the race
for the Elysee, it knows it now faces a different kind of suffering - that
of increased civil war between rival conservatives for a prize that looks to
be within each one's grasp.
Mr Delors would himself have clearly liked to postpone announcing his
decision. Even last night, he insisted on talking about the European Union's
just-concluded Essen summit for 40 minutes before answering no to the only
question his listeners were interested in. He went on to explain that, in
addition to the personal and family reasons for wanting a break after 10
years running the Commission, he was 'no miracle doctor'. Even if he managed
to somehow levitate into the Elysee, he could not carry Socialist fortunes
high enough with him to win a leftwing majority in new parliamentary
elections.
Some leading Socialists last night put a brave face on their misfortune. Ms
Segolene Royal, a former environment minister, claimed that Mr Delors'
standing in the polls - ahead of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur as well as
Mr Jacques Chirac, mayor of Paris - 'shows the right is in a minority' in
the country. Mr Henri Emmanuelli, leader of the party since the June ousting
of Mr Michel Rocard, called on the party to take heart and promised a party
congress in January to designate its presidential candidate.
But the party could then fall to its traditional factional feuding, in
contrast to its congress last month when all rallied around an appeal to Mr
Delors to run for president.
One particular Socialist fear is that Mr Bernard Tapie may leap into the
void left by Mr Delors. Mr Tapie's political label is that of the Radical
party, a small traditional ally of the Socialists. But Mr Tapie, who said
last night 'Jacques Delors's ideas are shared by a majority of French', has
proven voter appeal among the young and working class. He might see a
presidential bid as way out of the tax and bankruptcy litigation in which he
is mired. Mr Emmanuelli reacted by warning Mr Tapie that the left needed a
candidate who could at least come second in the first round of voting on
April 23 and therefore make it into the May 7 run-off.
Causing immediate jubilation on the right last night was precisely this
prospect that for the first time since 1969, the May 7 run-off will be
between two of its own. This will cheer up Mr Chirac. The mayor of Paris
still trails Mr Balladur despite having formally opened his campaign, but
can now hope to come in second on April 23. But a close supporter of Mr
Balladur reacted with the argument that the prime minister's appeal to
centrists - particularly within his coalition partner of the UDF - made him
the best candidate, since 'Jacques Delors has abandoned the centre, and that
is where the presidential battle will be fought out'.

General Sir Michael Rose, commander of UN troops in Bosnia, was yesterday
blocked by Bosnian Serbs from visiting 1,200 Bangladeshi UN troops trapped
in Bihac, a UN safe area. This slap in the face comes after Krajina Serbs on
Saturday stopped the British commander from crossing Serb-held territory in
Croatia. Also at the weekend, Bosnian Serb forces hijacked a UN fuel convoy
and banned peacekeepers from escorting humanitarian relief. The UN yesterday
said it would have to curtail sniper patrols round Sarajevo because it had
received no fuel deliveries for three weeks. The newest restrictions make it
impossible to carry out part of the UN mission, which is to secure the
passage of humanitarian aid by providing an armed escort of convoys
throughout Bosnia. But Bosnian Serbs also freed at the weekend nearly 200 UN
troops held hostage since Nato launched air strikes on Serbs targets and
allowed a food convoy into Sarajevo.
Fighting has intensified in western Bosnia-Hercegovina, where Bosnian Croats
are backed by regular troops from Croatia. Croatian officials at the weekend
admitted that their army had entered Bosnia to help their Moslem allies by
easing the pressure on the northwestern Moslem enclave of Bihac.

The Romanian Senate has passed a much-delayed bankruptcy bill, one of the
most important pieces of legislation needed in the country's transition to a
market economy. The bill, which has been blocked by conservatives in the
ruling left-wing party for nearly two years, is due to be discussed by the
lower house of parliament this week. The government agreed to pass the bill
this year as a condition of a Dollars 700m IMF loan package signed last May.
The passage of the bill coincides with a growing liquidity crisis at several
large state companies, with many unable to pay suppliers or wages. According
to central bank figures, inter-enterprise debt has jumped to more than
Lei7,000bn (Pounds 2.37bn) but until now only a handful of small companies
have been forced into liquidation in cases brought by banks under a
pre-communist commercial code. The delay in paying wages has increased
social tensions. Thousands of steel workers in the Transylvanian town of
Resita yesterday entered the sixth day of street protests sparked by
non-payment of wages for two months.

FT  12 DEC 94 / European consumers gloomy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business confidence is rising fast in Europe on the back of the broader
economic recovery, but many consumers do not appear to be seeing the
benefits, the European Commission says. The preliminary results of its
business and consumer confidence survey for November showed that consumer
confidence remained unchanged between October and November, after rising
rapidly since the start of the year. Industrial confidence, by contrast,
rose for the 16th successive month, almost reaching record levels. The
lowest level of consumer confidence was recorded in Portugal, where
consumers remain deeply gloomy about their country's economic prospects over
the next 12 months. Consumers in Italy were the second most pessimistic,
although this largely reflected concern about their household finances,
rather than the country's economic prospects as a whole. The country with
the strongest consumer confidence was Denmark, where consumers were very
upbeat both about their country's economic prospects over the next year and
about their own finances. Consumers in Ireland were also relatively upbeat.

The European Commission will this week announce its backing for a Ecu1.2m
(Pounds 940,000) project to try to identify Europe's fastest growing
companies and the factors behind their success. The Commission, which is
providing more than Ecu500,000 for the project, recognises that there is
little understanding in Europe of entrepreneur-led companies and that Union
policy often appears preoccupied with large industry, despite small
businesses' importance as the main generators of jobs throughout the
community. If the research successfully identifies rapidly growing companies
and highlights their pre-occupations, it could lead to the establishment of
a permanent body in Brussels representing their interests, the project
co-ordinators say. Researchers, led by accountants Ernst &amp; Young, will scour
the Union and Efta countries for the 500 most rapidly growing companies that
are prepared to say how they achieved their growth. About 50 companies will
be featured at an international conference in late 1995 where the initial
findings will be presented.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Klaus Kinkel, leader of Germany's Free Democrats since 1992 and foreign
minister in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government, was last night
facing mounting pressure to resign following a hostile reception by
delegates attending a special party meeting in Gera in the eastern state of
Thuringia. The party's presidium is expected to meet in emergency session
early this morning to decide whether it would ask for Mr Kinkel's
resignation. 'He is under extreme pressure to resign. That is no surprise
given the string of electoral defeats,' said Ms Irmgard Schwaetzer, the
former construction minister. 'He will sleep on it tonight. But we should
know tomorrow if Kinkel will stay or resign.' Senior party members confirmed
that Mr Wolfgang Gerhardt, party leader of Hesse, was a possible successor
to Mr Kinkel.
Delegates at the congress repeatedly interrupted Mr Kinkel's hour-long
keynote speech with boos and whistles. The address was aimed at restoring
the party's confidence after it failed to get re-elected to nine state
parliaments over the past two years, did not enter the European Parliament
and only scraped back into the Bundestag, in October through tactical voting
by Christian Democrats.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Hungary and the Czech Republic have set themselves a five-year timetable for
joining the European Union. Although EU leaders refused to fix a timetable
for enlargement at the weekend, the two most economically advanced countries
in the former communist bloc publicly set their sights on the year 2000 as
the nearest feasible date of entry.
Mr Gyula Horn, Hungarian prime minister, attempted to steal a march on the
other aspiring members, claiming that his country was the furthest ahead and
a prime candidate for early entry. The 2000 deadline was ambitious but
realistic, said his foreign minister, Mr Laszlo Kovacs.
Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech leader said his government would advance reforms
and put a case for early entry.
While Romanian officials were anxious that the applicants should stick
together rather than jockey for advantage, the EU leaders specifically ruled
out accession en bloc, and stressed membership negotiations would be carried
out case by case. They also pressed the council of ministers and the
European commission to prepare so-called 'Europe agreements' with Slovenia,
Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia so they could be included in the overall
enlargement strategy.
Representatives of the other putative members - Poland, the Czechs, Slovakia
and Bulgaria - were more restrained and contented themselves mainly with
reflections on the symbolic nature of their unprecedented participation at
the EU summit talks. Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the Polish premier, said the
meeting marked an historic occasion, although a timetable for entry might
have helped encourage speedier reforms in his country.
For their part the six planned to increase co-operation among themselves to
improve political and economic stability along the EU's eastern flank,
according to Mr Horn. That was equally important as a preparation for
possible membership of Nato, he said.
But German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the man leading the drive for eastwards
enlargement of the EU, said it was important not to arouse false hopes among
the candidates. They would have to carry most of the burdens associated with
aligning their economic, financial and legal systems to those of the EU, he
added.
Apparently under prompting from France, which is more pre-occupied with
'balancing' EU policies to the east with those towards the Mediterranean
region, he and his officials stressed that a planned programme of regular
top-level contacts did not constitute entry negotiations.
On the contrary, the summit agreed that substantive talks on extension
eastwards would have to wait until after the 1996 inter-governmental
conference, called to review the EU's future institutional needs, which
could last two years.
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, noted that forging monetary union
would be 'exceptionally difficult' in a union of 15 members and even tougher
with more.
Responding to a warning that enlargement made reforms of regional and
agricultural policies essential, the EU leaders asked the commission to
prepare a study on the impact of a further enlargement on the agricultural
budget.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Easy summit ride for Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major had nothing to fear in Essen. The European Union, the most
dangerous element in his domestic political troubles, was treading water.
Grand initiatives await the outcome of next spring's French presidential
elections.
The summit communique had plenty with which Mr Major could agree. The
free-market language on competitiveness, the Ecu300m (Pounds 236m) in aid to
Northern Ireland, endorsement of the United Nation's efforts in Bosnia, and
backing for initiatives to promote subsidiarity and combat fraud were signs
Britain's voice was being heard.
But Mr Major has only six months to end the civil war in the Conservative
party over Europe and to prepare a credible negotiating position for the
1996 intergovernmental conference.
Ministers will soon discuss a series of position papers around which Mr
Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, believes the bulk of the Conservative
party can unite. The papers set two priorities: the first is to contain -
and in some cases roll back - the independence of EU institutions; the
second is to promote a 'positive' agenda to reinforce and expand the
inter-governmental dimension to the Union put in place at Maastricht.
A central idea is for a slimmed-down Commission concerned more with
enforcing existing rules than with producing new legislation. It might well
retain the power to initiate legislation but could see its freedom of action
circumscribed by an obligation to work to a programme laid down by the
council of ministers.
The focus of the Strasbourg parliament should be on more extensive scrutiny
 -particularly over the EU's financial operations - rather than on extending
its authority vis-a-vis national governments. MEPs should be ready also to
share that role with committees of national parliaments.
Britain wants institutional advances concentrated on inter-governmental
co-operation. Mr Hurd has drawn up proposals for a more cohesive EU approach
to security and defence designed to provide a distinctive European role
within the Atlantic alliance.
There is no guarantee that such a strategy will re-unite the Tory party. The
Eurosceptics might yet bring down Mr Major. To meet the threat the odds are
that any British package for the IGC will be accompanied by the promise from
the prime minister of a referendum on the next stage of EU integration.

After a tilt to the east, now a move south. Over the next 18 months the
rotating presidency of the European Union will be in the hands of countries
with Mediterranean coastlines, starting with France on January 1, to be
followed by Spain and Italy. For the past six months the Union has been
dominated by German preoccupations with its neighbours - the former
communist countries of eastern Europe - and the expansion of the Union to
Austria, Sweden and Finland.
France now intends to redress the balance by turning its attention
southwards, with issues such as the rise of Islamic fundamentalism,
immigration from North Africa, terrorism and drugs high on its agenda.
Spain has announced that it will host a special EU-Mediterranean conference
during its presidency in the second half of next year to discuss relations
between the Union and its southern neighbours. Such a dialogue, however,
would stop short of full-fledged membership of the Union for them. Only
Malta and Cyprus are preparing for accession, but negotiations will not
begin until after the 1996 intergovernmental conference.
EU leaders at the weekend showed their commitment to their southern
neighbours by blessing a plan to embrace North Africa and the Middle East in
a free trade zone. The EU's ultimate ambition is to create a
Euro-Mediterranean economic area.
France, at odds with Germany over Europol, a proposed cross-border police
agency, committed itself to reaching an agreement on establishing the new
body by the next EU summit at Cannes next June.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, said the French commitment was one
of the most important advances of the weekend.
Justice and home affairs ministers will have to find a 'balanced solution'
for the structure of the system, blocked until now not only by France but
also by Spain and the UK.
France has insisted that national police officers attached to Europol must
have standardised data pooled in the agency, and also more sensitive
intelligence.
Germany, backed by the other member states, wants to restrict access to
sensitive data except where Europol and national liaison officers attached
to it are directly involved.
Mr Mitterrand's commitment delighted Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who believes
Europol will help stem rising crime in Germany, in particular car theft, and
assuage anxieties about the smuggling of nuclear material from Russia.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Essen Summit: Europe recovers its sense of direction - End
of an era as Mitterrand and Delors bow out / Challenge of enlargement lies
ahead
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
On Saturday afternoon, toward the end of the Essen summit, the television
cameras captured a glimpse of the new Europe in the making.
The shot took in the 12 existing members of the Union; Austria, Finland and
Sweden, which will join on January 1; and, for the first time, six leaders
of central and eastern Europe. At the head of this extended European family
stood the towering father figure, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany.
Mr Kohl was at his irrepressible best in Essen. He thundered against the
Euro-pessimists. He prodded colleagues into compromise. And he offered a
heartfelt tribute to Mr Jacques Delors, praising the outgoing Commission
president as 'one of the very few' in Europe who had supported German
unification in the summer of 1989.
The upshot was a solid, harmonious summit which restored a sense of
direction to the European Union. Leaders reached a consensus on the big
economic issues of the day, balancing the need to strengthen competitiveness
with a commitment to better training and help for the long-term unemployed.
On foreign affairs, the German-led push to build a wider Europe to the east
was offset by a new Mediterranean strategy which will mean more aid for the
EU's southern periphery, notably North Africa.
The Union's watchword is consolidation. In western Europe, leaders know that
they must continue to squeeze budget deficits and inflation with
higher-than-desirable interest rates, the goal being to keep alive the hope
of monetary union by the end of the century. All leaders appear committed to
this course, including Mr John Major, the British prime minister - though he
is not yet prepared to say if the UK intends to sign up to a single
currency.
Consolidation also applies to the six associated states in eastern Europe.
As Mr Kohl stressed on Saturday, they must bear the main burden of
transforming their former command economies so they are ready to withstand
competition inside the single European market. All six - Poland, Hungary,
the Czech republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania - will receive a
blueprint or 'pre-accession strategy' next spring setting out the steps they
must take for future membership. The Baltic states and Slovenia will follow
suit once they conclude negotiations for associate membership in 1995.
More broadly, it was clear that Essen marked the end of an era. First comes
the departure of Mr Delors after 10 years in Brussels. His successor is Mr
Jacques Santer, the Luxembourg prime minister, a man who prides himself on
playing safe and avoiding unnecessary action. Just as significant was the
final appearance of a frail-looking President Francois Mitterrand at a
European Council summit.
The memory of the front-row French press rising in honour of the man who has
ruled France since 1981 will linger; so too, the French president's gentle
teasing of Mr Edouard Balladur, the patrician prime minister who is
desperately seeking to cover up differences on Europe within his own ruling
Gaullist party. 'In life, nothing can be done without difficulty,' said Mr
Mitterrand, clearly suffering from the effects of chemotherapy, 'nothing can
be done in human society without pain.'
The Delors-Kohl-Mitterrand axis has been the most important alliance inside
the Union for the past decade. The Franco-German troika drove forward the
plans for European monetary union, brushing aside the doubters led by Mrs
Margaret Thatcher, then UK prime minister. Yet the end product - the
Maastricht treaty - was an uneasy compromise between supra-national
decision-making and loose inter-governmental co-operation.
The big question is whether this compromise will hold, or whether new deeper
forms of integration must be found to cope with a Union which may contain as
many as 27 members early next century. It is the essence of the 1996
inter-governmental conference to review the Maastricht treaty.
On Friday night, Mr Delors gave what participants described as a fascinating
first look at these questions. He spelled out that a new, expanded Union
would require reducing the number of Commissioners; changing the system of
six-monthly rotating presidencies; altering the weighted voted system which
gives smaller states a disproportionate influence over decision-making; and
introducing more majority voting.
But he also made clear that the EU would have to reform its own policies to
cope with eastern enlargement, including reform of the common agricultural
policy and the multi-billion-ecu structural funds.
Each of these matters is highly contentious. Yet without change there cannot
be a Great Leap Forward to the east. The challenge for EU leaders - barely
begun at Essen - will be to prepare public opinion. Only that way can the
mistakes of Maastricht be avoided.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Mitterrand promises to solve row on Europol
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospects for a pan-European police intelligence agency improved
considerably at the weekend after France promised to resolve differences
over Europol's scope and role during the next six months.
President Francois Mitterrand stepped in to heal the rift by signing a
commitment to reach agreement on setting up Europol by the next summit in
Cannes in June.
Mr Jacques Delors, the president of the European commission, said the French
commitment was one of the most important advances of the weekend.
Justice and home affairs ministers will have to find a 'balanced solution'
for the structure of the system, blocked until now not only by France but
also by Spain and the UK.
France has insisted that national police officers attached to Europol must
have standardised data pooled in the agency, and also more sensitive
intelligence.
Germany, backed by the other member states, wants to restrict access to
sensitive data except where Europol and national liaison officers attached
to it are directly involved.
But Mr Charles Pasqua, the hardline French interior minister, is determined
that Europol should remain firmly under national government control and has
insisted that police force co-ordination should be a matter for
inter-governmental co-operation rather than joint EU action.
Mr Mitterrand's commitment delighted Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who believes
Europol will help stem the rising toll of crime in Germany, in particular
car theft, and will assuage anxieties about the smuggling of nuclear
material from Russia.
Mr Kohl left no room for doubt that the agency - to fight organised crime
within the EU single market - was of the utmost importance. 'We want it
now,' he said, banging the table at the summit's final press conference. 'It
is absolutely urgent that we get the convention in place.'
The summiteers agreed to include terrorism within Europol's scope, a move
which will please Spain.
The UK, which has opposed giving the European court jurisdiction to hear
complaints about Europol conduct, hinted yesterday that its differences
could be resolved by June.

FT  12 DEC 94 / State oil companies dominate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE, Energy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
State-owned oil companies continue to dominate the top rankings of
international oil companies in spite of a spate of privatisations in the
industry. A report published today by Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, a US
newsletter, on the world's top 50 oil companies says that 28 are fully or
partly state-owned. But it predicts that privatisations planned over the
next few years will reverse this. The report shows that Petroleos de
Venezuela has overtaken Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil group, to move into
second place behind Saudi Aramco. Private companies in the top 10 include
Exxon, the US energy group, in fourth place. Two other US companies, Mobil
and Chevron, are ranked 7th and 8th respectively, while British Petroleum is
in 9th place. On the basis of production, however, Gazprom, Russia's
monopoly gas company, moves into second place behind Saudi Aramco, although
it ranks 33rd overall. Only Shell among the private companies ranked in the
top 10 by production. Private companies continue, however, to dominate the
list of the largest refining and marketing companies. The rankings are
determined by six operational criteria covering upstream production
activities as well as refining capacity and product sales.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Kohl carries EU debate on new members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ESSEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union leaders agreed to a road map for enlargement to the east and
south at a weekend summit in Essen which confirmed Chancellor Helmut Kohl of
Germany as Europe's leading power-broker.
Mr Kohl, as summit host, overcame opposition over plans for EU membership
for the former communist countries of central and eastern Europe with a
commitment to work towards a free trade zone in the Mediterranean.
The Essen accord offers the prospect of membership for a handful of central
European countries, as well as Cyprus and Malta, around the turn of the
century. But the leaders were unable to resolve long-running disputes over
fishing rights and the tension between Greece and Turkey.
Before expansion, leaders agreed that the union must streamline its
institutions and decision-making at the inter-governmental conference in
1996 to review the Maastricht treaty - a process which could provoke
opposition in sovereignty-conscious states such as the UK and France.
Spain has offered to host a special summit in July when EU leaders will have
a private brain-storming session on how to organise a union with as many as
27 members. Leaders declined to offer a firm timetable for the next round of
enlargement.
However, the summit marked a commitment for Austria, Finland and Sweden to
join the union on January 1 1995. It also saw the appearance of leaders of
Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania.
Essen marked the end of an era with the imminent departure of President
Francois Mitterrand of France, whose term of office ends early next year,
and Mr Jacques Delors, who hands the European Commission presidency to Mr
Jacques Santer of Luxembourg.
German newspapers yesterday heralded Chancellor Kohl as 'Mister Europe' who
succeeded in orchestrating summit compromises. On economic issues, he
secured a consensus on the need to increase EU competitiveness and tighten
budgetary discipline in preparation for economic and monetary union.
Mr Kohl was unable to get agreement on two German priorities: EU-wide
harmonisation of a tax on carbon dioxide emissions; and a final deal on the
creation of Europol, the Union's fledgling police force, to deal with
organised crime and drug smuggling.
However, German officials said they got a firm commitment from France to
drop its opposition to the force before the next EU summit in Cannes in June
1995. On the energy tax, finance ministers are to draw up new guidelines for
each member to apply a common CO tax 'if it so desires'.
Mr Kohl also failed to resolve Spanish claims for improved fishing rights. A
separate row is brewing over Greece's opposition to the EU's commitment to
launching a customs union with Turkey.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Russia sends troops into Chechnya: Forces close in on Grozny
 -Yeltsin claims need to 'protect' civilians / Protests in Moscow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Russian troops and armour were sent into the republic of Chechnya yesterday
in a move which President Boris Yeltsin claimed was intended to 'protect'
civilians and restore order in the self-declared independent state.
Liberal politicians in Moscow greeted the intervention with horror, warning
that it heralded a lurch into authoritarian rule in Russia.
In the Chechen capital of Grozny, about 1,500km south-east of Moscow,
President Dzhokar Dudayev said the move would throw a 'bloody blanket'
across the north Caucasian region.
The attack, launched early yesterday morning, came from three directions -
the eastern republic of Dagestan, the north western military base of Mozdok
and Vladikavkaz to the west. Reporters in the Mozdok area counted two
columns of 200 tanks. The Russian forces were late last night reported to be
about 10 miles from Grozny.
In Moscow, President Boris Yeltsin said the troops had been ordered not to
use force, but to 'protect' the civilian population.
Jet aircraft streaked over the capital last night, and gun fire could be
heard on the outskirts of the city as panicking civilians fled. Russian
television said up to 40,000 troops had moved in.
Two brief clashes were reported, with local reports of up to four people
dead and more than 10 wounded. Chechen information minister Movladi Udugov
last night claimed 40 Russian troops and six armoured personnel carriers had
been captured on Chechnya's eastern border.
US president Bill Clinton said Washington was concerned by the developments
in Chechnya. But he added: 'It is an internal Russian affair and we hope
that order can be restored with a minimum amount of violence and bloodshed.'
Moscow has long condemned the Chechen government as a criminal regime and
says Mr Dudayev's fighters are gangsters and terrorists. Mr Dudayev, a
former Soviet air force general, declared Chechnya independent in 1991.
Moscow does not recognise the claim.
The Yeltsin government sees the Chechen state as a threat to Russia's
territorial integrity. It fears the Chechens could encourage other dissident
ethnic groups to declare independence.
A special commission under Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime
minister, was reported to be working on a plan for reforms in Chechnya.
Delegations from Russia and Chechnya were due to meet today for scheduled
talks in Vladikavkaz, in the neighbouring region of Ingushetia. Mr Yeltsin
was quoted by the Tass official news agency as saying: 'A threat of
full-scale civil war (in Chechnya) carries a threat to talks, to the free
expression of the will of the Chechen people. We should avert a breakdown in
talks.'
Last night, Mr Taimaz Abubakarov, the Chechen finance minister, said in
Grozny: 'The president (Dudayev) has told me - go there and talk. There will
be talks. The Chechen government has never denied and does not deny now that
this problem can be resolved peacefully.'
However, Mr Abubakarov said he would not talk with leaders of the Chechen
opposition, who launched a strike against Grozny two weeks ago. Russia
insists that talks include the opposition.
Leading liberal politicians in Moscow, including Mr Yegor Gaidar, leader of
the largest liberal group, Russia's Choice, called a rally yesterday in
Pushkin Square in protest at the invasion.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Tories face growing pressure for poll on closer European
ties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major was last night facing growing pressure to agree to a
referendum on further European integration as Conservative leaders braced
themselves for a heavy defeat in Thursday's Dudley West by-election.
With another difficult week for the party in prospect, some pro-European
Tories joined Eurosceptics in arguing that a referendum was becoming
inevitable.
A notable exception, however, was Mr Michael Portillo, the Eurosceptic
employment secretary, who is seen by some as a future Tory leader.
As Labour emphasised that it had 'an open mind' on the issue, Mr Portillo
said a referendum would not be his 'first choice' for addressing
Conservative divisions over Europe.
Interviewed on BBC-TV's Breakfast with Frost, he said it would be better for
ministers to put forward a European policy that would be 'much more
Eurosceptical than in the rest of the continent'.
But he acknowledged that a referendum might be 'a valuable way to heal the
rift' because many Tories wanted one.
As Mr Major used a Sunday newspaper article to accuse the eight Tory MPs who
defied the government in a recent confidence vote of 'self-indulgence', a
poll among voters in Dudley West suggested Labour would win the seat by a
landslide.
The survey for GMTV showed the Conservatives trailing Labour by nearly 45
percentage points ahead of Thursday's contest with the support of just 18.4
per cent of those questioned.
The government could face another test on Wednesday in a Commons debate on
fisheries policy, when a Labour amendment opposing any increase in Spanish
fishing vessels in British waters may secure the support of some Tories.
Senior ministers said they did not expect a snap decision on whether the
government would offer a referendum on the next stage of European
integration.
Mr Portillo's antipathy - which will surprise some of his Eurosceptic allies
on the Tory backbenches - is matched by still stronger opposition from pro-
European cabinet ministers such as Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. But cabinet colleagues
confirmed that Mr Major was actively considering the idea as possibly the
only way to unite the party around a package of British proposals for the
1996 EU intergovernmental conference.
Some colleagues believe a commitment could come early next year if Mr
Major's leadership remains under threat. One senior minister commented: 'The
prime minister has not made up his mind but the (referendum) option is
beginning to look inevitable.'
This view appears to be shared by Mr Keith Hampson, the Tory MP for Leeds
North West and one of Mr Heseltine's closest allies. Mr Hampson said
yesterday that he thought 'probably the momentum has got to the stage where
there has to be one'.
Mr Tim Renton, the pro-European former Conservative chief whip, said autumn
1996 or spring 1997 would be the time when 'it would be right to consider
having a referendum'.
The prime minister appears determined not to bow to the separate demand of
hardline sceptics that he should rule out now British participation in a
single European currency.
Speaking at the EU Essen summit, he endorsed the suggestion of Mr Douglas
Hurd, the foreign secretary, that a national debate on a single currency
would be needed before any decision was taken.
Mr Major, who is expected to brief MPs today on the Essen meeting,
acknowledged that Britain was likely to be among the first countries meeting
the Maastricht criteria for economic and monetary union. But he insisted
there was no possibility of enough countries meeting the criteria before
1999.

FT  12 DEC 94 / Delors bows out of contest for French presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Delors yesterday finally and flatly ruled himself out of the
French presidency race, citing personal reasons and his calculation that
even if victorious he would not have the parliamentary majority to put his
ideas into action.
Mr Delors, who has led all other possible presidential candidates in the
opinion polls for the past several weeks, said his decision not to contest
the election next May was 'irrevocable'.
One element of his decision, which he revealed on prime time television last
night, was his age of 69 and his desire to take a break after 10 years as
European Commission president.
The former socialist minister, whose commission term ends in January,
claimed that 'if the Socialists can agree on a candidate soon, they still
have four months before the election and they have a chance'.
But few of his colleagues inside the Socialist party agree with that
reasoning and will be disappointed by Mr Delors' decision.
The move appears to make it highly probable that France's next president
will be a conservative from the ruling centre-right majority that won 80 per
cent of seats in the 1993 parliamentary election.
That very probability is likely to pull in other candidates from the right,
in addition to Mr Jacques Chirac, the mayor of Paris, who has already
declared his candidacy, and Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, who is
expected to declare next month.
Spelling out his political calculation in damning terms for any alternative
Socialist standard-bearer, Mr Delors said that if he had run and been
elected, he would have had to call fresh parliamentary elections to try to
find a workable majority. But he said even combining new elections with the
popular issue of reducing the French presidential term from seven to five
years, and making the electoral system more proportional to suit the left,
'I would not get a majority for the policies I believe in.' He added: 'I am
not cut out to be a do-nothing king with all the power elsewhere.'
Seeking to ease the pain of fellow Socialists, he said their
'disappointments of tomorrow would be worse than the regrets of today', if a
socialist president were to be blocked in his policies because of a
conservative majority.
Mr Henri Emmanuelli, head of the Socialist party, said he would convene a
party congress in January to select a presidential candidate.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Christmas Food and Drink: Pick your guiding light - Nicholas
Lander navigates his way around the 1995 restaurant guides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One restaurant guide describes it as 'relying to much on its reputation';
another as 'guaranteeing a sense of occasion'; a third calls it 'legendary'
and a fourth, after rating it 1 out of a possible 5, saysit is unable to
confirm details because the restaurant did not reply to its questionnaire. A
fifth guide does not include it because, after a critical review, the
restaurateur wrote asking the reviewer never to darken his doors again.
Which well-known London restaurant is being referred to?
The answer is Langan's of Mayfair. The five reviews of the same place
illustrate not just how subjective reviewing is, but what different
principles the five food guides in question - Harden's, Time Out, Egon
Ronay, The Good Food Guide and The Evening Standard - take.
The biggest problem their editors face is the enormous growth in the number
of restaurants in Britain. At the same time there is a numerical gulf
between the number of restaurants within London and outside.
This makes producing a guide which does not include the capital's
restaurants a difficult commercial proposition - unlike America where the
initial Zagat Guide to New York spawned guides to almost all the other major
American cities.
There is no doubt that demand for good eating exists throughout the UK - one
wine merchant told me that Leodis restaurant, Leeds (0532-421010) served 278
customers on a recent Saturday night, a figure most West End restaurateurs
would envy.
But there are not that many restaurants in Leeds. Five are listed in the
Good Food Guide and 14 in Egon Ronay.
Yet, confined to London, the number of restaurants under consideration is
vast. The Time Out Guide is the most comprehensive with 1,229 entries.
It contains some enticing photos of chefs, waiters and customers and has the
most quirky approach to what London has to offer: restaurants are listed by
national cuisine then, suddenly, there is a chapter on 'fish restaurants'
followed by another on 'hotels and haute cuisine'.
Unfortunately, the guide's A4 size makes it unwieldy. To get the best out of
it, you must sit down at home and plan your excursions.
As Harden's Guide (700 entries) already quotes me on its back cover I must
be brief. However, the fact that two brothers have, by themselves, managed
to produce the least expensive guide is a tribute to their business acumen
and judgment.
Particularly useful over the past year has been a companion volume, Harden's
London Party Guide (Pounds 6.95) which lists venues for hire from the 19th
century Old Operating Theatre Museum and Herb Garret, in London SE1, to the
Nine Kings' Suite at the Royal Lancaster Hotel, in London W2, which can
accommodate 1,300 for a dinner dance.
The Evening Standard Guide (267 entries) is doubly disappointing.
First, it looks drab and second, it fails editorially to promote its author
Fay Maschler, the most knowledgeable of all of us fortunate enough to earn a
living writing about restaurants.
Only Maschler could describe The Brackenbury, in London W6, as 'an
unpretentious neighbourhood restaurant with chef/proprietor Adam Robinson
the ideal boy next door for any keen eater.'
One of the most irritating developments in all the guides is the creation of
their own awards systems. The Standard has the Eros awards for its top 20
London restaurants. Time Out has an awards evening with its own ceremony,
and Egon Ronay has a plethora of sponsored awards including 'Kitchen of the
Year', underwritten by a company of environmental hygiene specialists.
The Good Food Guide is the most idiosyncratic with awards made to
restaurants for being 'East Sussex Flavour', 'Humberside Achiever' and
'Leicester All Day Restaurant' of the year.
Jim Ainsworth, a former restaurateur, is its editor and is one of the
wittiest of food and wine writers. He has injected a sense of humour and
warmth which makes this guide a very good read.
There is no doubting the usefulness of the Egon Ronay Guide, with more than
3,000 entries its is both clear and comprehensive. However, there is an
editorial tendency to praise every entry so that guide's opinions should be
best kept in perspective.
From a consumer's point of view the most useful guide would be a mongrel,
combining the breadth of Egon Ronay, the enthusiasm of Time Out, the wit and
experience of Jim Ainsworth and Fay Maschler respectively, and the business
acumen of the Hardens.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Christmas Food and Drink: The magic of Milroy's many malts -
Giles MacDonogh meets a man with a nose for a good dram and enough stock to
keep all his customers happy

<TEXT>
With between 350 and 375 different labels on sale at any given time,
Milroy's - in Soho's Greek Street - is London's best address for malt
whisky.
It is run by Jack Milroy, a big, hairy, fire-eating Scotsman of the old
school. Jack comes from Dumfriesshire and his local malt is the
lately-mothballed Bladnoch (which he describes as 'not a bad aperitif').
Jack's brother is Wallace Milroy, one of Britain's greatest authorities on
malt and the author of the Malt Whisky Almanac (Neil Wilson, Pounds 6.99).
About 70 per cent of his customers are dedicated whisky buffs, but many are
foreigners lured by the publicity he gets from articles in life-style
magazines.
Japanese come directly from the airport and ask for one of everything. Some
people like to buy two bottles: one to keep and one to drink, or
occasionally a mixed dozen.
I mentioned a coIleague of a friend who plays in one of the world's great
orchestras. This colleague wants to own a bottle of every malt made because
his wife will not let him drink any until he has the whole lot. 'He comes in
here,' said one of Jack's assistants.
A Japanese woman came in recently with a young girl. She wanted a bottle of
55-year-old Macallan for the girl's wedding: it cost her Pounds 5,000. A
Latvian bought a bottle of 1938 Macallan for Pounds 1,500 and came back for
some Royal Lochnagar 60-year-old Reserve at Pounds 159. It is good to know
that capitalism is making such swift progress in the Baltic states.
One of Jack's best customers is a Brazilian who has more than 2,000 bottles
of malt and has has built a special wing on his house to accomodate them.
But Jack points out that it is not so hard to be a collector once you have
bought the basic collection. There are probably no more than a dozen new
releases every year.
Jack is not happy with the standard strength of 40 per cent. For this
reason, he is not a great fan of Gordon and MacPhail, which distributes the
largest range of single malts from its headquarters in Elgin. Pointing to
one whisky at around 60 per cent, he declares: 'You are getting almost half
as much again]' He feels the ideal strength for bottling should be around 50
per cent - 43 at the very least but, preferably, 46.
Jack says the process of chill filtering, practised by almost all
distillers, takes out some of the whisky's goodness. It is done to prevent a
haze developing in the bottle when it is cold - or, indeed, when you add
water. 'The Japanese and the Americans don't like the haze,' he says,
although it does not affect the flavour in any way.
I asked Jack to recommend some of his own favourites. He pointed out various
bottles: a Mortlach 21-year-old, a Pittyvaich I2-year-old, a Glenlivet
15-year-old (priced keenly at Pounds 25); and a Talisker he calls an
'early-evening malt'. He has a 1955 at Pounds 115.
Another recommendation is Glenfarclas on Speyside. He is no longer so keen
on the 105 (60 per cent) as John Grant has removed the age statement, and
prefers the 15-year-old. Another great Speyside is Longmorn: the 15-year-old
sells for Pounds 24.50. 'It doesn't need much water, it's so smooth,' Jack
enthuses. He has a 1963, too, for Pounds 45.
There are also special whiskies from Islay. He thinks Caoli1a under-valued,
especially now that Laphroaig is not, in his view, what it was. 'They have
polished it right down. It is not as interesting as it used to be.'
He has a 1979 from the closed distillery at Port Ellen (Pounds 26) but, not
surprisingly, he waxes lyrical over the 18-year-old, cask strength Ardbeg
(54 per cent) at Pounds 43. The other day, he ate some pepper steaks which
had been flambeed in it. 'They were sensational.'
He has some kind words for the blended whiskies, too. He surprised me when
he said the Johnnie Walker Blue Label had its admirers (at Pounds 120) and
recommended the Islay Mist (it contains a lot of Laphroaig) at Pounds 17.50.
On the other hand, 'Johnnie Walker Black Label is hard to beat'. He drinks
it in Chinese restaurants when he cannot find any acceptable wine on the
list.
We opened a few bottles. A 21-year-old Glen Grant did not please me much;
despite all those aromas of honeycomb and heather, it was still rather one
dimensional. A Dailuaine 16-year-old combined the smell of sherry with
something animal, like a wet sheep. So we moved on to some whiskies Jack is
bottling himself.
First was a 16-year-old, 1978 Glenlivet which he will break down to 46 per
cent and sell for Pounds 25. This will make it better value than the Gordon
and MacPhail 15 (40 per cent) at Pounds 29. It was a classic Speyside with a
lot of rich sherry and toffee tastes - a great, warming dram.
Sensational, however, was Milroy's 29-year-old Springbank (46 per cent) at
Pounds 59. This might seem a bit steep, but the distillery's 30-year-old
sells for Pounds 165. There was a lot of honey on the nose and a beautiful,
lemony tang. Jack called it 'a kiss from a beautiful virgin'. He does a lot
of business with Springbank.
Although he has no Longrow at present, he has the rare Burnside, distilled
occasionally on a special still. He also sells new casks for Pounds 900. The
price includes 10 years' free storage and bottling at whatever strength you
choose.
Our final whisky was a 15-year-old Lagavulin at 64.6, which sells for Pounds
40. It was notably pale, with no sherry treatment and an obvious peat-reek
which had me thinking of log fires and ash-trays.
It is one of Jack's best-sellers. Indeed, he says males over 40 prefer Islay
malts because they 'sort the men out from the boys'. It was a comment that
gave me cause for reflection as I staggered out into Greek Street.
Milroy's, 3 Greek Street, London W1, tel: 071-437 0893.
This autumn yields three new books by Michael Jackson, the beer and whisky
guru. The Malt Whisky Companion (Dorling Kindersley, Pounds I2.99) is now
bang up to date and includes descriptions (and scores) for the whiskies
released this year.
Mitchell Beazley has published his Cocktail Book (Pounds 9.99), a
nicely-illustrated compendium of recipes ideal for use in either a busy bar
or the home. The same publisher has re-issued the Pocket Beer Book in which
he reveals his latest discoveries (Pounds 6.99).
Mmeanwhile, there is a new edition of the Good Beer Guide on sale. It is
published by the Campaign for Real Ale (Pounds 9.99) which, among other
things, is campaigning to have the level of UK duty on beer reduced
drastically to bring it into line with continental Europe.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Christmas Food and Drink: Pick your guiding light - Nicholas
Lander navigates his way around the 1995 restaurant guides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One restaurant guide describes it as 'relying to much on its reputation';
another as 'guaranteeing a sense of occasion'; a third calls it 'legendary'
and a fourth, after rating it 1 out of a possible 5, saysit is unable to
confirm details because the restaurant did not reply to its questionnaire. A
fifth guide does not include it because, after a critical review, the
restaurateur wrote asking the reviewer never to darken his doors again.
Which well-known London restaurant is being referred to?
The answer is Langan's of Mayfair. The five reviews of the same place
illustrate not just how subjective reviewing is, but what different
principles the five food guides in question - Harden's, Time Out, Egon
Ronay, The Good Food Guide and The Evening Standard - take.
The biggest problem their editors face is the enormous growth in the number
of restaurants in Britain. At the same time there is a numerical gulf
between the number of restaurants within London and outside.
This makes producing a guide which does not include the capital's
restaurants a difficult commercial proposition - unlike America where the
initial Zagat Guide to New York spawned guides to almost all the other major
American cities.
There is no doubt that demand for good eating exists throughout the UK - one
wine merchant told me that Leodis restaurant, Leeds (0532-421010) served 278
customers on a recent Saturday night, a figure most West End restaurateurs
would envy.
But there are not that many restaurants in Leeds. Five are listed in the
Good Food Guide and 14 in Egon Ronay.
Yet, confined to London, the number of restaurants under consideration is
vast. The Time Out Guide is the most comprehensive with 1,229 entries.
It contains some enticing photos of chefs, waiters and customers and has the
most quirky approach to what London has to offer: restaurants are listed by
national cuisine then, suddenly, there is a chapter on 'fish restaurants'
followed by another on 'hotels and haute cuisine'.
Unfortunately, the guide's A4 size makes it unwieldy. To get the best out of
it, you must sit down at home and plan your excursions.
As Harden's Guide (700 entries) already quotes me on its back cover I must
be brief. However, the fact that two brothers have, by themselves, managed
to produce the least expensive guide is a tribute to their business acumen
and judgment.
Particularly useful over the past year has been a companion volume, Harden's
London Party Guide (Pounds 6.95) which lists venues for hire from the 19th
century Old Operating Theatre Museum and Herb Garret, in London SE1, to the
Nine Kings' Suite at the Royal Lancaster Hotel, in London W2, which can
accommodate 1,300 for a dinner dance.
The Evening Standard Guide (267 entries) is doubly disappointing.
First, it looks drab and second, it fails editorially to promote its author
Fay Maschler, the most knowledgeable of all of us fortunate enough to earn a
living writing about restaurants.
Only Maschler could describe The Brackenbury, in London W6, as 'an
unpretentious neighbourhood restaurant with chef/proprietor Adam Robinson
the ideal boy next door for any keen eater.'
One of the most irritating developments in all the guides is the creation of
their own awards systems. The Standard has the Eros awards for its top 20
London restaurants. Time Out has an awards evening with its own ceremony,
and Egon Ronay has a plethora of sponsored awards including 'Kitchen of the
Year', underwritten by a company of environmental hygiene specialists.
The Good Food Guide is the most idiosyncratic with awards made to
restaurants for being 'East Sussex Flavour', 'Humberside Achiever' and
'Leicester All Day Restaurant' of the year.
Jim Ainsworth, a former restaurateur, is its editor and is one of the
wittiest of food and wine writers. He has injected a sense of humour and
warmth which makes this guide a very good read.
There is no doubting the usefulness of the Egon Ronay Guide, with more than
3,000 entries its is both clear and comprehensive. However, there is an
editorial tendency to praise every entry so that guide's opinions should be
best kept in perspective.
From a consumer's point of view the most useful guide would be a mongrel,
combining the breadth of Egon Ronay, the enthusiasm of Time Out, the wit and
experience of Jim Ainsworth and Fay Maschler respectively, and the business
acumen of the Hardens.
The Time Out Eating &amp; Drinking Guide 1995, Pounds 7.50, 242 pages; Harden's

plan must be used in this way. Annuity income is fully taxable. This

are used for personal pension plans and the previous retirement annuity
contracts. The rates in the chart do not include inflation proofing.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Income): Gilt issues - best
value v tax status
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gilt issues - best value v tax status
Your capital gain on a gilt - a UK government bond - is tax free.
However, you pay tax on the interest. Therefore, gilts which deliver a
higher proportion of their total return as capital gain are more tax
efficient, and - other things being equal - more attractive to
higher rate taxpayers.

What to buy for enthusiasts and experts - it is an annual dilemma. Their
hobbies ought to provide a host of ideas.
But what if they have already got your chosen gift, or - even worse - what
if it is not the right make or design? The Weekend FT's experts offer some
suggestions . . .
Expert skiers are often obsessed with finding out how many vertical feet
they ski. The Avocet Vertech Ski wrist watch will tell them to the nearest
five feet. All you need to do is set it before your first run and it will
automatically calculate vertical feet and the number of runs you ski all day
long without you having to touch it again.
The following day you can either start your tally again or keep a running
total. The Avocet which works on aviation technology using barometric
pressure, will clock up 299,000 vertical feet (more than enough for most
skiers' holidays) before returning to zero. But if you keep a running total,
remember to turn it off after each day's skiing or the watch will keep
calculating your vertical drop when you are driving or even walking
downhill.
The Avocet, which has a stopwatch and displays altitude, highest skiing
speed, barometric pressure and of course, the time, costs Pounds 119.95 from
Snow + Rock, 188 Kensington High Street, London W8 7RG, Tel: 071-937 0872.
One criticism of the so-called 'Fat Skis' designed to make powder skiing
easier is that they are not so hot on piste.
Now Porsche has come up with a design it claims works just as well on or off
piste. They are black and as sleek as a fat ski can be, and they retail at
Dollars 850 (bindings Dollars 175 extra) from Porsche Design, Corporate
Office, American PD Company Inc, 331 South Rio Grande Street, Suite 105,
Salt Lake City, Utah 84101. Tel: 0101 801 575 8815.
For the ultimate Christmas gift, what about hiring the most famous mountain
in America: Aspen's Ajax.
The day after the ski season ends on April 15, it could be yours for Dollars
100,000. For that you could take up to 100 guests, who would each ski free
and have their own instructor for the day - plus lunch of course.
You could even groom whichever slopes you choose at no extra cost. The fee
would be divided in two, with Dollars 50,000 going to your favourite charity
and the other Dollars 50,000 going to Aspen Skiing Company's favourite
charity.

Company, PO Box 1248, Aspen, Colorado 81612. Tel: 0101 303 544 3070.

What to buy for enthusiasts and experts - it is an annual dilemma. Their
hobbies ought to provide a host of ideas.
But what if they have already got your chosen gift, or - even worse - what
if it is not the right make or design? The Weekend FT's experts offer some
suggestions . . .
Modern cars have just about everything built-in. So the scope for buying
car-related Christmas gifts is not what it used to be in the days when
heaters and radios were extras.
Think first of security. Devices to lock gear lever to clutch pedal or
prevent the steering wheel from being turned full circle will not stop a
professional thief but should make joy riders look elsewhere. From Pounds 20
at Halfords.
Mobile telephones - the best gift for any woman who has to drive alone,
especially at night - have become so spectacularly cheap that Ford now gives
one away with every new car. But choose the tariff with care. Remember that
the lower the monthly charge, the more the calls will cost.
Motoring maps get out of date as by-passes are built and motorways extended.
Philip's 1:100,000 atlas is the best there is of the British Isles.
Michelin's spiral bound 1:200,000 atlas does the same for France. From
booksellers, priced around Pounds 17 and Pounds 12, respectively.
For a useful stocking filler, consider a map reading light that plugs into
the cigarette lighter (Pounds 9.99 from Halfords).
Prevention is better than cure. If you have a new car and a dog, call Over
The Top Textiles (0608-676625) for details of its Quilties (from about
Pounds 15 upwards). They keep mud and hairs off seats and estate car load
spaces. Dogs like sitting on them, too.
We may have a real winter this time. If so, a soft handbrush for snow
removal plus a de-icer spray and scraper will be appreciated.
If your partner has just been pinched for breaking the limit, you may be
considering the gift of a radar detector to warn of speed traps. But forget
it. In Britain, they are legal only so long as they are not switched on. On
mainland Europe, the police are liable to confiscate them on sight and fine
you heavily just for having one.

What to buy for enthusiasts and experts - it is an annual dilemma. Their
hobbies ought to provide a host of ideas.
But what if they have already got your chosen gift, or - even worse - what
if it is not the right make or design? The Weekend FT's experts offer some
suggestions . . .
Check a motorcyclist's fingernails before buying him or her anything for
Christmas. Black, oily hands belong to bikers who spend most of their time
building and rebuilding machines. Buy them spanners, sprockets and
industrial strength hand-cleanser.
Manicured motorcyclists are more difficult. They are likely to have almost
everything they need and want, from leathers and waterproofs to luggage and
sophisticated security equipment.
They are unlikely, however, to have Ducati Passions, a compact disc
featuring the exhaust sounds of 18 different Ducati motorcycles recorded by
the Ducati Club of Sweden (Pounds 13.45 by mail order from the Road Racer
catalogue, tel: 0477-544304).
Each 'track' lasts less than a minute and the recording quality is splendid
 -but only a total obsessive would find it a lasting pleasure. On the other
hand, it has the virtue of novelty, and could be useful for encouraging
overstaying supper guests to get on their bikes.
In the same catalogue is a range of wonderful tin toy motorcycles, priced
between Pounds 9.95 and Pounds 35. The originals upon which some of these
are based sell for hundreds of pounds at auction, yet you would be pushed to
tell the difference at a quick glance.
Thinking bigger, my letter to Santa lists a single item: any one of the
motorcycles made by Bimota of Italy. The models in this range are
sport-style bikes and are as beautiful as pieces of working machinery can
possibly be.
The Biposto, Furano or the Tesi, any of them would do. Prices range from
Pounds 10,750 for the YB9SR to Pounds 23,000 for the top-of-the-range
high-tech Tesi. Contact Galleria Bimota on 0483-272707.
As a stocking filler, go for earplugs (widely available). These are
essential safety accessories to guard against hearing damage caused by wind
noise when riding for long periods at speed.
And if you are in danger of having to listen to repeated playing of Ducati
Passions, then buy some for yourself as well.

What to buy for enthusiasts and experts - it is an annual dilemma. Their
hobbies ought to provide a host of ideas.
But what if they have already got your chosen gift, or - even worse - what
if it is not the right make or design? The Weekend FT's experts offer some
suggestions . . .
My Christmas suggestions are for seeding, cutting and clearing up. The two
best secateurs are the Felco Classic at Pounds 35.99 or the Wilkinson Sword
Medium Anvil at Pounds 22.99, which I marginally prefer; every gardener
loses the secateurs at least once a year and needs new ones.
If their garden is now growing furiously, they will also need long-handled
pruners. I like the Gardena 860 BL at Pounds 44.79.
For weeds, the essential is a Wilkinson Sword Classic Hoe,
rectangular-headed at Pounds 21.99.
Gardeners never use enough food; encourage them with a big pack of
Phostrogen at Pounds 4.79 and a potash-rich 500ml box of Tomorite at Pounds
2.49; both can be applied so easily with a hose if you fix on the no-clog
Miracle Gro Feeder which comes with highly nitrogenous Miracle Gro, which I
do not use, but is particularly cheap at Pounds 6.99.
Alternatively, you can water on fertiliser where the best cans are made by
Haws and there is now a cheap and cheerful Haws Practical model at Pounds
9.99.
Everybody also needs some line of attack against pests. My favourite slug
and snail killer is the admirable Growing Success which is both organic and
lethal.
You may prefer to give a Bosbag at Pounds 8.39 on the grounds that it sounds
like your horticulture partner anyway. In fact, it is an all-purpose piece
of sheeting which will stand up as a rounded bag and take all the garden
rubbish without involving a wheelbarrow. It will also hold dead leaves;
please do not give anyone one of those awful leaf-blowers which are all the
rage and so needlessly noisy that they ruin the neighbours' weekends.

What to buy for enthusiasts and experts - it is an annual dilemma. Their
hobbies ought to provide a host of ideas.
But what if they have already got your chosen gift, or - even worse - what
if it is not the right make or design? The Weekend FT's experts offer some
suggestions . . .
For the last three years my horse has redecorated my toenails. Black. This
year I been dropping heavy hints for Santa to come up with some very smart
paddock boots with invisible steel-capped toes.
Overider does just the job in black or tan waxy leather, sizes 3-8, from
Pounds 34.50 to Pounds 40.50. Not only protective, these will rival my
daughter's Doc Marten's in street cred. Call 0455-220375 for stockists, or
available from Ride Away Mail Order (0347-810443).
The warm, wet autumn has highlighted an age-old problem. Waterproof jackets,
whatever claims are made about their breathability, are hot when you are
schooling a recalcitrant beast: they get just as damp inside as out.
The most versatile jacket I have seen, but not worn (Santa, please note) is
the Royal Oak '94 made by Mountain Horse, available from good saddleries
from Pounds 182.50 to Pounds 195, sizes small to extra-large. This is a
four-in-one waterproof jacket with removable sleeves and waistcoat, but it
also has 'air regulators' under the yoke and armpits - zips you can undo to
get a through draught.
Videos make great presents. Even the rest of the family enjoys Thrills and
Spills (Pounds 9.99), 40 minutes of nail-biting stuff over show jumps and
cross country, and The Spanish Riding School (Pounds 12.99), 60 minutes of
breathtaking beauty and elegance as Lippizana stallions perform classical
dressage.
Badminton 94 (Pounds 19.99) will bring me right up to date, and I hope Santa
can stretch to the video I have been waiting for, new this year: The Half
Halt Demystified (2 cassettes, Pounds 29.99) in which Jane Savoie explains
how to put your horse on the bit. All available from Ride Away (see above)
or Robinsons Mail Order (0942-722555).
Thus equipped, I hope this Christmas my horse will stop walking all over me
and start to listen.

What to buy for enthusiasts and experts - it is an annual dilemma. Their
hobbies ought to provide a host of ideas.
But what if they have already got your chosen gift, or - even worse - what
if it is not the right make or design? The Weekend FT's experts offer some
suggestions . . .
The smartest Christmas shooting stockings - as worn by the Prince of Wales -
are knitted in local traditional patterns by Alison Thomson of 30 High St,
Sanquhar, Dumfries and Galloway for just Pounds 19, made to measure.
A gundog slip lead is a good stocking filler at Pounds 6 (Turner Richards,
tel: 021-359 5577), but if the labrador is steady at the hottest pheasant
drive he may merit immortality through Simon Gudgeon, whose dog portraits
start at Pounds 125 (tel: 0243-811613).
The silver dog whistle from Holland &amp; Holland, Pounds 38 (tel: 071-499
4411), is a better bet for owners of hooligan hounds - as it is 'silent'.
This asset will be lost on the 50-plus shooting men bellowing over the port.
The best present for those still with hearing is a pair of Sound Censor
ear-plugs. Individually moulded to the ear canal, they are unobtrusive and
extremely effective. They cost Pounds 130 a pair, although syndicates should
be able to obtain group discount (tel: Mrs Perkins at Holland &amp; Holland).
More light-hearted are the Loon cartoon boxer shorts - 'Cocks Over' - from
the Enormous Handkerchief Co Hounds and, inevitably, fly fishing versions
are also available at Pounds 9.95 (tel: 0333-329559).
For more public display, the silver salmon cuff-links from William Powell's
are good value at Pounds 50 (tel: 021-643 0689). And for a keepsake of an
epic tussle with a fresh-run spring fish, there can be little lovelier than
the hand-drawn river maps from Fred Cholmeley (tel: 047-683235), illustrated
with water-colours of birds and mammals chosen by the client. Prices start
at Pounds 95 unframed.
All fish and fowl can be red-inked in true style in the new range of
game-books by The Game Book (from Pounds 20.50, tel: 071-351 0233) but if
the season's tally looks meagre, Roxton Bailey Robinson can organise the
highest pheasants in the land from Pounds 800 per gun (tel: 0488-683222).
Just thinking of such a day causes insomnia, so Wildsounds' Nocturne of
Nightingale - one hour of nightingale song (Pounds 10.99 on CD, Pounds 6.95
on tape, tel: 0263-741100) - should send in the sandman before Santa.

What to buy for enthusiasts and experts - it is an annual dilemma. Their
hobbies ought to provide a host of ideas.
But what if they have already got your chosen gift, or - even worse - what
if it is not the right make or design? The Weekend FT's experts offer some
suggestions . . .
If it is books they like, there were two major publications this autumn:
Jancis Robinson's Oxford Companion to Wine (OUP, Pounds 30) and Hugh
Johnson's World Atlas of Wine (Mitchell Beazley, Pounds 30). Robinson's book
is the most useful and up to date. Johnson's is the nicest to look at.
Johnson's shop, at 68 St James's (tel: 071-491 4912) is a good place for
wine related presents. If you go there on the evening of December 15,
Johnson will be there, signing copies of his atlas. A good-sized decanter,
copied from a c1810 original, may be had for Pounds 157, or Pounds 227 for
magnums. For the original you will have to pay Pounds 300.
A useful idea is a wine cooler which covers the whole bottle. This is made
from copper, plated with silver and costs Pounds 395.
Silver bottle holders are available for Pounds 200 and the popular decanting
cradle is Pounds 175 or Pounds 350 for magnums. A beautiful claret jug with
a silver mount comes in the form of a modernised ampora for Pounds 400.
For the female wine buff there is a necklace of lapis lazuli with bunches of
grapes at Pounds 295.
An amusing idea, which has the virtue of being slightly cheaper than many of
the items in the shop is a decanter label in silver with the legend 'plonk'
(Pounds 36). It might make a subtle hint.
The best wine glasses come from the Austrian company of Riedel. The
hand-made sommeliers range starts at Pounds 23 a stem. If that is too much
to pay, the vinum range is about half that and few people will know the
difference. Selfridges and Harrods have them. For other stockists call
Michael Johnson Ceramics (tel: 071-624 2493).

What to buy for enthusiasts and experts - it is an annual dilemma. Their
hobbies ought to provide a host of ideas.
But what if they have already got your chosen gift, or - even worse - what
if it is not the right make or design? The Weekend FT's experts offer some
suggestions . . .
Three gifts please: one to get the day off to a good start, the second to
facilitate cooking for the next decade at least, and the third to allow my
family and friends to enjoy our meals together even more in 1995.
The first is a chrome plated citrus press that will produce sensational
fresh orange juice for breakfast (without which no breakfast is complete).
It is German and costs Pounds 43.40 from Divertimenti, SW3 (071-581 8065) or
W1 (071-935 0689). One fell swoop of the hand lever produces just the juice
 -no pips or pith. Just as good later in the day when you need lemon or lime
juice for cooking.
The second, which would definitely necessitate a large sack, would be the
full range of Global cooking knives.
These are Japanese, the blades made from Molybdenum/vanadium stainless steel
which has been icetempered and hardened so that they remain razor sharp
longer than other steel and resist rust, stains and corrosion.
I have ogled them in Richard Dare's kitchen shop, NW1 (071-722 9428) and
even held them - they are perfectly weighted. But the cheapest costs Pounds
25 and the complete range comprises 29 knives so I have put them down
quickly.
Finally, one of the biggest transformations in cooking around the world over
the past decade has been the increased use of different oils - olive,
hazelnut, sesame, walnut are the most common but pistachio, pineseed,
groundnut and almond oil are distinctive, too.
I would like a mixed case please from an everyday, fruity olive oil for
cooking to an extra virgin cold pressed olive oil, a type that now commands
such high prices that they are usually only available in designer half
bottles.
Santa Claus for this present would take the form of a delivery man from The
Oil Merchant, W12 (081-740 1335) or Taylor &amp; Lake, SW8 (071-622 9156).
And my wish for 1995 - that somehow there will be enough food for everyone
on this planet.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Minister rejects 44-tonne trucks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday rejected a recommendation to increase the maximum
size of trucks to 44 tonnes.
Some 44-tonne trucks used in road-rail operations are already allowed on the
roads and a House of Lords committee had recommended an overall increase for
all vehicles from the current 38 tonnes.
But Mr Steven Norris, transport minister, turned down the recommendation,
saying that 'while there would be some savings in lorry numbers, the effect
that 44-tonne lorries would have on existing rail freight and the intermodal
services through the Channel tunnel still needs detailed evaluation'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Proteus International has had a miserable year, with its shares falling by
more than 70 per cent at one stage. It hopes to 'design' effective drugs
using computer software developed at Manchester University. But the company
has failed to inspire investors suspicious of the scientific credentials of
top management, which started out in the property business, and of the
quality of the software.
Its most successful research programme has been in animal drugs, an area
with lower safety standards and sales than human treatments.

<TEXT>
Cantab Pharmaceuticals could be the great overlooked stock of the sector.
Its work on modifying the immune system is driven by Alan Munro, who gave up
the job of head of immunology at Cambridge to try to commercialise his
ideas.
The lead product is aimed at making kidneys less likely to be rejected after
transplants. The scientific principles seem solid, there is a good economic
story (transplants are expensive) and clinical trials should be quick. Phase
3 trials begin next year, but the company is likely to need more cash before
making a profit.

Investments
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Biotechnology Investments Limited (BIL) is an offshore investment company
run by the experienced Jeremy Curnock-Cook of Rothschild Asset Management.
The shares are at their lowest for 18 months, in spite of a decent relative
performance against the weak US biotech sector, in which the company has
most of its cash invested.
Investors should see BIL as a way into the world of biotech. Sixty per cent
of its cash is in some of the 1,500 or so US companies. In the UK, it
has a large stake only in
Cantab.
While the other companies here are to be found under 'pharmaceuticals' in
the FT share price listings, BIL is called Biotech Pref and is listed in the
investment companies section.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Celltech Group was founded in 1980 but acquired entrepreneurial zest only
when new top management joined a decade later. The company has a strong
pipeline of drugs in development, but has not captured City imagination in
the way that publicity-adept British Biotech has.
Celltech shares have perked up only in recent days as investors realised its
burn rate was cushioned by revenues from a manufacturing arm and a series of
corporate partnerships.
Celltech's disease areas are not good. Asthma, for example, is already quite
well treated and it takes a long time for patients to show benefit or
otherwise from a new treatment. The company also depends heavily on a
technology called monoclonal antibodies, which has not lived up to the
expectations held for it in its early days.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scotia Holdings is an extraordinary one-off which has based its research on
the principle that fats, as well as the proteins exploited by other
companies, can be turned into drugs. More than any of its rivals, it depends
on one man: founder and chairman David Horrobin, a former professor of
medicine in Montreal.
If, one day, he wins a Nobel prize, it will be in spite of his penchant for
establishing research centres in out-of-the-way places such as Nova Scotia,
Canada, and the Western Isles of Scotland and managing them on the
principles of Sir Karl Popper, the late philosopher of science.
The company struggled to find finance in its early days and turned to the
nutritional market to pay for more serious R&amp;D. It makes evening primrose
oil under the Efamol brand name. Yet, today, it has more drugs in phase 3
trials than some mainstream pharmaceuticals companies.

<TEXT>
British Biotech, which changed its name this year from the slightly less
snappy British Biotechnology, is the star of the UK sector.
Its dramatic share price rise this year has made it 10th biggest in the
sector and attracted US investors. The warrant, issued in the spring, has
almost trebled in value since.
The company has picked potentially lucrative disease areas (mostly cancer),
has plenty of money in the bank and an energetic and imaginative management
team. It has kept all the rights to its products, maximising potential.
But the company is burning money at a ferocious rate. It could be in trouble
if warrant holders do not convert in a year's time. Meanwhile, the company's
drugs seem to work well, but crucial clinical trials have yet to be
conducted.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Growth): Daniel Green looks at
five areas for investors to watch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Purveyors of snake oil masquerading as scientists, or entrepreneurial
geniuses building a new Glaxo? That is the question which everyone investing
in biotechnology tries to answer. It is tough even for professional
investors because the road from laboratory research to a blockbuster new
drug is long and risky.
They get little advice from analysts, most of whom have their hands full
with developments in the pharmaceuticals industry. There is no way of using
conventional yardsticks - such as yields and price-earnings ratios - since
biotech companies have no earnings and pay no dividends until they make it
big or fail.
Investors both private and professional must resort to the old-fashioned
approach of trying to understand the companies themselves. There are five
areas of risk they should consider:
Financial
Biotech companies consume money for years before products are marketed. This
burn rate should be compared with the company's cash reserves to judge when
the next cash injection is likely. This is usually a rights issue or
partnership with a large drugs company. While drug company partners bring
cash and expertise, they usually take marketing rights in return. Scientific
It is difficult even for the experts to determine which field will provide
the next breakthrough. Investors should concentrate on the facts that emerge
from clinical trials. As explained on page 1, clinical trials come in three
stages. Phase 1 is on volunteers to check for side effects. Phase 2 is to
test proof of principle (does the drug have the right kind of effect?) and
to find the best dose. Phase 3, on hundreds or thousands of patients, is a
statistically significant comparison of the new drug with existing
treatments or a placebo. This phase is, ultimately, the only one that
counts. Nine out of 10 drugs that enter Phase 1 will not make it to Phase 3.
Management
Biotech company bosses may never have run a business before, or be out of
their depth in research. Would you trust them with your money?
Regulatory
Drug regulators, such as the US Food and Drug Administration and the
Medicines Control Agency in the UK, are more sympathetic to companies trying
to treat hitherto incurable diseases such as Alzheimer's. Also, it is easier
to produce unambiguous clinical trial results quickly if - to put it bluntly
 -a disease is virulent and lethal.
Economic
There is pressure on health-care costs around the world and drug prices are
often a target for control. Drugs that fetch the highest prices will,
increasingly, be those that cut health-care costs elsewhere - for example,
by avoiding the need for surgery or shortening a hospital stay.
On the right are the most important investment vehicles in the UK.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Orange County starts action against banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Orange County, the beleaguered southern California district facing Dollars
1.5bn (Pounds 958m) of investment losses, formally started legal action
yesterday against a number of Wall Street investment banks.
The move came as a new team took up the task of sorting out the county's
finances, cast into chaos by the losses and a decision to file for
bankruptcy earlier this week.
Mr Thomas Hayes, a former auditor general of California and a close
associate of Mr Pete Wilson, the state's governor, was appointed late on
Thursday to lead the restructuring of the troubled investment portfolio in
order to reduce the actual losses born by the prosperous area's taxpayers.
The county also named Salomon Brothers, one of a small number of US
investment banks not to have had dealings with the investment fund, as an
adviser.
The decision to take legal action, reached after a meeting of the county's
board of supervisors on Thursday evening, will pit the county against a
number of leading firms on Wall Street, among them Morgan Stanley, Smith
Barney, Prudential Securities and Nomura. Since the filing, the firms have
all sold securities they held as collateral for loans made to the county.
Total sales had reached Dollars 11.4bn by yesterday, the county said.
Officials in California have argued that the filing put a legal block on the
firms selling the securities, a move intended to prevent its investment
losses from being realised.
'We are outraged that some broker-dealers have elected to ignore the law and
have only contributed to the uncertainty that has confronted us in recent
days,' said Mr Thomas Riley, chairman of the board of supervisors. According
to the county's lawyer, Mr Bruce Bennett of Stutman Treister &amp; Glatt, the
bankruptcy filing put an 'automatic stay' on any actions that could impair
the authority's finances.
Merrill Lynch, which had lent Dollars 2bn to the investment fund, is
believed to be the only bank not to have sold its collateral by late
yesterday.
The bankruptcy was precipitated after CS First Boston earlier this week sold
Dollars 2.6bn of securities it held belonging to the county, which is
believed to have missed an interest payment due to the bank on advances it
had made under so-called 'repurchase agreements'. CS First Boston would only
say it had 'liquidated the collateral under the terms of the agreements we
had', and that the sales had taken place before the bankruptcy filing.
Meanwhile the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates the US
investment markets, has moved fast with its own investigation. Merrill
Lynch, which is believed to have sold the county many of the investments on
which it faces losses, confirmed it had received a subpoena from the agency
for information. Other investment banks are understood to have received
similar requests.

President Bill Clinton yesterday fired his top public health official over
comments she made advocating the teaching of masturbation in schools. White
House chief-of-staff Leon Panetta said the comment by Surgeon-General
Jocelyn Elders 'was just one too many' controversial remarks and that Mr
Clinton had demanded she resign. According to the US magazine News and World
Report, Dr Elders had finished a speech on Aids at the United Nations in New
York when a man asked whether she would support promoting masturbation to
discourage school-age children from trying riskier forms of sexual activity.
'With regard to masturbation, I think that is something that is a part of
human sexuality and a part of something that perhaps should be taught,' she
replied.

<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton, racing to get ahead of Congressional Republicans,
will convene a closed White House meeting of governors and mayors early next
month to develop plans for addressing the nation's 'broken welfare system'.
Mr Clinton said the current welfare system 'is a bad deal for the taxpayers
who pay the bills and for the families who are trapped in it'.
Welfare reform is considered one issue Republicans and Democrats can tackle
together. After meeting Mr Clinton, Governor Howard Dean, a Vermont Democrat
who heads the governors' association, said: 'There's real potential for some
good bipartisan co-operation on welfare reform.'
Mr Clinton has been talking about welfare reform since his presidential
campaign, but the money has not been found to pay for job retraining and
education programmes which the Administration wanted. Higher priority was
given to health insurance reform. After 17 months of internal debate, the
Administration finally introduced a welfare proposal, but it came too late
this year for Congressional action.
House Republicans are expected to propose abolition of over 100 federal
social programmes providing cash, food programmes, job training, child care,
foster homes and other services. The Dollars 60bn of programme funds would
be cut 20 per cent and the remainder handed over to the states to finance
their own programmes.

FT  10 DEC 94 / As They Say in Europe: When in Rome, do as the Muscovites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia and Italy can get muddled up. Doesn't Berlusconi remind you just a
bit of Yeltsin? 'If irreconcilable positions of the two sides prevail and
the legislature does not find a common language with the government on the
1995 budget, such a situation may well again raise the question of a
no-confidence vote in the government.' Not La Stampa, but a comment in the
Moscow paper, Rossiiskie Vesti.
It is, perhaps, the result of reporting on a society where tumult rules and
change often seems revolutionary. It also provides journalistic novelties.
Nezavisimaya Gazeta, one of the better Moscow dailies, ran a page of photos,
without comment, entitled 'Russian woman in an era of reform'. Beggars,
harlots, business-women and the super-rich - the pictures all authentically
Muscovite.
Today, Russia comes alive in the press - it never did in the old days. New
newspapers spring up; some, like Sevodnya, are very good.
It's not only the news that is exciting. There are tempting advertisements
for share offers of the kind killjoy governments have eliminated in richer
lands. 'Tomorrow will be better', one is headed.
The Russian Food Bank is offering Dollars 25m (Pounds 15.2m) in shares 'of
the highest category of reliability'. These will provide the investor with a
'stable foreign exchange income'. The whole is illustrated with a nice
picture of the Kremlin: one is transported back to those days when investing
was fun, unencumbered by dreary regulations, and able to proclaim guaranteed
high incomes from totally safe projects.
The freewheeling financial services sector overlaps with another sign of the
times. 'Crime has spread to just about all the branches of the national
economy and the budget. It accompanies all the directions of economic
reform,' said an interior ministry official, Viktor Salganov, in the daily,
Trud. Salganov is head of a department that struggles against economic
crime. He concludes by arguing, presumably in the face of a sceptical
readership: 'The crime wave can be stopped only with the help of the law.'
It is curious that his remark was made as the UN conference on organised
international crime in Naples got under way nearly two weeks ago. It was
there that the Russian interior minister, Viktor Yerin, said a 'cold war'
style scare over the Russian mafia was being whipped up to isolate the
country and harm its economy. But that cuts little ice back home.
How can it, when one reads among the trivia of everyday life of the
discovery of 'a secret arms dump' in Moscow?
The papers reported how a railway bridge in Moscow was blown up a few days
ago. An anonymous caller told the police of a 'mobile ammunition dump'. The
caller said: 'You will find it in Spartak Street, near the fence with a sign
that reads 'Alice Trailers'. A Zil-131 truck is there and the key is under
the left wheel.' A random, pointless tale of daily life in Moscow.
When Russian newspapers are not dealing with the harsh realities of everyday
existence, everything changes. They have always been good on what might be
called culture. Artistic life is important because the present period of
gigantic change has made reclaiming the nation's heritage one of the most
explosive issues in an already highly charged society. If it is captured by
the nationalist right we could all be in trouble.
There is a battle going on for control of the country's media, particularly
television. Parliament wants less government control, and the allocation of
subsidies to be made the responsibility of a non-government body. President
Yeltsin disagrees and wants to increase his influence over television by
merging the two main channels.
With news like this it is not surprising that Italy comes to mind. For sure,
the Russian and the Italian crises are more than a little different but you
would not know it if your knowledge came only from the newspapers of the
countries concerned. Compare Berlusconi with Yeltsin; the impasse over the
budget and who should control the broadcast media; the ubiquity of organised
crime and the vibrancy of the nation's culture.
But Italy is rich (for the time being at least) and Russia is more than
poor. It is mired in poverty and struggling with unimaginable problems as
whole sectors of the economy, and indeed of the country, seem to face
terminal collapse.
New countries have suddenly raised themselves to levels of wealth and
development that leave Russia far behind. But nobody could spend more than
five minutes reading the newspapers of most of those dynamic lands.
The concept of the all-conquering emerging market is one before which the
whole developed world routinely genuflects today. But one forgets how
desperately boring those places can be. Highly developed poverty may not be
worth aiming for, but it makes one think.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Private View: A modern-day Caxton - Christian Tyler meets
Charles Chadwyck-Healey, who is putting the world's literature on to compact
disc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five hundred years after the invention of the printing press, the second
publishing revolution is being ushered in by rows of patient typists in
Asia.
Much like the monks who sat on their high stools in medieval scriptoria
laboriously copying manuscripts, these workers are transferring the world's
literary heritage on to computers for publication on magnetic tape or
compact disc.
Unlike the monks, they have little understanding of the words they type. But
they are being paid piece-rate - so many cents per thousand words - by the
entrepreneurs of the electronic revolution.
One such is Sir Charles Chadwyck-Healey, an English baronet, who is
employing a Filipino contractor to have 100 scribes knock out the collected
works of Goethe - plus footnotes - from the old Gothic script. Other
Filipinos are retyping millions of words of faded Latin and Greek for a
database of the complete writings of the early Church Fathers.
'They guarantee us accuracy better than 99.9985 per cent,' said Sir Charles.
'We don't care how it's done: all we care about is the rate per thousand. If
it's a viable rate, then good luck to them]'
Forget the title and the double-barrelled moniker for a moment. Forget the
Eton and Oxford education. This is no languid aristocrat, but a hard-headed
buccaneer in the academic publishing market. Based in Cambridge and still
expanding, his company has subsidiaries in Paris, Madrid and Alexandria,
Virginia.
Chadwyck-Healey sprang to public notice two years ago when, in partnership
with the Hoover Institution, he clinched a contract to distribute on
microfilm the huge archive of the former Soviet Communist Party and state.
Earlier this year he completed a four-CD collection of all the published
English poets from Saxon times to 1900 (price Pounds 25,000).
I asked him whether book-publishing had had its day.
'No, it certainly hasn't,' he said. 'The book will continue for ever as far
as I am concerned. What's happening is that something else is growing - and
growing very fast.
'What we're experiencing here is very much what the early printers
experienced. Caxton didn't say: 'Oh, my God, I must commission some authors
to write books.' He took existing manuscripts and transcribed them into
print.
'In fact many scriptoria took Caxton's printed books and copied from them
because they were so much easier to read. And most of the early printers
went bust because they got it wrong. They hadn't got the marketing right.
They hadn't got the market out there. This will happen to many electronic
publishers.'
Although traditional publishers seemed frightened of the future, he said,
books would never die out because they are for many purposes (reading, for
instance) an efficient way of storing information. 'And we have a couple of
thousand years of indoctrination into being comfortable with books.
'Though,' he added, 'I suppose sociologists would say I might be comfortable
with books, being educated at Eton and Oxford, but actually 80 per cent of
the people in the world are extremely uncomfortable with them.'
The fifth baronet ('I thought the title might get in the way, but it
hasn't') studied science at school and geography at university, where, he
said, he was lucky to get a Third. He liked fast cars and still does. His
first job was as a photographer on a travel magazine called Go] and his
first enterprise was running a pair of trendy shops called Abacus.
'Then I spent six months writing three television plays. I thought I could
do one a month and make a living. But it put me off writing as a profession:
it was too demanding and isolated.'
The Chadwyck-Healey family had publishing interests but Sir Charles followed
his own nose. By 1972 he was ready to start up on his own in the microfilm
business, an unglamorous medium which is almost universally disliked. By the
end of the 1980s he was ready to go electronic; and today this is 60 per
cent of his business.
Most of the company's list consists of dry-as-dust bibliographies, indexes
and catalogues. More accessible, though still scholarly, are ventures such
as the Weimar edition of Goethe now under way (Pounds 3,000 for the
equivalent of 142 volumes) and an upcoming Voltaire Electronique for the
Voltaire Foundation.
Alongside the Patrologia Latina of the Church Fathers (Pounds 27,000 the
set) he is bringing out English Verse Drama (plays from 600AD to 1900), the
Bible in its main English versions and the prime editions of Shakespeare.
'Since we're at the beginning of all this, my motto is, let's occupy the
high ground. Let's not get bogged down too much in some of the
specialities.'
Sir Charles has contracts to publish back numbers of the 'serious' British
national dailies, including this one and its sister paper, The Economist.
Sometimes, the database can bite back. It is all too easy for the researcher
to discover, for instance, that Sir Charles's son, Edward, was arrested with
rowdy friends at Oxford for ripping up a municipal flower bed. Or to read
that his sister-in-law, Julia, is the Duchess of York's aunt, when in fact
she is Fergie's cousin.
I asked Sir Charles if his was a literary venture or just a library service.
'It's as creative as any publishing - in some ways more so,' he said.
'Publishers wait for an author to come to them with a manuscript and the
amount of editing that gets done is fairly minimal. To me the only really
creative person is the author.'
You obviously don't like publishers much.
'I like publishers very much, but I've never felt part of the publishing
establishment or been regarded as part. It's understandable. Our
publications are virtually invisible. They haven't got the impact of a
beautiful book - which is why we make so much effort with our brochures.'
Conventional publishers tended to recoil with horror at the electronic
medium because they could not understand the market, the high price of the
product or the long timescales involved.
Bookshops are however starting to retail CDs of dictionaries, encyclopaedias
and science for children, at between Pounds 60 and Pounds 80 a time. Sir
Charles said he was not interested in the consumer market.
'But we might, for example, license a publisher to put love poems on a
CD-Rom from our database, colour the CD pink and sell it in a kind of
Valentine's package.
'I wouldn't attempt to do that myself because I have no feel for that kind
of market. I often think that selling these databases is a bit like selling
an expensive Mercedes or something: you negotiate, you discuss, the months
roll by and suddenly an order appears.'
Among Chadwyck-Healey's institutional customers, however, things are
changing quickly. CDs are already going the way of microfilm and the
'virtual library' is round the corner.
To save space (even CDs take up room), smaller libraries are either asking
for the right to take words down the telephone line from a central
institution as they need them - the company has already negotiated one such
arrangement in the US - or even to be fed directly from Chadwyck-Healey's
own headquarters.
This raises the difficult question how far an electronic publisher can
license onward transmission of his 'books' without losing large amounts of
revenue and cutting his own commercial throat.
Pirating of electronic databases is too easy, Sir Charles said, and he is
afraid that a forthcoming European Union directive on copyright protection
will be much too weak.
At the same time he is trying - and so far failing - to negotiate with
publishers and other copyright holders for permission to bring out
electronic editions of modern literature.
'Our view is that you can print out of our databases until you're blue in
the face. As far as individuals are concerned we really encourage that. You
can go to a library which has our English Poetry and download all of
Tennyson if you like.
'What we don't want is someone setting up as an electronic publisher,
stealing half our database and undercutting us because he hasn't had our big
production costs.'
Of course you expect your return, I said. But won't others see electronic
material as common property? If you are ripped off will they shed any tears?
'I don't expect anyone to shed any tears. We can fight our own battles. But
if we invest a lot of money in selecting the books, deciding on the
editions, coding them with this very complex coding, then I think we have a
proprietary right to the data we have created in its electronic form.
'I am a relatively unsentimental person. We want to move on all the time. If
it turns out in two years that creation of full texts becomes pointless,
we'll just stop and do something else.'
What if all these texts end up under one roof, with people like you free to
charge us what you like for consulting them?
'At the end of the day anybody can do what we're doing. It's not as if we're
buying rights from Goethe's heirs so as to shut Goethe off from the rest of
the world for evermore.
'We're creating our own edition. If somebody doesn't want to use it, they're
free to create their own.
'Or they can just go on reading it out of a book.'

FT  10 DEC 94 / A nation warmed to take the cockle to its heart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enjoy a bouillabaisse?
You barbarian] What about the rights of the innocent cockles and mussels
plucked from sand and rock, thrown mercilessly into boiling water, solely
for the gastronomic satisfaction of humans?
This is the charge levelled against shellfish eaters by Animal Concern, a
vegetarian organisation that recently petitioned William Waldegrave, the
agriculture minister, to outlaw all types of shell fishing.
Britain is showing every sign of becoming the most animal-loony nation in
the world. The Jains of India sweep the path before them, and wear cloths
over their mouths, lest they inadvertently harm insects. But they are an
extreme religious sect; and live for the glory of God. Care for animals in
Britain is taken to extremes by a vociferous fringe who discredit those
whose concern for animals is reasonable and genuine.
Hunt saboteurs in their doomsday garb fail to convey the impression of
having a deep regard for animals, or the countryside.
Peculiar public reactions followed the latest death of a keeper, mauled in
John Aspinall's zoo. Animal 'experts' were summoned to examine the offending
Siberian tiger, and pronounced it 'not wicked'.
But how could the world's most powerful terrestrial carnivore be wicked if,
frustrated by incarceration, it occasionally wanted a dietary change? The
public reproaches heaped on this animal would not have been applauded by the
deceased keeper; he had made a pact that the animal should not be punished
if he were mauled.
We have a contradictory attitude to wildness in animals. We crave to see it,
touch it, but we simultaneously veer in the direction of sanitising it.
So people increasingly keep dangerous animals such as cross-bred wolf-husky
dogs as pets and then are surprised when, as happened recently, one attacks
its owner's child. What we want on the fireside rug is a reminder of the
animals we are banishing at an alarming rate from the great outside.
Britain is one of the world's most urban societies, and its inhabitants are
also great lovers of animals. This is no accident. People feel the need to
reconnect with the unpredictable, mysterious, non-neurotic world of nature
and wildlife.
This repressed nostalgia for wild environments has surfaced conspicuously in
the cries for a restored Great Caledonian Forest in the Cairngorms.
Enthusiasts talk wildly about bears, wolves, even genetically-recreated
aurochs, or aboriginal cattle, which will roam together. The forest will be
shady, capercallies gliding between the great pines; humans will play a part
as mushroom-gatherers harvesting the fruits of the forest floor. The appeal
of this lost world moves modern man who has to make do with the cat on the
mat.
But alienation from real processes in the animal world is almost complete.
Gross overstocking of Canada geese in the London parks produced a communal
wringing of hands, but confusion about a sensible culling policy. Shooting
the surplus birds, which were making mud-pie of the lakesides, was held to
be cruel, even though dispatch by a rifle shot is far kinder than the fate
which awaits most animals in the wild.
Similarly, public anxiety about the rate at which native British red
squirrels were being displaced by 'foreign' grey squirrels led to an
effective system of trapping the greys. But now people are worrying about
what happens to the unfortunate grey squirrels that fall into the traps.
They are killed of course. What else? Culling deer in public parks was
highly unpopular until supernumerary browsers started grazing on people's
garden shrubs.
Our society tries to eliminate cruelty but, through lack of understanding,
creates more. Cruelty to animals is the prolongation of pain, not the swift
taking of life.
A hue and cry arose recently about the transport of farm animals to overseas
slaughterhouses.
Yet the closure of hundreds of abattoirs in Britain because of trivial
hygiene failures and over-zealous EC sanitation rules has increased the
transport of farm animals. At the same time on-farm slaughter, unless
performed by an expensive vet, has been outlawed.
Traditionally, farmers killed their own livestock for eating. The sheep was
led into the barn, and its nose got deep into the corn before the farmer,
who may have assisted in its birth as a lamb, approached with the stun-gun
and killed it instantly.
Now, by EC law, a sheep must be herded into a truck, driven perhaps 100
miles to a slaughterhouse, pushed down the ramp into the odour of blood and
death, and fixed on to some ghastly assembly-line for the final meeting with
powerful electric nodes.
In the name of welfare, we have legislated for something far worse, which
costs more.
The call of the wild is in us all. The hunter-gatherer instinct is also a
strong one. On Brittany's summer shore at low tide hundreds of people pick,
rake, and probe for things to put in the bouillabaisse. The whole family
goes. It is neither unecological nor unsustainable. The scene was the same
hundreds of years ago.
The idea that to pull a whelk from its rock is cruel would be regarded in
France with incredulity. Such a perversion of values could happen only in
Britain. The nation of great animal lovers no longer dares to reason against
its sentimentality.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Arts: Prima donna past her prime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What do we do with the ageing prima donna? Do we allow fond memories of her
heyday to cushion her decline - or do we politely suggest she moves on to
less demanding roles where her experience can be put to advantage? Those
questions are posed by the new production of Richard Strauss's Die Frau ohne
Schatten at the Zurich Opera House, in which Gwyneth Jones sings the Dyer's
Wife. This is a part she has sung to justified acclaim in the past -
including one historic occasion in Zurich nine years ago when she sang the
Dyer's Wife and the Empress in the same performance.
Time has marched on, but not all of us are wiser. Dame Gwyneth still likes
to sing the part, to bask in the limelight it brings. She clearly needs that
kind of ego-boosting, adrenalin-pumping experience. The hit-or-miss
intonation, which was always her trademark, has become more distracting. The
beat in the voice is heavier. In the past, such flaws had to be set against
her charismatic stage presence, her ability to communicate 150 per cent.
But the flaws loom bigger now. She no longer looks the part, despite a
flattering brown wig. Gestures which were once an appealing part of her
stage make-up - such as that helpless look of put-upon innocence - have
become mannerisms. The Zurich audience indulged her, cheered her to the
roof. But Dame Gwyneth is living off her reputation. She is a crumbling
vision of her former self.
Now look at another soprano in the same cast - Anja Silja, whose voice was
long considered close to burn-out. Silja is older than Gwyneth Jones, but
has aged with dignity. She has graduated to roles which suit her, roles
which do not require pristine vocal quality - such as Herodias in Salome,
Emilia Marty in The Makropoulos Case (both of which she will sing in Britain
next year) and now the Nurse in Die Frau ohne Schatten. Silja dominated the
stage without appearing to try. Tall and shrewish, she moved with the
stealth of a predator, and once rejected, bore the crestfallen look of
someone mortally wounded: a classic portrayal.
The rest of the cast were comparative youngsters. Gosta Winbergh made a
cautious but convincing debut as the Emperor. Gabriele Lechner was a
gracious Empress, with a gleaming array of top notes. Alfred Muff was the
poetic Barak. All benefited from Christoph von Dohnanyi's conducting: the
orchestra has never sounded better.
Cesare Lievi's production was little more illuminating than the previous
instalments of his Strauss series in Zurich. His approach was deliberately
naive, barely suggesting the mystery or symbolism of the tale. David
Pizzigoni's postmodern sets, adorned with oriental motifs, had as much
atmosphere as an architect's model, but his costumes looked pretty.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Arts: Comic with rage beyond the laughs - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unless today's programme is utterly different from the first nine in the
series, Channel 4 will screen the funniest and sharpest programme of the
week at 10.05 tonight: Rory Bremner - Who Else? It has not been possible to
watch a preview tape because the programme was still being put together last
night, topicality being an important element. But a flop at this stage would
be astonishing. Between them, Bremner and his producers Geoff Atkinson and
Elaine Morris and, very importantly, John Bird and John Fortune, have now
developed a formula and a tone of voice which induces not only laughter but
cheering.
For too long in those few television comedy programmes where topicality
plays a part, it has been fashionable to be flippant; to give the impression
that, while you understand everything that means anything in the world today
 -the information superhighway, Take That, Michael Portillo - it is all
really too, too boring and the sooner this awful layer of pancake is removed
and the cheques dished out, the sooner we can all get back to the things
that really matter . . . soap commercials, corporate videos, that sort of
thing.
Of course there have been laughs in Knowing Me Knowing You, Clive Anderson
Talks Back and Have I Got News For You, even a few in Spitting Image, and a
lot in Drop The Dead Donkey. But it is difficult to imagine anybody in any
of those shows ever allowing honest-to-god anger, or even passionate
enthusiasm, to show through the pose of ennui and knowingness. When a tub of
lard was substituted for Roy Hattersley on Have I Got News For You it was
certainly funny, but there was no feeling that anybody really wanted to
offend poor old Roy. Sure enough they welcomed him onto the show a few weeks
later.
The loudest and longest laughs in Rory Bremner - Who Else? are prompted by
Bremner's stand-up sessions at the start and, most of all, the end of the
show when he delivers tour-de-force medleys of impressions. Last week he
segued through Victor Meldrew, Lloyd Grossman, Clive Anderson, Ronnie
Corbett, Barry Norman, Ian Paisley, Prince Philip, Lynne Faulds Wood and
Anne Robinson to Peter O'Sullevan - I may have missed one or two. The talent
of impressionists is currently out of fashion for some reason, but Bremner
has two strengths that put him above fashion: first, all his characters are
instantly recognisable and, second, he delivers good jokes.
Sometimes his own sketches are political, the government being his target
more often than not, which is proper enough since it is the government which
enacts legislation and affects our lives. Evidence suggests that Bremner's
personal beliefs lean left, so it is hardly surprising that in this series
he has developed a gormlessly grinning Tony Blair who avoids ever saying
anything definite, and a fine line in ridicule for the entire shadow
cabinet. They were recently shown smiling, drinking, and sailing to the tune
'Busy Doing Nothing'.
The significant point is that there is frequently a sense of anger, even
fury, behind the political content of the programme (which means much of it)
the greatest scorn often occurring in the material delivered by guest
performers. Sheila Hancock proclaimed a scathing revision of Margaret
Thatcher's quote from the prayer of St Francis: 'Where there is hatred let
me sow division; where there is injury, a reduced disability allowance . . .
where there is darkness let there be VAT on fuel; where there is sadness, a
telethon . . .'
There is nothing flippant about that, nor about the dialogues of the two
Johns which have become such a powerful element in the show. The fictional
interviews with politicians, civil servants, and especially chairmen of
privatised industries provide some of the funniest moments of the week: the
important difference between the chief executives of BT and the Post Office?
'Well his basic salary is Pounds 663,000 and mine is only Pounds 150,000.
Have you ever tried to live on Pounds 150,000 a year? Next door to
impossible'. Beyond the laughs there is unmistakable rage at the way we
continue to allow greed and sleaze to flourish alongside pain and poverty.
This series stands head, shoulders, and torso above the other topical comedy
programmes.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Arts: Veteran painters in abstraction - Alan Green and
Albert Irvin may not have won any prizes but their work is flourishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At 62 and 72 respectively, Alan Green and Albert Irvin qualify as veteran
painters in the true sense of the word, 'grown old in service; experienced
by long usage or practice; old soldiers.' More to the point, both are
abstract painters, which to many, such is the current orthodoxy of critical
debate, would seem to mark them out not so much as rare, but as irrelevant
beasts indeed.
On the one hand, the figurative-revisionist lobby comes close to arguing
that abstraction was an aberrant and sterile sport in the development of
modernism. On the other, we should remember that not since the 1960s has an
abstract painter of any kind been our principle representative at the Venice
Biennale; and not once has one won the Turner Prize, which in any case seems
now, after seven such winners on the trot, to be reserved exclusively for
sculptors.
The truth is that once developed, abstraction was never going to go away.
Moreover, from the hands of true artists from Mondrian to Pollock have come
some of the most physically beautiful and certainly most characteristic
works of our century. Here it flourishes, as it has done since the war, with
many of our more interesting painters, young and old, as committed to it as
ever - Fiona Rae, Alan Gouk, Basil Beattie, Bridget Riley, Trisha Gillman,
Jennifer Durrant, Peter Joseph, Sean Scully, Terry Frost, Patrick Heron -
the list is endless.
Green and Irvin, although they have won no prizes, no public honours, no
great retrospectives, are as distinguished as any of them. Between
themselves, they could hardly present a greater contrast. Green is the more
classical of the two, his work coming out of the constructivist tradition,
architectural and rectilinear in its disposition, minimalist in its
tendency. To describe it, even now when it has withdrawn from the more
extreme simplicity of recent years, is almost to describe nothing - muted
colours; close tones; the composition a matter of simple verticals and
horizontals.
But that says nothing of the richness of the surface, with its pigment
worked so lovingly, raked and hoed like the richest soil, albeit a mere
patch, a pocket handkerchief. These are small paintings, yet the vigour so
evident in their working gives them a physical presence quite
disproportionate to their scale. All, so far, is on the surface, to be
relished as the surface - texture, colour and tone all singing together in
close and silent harmony, 'for there is a musick wherever there is a
harmony, order or proportion', as old Thomas Browne said.
But there is more to them than that, for these are pictures: all their
surface and physical qualities have pictorial and imaginative qualities to
complement them. All abstract painting has a sense of landscape to it, by
the simple fact that even a single mark laid upon a surface will work
pictorially upon the imagination by the suggestion of space. An horizontal
becomes an horizon, and any vertical interposed will articulate the space
between. Are Green's horizontals, then, true horizons, his verticals and
cross-members monumental structures, or are they only possibly such things?
Are they even these things, and at the same time not these things at all?
Such imaginative ambiguity is for us to reconcile.
If Green is the classical, Albert Irvin is manifestly the romantic, and yet
the point of the landscape possibilities of abstraction applies equally to
him and his work. It is just that Turner rather than Mondrian is his hero,
and the ambiguous suggestion is achieved by atmospheric clouds and sweeps of
colour rather than by line. Music too comes into it, though Wagner and Verdi
rather than Satie.
It must be said that in recent years Irvin seems to have settled upon the
major keys, and even the same tunes. The energy, the sheer gusto of the
work, and the particular variations that inevitably follow notwithstanding,
the formal structure he employs seem now to be set in a consistent pattern -
a huge colour-field filled to a consistent density, flat up to the
picture-plane, with blocks and circles overlaid cross-wise with broad
swathes of clean, vivid colour.
The physical excitement and delight he takes in the act of painting are
infectious, and his technical control over so ebullient a temperament,
exercised on so vast a scale, is remarkable. To note a formulaic quality,
when an artist such as Green is clearly and necessarily formulaic, is
therefore not to carp. But Irvin is so different, so openly intuitive and
spontaneous in his approach, that one only wonders how considered, or
unconsidered, his formula has become.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Arts: They're the Topps]
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If this year produces other Yuletide entertainment on the level of the Topp
Twins's Topp Secret, it will be a vintage Christmas. This confirms my
reaction to the Topp Twins in Edinburgh this summer: love. Most of their
current show is new - and if we have seen before such things as Lynda Topp
getting carried away doing the spoons, what of it?
And yet it is hard to explain their spell. The snobs among you may not
thrill to hear that Les Topps (a) come from New Zealand (b) are
squirrel-faced identical twins (c) are lesbians (d) sing a lot of
country-and-western music. But who could resist them? The characters they
play most of the time are over-energetic spinsters, jolly and Down Under, so
ludicrously over-committed to country-and-western that the audience cannot
help but howl with laughter at music-making that actually they make
extremely well. And who could resist the way they wear their
country-and-western outfits? The fringed sleeves, the hats, the checked
mini-skirts with waistlines hoisted halfway up their diaphragms.
'I'd like to introduce you to the Yodelling Sweetheart of the Tennessee
Weightwatchers Club', says Jools. And while the yodelling song starts, Lynda
 -the plumper of the two - starts to get those spoons going. She has a few
problems at first, but soon she has got the utensils rattling like metal
maracas, bouncing off her elbows, her knees, her pelvis; and off the
audience too.
All of which distracts the audience from noticing how well the Topps (Jools
especially) sing and play their songs. In fact, they let country-and-western
music, in its best blend of rhythm and melody, seduce you insidiously. But
there are innumerable moments that reveal the quality of their musicality.
'Martina', for example, starts with an agitato strum on the guitars, a
unison staccato turn of the heads - and then a soft glissando strum that
takes us completely by surprise . . . You may forget this, of course, and
remember only the words ('Oh oh Martina . . . Now the ball's in your court .
. . I don't miss the sex, I'm going out with your ex, She'll write a book
about me.')
Their purity in music-making and their absurdity in words or action is what
makes the Topps unique. By the end, they can afford to be serious, but the
main sensation they generate is not laughter or sympathy - but sheer joy.
Drill Hall, WC1 until Jan 7

FT  10 DEC 94 / Arts: An Oliver] for the nineties - A spectacular staging
evokes Dickens' world of Romantic despair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new Cameron Mackintosh production of Lionel Bart's 1960 musical Oliver]
is - of course - a spectacular hit. It has been announced for months;
bookings are already being taken for five months hence; and I noticed, as I
rushed to my deadline from the theatre, that Liberty's already has a window
of the 'Who will buy' scene.
To find fault with a hit of this order would be about as practical as trying
to stand in the way of a herd of charging bison - though I, who have a
kamikaze instinct in these matters, have a fault or two I will in due course
try to find.
But first I report that I did all those things you hope to do at a musical -
gasped, laughed, cried. And the composer, who was sitting behind me on
opening night, sounded as if he was hyperventilating - with, I hope,
pleasure.
Spectacular is the key word. Sam Mendes's staging starts with a terrific
image - Oliver's pregnant mother Agnes rushing in lonely misery against a
violent storm - and at once we are in the bleak world of Romantic despair
that is vital to the original Dickens novel. Then in moments we are in the
symmetrical militaristic regime of the workhouse. The next half-hour, it
must be said, sags.
The original Oliver] was spectacular too, by the standards of its day; it
was probably the first West End show I ever saw, as a titch in short
trousers, and my memories are largely of the amazing revolving stage.
In the 1994 Oliver] the stage does not turn - but once we are on the streets
of London, in the company of the Artful Dodger, Anthony Ward's scenery
begins to do marvels. Brilliantly, Ward puts St Paul's Cathedral and other
sights before us in breathtaking succession - and reminds us that Bart's
musical is actually a lovesong to London. What a gift to the tourist trade
this staging is] And yet resident Londoners may watch it with even stronger
emotion.
Bart's Oliver] is also a lovesong to the traditions of the music-hall. Bart,
in 1960, was far from original in this (it is, indeed, easy to see that he
was simply doing to Dickens what My Fair Lady had done to Shaw, and that
'Consider yourself' very cleverly repeats the formula of 'Get me to the
church on time') but so what? In the 1994 staging, it is Matthew Bourne's
choreography that is most alert to the music-hall element of this musical;
and, watching some of the wonderful traditional steps Bourne gives Fagin
(Jonathan Pryce) and his thief-children in 'Be Back Soon', I cried in
wonder. What British choreographer since Frederick Ashton has shown so much
sense of the musical wit of these old music-hall steps?
Still, this staging is better seen than heard. William David Brown's
orchestrations and Martin Koch's musical supervision do Bart's score no
favours. The most original and beautiful musical episode in Oliver] is 'Who
will Buy?' - the fantasia of arching street-melodies all overlapping and
prompting Oliver himself to his one moment of lyric radiance ('Who will buy
this wonderful morning?'). The street-songs (which so touchingly show Bart's
love of bygone London traditions) should drop upon the still morning air and
illumine it.
But the whole scene here feels pre-packaged and undersung. The ensemble
radiance that should infect Oliver is here replaced by neat, tepid cuteness.
Little Adam Searles's Artful Dodger is the first performance that gives the
production the shot of spontaneous energy and charm it needs. He is only a
child, but he has the kind of winning chuckle, smile, and bubble that many
adult performers try for in vain. He and his chums, leading us to Fagin and
the thieves' kitchen introduce us to the production's star - Jonathan Pryce.
Here too is an artist who takes command of the whole show from his first
appearance.
Tall, piratical, canny, Pryce is a consummate performer; just hear how he
draws out an elaborate cadenza in 'Pick a Pocket or Two' and then,
economically but deftly, coughs.
Next we meet Sally Dexter's Nancy - not only the best singing of the evening
but also the most generous attention to her every fellow performer and the
most thrilling energy. These three performers carry the show to triumph.
And yet, and yet . . . Several times my eyes filled with tears, not thanks
to the current performance, but because it so frequently failed to match the
eloquence of the original cast album - which, ah me, I grew up on.
The Palladium cast is strong in rhythm (except in the slow, lyrical numbers)
but shockingly dull in melodic phrasing or in dynamic variety. The great
ascents of Beadle Bumble's 'One Boy, Boy for Sale' fall flat, as do the
plaintive repetitions of 'Where is Love?' from Oliver (James Daley). The
Sowerberries wreck the witty, urbane, creepy 'That's your funeral' by
shouting it.
For this, Mendes - sometimes Bourne too - must take responsibility; but what
the show needs most is better musicianship. Neither Pryce nor Dexter make
the great impression that they could in their big solos.
You will never know why Oliver] inspires such affection if you only listen
to the current cast. But anyone with an eye will be impressed and sometimes
thrilled.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Arts: It's all in the voice - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For all its innate superiority, the senior service lags behind television in
the mater of free expression. Take Two Way Cut. This serial about Glaswegian
cops and particularly nasty murder (decapitation) would, on television,
entail raw nerves, toughness and abrasiveness. On Radio 4 one marvels at the
mild-mannered articulateness of it all. Dick Barton, Special Agent was
surely more gritty, despite the current would-be verismo use of location
recording, surely the most expensive bluff ever foisted by producers on to
costing departments. The mania for realistic radio drama - I remember a BBC
Bristol director years ago making an actress strip to her underwear in the
studio when the script required it - suggests that these producers might be
happier in film and to hell with it.
Voices matter in radio, not atmospheric mush, boom and twitter, certainly
not squeaky bedsprings or creaking floorboards. This fundamental radiophonic
grammar is constantly flouted by casting that disregards the basic rule:
that character is expressed by the voice and that voices must be
distinguishable from one another. The problem recrudesces with the return of
Sherlock Holmes to the airwaves. In spite of a bombardment of complaining
letters, the BBC persists in offering Clive Merrison and Michael Williams as
Holmes and Watson, excellent actors but confusingly similar to the aural
palate. Don't radio producers audition with their eyes shut? They should.
The old Gielgud-Richardson casting had the right idea, though the ideal
partnership was Carleton Hobbs and Norman Shelley in the ever-lamented
Children's Hour.
Still, children are getting a good deal from Radio 4's new adaptation of The
Wizard of Oz, a nicely unforced Anglo-American blend led by Barbara Barnes
and numbering in the cast Philip Franks (winning the nation's hearts as Tom
Pinch in the junior service's Chuzzlewit). How well, alas, an English accent
conveys charming inadequacy.
An Australo-American accent suits the mad dogs and insomniacs who spend the
small hours with the World Service. Last week Pop on the Line, the biggest
phone-in around, presented Kylie Minogue to her admirers and a grateful
telecommunications industry. Brutally honest, she doesn't mind telling
people her age (26), though a question about scanty clothing in pop videos
reduced her to gasps and giggles at the intellectual challenge of it all.
The presenter gallantly answered for her, explaining that Kylie was
expressing herself, and that was part of her. He added hastily that she
doesn't walk down the street scantily clad. She agreed on this point.
To a fan in Kenya who asked about filming with Jean-Claude Van Damme she
replied mysteriously that he was 'well and truly stacked in the body
department' but added ominously that he was delighted that she was 'five
foot noth ing' as it made him look tall. A girl in Sweden asked how Kylie
entered the music business, a question that occurs to all who hear her sing.
She put it down to instinct. 'I felt like pursuing music,' she explained. I
hope she catches it.
The excellent Scapegoats reached the mentally ill and a chilling catalogue
of callousness and crookedness. It traced attitudes to the mad from the
divinely punished to victims of society, from Bedlam through big business to
beatification via RD Laing. From segregation to integration; and the
alarming evidence that public tolerance is again strained. We heard from
Edna, committed by her grandfather to Rampton as 'a moral imbecile' for
going to the cinema with a young man. She was kept there for 20 years. Now
that statistics show that immigrants have a higher rate of 'madness', uneasy
questions arise about how we perceive the inconvenient.

THE DEMJANJUK AFFAIR: THE RISE AND FALL OF A SHOW-TRIAL by Yoram Sheftel
Gollancz Pounds 18.99, 379 pages
This book reads like one of those paperback courtroom thrillers you devour
on long-haul flights. It has fast cars, beautiful girls, unfair judges and
dishonest prosecutors involved in an international cover-up and, at the end
of the day, our plucky defense lawyer and his innocent client triumph
against overwhelming odds.
But, for all its page-turning and sometimes frankly tacky style, The
Demjanjuk Affair tells a true and important story. Written by Yoram Sheftel,
the defense lawyer in the case the book describes, it is the tale of how, in
one of the most publicised war crimes trials of the decade, Israel very
nearly executed the wrong man.
In 1986 John Demjanjuk, an retired auto-worker living in Cleveland, was
extradited to Israel to be tried on charges that he was a Ukrainian guard at
the Treblinka concentration camp, known as 'Ivan the Terrible' for the
sadistic pleasure he took in abusing prisoners. Demjanjuk was imprisoned in
Jerusalem for seven years and found guilty and sentenced to death before an
overwhelming body of evidence - discovered by the defence only late in the
case - compelled the Israeli Supreme court to overturn the verdict and allow
him to return home.
Sheftel leads readers on a racy romp through the twists and turns of this
tale - which includes the suspicious suicide of one of his partners,
rummaging through garbage cans outside the US Department of Justice for
concealed evidence, and trips to Warsaw and the Crimea - but he ends with a
damningly serious conclusion.
Sheftel contends that Demjanjuk was not merely the victim of a sad case of
mistaken identity. Instead, by the end of the book, Sheftel has concluded
that 'Not only was the wrong man put on trial; the whole affair began with a
despicable plot, an international conspiracy of five countries - the Soviet
Union, Poland, the United States, Germany and Israel.'
Sheftel argues, and subsequent decisions by American courts overturning the
initial extradition of Demjanjuk have supported this view, that the Office
of Special Investigations, the branch of the US Justice Department
established to investigate war criminals living in America, knew all along
that Demjanjuk was not 'Ivan the Terrible.' But the OSI, according to
Sheftel, concealed exonerating evidence from the defence (these are the
documents discovered in the DC trash bins) because of its overpowering
desire to secure a conviction.
He accuses Poland, Germany and the Soviet Union of going along with the
American plot and concealing documents in their own possession which would
also have helped to prove that Demjanjuk was the wrong Ivan. But Sheftel
reserves special venom for what he calls the 'Israeli establishment.' In its
eagerness to 'conduct a special 'Israeli-style' show-trial, to teach Israeli
children the story of the Holocaust,' Sheftel argues that the Israeli
criminal justice system very nearly 'murdered' an innocent man and debased
the memory of the Holocaust.
These are serious charges, but Sheftel backs them up with a wealth of
evidence, and they have been broadly endorsed by rulings in American and
Israeli courts. It is this miscarriage of justice - which Sheftel, with huge
arrogance but an equal measure of justification, compares to the Dreyfuss
Affair - that makes The Demjanjuk Affair an important book.
Some readers might disregard this book's powerful message in their distaste
for its tone. Sheftel has made no effort to adopt a dispassionate, objective
stance. His 'beautiful, new, dazzling white Porsche 924' appears four times
in the first 25 pages, his mother's Yiddish sayings pop up repeatedly and
cliches, especially those involving fire, seem to hold a magnetic appeal.
But for all his unabashed self-promotion - Sheftel admits this was the case
of his career and takes an unholy delight in the humiliation of his
opponents - he tells a story worth reading. If I were ever unfairly accused
of a serious crime I would want this courageous egoist to be my lawyer.

WINCHELL: GOSSIP, POWER AND THE CULTURE OF CELEBRITY by Neal Gabler Knopf
Dollars 30, 681 pages
Modern journalism has its angels and its devils, its pundits and
polemicists, its scandal and hate-mongers and gossips and those whom even
the mightiest governments could not ignore. Yet surely no American in the
20th century has embodied all these qualities, good and bad, as much as
Walter Winchell.
Neal Gabler's vivid book is not merely the chronicle of an extraordinary
life. It is also an indispensable guide to the rise and rise of the tabloid
media. As one contemporary observer noted, 'calling Winchell a mere gossip
writer is like calling Lindbergh a mere aviator,' no mean compliment to the
son of impoverished Russian Jewish immigrants who started his working life
as a Vaudeville hoofer.
His 40-year journalistic career encompassed, consecutively, newspapers,
radio and the early days of television, with a brief digression into film.
All the great trends and events of his times were the subject of his pen and
voice. He was the principal chronicler of the glamour of Broadway in the
1920s, the flowering of the cafe society in New York in the 1930s and the
emergence of Hollywood.
Winchell practically invented celebrity journalism as we now know it. Damon
Runyon, his personal friend, Hemingway and Mencken all thought his style
unique and admirable but he made his enemies, too, like Ed Sullivan, a
contemporary rival and later the TV host who introduced the Beatles to
America.
But once established as the king of his gossip realm and with a radio
audience running into 70m a week, he turned to politics and the affairs of
the world. In one of his smartest acts, Franklin Roosevelt invited Winchell
round to the White House for a brief chat in the first week after his
presidential inauguration. No precise record of what passed between them
exists beyond the columnist's notoriously exaggerated recollection, but the
result was that the president acquired a supporter-for-life.
The New Deal had no larger public booster than Walter Winchell and, at a
time when fascism was a force in American politics, no more early and
vociferous American opponent than Adolf Hitler. Although Winchell was, like
the rest of his country, equivocal on whether the US should enter the war in
1939, he thought his president was right to support Britain with the
lend-lease programme - and British intelligence was smart enough to
understand his public influence and to feed him material (so, for different
ulterior motives, did J Edgar Hoover of the FBI).
His progressive record, most noteably on race relations, made it all the
more extraordinary that he joined Joe McCarthy's witch-hunt. Gabler traces
this to a famous incident at the Stork Club involving Josephine Baker, the
black entertainer, who walked out in disgust at not being served promptly.
This turned Winchell's anti-fascist guns on all 'ungrateful' liberals and
communists, with Hoover, as ever, stoking his fire. The columnist was there
at all the great Washington hearings of the mid-1950s, as much of a
celebrity as those on the bench and in the dock. As McCarthy fell, so did
Winchell and his reputation never recovered.
His decline into irrelevance and poverty again had its occasional
counterpoints. His distinctive machine gun voice could be heard again in the
early 1960s as the narrator of The Untouchables, the TV crime series; the
late Burt Lancaster caught his personality dead to rights in his portrayal
of JJ Hunsecker, the unscrupulous gossip columnist in the film The Sweet
Smell of Success.
But his spirit and approach does live today. As a gossip columnist, he
relied on and thus legitimised 'press agents,' forerunners of today's
ubiquitous public relations industry; current American fascination with
celebrity trials (OJ Simpson, the Menendez brothers, the Bobbitts and
Hardings) has roots in Winchell's intense coverage of Bruno Hauptmann,
convicted for kidnapping the Lindbergh baby. And if Rush Limbaugh, the
modern radio polemicist, and all his coterie want to look up family trees,
they need search no farther than Walter Winchell.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Books: From Elvis to punk - Nostalgia rules as Peter Aspden
tunes into the year's pop books
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As if sensing its own decline, pop music is delving more and more into the
past to discover its true worth; and nowhere can this be seen more clearly
than in its literature.
The pick of these year's pop books fittingly tackle two of the genre's
greatest legends: Elvis Presley and The Beatles. Peter Guralnick's Last
Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley (Little, Brown Pounds 17.99)
chronicles just a small part of his subject's life - up to his mother's
death in 1958 - but how refreshing it is to see an author concentrating on
Presley's formative, classic years rather than dwell morbidly on his
decline.
Guralnick's account is a welcome corrective to those who believe that Elvis
was just a good-looking boy who was in the right place at the right time. He
was also, notwithstanding his youth, an immensely dedicated and
self-confident artist whose perfectionism exasperated colleagues; the rough
spontaneity of a classic like 'Hound Dog', for example, required no fewer
than 30 studio takes before the singer declared his satisfaction. The book
also evokes marvellously the atmosphere of rural America in the 1950s.
Ian MacDonald's Revolution in the Head: The Beatles' Records and the Sixties
(Fourth Estate, Pounds 15) also makes the point that success and
super-stardom were not achieved with the apparent effortlessness which the
group's best songs managed to convey. His track-by-track analysis, unafraid
of explaining seemingly trivial points with quite complex musical
terminology, will prove irresistible to any fan; equally impressive,
however, is the subtle, elegaic essay at the front of the book which is one
of the most convincing cultural analyses of recent British musical history
which you could ever hope to read.
Elsewhere, we have had the usual mix of embarrassingly hagiographic
biographies and serious, polytechnic-lecturer theses which attempt to locate
the importance of popular music in society-at-large. These latter affairs,
on the whole joyless and ponderously-written, are a result of the
spectacular growth of subjects such as cultural studies in higher education,
which legitimises doctoral dissertations on . . . well, just about anything
really.
One of the best of these books is George Lipsitz's Dangerous Crossroads:
Popular Music, Postmodernism and the Poetics of Place (Verso, Pounds 18.95),
a collection of essays which looks at the subject of ethnicity in music. The
mix of different cultural soundtracks is one of the most characteristic
features of today's music, and most of these pieces are intelligent and
well-conceived.
Which is more than can be said of most of the biographies on offer. Once
more, the goodies are the oldies. Ray Coleman's Clapton: the Authorised
Biography (Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, Pounds 15.99), an easy enough read, perfectly
reflects the man's current musical output: pleasant and unchallenging. The
subject of Jeremy Reed's Waiting for the Man: A Biography of Lou Reed
(Picador, Pounds 14.99) could never be accused of that, but he has become
increasingly difficult to take seriously, scarcely deserving of the iconic
status ascribed by the author (no relation).
The most pretentious offering around is Ray Davies's X-Ray: The Unauthorised
Autobiography (Viking, Pounds 16), in which a fictitious 'journalist' gets
Davies to open up on his life in the 1960s, although there are some nuggets
in the over-confused narrative. A more entertaining account of that decade's
excesses is provided by Marianne Faithfull and her co-author David Dalton in
Faithfull (Michael Joseph, Pounds 15.99), written with good humour and a
certain amount of battered dignity.
Moving into (slightly) more recent history, Carl Magnus Palm's Abba: The
Complete Recording Sessions (Century, Pounds 12.95) is a good example of a
pop act, notwithstanding phenomenal sales and even a cult retro following,
being unable to withstand detailed critical attention. Palm has done his
homework, however, and some of the early pictures are hilarious.
A man who seems to keep up with the feelings and desires of each successive
generation is Neil Young; The Rolling Stone Files (Sidgwick &amp; Jackson,
Pounds 15.99) is a revealing and poignant collection of articles from the
magazine's archives, and a fascinating insight into the changing face of
rock journalism over the past 25 years.
But then again, time and pop music have a strange relationship. Delving into
George Gimarc's Punk Diary 1970-1979: An Eyewitness Record of the Punk
Decade (Vintage, Pounds 8.99), I was reminded that there were just four
years between the release of the Beatles' final album, Let It Be, and the
first Ramones gig. To listen to the two groups' music, you would put them
100 years apart; but things moved fast in those days. If nobody comes up
with any bright ideas, expect both a punk and a Beatles revival for 1995,
and expect them to be written about in yet more loving detail.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Books: Sad Little Prince
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER

<TEXT>
SAINT-EXUPERY by Stacey Schiff Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 25, 525 pages
Who is the most popular French writer outside France? Not Moliere, nor
Sartre, nor even Simenon, but the war pilot Antoine de Saint-Exupery. His
children's story The Little Prince, about an aviator who crashes in the
Sahara Desert and wakes up beside the little prince, visiting from another
star, runs into more foreign editions than any French book.
Written in lonely wartime exile in New York, The Little Prince was bundled
off to the publishers as Saint-Exupery boarded a ship for north Africa in
1943 and persuaded the American forces to take him on as a reconnaissance
pilot. The next year, deviating from his flight plan so that he could
glimpse his childhood haunts in southern France, he disappeared. His plane
was never recovered.
As romantic and mysterious as his fiction, Saint-Exupery's life was steeped
at once in the pioneering spirit of early aviation and in nostalgia for the
chivalry of the 19th century. Born in 1900 into an aristocratic family, he
spent an idyllic childhood in a chateau at the foot of the Jura mountains.
At 12, he made his first flight - four years after the Wright brothers - and
was hooked. He joined the French air force, then flew in north Africa as a
member of the Air Mail Service - the subject of his first book, Southern
Mail.
In 1931 in Argentina he met a glamorous young widow called Consuelo. He
invited her for a flight then and there, and demanded from the cockpit that
she kiss him. When she refused, he threatened to crash the plane because he
was too ugly to win her love. A few months later, with the bride dressed in
black, they married.
But his obsession with flying took its toll, and the couple rapidly and
resentfully came to lead separate lives. They competed to see who could stay
out latest, habitually standing each other up on midnight dinner dates. They
could not have a baby, Saint-Exupery said, because Consuelo's socialising
was so hectic that she would leave it in a taxi.
To escape, he made ever more reckless trips. Trying to break the record for
a flight from Paris to Saigon, he and his mechanic crashed in the desert and
nearly died of thirst; how they were rescued by an Arab is told in Wind,
Sand and Stars. Back home in France, he wrote to the family that had saved
him: 'Here the world looks less like a desert but in reality it is more so.'
Saint-Exupery never accommodated to his own times. His manner was
old-fashioned, aristocratic, exquisitely courtly - the style of The Little
Prince. He was an idealist whose over-riding concern was man's spiritual
needs in the new technological age. Like many children's writers he never
grew up - his favourite pastime was to fly paper aeroplanes off the Empire
State Building.
This is the second major English biography of Saint-Exupery in two years.
Stacey Schiff is more comprehensive and detailed than Paul Webster (Antoine
Saint-Exupery: The Life and Death of the Little Prince, Macmillan), but far
less readable. Her style is fussy, her interpretation of her subject's
writing muddled and convoluted. She does however, throw extensive and
important new light on the composition of The Little Prince, much of it
written at the home of Sylvia Reinhardt, a young American who was besotted
with Antoine.
He was, according to Schiff, by this time impotent; moreover he spoke no
English and Sylvia had no French. But she served him fried eggs and English
muffins by candlelight whenever he called, and provided a doll and a poodle
as models for the prince and the sheep. Then she listened, rapt though
without understanding a word, as Saint-Exupery read from the manuscript.
Schiff sees the Little Prince as a 'cosmic urchin.' Webster, more
convincingly and sympathetically, reads the book as a love letter to
Consuelo, who is characterised as the rose. After he had finished it,
Saint-Exupery wrote that he was 'indifferent to life.' The climax to this
story, his madcap despairing wartime flights, is breathtaking and
heartbreaking.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Books: An epic study of the genesis of greatness - Patti
Waldmeir on Nelson Mandela, the man who refused to hate
</HEADLINE>

LONG WALK TO FREEDOM by Nelson Mandela Little, Brown Pounds 20, 630 pages
Everybody likes a story where good triumphs over evil, where great men do
battle over humanity's most dearly-cherished ideals: freedom, equality, and
the brotherhood of man. That is why South Africa's story fascinated the
world.
It was a natural thriller, a story of human greatness culminating in one of
history's truly transcendent moments. As a crowd-pleaser, it could not fail.
Neither can the latest contribution to the tale: Nelson Mandela's
autobiography.
Mandela, who has recently completed six months as president of a new,
democratic South Africa is one of the most compelling figures of the 20th
century. He refuses to hate, although hatred would seem not only
understandable but more rational than its opposite. He is tireless in wooing
those who oppressed him, even to the point of angering his own supporters.
He always takes the long view. No wonder right-wing whites say he is a gift
from God, and supporters of the former ruling National party admit to
praying nightly for his well-being.
Mandela is not a saint, though. And although his autobiography reflects a
character seldom given to self-doubt - he seems certain that he always had
right firmly on his side - it profiles a man, not a super-natural agent of
good. His memoirs are never merely self-indulgent: each episode represents
an essential building block in the construction of the Mandela character.
From the moment of his birth into the royal family of the Thembu tribe in
the Transkei black homeland, he begins to learn the lessons of leadership
which he draws on - 600 pages and seven decades later - to guide a reluctant
African National Congress to eventual agreement with the white minority
government. For although Mandela often disclaims personal responsibility for
the deal which ended apartheid - going out of his way to stress the
deadlock-breaking initiatives taken by, among others, South African
Communist party chairman Joe Slovo - this is the story of the political and
emotional evolution of a great leader of men.
There are glimpses of human weakness: after young Mandela flees an arranged
marriage in the Transkei, he leaves a trail of lies and half-truths which
land him in endless trouble. And, to the very end, he remains unable to
detect guilt in his wife, Winnie, despite her conviction on kidnapping
charges; the book's most moving passages reveal his love for the beautiful
young Winnie, his desire for her during decades in prison, and his devotion
to her despite their 1992 decision to separate.
Winnie is the centre of Mandela's personal tragedy: that he was forced to
sacrifice his personal life to the liberation cause, not only while in
prison but for the five years since his release. Mandela today lives largely
alone, bereft of the family comforts which formed the substance of so many
prison dreams.
Forced to choose between his role as father of the nation or father of the
family, Mandela knows he chose correctly. He regrets the consequences -
among them, the pressures which probably helped to drive Winnie to illegal
acts - but he does not regret his choice. Commitment made that inevitable.
Mandela avoids dwelling on this personal tragedy, or on the demeaning and
de-humanising experiences of his long life as a prisoner. He mentions them
almost in passing and focuses instead on his efforts, often successful, to
triumph over his captors by using persuasion and charm - plus his sharp wits
as a trained lawyer - to defeat a brutal system.
Nowhere is Mandela's extraordinary character apparent more readily than in
his relationship with his warders: his steadfast refusal to blame the
individual for the evils of a political system; his joy at detecting a
'glimmer of humanity' in one of his guards; his patient efforts to persuade
them of his cause - efforts which, surprisingly, often succeeded.
This tale of struggle and suffering is leavened throughout by Mandela's
impish wit: ghost-writer Richard Stengel is remarkably adept at capturing
the voice of Mandela at its most relaxed and entertaining. Although his
prepared speeches often are heavy and dull, Mandela is a superb impromptu
raconteur. This survives Stengel's editing of the first parts of the book -
composed in jail and buried in the prison garden for safekeeping - and the
fact that he wrote most of the latter section on the basis of interviews
with Mandela.
Overwhelmingly, though, this is not a book about Mandela's love of gardening
(he provided home-grown vegetables to the prison warders); or about his
sight-seeing forays in the Cape, guided by warders who tormented him
unwittingly by giving him opportunities to escape which he knew he must not
take; or about his decision to build a retirement home in the Transkei based
on the floor plan of his prison bungalow. It is a serious book about his
political evolution - from Thembu loyalist, to African nationalist, to
violent revolutionary, to world-class statesman.
It is one of the most extraordinary political tales of the 20th century and
well worth the investment for anyone truly interested in the genesis of
greatness.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Outdoors: A classic of British know-how - Motoring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL

<TEXT>
Why have four-wheel drive? Quite simply, to maximise traction. Normally,
drivers exploit it to keep going across country - as I did in the Range
Rovers I enthused about here two weeks ago - or when the tarmac disappears
beneath snow and ice. But four-wheel drive also has a calming effect on
high-performance cars. It makes fierce acceleration usable for fast, safe
overtaking without risking loss of grip.
On-road 4x4 cars are always well balanced and never feel as though they want
to bite the hand that steers them. In the past few weeks, I have sampled
three of them, all quite different. Two were Audi quattros: the A8 and Avant
RS2. The third was the daddy of them all, the Jensen FF.
Many people are unaware that Audi's turbo-charged quattro coupe of 1980 was
not the first on-road 4x4. Jensen got there first in 1966. This small West
Bromwich firm built 320 FFs between 1966 and 1971, plus larger numbers of
the rear-wheel driven Interceptor on which the FF 4x4 was based. It was a
great car but, sadly, not a commercial success; Jensen went bust in 1975.
The benefits of all-wheel drive for road-going cars, along with anti-lock
brakes - the FF pioneered those, too - were not appreciated widely at the
time. Even if they had been, few could have afforded one. In 1967, the FF
cost Pounds 5,339 - roughly as much as a Rolls-Royce. An Interceptor was
only Pounds 3,742.
Typical FF owners were aristocrats, showbiz people and professional golfers
on a winning streak. Their Pounds 5,339 bought a beefy but elegant two-door,
four-seater with a massive 6,276cc Chrysler V8 engine producing around 330
horsepower.
All four wheels were driven permanently through Ferguson Formula (hence the
FF) transmission and a three-speed automatic gearbox. The disc brakes
incorporated Dunlop's Maxaret anti-lock system, used until then only on
aircraft.
The FFs were 20 years ahead of their time, and many survive. (In contrast to
some of the rubbishy cars called classics nowadays merely because they are
old, FFs really are classics worth saving.)
You could call the Interceptor and FF barrel-chested cars. They look like
identical twins, although the FF is a little longer and heavier.
I found it to be sprung far more firmly than an Interceptor, while its
agility made it very light on its feet. It was no less effortless to drive.
The transmission shifted smoothly and the steering was amply power-assisted.
Even by today's standards, it was extremely muscular, yet its manners were
courtly.
Inevitably, the 34-year-old FF showed its age in some respects. Compared
with its 1994 equivalent, the Audi A8 quattro, which I had driven to
Shepperton, its shallow windscreen made it seem beetle-browed.
The minor controls were less ergonomic, the interior not so spacious. It
seemed a broadsword of a car to the Audi's rapier but, in general, carried
its years lightly.
Audi claims a top speed of 163mph (262kph) and 0-62mph (0-100kph)
acceleration in 5.4 seconds for the Avant RS2. I believe them.
Having driven it for a week in the real world, not on a race track, what
impressed me was the silkiness of the close-ratio, six-speed gearbox,
complete lack of temperament in town, bullet-like acceleration and
unbreakable tyre grip.
Less agreeable was the harsh ride, aggravated by hard seats. Fuel
consumption averaged 20-21mpg (14.1-13.4 l/100km).

FT  10 DEC 94 / Outdoors: Getting into the swing - Fishing / Tom Fort meets
a master caster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Scotland earlier this year, I met a master caster with the fine Scottish
name of Willie Matheson. I was on the Beauly and trying, with my 15ft carbon
rod, to propel my fly far enough to reach one of very few salmon in the
river. Actually, I thought I was doing quite well. But his arrival put
matters in perspective.
I was using the overhead cast as I usually do, simply because it comes
easiest. There is nothing wrong with the overhead cast assuming there are no
trees, bushes, fences, grazing Highland cattle or other obstacles behind;
and that a gale is not tearing over your right shoulder. In other words, it
is a flawed technique.
There is another method known as speycasting which, in one or other of its
variants, enables the salmon fisher to overcome the problems associated with
the overhead cast.
Put very simply, the speycast involves creating a moving loop of line which,
when unfurled, sends the fly across the stream. Its sublime virtue is that
at no point does the line go behind the angler. Vegetation and lurking
livestock are safe.
It took Matheson to bring home the beautiful efficiency of the speycast. He
is head gillie on the Beauly and knows how to deal diplomatically with
duffers, so he was gentle with me. He also has, or had, a back so bad that
he could hardly walk.
He hobbled over, picked up my rod, eased out the line and performed a minor
miracle. He swept the rod up on his left, across in front of his face, and
punched it out on his right side. The loop flew across the river,
straightened, and the fly broke the surface an incredible distance away.
It was the economy and effortlessness of his performance which were so
delightful. There was no exertion, no strain. It looked as straightforward
as turning the page of a book. But it isn't. It is extremely difficult and
let no one kid you otherwise. At least, that is my experience.
With Matheson at my side, I tried. But the harder I tried, the more inept
the results. The secret, of course, is in the timing - as with a cover drive
in cricket or a three-iron approach shot in golf.
Brute strength is of little help without co-ordination and that essential
'feel'. Willie was encouraging as he left me; keep at it, he said, keep
practising. It's the only way.
But you need a teacher, and the supreme one of our times is, beyond doubt,
Hugh Falkus. Indeed, he is one of angling's great figures. Two of his books,
Sea Trout Fishing and Salmon Fishing, have become standard texts, shedding
light on what were once mysteries for countless anglers. His Freshwater
Fishing - which he wrote with Fred Buller - is a wonderful storehouse of
learning and sage counsel.
For years, Falkus has been running casting courses near his home on the
Cumbrian Esk. By most accounts, these were pretty gruelling affairs, for the
man is not noted for indulgence and compassion. But, for those who could
stand the pace, the experience was often formative.
Now, the lessons barked across the water at his cowering pupils have been
assembled in his new book called Speycasting: A New Technique, published by
the great man's friend, David Burnett (Excellent Press, 103 Lonsdale Road,
London SW13 9DA). The price of Pounds 25 is less than a tenth of the price
of a new carbon salmon rod. The help it should give you in getting the best
out of that rod makes it a sound investment.
I do not intend to go into Falkus's new technique, partly because it defies
simplification and mainly because I do not begin to grasp it - yet. The text
is certainly no literary classic, nor should it be. The voice is that of an
elderly, opinionated, irascible prep schoolmaster addressing a gaggle of
more or less ignorant boys. But the unrelieved didacticism does not matter
if the lesson is sound - which, I would guess, this is.
The photographs, arranged mainly in sequences like stills from a film, give
as fluid and vivid an impression of the techniques as a book could possibly
provide. The great majority of them feature Falkus himself, white-maned,
stern-faced, in an interesting selection of threadbare jerseys.
I am told that he is now in poor health. So, if this should prove to be his
last testament, it is a worthy one. Certainly, it has hardened my resolve to
grapple with these disciplines.
Practise, practise, practise - I can almost hear him saying it. Who knows:
it might even, one day, turn me into a half-decent salmon fisherman.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Gardening: In praise of old Chinese practices / Plans for
autumn's finest flower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The start to winter has been extraordinarily kind, but we are all wishing
that there were more flowers in the garden. Some of you are looking forward
to Christmas; I am looking forward to an end to examining young hopefuls for
entry to Oxford. Could we not pool our wishes and come up with something to
satisfy everyone?
I now think I have found it in a recent study of life in southern China. In
the Pearl River delta, the town of Xiaolan has, over 200 years, evolved what
we need. In late autumn, it holds its great festival of the chrysanthemum,
the history of which was studied beautifully in 1990 by a Dr Siu. And,
instead of twinning, the town has changed its name. It now calls itself the
Town of Chrysanthemums.
In the past, when the upper classes still wrote poetry, upper-class townsmen
there would meet in poetic groups and write poems to chrysanthemums. They
also wrote chrysanthemum operas. As the social pyramid widened, the poetry
dwindled and the music became more popular. Old blood had to compete with
new money for social honour by displaying autumn's finest flower.
The festivals have been revived and, in a new municipal age, the town now
makes little delicacies with a chrysanthemum flavour. During the festival,
the flowers are still graded in pots, marked, and given prizes.
In Britain's climate, I quite see that town councils could find such
cultivation difficult and might opt for a Universal Pansy Week instead. So,
I have been going round the growers, asking how to grow top-class chrysanths
in our busy, fragmented lives.
The easiest answer is to grow some of the few hardy forms outdoors and cut
the flowers before the rain and frost ruins them. They have been
misleadingly good in this mild year but, in any season, I recommend the
buttoned bronze flowers of Dr Tom Parr, the favourite of the connoisseurs;
and the single white-flowered Wedding Day, which was selected and shown by
Rushfields of Ledbury at the late-November Royal Horticultural Society show.
These hardy forms are even better than the semi-hardy Korean varieties which
have to be lifted yearly and treated like dahlias in a frost-proof shed.
They are not, however, the exhibitor's dream. To find this, you need to
visit the RHS headquarters at Wisley, Surrey, where the national trials have
been running for the past five years.
At Wisley, I fell for the superb, sunny-yellow Victor Rowe with large
flowers that van Gogh would have loved to paint. The strong stems of White
Cassandra are its near equal; the season can be prolonged until Christmas if
you add in the quill-shaped flowers of the Elegance group. These varieties
have stood up particularly well to the long trials, and Wisley's expert
curators recommend them.
All these varieties need the support of a greenhouse and heat from October
until April. Every year, they should be started from small cuttings, rooted
in February and planted in 3in pots. Even the big UK growers now buy in
their cuttings from specialists, most of whom grow them in Israel, Madeira
and other sunny countries.
Chrysanthemums are acutely responsive to warm sunlight. Light encourages
their early growth, whereas lengthening darkness promotes the change from
growing to flowering. Commercially, growers now manipulate the season by
shortening daylight artificially, aiming to extract 3 1/2 cycles of flower
in one year. The rest of us leave the natural darkness of late autumn to do
the trick.
Late in spring, after the frosts, your rooted chrysanths can be stood
outside and potted on through 3in, 5in and 9in pots. They like fresh air and
fertiliser and respond to plenty of potash from September onwards (available
easily in the Tomorite which we use on tomatoes).
On October 1, they must return under glass and, ideally, must be warmed
along to opening time with a sustained temperature of 50-60`F. As you can
see, they are not suitable for gardeners without a heated greenhouse; heated
rooms indoors do not have enough light.
The reason why civilised eyes dislike this family is that they fasten on the
more recent varieties, known as Charms. They are nothing of the sort. They
arose from a chance seedling in Slough, near London, in the 1930s and have
the stunted regularity of a mound of dwarf asters, with even more flowers in
even harsher colours.
Instead, try the Cascade varieties which have long been loved in the East.
Three or four plants can be trained to go a very long way, as Wisley shows.
Train each plant individually on to an upright square of wire netting fixed
at the back of its pot. During summer and autumn, the green shoots need to
be trained on to this wire to show themselves off; extra shoots should be
pinched out until you have a cascading curtain of flowers in mid-November,
several feet high and wide.
Two such plants would dominate any drawing room. At Wisley, the spectacular
cascades are Wisley Bronze and White Bouquet, tremendous flowers for anyone
who has kept off the whitefly and leaf-miners during the growing season.
So much for the cultivation; now for my proposal. A Xiaolan-style festival
could fill in the gap between the fireworks and the Christmas carols and,
under municipal patronage, it could even attract a few new tunes of its own:
'Once in Royal Beijing City . . .' or 'We Three Mums of the Orient Are . .
.'
If the class structure has changed in the Pearl River delta, it has
certainly altered in the home counties of England; how better to integrate
new and old money than to make them both compete for honour by growing the
same chrysanths?
I see no problem about the musical accompaniment: the English National Opera
seems only too keen to upstage old favourites and it could surely come up
with some previously-loved classics, set in a municipal flower show.
What, though, is in it for hard-pressed academics such as myself? Here, the
Chinese seem to have found the answer. When the chrysanths had been
displayed individually in their Hall of Honour, they were graded, marked and
assessed by a system which, according to Dr Sui, was based on the marking
conventions of the famous examinations for the Chinese civil service.
Marking, testing and assessing are now the obsession of British bureaucrats
but, as a school governor, I am extremely concerned that the new tier of Key
Stage testers of schoolchildren have nothing to test in the winter months.
How better could Key Stage testers keep up their standards out of season
than by going to inspect their local council's chrysanthemums and giving
them Certificates of Competence on the Chinese model?
Those of you who have seen the proposed Key Stage test will appreciate that
it could as well be applied to chrysanths as to comprehensives - and the
proposal has an appropriate symmetry.
The Chinese used to grade their plants as if they were scholars. Their
festival would be a useful training ground now that we are about to grade
our schoolchildren as if they were plants.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Property: An Italian renaissance - With prices low, now
might be a good time to buy a second home in Florence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dire predictions that were made about the Italian property market in
1993 have come true in Florence this year, and worst estimates say the
market has fallen by between 20 and 30 per cent.
PRIcoa Relocation Management (the acronym comes from Prudential Insurance
Company of America), a company that has handled relocations in the UK and
Europe for 25 years, says: 'The weak economy and political uncertainty have
taken their toll.
'In a town that relies on small industry and tourism, the residential market
falls have been serious.' So now could be a good time to buy.
However, PRIcoa says buyers have been cautious, while sellers have often
refused to accept that the market has fallen so far.
Some agents are now saying the market has 'stabilised', but others are using
the word 'stagnated'. Both buyers and sellers are awaiting a miracle
solution, from the government. The company notes that many foreign
purchasers have chosen to live in the city centre, around the Duomo and
Santa Croce areas. For a new or renovated apartment there, prices are about
Pounds 325,000 to Pounds 350,000 (L750m to L800m). Older properties could be
a third cheaper.
Be wary of neighbourhoods that could be noisy, of the ever-present parking
problem, and of places that attract the city's annual 2.5m tourists.
The revival of demand for second homes abroad among British buyers has been
slower than expected.
Brian A French &amp; Associates, a UK agent specialising in Italian property,
believes it is now up to the agencies to rekindle the public's interest in
the overseas market. The company's view is: 'We can lead it along.'
French has gathered a broad mix of properties in and around Florence, which
it hopes will entice second-home buyers to the area. Accessibility is one of
the selling points. Florence is served by air, road and rail, and is a good
base for business or relaxation.
Nearly all visitors leave the city regretting that they could not see
everything they wanted to of its arts and architecture, the handicrafts
produced in the 5,000 craft workshops in its network of lanes, and its
celebrated high-fashion boutiques.
With so much to do, life in Florence need never be dull, although it could
certainly be expensive. A currency that soon takes you into figures that run
off the end of your calculator can be daunting to the foreign home-buyer.
Take heart from the fact that Florence is a great place for haggling,
especially in the present financial climate.
The hill-encircled city, with a population of 397,450, straddles the River
Arno. From its high vantage points, it forms a pattern of faded red roofs
and mellow walls. At ground level there are narrow streets with ornate iron
window grilles, avenues well-shaded with trees and businesslike, tall,
flat-fronted apartment blocks.
So where should one look for a second home?
Up-and-coming areas are to the south at Campo di Marte. The lettings market
is more buoyant than sales. In the medium-price bracket two-bedroom
apartments range from Pounds 475 to Pounds 713 a month, depending on whether
furnished or unfurnished.
For something more pricey, look in the Piazzale Michelangelo and Viale
Michelangelo districts, says Dr Paolo Spagnoli, a property consultant with
offices in Florence and London.
A beginning-of-the-century semi-detached house, set back behind a screen of
trees has space for six cars in the forecourt. The basement would make a
sizeable garden flat. There are high-ceilinged ground-floor rooms; various
upper rooms and bathrooms.
It is not much cared-for at present, but the basics are there. Its Italian
industrialist owner had been wanting about Pounds 1.5m, but is now asking
Pounds 1.2m, negotiable.
In San Domenico, on the city fringe, is a property in a different style: a
1930s detached house. This is slotted among individual homes on a hillside
with more than two acres of garden and there is a possibility of buying
more.
Although it looks almost like a bungalow, it has five bedrooms, a sitting
room, study, dining room, paved terrace and double garage. It is modernised,
has a highly sophisticated security system and is ready to move into. This
is also priced at Pounds 1.2m, negotiable.
If you are not in the market at this sort of price, a short drive north of
Florence takes you into the Mugello region. This expanse of open country
seems to have escaped publicity because it has little to attract tourists
except the occasional castle.
It has that Italian trademark: groups of slender cypress trees, and is
surrounded by folds of hills shading from pale green to purple in the
evening light.
Many Italians from Florence head in this direction, either for second homes
or as commuters. They find they can pick their price among old villas and
rural buildings. There are no parking worries and it is cooler in summer.
Brian A French &amp; Associates has built up a collection of possible second
homes. It is working in conjunction with Spagnoli Engineering, a Florence
construction company that is renovating old villas and manor houses, often
dividing them into more manageable units for sale. The company also does
conversion work for individual buyers.
It is building 40 houses and flats in a development in the Rufina district,
30 minutes by car or train from Florence. The properties will be in short
terraces, with the local-style red roofs and ochre-coloured walls. Prices
are from Pounds 55,000 to Pounds 170,000.
If you want an older property, a 15th-century manor house in parkland, in a
hill-village 20 minutes from Florence, is being made into 13 units of
between 683sq ft to 2,750sq ft. They will sell from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds
400,000.
A farm estate in another Mugello area has been split to make a three-bedroom
apartment in a tower, for sale at Pounds 75,000; and a ground-floor
four-room flat with a bathroom and family room, priced at at Pounds 39,000.
Both will need refurbishment.
A four-bedroom section of a farmhouse, on two floors, at Dicomano, also
needs renovation, but comes with 25 acres, at Pounds 160,000.
A long, low ruin of a stone-walled farmhouse at Barberino di Mugello needs
complete refurbishment, in spite of its Pounds 70,000 price. Yet it has the
makings of an appealing home.
For the person who wants a simple property, on its own, with the conversion
work long done, the choice could be a former mill at Londa. This has three
bedrooms, dining and sitting rooms and a small three-room apartment.
It has a double garage and nestles in its sheltered, well-cultivated garden,
with a stream running through it. It also has a large swimming pool, a
luxury in a region where permission for a pool may be hard to get. The price
is Pounds 327,000.
Abbey National, the British bank, has recently opened 13 bank branches
across Italy, including one in Florence. It offers a range of lire mortgages
for both first and holiday-homes in mainland Italy.
According to Pietro Bertollo, of Abbey National's Milan head office, the
bank now has a significant presence on the Italian financial services scene
lending to 'thousands of contented Italian borrowers' and an increasing
number of UK buyers. It has an English-speaking customer-service department
in Milan.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Sport: A sport that is going up in the world - Climbing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The near-certainty that the climber will fall off spectacularly and have to
be lowered to the ground on a safety rope, makes watching a climbing contest
a nail-biting experience. Rock climbing has tension, drama, and in an indoor
arena, television cameras can move in close.
The popularity of the sport is growing rapidly and the televising in the UK
on December 28 of the fourth round of the International Climbing World Cup
at the Birmingham Indoor Arena could herald its golden era.
On the continent, televised climbing commands huge audiences and rock
climbing is as popular as football is in the UK. However, climbing in
Britain is now booming.
One place this is evident is at Plas-y-Brenin, the Sports Council's centre
for training mountaineers in Wales, which runs courses for all standards in
climbing, as well as canoeing, orienteering and winter mountaineering.
Martin Doyle, chief instructor at Plas-y-Brenin said: 'We run rock climbing
courses for people coming into the sport, and demand for these is
significantly increasing.' It also runs courses leading to the Mountain
Instructor Award. 'We train people who then train newcomers and this area is
absolutely booming,' said Doyle.
Because climbers now train on indoor climbing walls, the standard of skills
has not fallen, even though the numbers of people entering the sport has
gone up. In the 1960s and 1970s, few if any British climbers were able to
train, but many now have their own climbing wall in a cellar or garage, with
specially made holds bolted to panels of plywood.
'Some climbers have no intention of ever going near a mountain,' said Mike
Brown, managing director of Snow + Rock, the ski and mountaineering retail
group, which has five shops in the south of England.
Snow + Rock spent Pounds 25,000 sponsoring the competition at Birmingham,
and Brown said: 'This has been one of the best things that has ever happened
to climbing and it would have been a disaster for Britain not to have held
that competition.'
'The advent of the climbing wall has increased the popularity of climbing,
just as dry ski slopes pulled skiing forward in the late 1960s. We sell the
holds in our shops and some climbers build their own walls.'
Snow and Rock, which has an annual turnover of Pounds 2m, used sponsorship
of the Birmingham event to raise the profile of the company in a growing
sport.
The British climbing team is sponsored by Reebok, the sports clothing and
footwear company.
The company does not yet have a product directly related to the sport but it
plans to launch a specialist rock climbing boot, the Transcender, in the
spring.
Chris Gore, outdoor manager for Reebok, said: 'Rock climbing is one of the
most exciting visual sports.' Reebok believes linking its name to an
exciting sport such as rock climbing will lead to consumers seeing its
products in a glamorous light. The company plans to move on to sponsor
individual climbers.
Meanwhile, the sport continues to grow. A company called High Performance
Sports has been set up to turn a former water-pumping station in Stoke
Newington in north London into an indoor climbing centre called The Castle
at a cost of about Pounds 1.8m. It will offer climbs up to 80ft and it is
hoped it will be open next autumn.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Sport: Grand Slam serves the whole game - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You may never have heard of them, but Dan O'Connell, Nicolas Ayeboua,
Gustavo Granitto and Frank Couraud are perhaps the most important names in
international tennis.
At least, they are to thousands of aspiring young tennis players in third
world countries trying to make a start in the game.
All four are tennis coaches, employed by the International Tennis Federation
as full-time development officers. They travel their regions, working with
the national federations to organise competitive events among junior players
and train future coaches.
O'Connell is an American, whose patch is Fiji and the South Pacific;
Ayeboua, from Togo, looks after the whole of French Africa; Granitto comes
from Argentina and operates in Central America and the Spanish Caribbean;
while Couraud is a Frenchman, whose territory is the English and Dutch
Caribbean.
Doug MacCurdy, who runs the operation for the ITF, said: 'This has been the
most significant step since we set up our development department in 1984.
During 1995 and 1996 we shall appoint three more coaches in Africa, China
and Central Asia to start the same process.'
The whole of this work is funded from the Dollars 2m a year donated to the
Grand Slam Development Fund by the Compaq Grand Slam Cup, the end-of-season
event that is taking place for the fifth time this week at the Olympiahalle
in Munich.
Those who criticise the tournament for providing annual prize money of
Dollars 6m for the 16 men who have performed best in the four major
championships of the year - the Australian and French Open, Wimbledon and
the US Open - forget the benefits to the whole of the game.
One who does not is Andre Agassi. Speaking in Munich this week, after
beating the Austrian left-hander Thomas Muster in a glorious first-round
match, the US Open champion and world number two said: 'They are always
asking, 'should there be all this money in tennis?'
'The reality is that the stadium is full up there and the tournament donates
Dollars 3m a year to charity. Two million a year has gone to third world
countries' programmes for developing tennis and another Dollars 1m goes
every year to a charity of Axel's choice.'
Axel Meyer Wolden, the Munich lawyer who came to the ITF and the Grand Slam
Committee in 1989 with the idea of launching the Grand Slam Cup, is a man
with a keen sense of social responsibility.
'The motive is a moral one - to help others,' he said. 'Contributions have
been made to buy equipment for treating young children with cancer and for
facilitating organ transplants. Bosnia, Russia and other areas afflicted
with war and strife have received funds to feed, clothe and give shelter to
children.'
It is a proud record. But do not be misled. There is more than just
philanthropy in Dr Meyer Wolden's motives. He has built the Grand Slam Cup
into a profitable event of real stature.
Television coverage ensures it is seen in more than 200 countries. That has
been no easy task in the face of the political sniping from the Association
of Tennis Professionals' Tour, the body that emerged when the ATP broke away
from the Men's International Professional Tennis Council.
The Grand Slam Cup is at the very top of the sporting pyramid. Three players
who started at the bottom are Claude N'Goran from the Ivory Coast, Tamer el
Sawy, an Egyptian, and Nigeria's Sule Lapido. All three have emerged from
ITF programmes to achieve significant rankings - Claude and Tamer are now
among the top 240 men in the world, Sule only a little lower.
By winning local tournaments they were selected for one of the ITF junior
teams, which are sent to appropriate tournaments under the eye of an
experienced manager/coach. Through successes at this second stage of the
ITF's 'pyramid of opportunity', Claude, Sule and Tamer were promoted to ITF
Satellite teams, the first rung of the professional ladder where ATP points
can be won.
From there they have now been transferred to an ITF Challenger team, whose
coach is the former French circuit player, Jacques Hervet. But they have yet
to climb the final peak. Entry to the Grand Slam Championships and the
tournaments of the main ATP Tour can be gained only by accumulating
sufficient computer points from Challenger tournaments and Satellite
circuits.
That quantum leap has been made by a few players who started out on ITF
programmes. Byron Black, the Davis Cup player from Zimbabwe and the French
Open doubles champion, freely acknowledges that without ITF help his career
would never have taken off. And Karim Alami, who beat Pete Sampras in the
first round of the Qatar Open last January, benefitted from membership of an
ITF professional team.
So tomorrow, when this year's winner of the Compaq Grand Slam Cup steps
forward to receive his cheque for Dollars 1.5m, remember the benefits that
the contest has brought to the world game.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Sport: The ups and downs of a 24-hour race - Skiing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is high noon at the top of Ajax Mountain. Two at a time, the racers
launch themselves down Aspen's legendary peak, gradually building up speed
to 50mph or more down Spar Gulch.
A severe left-hand bend checks their speed at Kleenex Corner as they hurtle
past the portals of the Compromise Nine - the only working silver mine on an
American ski slope - and then they hurtle down Little Nell to the bottom of
the Silver Queen gondola.
They have travelled the best part of three miles. The vertical drop is
3,267ft. The fastest time is 2:26.27 minutes. In a conventional contest, the
race would be over. But this race is just beginning.
During the next 24 hours, the racers - 11 teams of two - will repeat this
desperate dash up to 50 times, skiing the equivalent of more than nine
Everests. They will use the 13-minute gondola ride back to the top to
recover body heat with blankets and hot water bottles, to eat, drink,
respond to the call of nature and even doze for a few precious moments until
their next headlong plunge down the race-track.
The Land Rover 24 Hours of Aspen is called 'the most brutal ski race on the
globe'. As the skiers from eight countries continued to hurtle down Ajax's
now floodlit slopes, I rode the Silver Queen with the British pair, Malcolm
Erskine, veteran of more than 100 downhills and third at Aspen two years
ago, and Bill Gaylord, recently retired from the British Olympic team after
racing at Lillehammer and Albertville.
Not being a racer, the best time I could manage was five minutes and I could
not think of anything particularly intelligent to say. But I felt I should
at least offer them a little moral support.
Gaylord seemed to be cheerful in spite of smashing both his skis in a fall
earlier, and Erskine was busy eating bananas. They leapt from the gondola
for their umpteenth lap, while I retired to the old-fashioned splendour of
the Jerome Hotel, from which one could watch Aspen's floodlit slopes.
By the time I stirred again at dawn, the amiable Erskine had crashed twice.
'Once at 3am, when I wrapped myself round a pylon, and again at 5am when I
fell at Kleenex Corner,' he said when I dived into their gondola again after
breakfast.
Unbeknown to any of us, Gaylord was suffering from quite seriously
frostbitten feet, which he only discovered after the race when he removed
his boots.
By now, the French and American men's teams had dropped out, leaving a dour
battle to avoid coming last between the British, the Germans and the
Argentines. The British pair somehow managed to draw ahead of the American
women's team, leaving Germany to finish last behind Argentina.
The Aspen men's team won the race from last year's champions, Canada. But in
the end one could only marvel at the extraordinary valour of all the racers.
Later, I was in Telluride for the Tournament of Champions, and I described
the event to Franz Klammer - just 41 years old and perhaps the bravest racer
of all time. He said: 'I just couldn't do it. My knees just couldn't take
it.' And Bill Johnson, the Olympic gold medallist in the downhill at
Sarajevo in 1984 agreed: 'I wouldn't last more than an hour.'

FT  10 DEC 94 / Sport: Litigation is the name of the game - Growing numbers
of sportsmen are consulting a lawyer instead of the referee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year, a powerful new figure has entered the British sporting scene. The
authorities are running scared but, with media attention dominated by drugs
scandals, the contestant's rise to prominence has been hardly noticed.
The new contender on pitch and track is the lawyer, and the name of the game
is litigation.
In the second High Court case of the year involving a soccer accident, the
Aston Villa footballer John Fashanu and his insurers were ordered to pay
Pounds 70,000 in compensation to a defender injured in a 1987 league game.
In a wrangle over contracts, Leicester City went to law last week seeking
compensation running into millions of pounds after its manager, Brian
Little, was lured away by Villa.
Meanwhile in Geneva, attorneys acting for the International Motorsport
Federation are trying to decide whether David Coulthard will work for
McLaren or Williams Renault in next season's Formula One. If Williams wins,
a talented driver may have to sit out 1995 in the pits while Nigel Mansell
continues his comeback.
The death of the Austrian skier Uli Maier last season focused attention  -
and litigation - on a dangerous sport. When the International Ski Federation
introduced compulsory and far-reaching rights-waivers for competitors in
this year's World Cup, skiers began talking of a boycott.
The old maxim of Volens non fit injuria (he who consents cannot be injured),
which used to govern sport, is now history and the inclination to reach for
a lawyer rather than a referee is worrying the highest reaches of world
sport.
Since the effects of this on the Olympic Games can only be bad, Olympic
officials and leaders of international federations have begun to fight back
against the tendency to sue and are attempting to make specialised sports
arbitration more attractive.
Recent cases such as the one involving the American sprinter Butch Reynolds,
who sued the world athletics body for Dollars 27m after he was suspended
over allegations of drug abuse, were the last straw.
As worries mount about how litigation could affect the Atlanta Games in
1996, Dr Primo Nebiolo, president of the International Amateur Athletics
Federation, announced at the International Olympic Committee council meeting
in Barcelona last week that new IAAF rules would impose mandatory
arbitration on competitors.
'We will change our constitution and insert an article making it obligatory
for an athlete to follow all internal appeals and then go to arbitration,'
said Dr Nebiolo. Other sports within the Olympic programme plan the same
restrictions.
Insiders say that the IAAF realised how serious the problems of litigation
by athletes had become when the Coca-Cola corporation froze millions of
dollars in sponsorship money to prevent it being sequestered under a court
order to pay compensation to Butch Reynolds.
If the new system had been in place, Reynolds's dispute with the US Olympic
Committee, would have had to go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in
Switzerland.
This court has existed on a very modest scale for nearly 10 years. However,
it has only recently been separated from the IOC, which was seen as a vital
move, as many of the most serious disputes are likely to involve the
Olympics and national trials.
Dick Pound, a Canadian lawyer and the most powerful member of the IOC after
President Juan Samaranch, said: 'Previously in these disputes the IOC had
tended to take the line, 'What you say is debateable; what we say is sacred
fact.' To hold ourselves up to outside jurisdiction is a signal of how
seriously the problem must be addressed.
'It is vital to find some means which can keep the Olympics in Atlanta free
of litigation, which may paralyse the ability of the organisers, the
officials and the athletes, in relation to the Games,' he said.
In a lecture given in Washington, he gave warning that a stadium full of
writs could have far-reaching consequences. 'We must all hope that the
courts in the United States will not try to substitute their judgment for
that of the proper sports authorities,' he said.
'If this does not happen, I foresee the day when the US will no longer be
able to attract any major sports events.'

FT  10 DEC 94 / Outdoors: With Klammer to watch over me - Arnie Wilson rubs
shoulders with some skiing legends / FT Ski Expedition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are attempting to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. They are spending their final weeks in North
America.
Was there not a movie in which all the waxworks came to life? Well, that is
how it has seemed in Telluride, Colorado, where we have been consorting
almost night and day with some of skiing's legends.
They are here for a tournament of champions and we are here to watch. We are
also skiing a little - although I made my excuses when Franz Klammer
suggested I should ski in the pro-am race.
Winter or summer, Telluride is one of the most beautiful places in Colorado,
and the skiing - down steep gladed trails under a consistently dark blue sky
 -has been outstanding for early December.
One problem, however, is that you have no idea which of your skiing gods may
be peering down at you from a lift. For example, will Klammer - for whom
Telluride is something of a second home - notice that I still have the same
bad habits he tried to cure me of two years ago at his ski clinic in Copper
Mountain?
He should at least be impressed that Lucy and I are getting better at not
falling over. Lucy recently went 300 miles (the best part of a month)
without a tumble, and what is perhaps strange is that after almost a year of
skiing, we have both fallen exactly the same number of times: 161, or about
every 20 miles.
The people sharing the dance floor with us at a Wild West party at Gorrono's
mid-mountain restaurant share six Olympic gold medals, three silvers, two
bronze and 13 World Cup titles. Now they are about to battle for Dollars
200,000 prize money in the Tournament of Champions series.
Every other person is famous: there is Klammer, Bill Johnson (the first
American - in 1984 - to win an Olympic gold for downhill), Franz Weber (six
times World Speed Skiing champion), Leonhard Stock (1980 Olympic downhill
gold medal at Lake Placid), Steve Podborski ('Crazy Canuck' winner of eight
World Cup races and the 1980 World Cup downhill title) and the Mahre
Brothers (Phil and Steve) who won all kinds of World Cup and Olympic races.
Meanwhile, what of the unheralded progress of the un-bemedalled Wilson and
Dicker?
Our 40 pairs of socks, purchased as a job lot in London's Queensgate 12
months ago are all holed. But rather like us, they have all lasted the
course. We also have holes in all our gloves, and I have a hole in my only
remaining pair of shoes.
Lucy cut my hair quite nicely but I have since had it tarted up by a
professional. Lucy cut her own fringe too short and has acquired a gamine
look.
We have smart new Degre 7 suits, but our Financial Times and Ski The Summit
logos and those of all our other sponsors have had to be cut from our old
suits and attached to the new ones.
Thanks to Fran Newitt, our tireless UK co-ordinator, our mail still finds
us. Most of it is of the 'Dear Sir, Unless you . . .' variety from banks and
credit card companies, but we did have one letter from Robert Redford
welcoming us to Sundance, his ski area in Utah.
Ski the Summit, our principal sponsor, which has tried to keep our debtors
at bay, is making plans for an interesting finale to our trip: it is hiring
a helicopter to fly us between each of its four resorts so that we can ski
one symbolic run at Breckenridge, Keystone, Copper Mountain and Arapahoe
Basin without going near a ski-lift. We will then be taken to Denver for our
final flight to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where this whole crazy business began
a year earlier.
Since we were unable to ski on August 22 - the International Date Line meant
we went straight from August 21 to August 23 - we have decided to ski on
January 1 to ensure that we have skied on 365 consecutive days.
After that, I am looking forward to a day off. Lucy, on the other hand,
wants the trip to go on for ever.
In Colorado, Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker stayed at the Vintage Hotel,
Winter Park; the Sonnenalp Hotel in Vail; the Hotel Jerome in Aspen; and the
Ice House in Telluride.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Sparkling with extra class - Vintage Champagne
/ Giles MacDonogh sips some special cuvees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Krug brothers used to say that they preferred their (admittedly rather
special) Grande Cuvee to their vintage wines. After all, while God makes
vintage champagne, only a highly talented mortal can make wines as great as
the Krug Grande Cuvee.
Vintages are not declared every year, for the very simple reason that God is
not always that kind to champagne growers. There are miserable years in this
northernmost outpost of French viticulture when the grapes scarcely ripen.
To make drinkable champagne in years such as these, you need to add reserve
wines from other years to achieve the weight and balance required of
champagne.
The 1980s, however, proved to be a champagne-maker's dream decade. All the
major houses declared vintages in 1982, '83, '85, '86, '88, '89 and '90 and
some declared other years, too. During the economic boom times, the wines
walked off the shelves with such indecent speed that they were often a
little on the raw side - or 'green' to use the technical term.
The quality of the decade and the recession, however, have had one
beneficial effect: stocks are high, and the wines released these days have a
touch more maturity than many of those sloshed back in the days of
enrichissez-vous and Margaret Thatcher. Most of the top champagnes (or
grandes marques) are now released when they are five years old.
Champagne is a blend of three grape varieties: Pinot Meunier, Pinot Noir and
Chardonnay. Pinot Meunier does not generally figure in vintage champagne, as
it is not considered able to age with dignity. And although there are some
fabulously rich Chardonnay vintage champagnes, it is the black Pinot Noir
which gives the body to most of the great vintage wines.
A young vintage champagne often has a bouquet of fresh fruit: crushed
raspberries or strawberries. As it gets older, an increasingly toasty, nutty
character creeps in. When it is really old, it sometimes smells a little of
old rose petals in a pot-pourri.
English people are supposed to like the taste of really old champagne, and I
have heard it said that a vintage should not be broached before it is 10
years old. A really ripe vintage of this sort, such as an '83, would be
perfect now. On the other hand, such wines are hard to find.
Many people open a bottle of champagne at Christmas, either around the tree
while the presents are being unwrapped or at the lunch table later. In
general, non-vintage cuvees are fine without food; they have an aperitif
effect as the sharpness of the acidity begins to stir the stomach juices.
A mature vintage champagne, on the other hand, goes very well with the first
course of a Christmas meal - either with oysters, smoked salmon or - in the
case of the richer, older wines - foie gras.
The FT tasted 22 vintage champagnes available in the shops this Christmas.
The foIlowing are recommended.
1990. Deutz - a firm which has specialised in champagne for laying down in
the past. This would benefit from a few years more in the bottle. Pounds
21.05 from Laytons or Andre Simon shops (071-387 2552).
1989. Most of these would profit from a little more time to mellow the
wines.
Drappier - fresh raspberry character but quite sharp still. Pounds 15.76
from Threshers and Wine Rack.
Taittinger - a superbly complex wine with the redolence of fresh pressed
roses. Pounds 27 to Pounds 30 from Selfridges or Irvine Robertson of Leith.
1988. This is the first vintage to be properly ready this Christmas,
although there is certainly no hurry to drink up.
Laurent Perrier - superb balance with a lovely lemon peel tang. Pounds 23 to
Pounds 27 from Oddbins, Lay and Wheeler (01206-76446) or EN Booth
(01772-204316).
Henriot - a lovely champagne with a bouquet of hazelnuts, but it needs more
time. Pounds 19.05 from Cellar 5.
Pommery - showing already a mature character of bread and white truffles. It
is very much a food wine and would be delicious with foie gras. Pounds 19.75
from Bibendum (071-722 5577).
Veuve Cliquot - another big wine ideal for food. Pounds 25.95 to Pounds
29.50 from Waitrose, Harvey Nichols (071-235 5000), La Reserve (071-589
2020), Eldridge Pope (0305-251 251) or Fortnum and Mason (071-734 8040).
Roederer - rich again (honey and apples) and another food wine. Pounds 29
from Harrods, Tanners, Laytons, Justerini and Brooks, Lay and Wheeler, Berry
Bros and James Nicholson.
Pol Roger - a big Pinot Noir wine with plenty of fresh raspberry tastes and
one of the great wines of the vintage. Pounds 28 from Berry Bros, Harrods,
Tanners (0743-232400), Valvona and Crolla (031-556 1668) and Bennetts of
Chipping Camden (0836-840392).
Bollinger - potentially the best of all but a slow developer and one to lay
down. Pounds 30 from Sainsbury, Majestic, Bottoms Up, Threshers, Oddbins and
Wine Rack.
1986. Alain Thienot - an interesting champagne which would be good with more
highly flavoured foods: Pounds 20 to Pounds 23 from Robersons, Barnes Wine
Shop or the Clifton Cellar in Bristol.
Ruinart - this champagne is a point and one of the loveliest wines in the
tasting. With its nutty bouquet, it would be superb with food. Erick
Bequemont, of the Four Seasons Hotel, suggested a salade folle with foie
gras. Pounds 21.60 from Bibendum.
Billecart-Salmon - tasting of raspberries and cream and a very delicate,
feminine champagne. Pounds 28 from Harvey Nichols or Adnams of Southwold.
1985. Alfred Gratien - call 0342-315105 for stockists. Pounds 33.
Piper Heidsieck - the only really old-tasting champagne in the tasting.
Perhaps a little like Miss Haversham but it will have its admirers. Pounds
18 to Pounds 20.50 from Davy's of London, Les Caves du Patron of Leicester,
Vin de Bordeaux of Oldham or Best Cellars of Devon.
Bruno Paillard - creamy bread and walnuts, just right for this Christmas.
Pounds 22.95 from Le Nez Rouge (071-609 4711).
Charles Heidsieck - strawberry mousse, soft and luscious, it could even be
drunk with bland fowl such as turkey. Pounds 27.50 to Pounds 30 from
Selfridges, Fenwicks of Newcastle, Cavendish House of Cheltenham, or Binns
of Darlington.
Krug - nuts, raspberries and lemon, astonishingly complex, this really is
God's wine. Pounds 66 to Pounds 75 from Oddbins, Harrods, Selfridges or
Threshers.

My most enjoyable gastronomic experiences recently have not been in a
renowned dining room or even in a newly-discovered eatery. Instead, they
have taken place at Saturday lunchtime around the kitchen table at home,
when one of our children has returned from a morning spent at Les Petits
Cordons Bleus, the Saturday culinary workshop for children aged 8-14.
Our son, William, in his splattered apron and a small chef's hat, brings
home two plastic containers with our lunch: mussels in a cream sauce; a
delicate fish stew cooked with herbs in a court bouillon; chicken leg, sauce
diable and mashed potato; a rillette of salmon with lime that was so
delicious a friend insisted on the recipe; and a creamy bread and butter
pudding. He has also appeared with florentines, macaroons, brandy snaps,
flapjacks and strawberry cheesecake for our tea. These courses began in
Paris three years ago and proved so successful that they were adopted by the
London branch of Le Cordon Bleu last year. Each session lasts from 10am to
12.30pm and costs Pounds 25. This covers teaching, ingredients - and,
effectively, provides lunch for parents.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Food and Drink from Italy: Where Parma ham is king
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Parma is home of the sweetest nosegay of spring, and this city, like its
violets, is small, elegant and charming. I was captivated, on leaving the
cathedral, to witness the unveiling of the baptistry after its cleaning.
Workmen shouted and tugged. Plastic and tarpaulin shrouds draped over the
scaffolding fell away gradually and the beautiful building emerged like a
wet-winged butterfly from its chrysalis.
Like Bologna and Modena, Parma was governed for generations by local
nobility but the foods of Parma seem more sophisticated than those of
Bologna and Modena - the pasta is more delicate, the pork products are more
restrained.
This may be due in part to long years of government by the Farnese family
and to the subsequent influence of Maria-Luigia, Duchess of Parma. The
duchess (daughter of Francis I, Emperor of Austria, and second wife of
Napoleon) employed two French chefs from her days as Empress of France, as
well as an Italian chef and pastry cooks from her native Vienna. These last
introduced yeast pastry confections to Parma - lighter and more refined than
Austrian patisserie. Cafe Torino in the centre of Parma is famous for them.
Parmesan cheese - more specifically called Parmigiano-Reggiano to
distinguish it from others in the same family - is one of the world's great
cheeses. The real McCoy has the words 'Parmigiano-Reggiano' pinpricked all
over the sides and a stencil giving the date of making and the maker's code
to prove its excellent provenance.
Cheeses that fail their exams (and Parmigiano-Reggiano is rigorously tested
at various stages during production) have the proud legend
'Parmigiano-Reggiano' cancelled by ignominious Xs.
Parmigiano is famed as a grating cheese, especially for dressing pasta, but
increasingly I enjoy it as a table cheese - the less elaborate the context,
the better it shows off its flavour. Shaved into flaky curls with a
swivel-bladed potato peeler, it sets the gastric juices flowing as a first
course salad, scattered over wafer-thin slices of bulb fennel dressed with
olive oil and lemon. I also love it served at the end of dinner with
quartered juicy pears. Or on its own instead of amuse-gueules with
pre-dinner drinks.
Emilians insist the king of cheeses should never be sliced. So cut, dig,
chip or hack it into craggy wedges instead, using a purpose-made Parmesan
knife (a bit like an oyster knife without the guard) that encourages the
cheese to break into jagged splinters following the natural seams.
The pig (which grows fat on whey left in the vat after cheesemaking) reigns
supreme in the duchy of Parma. A notable feature of pork products here is
how few extras they include. A little salt, some pepper maybe, but rarely
more as the meat of local pigs has, by tradition, so much character of its
own.
Spalla, or shoulder, can make succulent, sweet, cooked ham but uncooked,
cured meats are generally preferred. From Felino, just south of Parma, comes
Felino salami, one of the most pleasing. The best coppa (a meaty muscle of
neck fillet) is made near Piacenza.
The marshlands of the Po valley north of Parma are home to exquisite
culatello, made from the best part of the buttock. A rarer treat than Parma
ham, it is whispered about and so highly prized by local cognoscenti that
you are unlikely to find it outside the duchy.
But Parma ham is king. DOC-controlled, each leg is branded with the
five-point ducal crown of Parma and bears a seal stating the place and date
of making so it can be traced right back to the farmer who raised the pig
and the man who salted it. Like the individual identification of each and
every Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, this shows proper pride in food
production.
The breezy hills round Langhirano, south of Parma, provide the ideal
environment for curing Parma ham (the very opposite of the foggy stillness
on which culatello production depends). The carefully selected legs, lightly
massaged with salt, rinsed and partially smeared with lard, are hung for 10
to 12 months in wonderfully odiferous ageing rooms, shuttered or fully
ventilated depending on the weather. The result is raw ham of elegant and
distinctive savour, finely textured with pale lingerie-pink lean and a good
ratio of fat. It falls silkily from the knife when carved.
Outside Langhirano - in the shadow of Torrechiara, a 15th-century fortress -
lies the Ristorante Gardoni. I was taken there for lunch after a morning
watching and learning about the making of Parmigiano and Parma ham. A modest
establishment, a splendid meal.
We began with generous plates of local pork meats. There was excellent
Felino salami; coppa; cotechino; smooth-grained and delicate spalla cooked
on the premises; prosciutto di Parma of roseate hue in slivers as fine as a
magician's handkerchief, the very best I have ever eaten; culatello, 'the
noblest cut of all', softer textured, darker and more mellow than the Parma
ham. For crunchy contrast there were ciccioli (pork scratchings) still hot
from frying to draw the lard out of them. And glasses of chilled Malvasia
Frizzante.
Then came tortelli alle erbette, a dish of finesse and Parma's pasta
speciality: pockets of egg pasta filled with ricotta and spinach (variations
call for spinach beet or chard) lightly seasoned with nutmeg, the whole
dusted with Parmesan cheese and dribbled with melted butter.
I am afraid I cannot recall what came next. Maybe I skipped a course having
feasted so well on the first two. But I remember cakes were served with a
very sweet, elderflowery Malvasia Dolce for dessert. Finally, we sipped
green walnut liqueur, another local speciality. Then it was high time for a
siesta.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Fennel with prosciutto and parmigiano
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
(serves 4 as a first course or 6 as a vegetable)
For years we have enjoyed Parma ham simply wrapped round grissini bread
sticks or as an appetising partner for ripe melon, figs, peaches or pears.
More adventurous cooks have also begun to use Parma ham as the Emilians do,
sometimes slipping it into pasta fillings, wrapping it around veal or
chicken to give those meats a little lift, or employing it - as one might
use bacon but to more subtle effect - in vegetable cookery, especially with
peas, beans, lettuce, fennel and celery.
Here is a recipe to remember for Christmas as it goes well with cold roast
poultry, pork and veal:
1 1/2 lb Florentine fennel; 1oz unsalted butter; 1 tablespoon olive oil; 2oz
prosciutto di Parma, cut into snippets; 1-1 1/2 oz Parmigiano-Reggiano
cheese, freshly grated; 1 1/2 oz coarse, slightly stale breadcrumbs.
Trim the fennel, reserving the feathery fronds, and cut the bulbs into thin
wedges. Saute them for five minutes in two-thirds of the butter mixed with
the oil. Reduce the heat, cover and steam-fry for 10 minutes, stirring
occasionally, until golden and well cooked through.
Rub one hot gratin dish (or four oeuf sur le plat dishes) with butter paper.
Put the fennel into the dish(es), sprinkling the chopped fennel fronds,
black pepper (but no salt), all of the ham and most of the cheese between
layers. End with a layer of fennel.
Melt the rest of the butter in the saute pan. Away from the heat, stir in
the crumbs to sop up the fat. Add the rest of the grated cheese to the
crumbs and sprinkle the mixture over the fennel. Grill until golden.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Food and Drink from Italy: Pigs, pasta and cheese / The
belly of Italy, Emilia-Romagna
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emilia-Romagna is a food lover's paradise. It is the belly of Italy, where
rich alluvial soil yields some of Italy's finest ingredients and the cooks
of the region, drawing on a historical mix of court grandeur and farm
kitchen simplicity, produce exquisite recipes.
Orchard fruits and soft wheat flourish here. So do all manner of vegetables
and fungi. The area is famed for its egg-yolk yellow pasta, richly sauced or
lavishly stuffed, and for balsamic vinegar, one of the most fashionable
flavourings of our times. Above all else, this is the land of the pig and
Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
Do not think, though, that Emilia-Romagna is famous only for its food. There
are romanesque cathedrals, medieval abbeys, Byzantine basilicas, the
ceramics of Faenza, the mosaics of Ravenna and paintings by Correggio. It is
also the home of Ferrari, Maserati and Lamborghini cars.
Bologna is the greedy capital and contains the oldest university in Europe,
hence its nickname 'the fat and the learned'.
It is a city of joyfully noisy, hotly competitive gourmandise - a legacy
probably derived from medieval times when the rich demonstrated their power
by giving gargantuan feasts and constructing towers bigger and better than
those of rival families.
Paolo Atti, near the basilica of San Pietrono, is never without a queue for
its crusty loaves made half-and-half with wheat and maize, its heavyweight
cakes that appear to be composed almost entirely of glistening glazed fruits
and nuts, and its pastas.
Huge and delectable tortelloni are stuffed with fresh artichokes or pumpkin.
Little tortellini are stuffed with a mixture of fresh pork, chicken,
mortadella, Parma ham, eggs and Parmesan, dextrously folded and twisted into
rings (the shape was supposedly inspired by the navel of Venus). Served in a
rich broth with globules of fat floating on the surface, or sauced with
scalded cream, they epitomise the sumptuous glory of Bolognese cooking.
Prize items in the herb and vegetable market on the morning I was there were
porcini, brought in fresh from the woods. Their sight and smell drew crowds,
and even those who did not buy relished watching others make their selection
from the three grades on offer.
For a late-night supper that evening at the Ristorante Diana in the via
dell' Indipendenza, I succumbed to a potato, porcini and Parmesan gratin
finished with a grating of truffle - not one helping but two.
Elsewhere in the market there were chickens split to reveal the unlaid eggs
inside them (it is their deep golden corn-fed yolks that give the local
pasta its rich colour). Strings of little cacciatore salamis, suspended in
rows, swung like bead curtains - dwarfed by mortadella sausages, some as big
as punchbags at the gym.
Mortadella is a cooked sausage of ancient pedigree, a smooth forcemeat of
high quality pork studded with fat and spices, so beloved of its creators
that it is sometimes simply known as Bologna sausage - which British
travellers of earlier centuries called baloney.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Food and Drink from Italy: The elixir of Modena - 'In an
attic holy of holies, the full-blooded aroma revived me'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Modena, less than 40km north-west of Bologna, is extraordinarily rich. The
personal wealth of its inhabitants has earned it the soubriquet 'mink city'.
This is Luciano Pavarotti's home town. The Ferrari factory is nearby. The
place fizzes with fashion shops, tottering high heels, couture and indeed
with fur coats. But Modena is also a university town and the coffee bars
buzz as much with animated student discussion as with society chatter.
Some streets are colonnaded, there are little squares and spacious squares,
peaceful gardens and an 11th-century cathedral of great beauty.
Gastronomically, Modena exhibits signs of gutsy extravagance. Favourite
local specialities include two of Emilia's richest and stickiest pork
products - cotechino, a boiling sausage laced with gelatinous pork rind, and
zampone, stuffed pigs' trotters. Both make wonderful winter warmers served
with pulses and maybe a zabaglione sauce flavoured with that other great
local creation - balsamic vinegar.
Real balsamic vinegar is labelled tradizionale to distinguish it from the
offerings of commerce, which can only hint at the remarkable character of
the real thing.
It may be 70 years old and will probably have lost two-thirds of its volume
in the making. Made from the cooked must of sweet Trebbiano grapes, mixed
with strong wine vinegar, it is aged at length in attics where hot summers
evaporate it and cold winters help to clarify it, using a succession of
barrels made from different woods for subtle extra fragrance.
High in an attic holy of holies, the full-blooded aroma of it revived me
from climbing the stairs. The texture was as heavy as molasses. The complex,
velvety, sweet-sour taste exploded in my mouth, filled it and lingered
dramatically. Just one whiff, just one lick of a drop laid on my forefinger
made me understand what all the fuss is about and why one might be asked to
pay up to Pounds 60 for a small phial of it.

<TEXT>
Exceptional restaurant manageress Elena Salvoni has taken on a new challenge
in the hectic period leading up to Christmas and the new year.
At the age of 74, she emerges as the matresse d' of the former L'Etoile
restaurant, 30 Charlotte Street, W1 (071-636 1496) - henceforth to be known
as Elena's L'Etoile.
This is a marriage of restaurant history. L'Etoile opened in 1904 and has
maintained its original, charming feel.
Elena began as a waitress in Soho in the early 1930s, spent the war years
serving at the Cafe Bleu and completed 30 years at Bianchi's before spending
the 1980s at L'Escargot, where I worked alongside her. Her life is
chronicled in her book A Life in Soho, published by Quartet Books.
Nicholas Lander
Meanwhile, at the Ritz, London W1 (071-493 8181), Emmanuel Menjuzan, aged
28, becomes restaurant manager. Menjuzan trained at Talence Catering School
near Bordeaux, and took 'stages' at the Savoy and the London Hilton. He was
matre d'hotel on the French aircraft carriers Clemenceau and Foch, while
completing his military service. His most recent success has been as
restaurant manager of Les Saveurs in Mayfair (071-491 8919). NL
For the past 20 years the Anchor Brewing Company in San Francisco has made a
special Christmas Ale. It is brewed with added spices at between 5 per cent
and 6 per cent alcohol to make a dark, pungent beer.
It keeps too. I found a bottle of the 1990 stashed away and tried it
alongside the 1994. There was a decent head on the beer and four years in
the bottle had given it a sweet, marmalade-like character.
It is available from the Beer Shop, 8 Pitfield Street, London N1 (071-739
3701). For other outlets ring Anchor Brewing on 081-977 0261. The price is
about Pounds 2 a bottle.

<TEXT>
Autumn and winter are the best times to appreciate German food. Germans are
partial to game and wild mushrooms, and they enjoy the pretext afforded by a
religious feast day to gorge themselves.
As often as not these festivals take the form of week-long blow-outs around
a particular theme: strawberries, asparagus and chanterelles in the spring
and summer; ceps, game and geese in the autumn.
After two days of hectic shuttling up and down the Lower Rhine I felt in
need of a little German Gemutlichkeit. My thoughts turned to the Rheingau,
home to the vines which make Germany's noblest wines. I took the train to
Eltville at the area's eastern end, a small town filled with a jumble of
half-timbered houses and an old fortress overlooking a wide stretch of the
great river.
A refreshing provincialism was apparent from the first. In the local
Konditorei a middle-aged German noblewoman was showing the staff the fruits
of a shopping expedition to Wiesbaden. With each new revelation the old
women clapped their hands with joy.
Posters informed me that I had arrived in time for the Schlachtfest: the
most dangerous moment in the life of a German pig. Not that the swine looked
unhappy in the drawings: they were depicted running gamely off to the
slaughter; altruistically disposed to yield up their all in the form of
sausages, bacon, ham and roasting meat for the cold months ahead. But I did
not go to the Schlachtfest. I went to Schloss Reinhartshausen instead.
Schloss Reinhartshausen was once a royal residence. It was purchased by
Princess Marianne of Holland in 1850 after her divorce from Prince Albrecht
of Prussia, brother of the first German Kaiser.
Albrecht's sexual misdemeanours forced him to quit his native land and live
in Saxony where he built the ravishing Schloss Albrechtsberg on the Elbe
near Dresden. The Schloss remained in Hohenzollern hands until a few years
ago when Albrecht and Marianne's descendants sold it to a property company.
The Hohenzollerns retained only a third part of the prestigious vineyards
around the Schloss in Erbach.
The new owners turned Schloss Reinhartshausen into a luxury hotel. The
changes were not always for the best. In spite of the loan of Hohenzollern
pictures and the profusion of Biedermeyer furniture, the mixture of old and
new is uncomfortable in most of the main rooms.
A clumsy verandah has been built on to the side of the building looking out
over the Rhine. Everywhere there appears a lack of love and sympathy for the
spirit of the house.
Schloss Reinhartshausen has two restaurants: the informal Schloss-keller and
the rather grand Marcobrunn. I ate in the Marcobrunn; one of the few rooms
to emerge unscathed from the conversion.
The wine list was a hefty volume containing the names of the world's best
wines as well as those from the Rheingau and the Schloss itself. Drinking
Schloss Reinhartshausen had its advantages: a lot of wines could be ordered
by the glass. This was particularly useful when it came to ordering a sweet
Auslese with dessert.
The Marcobrunn's French chef was clearly tilting at his first star in the
Michelin Guide: it was an ambitious menu. An amuse gueule of some
sweetbreads, a little avocado mousse, some quail mousse and some sliced,
waxy potatoes was followed by equally elaborate first courses: quail breasts
with foie gras on a bed of green beans and mushrooms; zander and crayfish in
rice pastry on a bed of chanterelles.
Another ambitious dish was a partridge in three services. First came the
breasts on a stock reduction with salsify; then liver in a game consomme;
finally the legs were dished up with red cabbage and Schnupfnudeln (long,
thin dumplings).
It was an exciting concept, but it would have been a good deal more exciting
if the bird had been hung for a day or three.
The puddings were good: a fig strudel with coriander; an apple terrine
wrapped in Baumkuchen, that legendary German dessert which is so complicated
to make that it is rarely encountered these days - so much so that the only
time I have eaten authentic Baumkuchen was in a German restaurant in Madrid.
The Marcobrunn restaurant is good, but it needs to do something about the
occasional moments of blandness. It was certainly new wave cooking of the
sort now available all over the better-heeled parts of west Germany. The
next day, however, was St Martin's, and the moment for proper Gemutlichkeit
had come.
I went into an unpretentious restaurant in Eltville and ordered cep soup and
a goose leg; the largest goose leg I have ever seen, sitting on a huge pile
of red cabbage. This was a homely sort of dish: the sort of thing the
Germans do best.
Marcobrunn restaurant in Schloss Reinhartshausen, Erbach im Rheingau, 65346
Eltville, Germany. Tel: 061-23 6760. Fax 061-23 67 64 00. A la carte Pounds

FT  10 DEC 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Where have all the cheap whites gone? - Jancis
Robinson finds out, and selects some more plums from merchants and
supermarkets for festive drinking / Wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I could name any number of good, interesting, cheap red wines. There is Kwik
save's Steep Ridge Grenache-Shiraz 1993, Pounds 2.49 - a Vin de Pays d'Oc
from southern France trying desperately to look like an Australian but
tastes very southern Rhone with its frank, full, vigorous fruit, all sweet
and spicy. Or Safeway's special Christmas offer of a perfectly sound
Minervois at just Pounds 2.15, for example.
There's also Debut Bulgarian Cabernet, Pounds 2.99 at Victoria Wine, a
hi-tech wine made from low temperature fermentation to produce a very clean,
correct, if slightly dull wine aimed at those who find other Bulgarians just
too ethnic.
Victoria Wine also has the deep crimson, fruity, smooth and equally modern
Puerta de la Villa Cencibel Valdepenas 1993 at Pounds 2.99 which would also
make a perfectly acceptable house wine for all but the grandest parties this
Christmas.
But where are all the interesting, cheap whites? I can quite see why
wineries have to charge a bit more in the first few years of modern white
wine production, to pay for the necessary gentle presses and temperature
control, but is that era not behind us?
Only South Africa seems to want passionately to play in the
white-wine-under-Pounds 3 paddock (as witness several aggressive special
offers), and is exporting oceans of technically correct, crisp dry white,
much of it made from Colombard. Supermarkets can offer the best deals here.
Eastern Europe is also doing its best (despite presumably having made some
fairly recent investments in plant) and Safeway's special Christmas white at
Pounds 2.15 is a clean, full-bodied Hungarian Chardonnay. But, while cheap
South African white may lack character, some eastern European cheap white
may have too much. Grapy flavours abound, which is not everyone's bowl of
goulash.
Perhaps it makes sense simply to swallow hard and pay a bit more for white
wine with some real character, such as many of the appetising lemon-fresh,
barrel-fermented Chardonnays from the new appellation of Limoux in the hills
west of Corbieres in south-west France.
Jean-Louis Denois is one of the area's most passionate exponents,
particularly proud of his Domaine de l'Aigle, at Roquetaillade high in the
eastern Pyrenean foothills. His Cuvee Classique 1992 is delicate, yet as
fiercely concentrated as its maker. Tanners, of Shrewsbury Shropshire, sells
it for about Pounds 7 a bottle.
Rather similar in style is another relatively high altitude Chardonnay given
de luxe oak treatment, Shaw &amp; Smith Reserve Chardonnay 1993, Pounds 10.99 at
Winecellars, of London SW18 et al. The high country around Adelaide in South
Australia is responsible in this case. Here is a wine to define that strange
term 'elegant mouth feel' for what top-quality barrel fermentation does to a
good white. This serious wine should continue to improve in bottle for at
least two years.
And it is heartening to see New Zealand Chardonnays also demonstrating
mastery of traditional burgundian techniques, most notably with the recent
release of two single vineyard bottlings from Montana, the giant of this
small industry. Ormond and the rather more austere Renwick are both Pounds
10.99 chez Oddbins and others and are cleverly labelled and named after
particularly promising sites in Marlborough.
But these are wines to be drunk with food. For a house white that will serve
either as aperitif or all-purpose lubricant, a gentler, more aromatic wine
is needed. Riesling is the perfect candidate, and Dr Loosen Riesling either
1992 or 1993 is an excellent lively, off dry example costing about Pounds 6
at Thresher, Adnams of Southwold, Suffolk, and many other outlets.
Oddbins has a particularly inspiring selection of German wines, notably from
that hotbed of winemaking talent, the Pfalz region in south west Germany.
The wines of Kurt Darting, Fuhrmann Eymael (Pfeffingen), Lingenfelder,
Muller Catoir are racy, concentrated and extremely versatile. Both the open
1992s and the denser 1993s are tasting delicious at the moment.
Those who just won't give Riesling a chance had better try Pinot Blanc 1992
Marcel Deiss, about Pounds 7.45 from Lea &amp; Sandeman, of London SW10 and
Adnams of Southwold. This scented, pure Alsace white would make a house wine
extraordinaire, with more zest and undertow than the average Pinot Blanc
(although in general Alsace's Pinot Blancs are the region's best value
wines).
House reds should probably be relatively snappy, sappy and not too heavy.
Great Plain Kekfrankos 1993, Pounds 3.49 Safeway, is beguilingly lively with
lots of fruit and an aroma that attracts those of us with a penchant for
this Danubian answer to cru Beaujolais.
Sainsbury's Teroldego Rotaliano Pounds 3.95, made by Australian Geoff
Merrill, is another example of this inky style of red that is probably
flattered by being served very slightly cool.
Bordeaux may make many a keenly-priced Sauvignon/ Semillon white, but its
reds are rarely suitable for drinking without food. Nevertheless there is
keen activity in the red bordeaux market and several British retailers are
anxious to remind their customers of Bordeaux's particularly digestible red
wines so suitable for the table.
Thresher/Bottoms Up/Wine Rack has some keen selections currently, and
Safeway has lopped Pounds 3 off the price of its better clarets such as Ch
Leoville Barton 1992, Pounds 13.49 down to Pounds 10.49. Wines from this
vintage have to be chosen with care, but this one, always sensibly priced,
is well-judged and could already be drunk with great pleasure.
More red wines too powerful or tannic for sipping without food include the
big, oaky Cosme Palacio 1990 Rioja Pounds 4.99, Safeway and Oddbins, as lush
and full bodied as Michel Rolland's more usual output in Pomerol.
Those combing unlikely branches of Victoria Wine and Safeway may still find
bottles of La Cuvee Mythique 1991 at about Pounds 5.50. This herby red is
one of the most interesting bottlings of Val d'Orbieu, the Languedoc's
largest growers association, being an oak-aged blend of some of their most
powerful Vins de Pays.
There is just as much character, though of a very different kind, in Laytons
of London NW1's Barbera del Monferrato 1986 at Pounds 6.75. This is poor
man's Barolo and none the worse for it. This intensely spicy Barbera fruit
comes from Carlo Cassinis' particularly mature Vigne del Sole vineyard which
is vinified separately only in the best vintages. Four years in large oak
casks and two in bottle have resulted in a delightfully recognisable, yet
accessible tangy Piedmontese red.
And finally, an Australian classic (yes, it already exists), Penfolds
Coonawarra Cabernet Sauvignon 1990 or 1991, widely stocked at Pounds 7.99.
This much-decorated wine has an amazing colour and carries it weight well.
Wynns Coonawarra Cabernet Sauvignon 1991, Pounds 7.49 Oddbins, is no slouch
either, and would also make a thoroughly enjoyable Christmas bottle.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Travel: Flying on wheels under the Channel - Christian Tyler
travels safely by Eurostar, but feels he hasn't travelled at all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER

<TEXT>
If there were a few flat-earthers who condemned the Channel tunnel as a
crime against nature, most of us could not wait for the day when the journey
from London to Paris or Brussels was reduced to a seamless three-and-a-bit
hours.
But Eurostar is a breach of the rules. Planners, engineers, architects and
designers have conspired to overturn the laws of physics - never mind the
conventions that once made foreign travel a sensory adventure. There is no
more 'abroad'.
From the moment when the wide-eyed passenger enters the terminal he is
denationalised, desensitised and disembodied.
He, or she, might be in transit to Mars, were it not for the fact that the
spaceship's yellow nose is pointing aggressively to the horizontal.
Once aboard the steel projectile, all contact with the external world is
snapped. An invisible controller delivers over the intercom some
bureaucratic banalities: 'Please ensure that your seat number corresponds to
the number on your ticket', and so on.
The rocket ship pulls away but there is no sense of forward motion. Instead
the scenery of a now alien world is wound energetically past the window in
the way they used to do for the silent movies in Hollywood.
There is no wind or weather here, no smell of ozone, no clank of old
machinery, no whiff of Gauloises or strange foreign oaths. All we hear is
the distant hum of electric power and the squeak of the food trolley as it
is dragged down the aisle by its well-pressed, bilingual attendant.
As the mouth of the tunnel looms, the invisible controller makes a brief
announcement. Some of the passengers fidget and wipe their palms on the grey
moquette upholstery. But nothing very much happens. There is a 'pop' as the
atmospheric pressure rises and the scenery-projectionist changes a reel. For
20 minutes the passengers are shown a piece of cine-minimalism. It is the
story of passing lights in a grey wall with all the visual excitement of an
Andy Warhol epic.
Another atmospheric pop signals the end of the tunnel. Now Eurostar sets off
across country like a racehorse and the invisible controller boasts that the
train has reached its maximum speed of 300kph (186mph). Yet all the
passengers notice is a slight lateral movement of the carriage. The burst of
speed does not last long.
Eurostar may be the most efficient, hygienic mode of transport since the
wheel. But plainly there are sacrifices. For myself, on a recent trip from
London to Brussels and back, what was missing was the sense of passing from
one country, one culture, to another.
This is not train travel. It is flying on wheels. The compartments (at least
the second class compartments) seem to have been purposely designed to
inhibit all movement, conversation or cultural intercourse. Rows of
high-back seats are set out just as in the cabin of an aircraft. There are
little mustard-yellow anti-macassars, fold-down tables and not nearly enough
room between rows for any normally-designed adult human being.
But it is amusing to be de-materialised in London and painlessly
reconstituted in another capital. It was piquant to go from the quaint
English atmosphere of the Turf Club, where I had been invited to lunch, to
the trendy purlieus of a Brussels brasserie where I had dinner. Apart from a
short taxi ride at each end there was no sense whatever of having travelled.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Travel: Flying on wheels under the Channel - Nicholas Lander
is more interested in the food than the view as Eurostar carries him under
the Channel
</HEADLINE>

A leisurely breakfast in Surrey, an aperitif 10m under the sea, lunch in
Paris and dinner gliding through Kent.
How very pleasant. This may not be why Pounds 10.3bn was spent on the
Channel tunnel. But since it is there, it certainly offers new opportunities
for the determined international gourmand or those who would like to combine
business and travel with a little relaxed entertainment. I decided to
achieve this with the help of Eurostar.
I left London's Waterloo at 8.23am and arrived at 12.23pm at Paris's Gare du
Nord, a short trip by Metro to any of Paris's great restaurants.
On this occasion I was on a trip to watch the baking process at Cosi's - an
exciting venture which cleverly combines opera music and first-rate pizzas.
By 1pm I was eating lunch at its branch at 53 Avenue des Ternes in the 17th
arrondisement, (tel: 43 80 86 70). The company's other venture is at 54 rue
de Seine in the 6th, (46 33 35 36).
Although the airlines have spent millions upgrading their in-flight catering
and wine lists, few business travellers want to eat or drink large amounts
at 33,000ft.
However, if one travels first-class on Eurostar, it is feasible, safe and
most enjoyable. The first-class ticket includes all meals and all drinks
served at your seat - and my dinner was better than any meal I have had on a
short-haul, business-class flight. You can easily consume the Pounds 40
difference between the Pounds 155 standard and Pounds 195 first-class return
fare.
The enjoyment of the food may have something to do with being on the ground
rather than in the air and the effects that altitude has on your taste buds.
A conversation with Philippe Cyganski, catering operations manager at
Waterloo for the Cross Channel Catering Company, a joint venture between
Wagons-Lits, Inter-City On Board Services and Sabena, revealed that the food
on Eurostar is prepared by the same catering companies which supply large
airlines, such as British Airways. Eurostar has decided to beat the airlines
at their own game.
Certainly, the breakfast benefited from not being served slightly chilled -
as is the case in aircraft. I cannot comment on the quality of the cooked
breakfast - sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs, tomato and mushrooms - because
the trolley had run out by the time it reached my seat. But the viennoiserie
 -croissants, pains au chocolats and rolls were first class. These are
produced by Bridor, a French company with bakeries in the UK and Belgium.
Even at 300kph there was no sensation of speed so that, unlike on a jet, I
managed not to spill my orange juice or coffee. Breakfast, certainly without
the most expensive dish, does not appear to justify the extra cost but the
glass of champagne served at 9.30am, as we went under the Channel, was a
nice gesture.
The dinner menu has an enticing cover and begins with the phrase
'complimentary drinks'. More importantly, it is more than value for money.
First, comes a trolley with a free bar followed by another with your first
course - slightly over-salty smoked salmon (not a clever move when you are
giving drinks away) or salade Nicoise.
A charming, bilingual stewardess takes your main course order, beef fillet
or grilled lamb noisettes, both served with vegetables, and places a small,
sticky piece of paper with a letter 'B' or 'L' on to your headrest to enable
her colleague to serve the correct main course. With all this comes wine,
two whites and two reds, in quarter bottles.
After your main course plate has been cleared, you are offered impressive
cheeses: Cheddar, Fourme d'Ambert and Camembert, cut in front of you and
served with bread, crackers and dried fruits. Dessert could be gateau moka,
fresh strawberry flan or fruit. Coffee and liqueurs and a box of two Godiva
chocolates follow.
Service is professional and obliging. The only difficulty for all concerned
came when a trio from customs wanted to see passports and tickets as the
main course was being served. Combined with the cost of breakfast, it was
certainly worth more than the Pounds 40 difference in the ticket price
particularly when compared with prices in the rather soulless, modern buffet
range.
As the train pulled in to Waterloo I considered several points about the
style of service. First, its quality is good but the staff were visibly
finding the effort of serving so many courses to 210 first-class passengers
(a short-haul, business-class flight normally seats 21) in less than three
hours, a strain.
Will they be able to cope when the number of trains per day increases from
1995?
Second, will quality be maintained? Eurostar's troubled financial past will
undoubtedly mean that operating costs will be closely scrutinised. I hope
that ingredients and menus do not suffer.
Third, I wish Eurostar's management had taken a more adventurous approach to
catering. This is undoubtedly the train of the 21st century but the catering
is simply the best of the mid-1990s. If the same quality of food were
supplied in a less structured manner, perhaps by a top traiteur or
delicatessen from Paris, Brussels or London, would Eurostar offer an even
greater gastronomic, as well as a travel, alternative to the airlines and
the ferry companies?
However, I would recommend Eurostar travel and accept the challenge to eat,
drink and enjoy the difference between the first and standard-class fares.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Travel: A coracle of my very own / Boat-building in Wales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I had always wanted to build my own boat. To witness with growing pride the
transformation of planks of wood into a vessel as, painstakingly, I would
saw and plane and fit and shape.
Finally, as high as the house and gleaming with fresh varnish and the glint
of dozens of nautical accessories, it would be ready. A mobile crane would
be hired and, with the local paper and regional television in attendance, my
beautiful boat would be lifted over the rooftops for all the neighbours to
see and settled carefully on a low-loader for its journey to the ocean.
To be realistic, though, I am far too impatient for such a long-term project
and, in any case, my back garden makes a pocket handkerchief look like a
table-cloth. But the desire still remained and so, when I came across a
three-day course in coracle building, with a seaworthy craft at the end of
it, I had obviously found the answer to my dreams.
It was a beautiful morning when I arrived at the woodland venue for the
course, near Builth Wells, in central Wales. I followed a path of sawdust
and shavings towards a wood fire.
Gathered around it were nine other participants and Tim Wade, the course
instructor and head boat builder. Tim is a bodger, a term once applied to
skilled woodsmen.
He is also a fine craftsman who designs and makes furniture. This year he
won the commission for the National Eisteddfod's ceremonial chair. In
comparison with that, a coracle is a simple affair, a basic craft originally
fashioned from cleft ash and animal hides painted with pitch.
I began to build my coracle with nothing more rustic than a piece of
softwood plank from the local DIY store. To this was added three legs and
then woven ash laths which, to form the essential half-walnut-shell shape of
the coracle, had to be bent.
Apart from the actual launch, this was the most exciting and the most tense
part of the process. The laths were wrapped in sack and soaked first with
cold and then hot water, which meant much fetching and carrying and stoking
of the fire to keep plenty of water boiling for so many coracles.
The bending was a strange experience. To grasp a sack-covered strip of hot
wet wood, to apply pressure and feel it bend like lead or copper, was like
performing a magic trick. It was as if the wrapping of the wood in wet
sacking was a rite which endowed my hands with a certain power. The tension
came when the wood refused to comply - or perhaps my faith in my ability to
bend it ebbed. The lath would begin to snap with an ominous cracking. With
luck the deft use of a clamp would get me out of trouble. Otherwise, some
careful splicing was required.
At the beginning of the day, we had carried our benches out of the barn to
work in the sunshine. Sheep bleated, a buzzard mewed on the air currents and
a pair of ravens croaked in the distance. Only occasionally was the peace
shattered by the ground-shaking roar of treetop-skimming jet fighters.
Lunch came, made and delivered by Mrs Lee from the nearby village as part of
Wade's policy of spreading the benefit of his enterprise into the local
community. The afternoon swept past and by early evening the main bones were
in place. We had all made coracle skeletons.
Stretching calico over these bones gave the coracle a bulk and substance
greater than it warranted and led me to believe that this frail craft might
float. Once fastened, and with additional material tucked away and sewn out
of sight, on went the bitumen, a modern equivalent of pitch. Three coats
were necessary to ensure that it was watertight.
The boat was almost complete. Next came the paddle. To make a round shaft
from a square stick required the use of an instrument like a giant pencil
sharpener. As with all of Tim's tools it was perfectly honed so that it
worked without protest.
To fashion the T-shaped paddle handle, Tim Wade used his pole lathe, a
contraption put together from a stout sapling and a piece of cord which
requires only a strong thigh to operate it. By pushing up and down on the
pedal, the selected piece of greenwood turned back and forth under the
chisel until, out of a shower of woodchips, came a perfectly rounded handle.
Turned greenwood is just one of the many uses of coppice. In a quiet moment,
Tim showed me just how many products could be obtained from regularly
cropped woodland: everything from besoms, apparently a popular item at city
craft fairs, to charcoal - imported in to Britain in great quantities every
year - which could be supplied from native coppice.
The craft of coppicing is reviving, which must be good news for wildlife as
its decline has led to the serious depletion of some species, such as the
dormouse.
It was shortly after lunch on the third day that we loaded our completed
coracles on to roofracks and trailers and into estate cars and hatchbacks
and drove in convoy through the narrow Welsh lanes to the River Wye. One by
one, we anxiously cast these cockle-shells on to the water where they bobbed
on the surface, barely breaking the meniscus.
Stepping in, I pushed off and, by sculling gently over the bows, made my way
across the river. I was afloat in a boat I had built myself. When I arrived
home, I simply picked up the coracle and carried it through the house. It
takes up no space in the back garden for I have hung it on the wall.
Coracle Making courses are run by Tim Wade over a period of three days at a

FT  10 DEC 94 / Travel: Lagoons with a view / Hawaii's 21st century resort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PONSFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Driving out of Honolulu airport, I remembered just in time not to turn
right, as I had done a score of times, to head east into the city along the
southern shore of the island of Oahu.
That is what the torrent of tourists have always done, most of them flooding
into the skyscraper blocks of Waikiki and its famous beach.
Instead, making a left on to Highway 1, relaxing as the traffic thinned
beyond Pearl Harbour, I was bound for West Oahu's bespoke city of the
future, Kapolei, now rising out of a green cane-field site. Its new holiday
area of Ko Olina is already plying for trade in the form of the sumptuous
Ihilani Resort and Spa and its adjoining golf course.
The fledgling city's procreator was a shrewd, adventurous Irish immigrant,
James Campbell, who in 1879 sank a well into the then barren Ewa Plain. It
uncorked a vast artesian water supply that was to feed prolific sugar
plantations for many years.
When Campbell died in 1900, leaving an estate worth Dollars 3m, his will
began an intriguing tale that will reach its climax a century later. It
stipulated that the estate remain intact, administered as a trust named The
Estate of James Campbell, to be terminated 20 years after the death of the
last of his four surviving daughters.
Thus the death of Beatrice in 1987 triggered the distribution of the assets
to the beneficiaries (though not necessarily liquidation) on January 20
2007.
The value of the Campbell Estate has grown to more than Dollars 2bn, so that
even now the heirs of the daughters share Dollars 40m annual profits.
With the ending of sugar production in Campbell's corner of Oahu, its
development could have meant uncaring urbanisation and despoilment of the
rocky coast. Happily, today's four Estate trustees have proved visionaries.
They declare that they have 'master-planned Kopolei . . . to create a
balanced city . . . with a diversity of people'. They say they have created
a self-contained community - not a dormitory - for Honolulu and are offering
a different visitor experience for holidaymakers.
Ko Olina should certainly do that. For many the Waikiki strip of downtown
Honolulu will always appeal, with its high-rise, brash vitality, tacky
stalls, elegant international big-name stores, and a crowded beach pervaded
by the odour of coconut oil, which has survived the evolution of sun-tan
cream into digital block.
But one in five of the 6m visitors a year trek back to the airport at some
stage for 20 or 30-minute flights to one or more of the so-called neighbour
islands.
They and others seeking a calmer, unspoilt setting, yet still within
half-an-hour's drive of Honolulu, are fixed in the sights of the Ihilani.
The other three planned hotels will follow its lead in promoting a 'neighbor
island experience' without the hassle. The hotels are being set in four
coves - lagoons in local parlance - carved into the coastline, providing
crescent-shaped beaches and safe swimming.
All will fit with Kopolei's image of quality. At an average of Dollars 365 a
day, the Ihilani's capacious rooms are not aimed at the hoi polloi. Its
Hawaiian name of Heavenly Splendor is a challenge it meets with style and
luxury.
It can provide a one-stop holiday with its large, circular swimming pool,
four restaurants, each with its own cuisine, tennis club, children's
programmes, a spa purveying every known form of pummelling and pampering,
and the maturing Ted Robinson-designed golf course, built around masses of
still and tumbling water.
That is important. For, although Ko Olina is a small blob on the fringe of
the Kapolei long-range master plan, the cranes and bulldozers are going to
intrude on the city for a long time, as it develops into a spacious
community of houses (for 75,000 people by the turn of the century), schools,
university campus, commerce and light industry.
The upside for Ko Olina's hotel guests is that they are going to benefit
from Kapolei's provision of shopping and entertainment facilities, marinas
and lots more golf courses - and from a planning philosophy that insists on
extensive parks, many miles of cycleways and landscaped walkways,
incorporation of traditional Hawaiian architectural styles and a bicycle
park for every substantial building.
Already a big shopping centre is open and a 16-screen, 3,300-seat cinema
complex is on the way. A long-established luau garden, introducing visitors
to Hawaiian customs and food, is being enlarged. The Ko Olina Express, a
restored old sugar train, chugging along at 15mph, is proving popular. So is
a plantation village demonstrating how the cane-field workers lived in the
last century.
Kapolei and Ko Olina may never rival Honolulu and Waikiki, but they will
certainly be different.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Travel: A holiday near the killing fields - Cambodia is
trying to put its tragic past behind it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK HODSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After three hours in Phnom Penh I was lying by the roadside, bleeding from
the leg. This atrocity was nothing to do with the Khmer Rouge - I had been
knocked off my rented bicycle by a 10-year-old boy on a moped.
Three giggling mechanics working on a battered Toyota, helped me up and
straightened the front wheel. One offered a grimy rag to use as a bandage.
The boy smiled and sped off: no need to exchange names and addresses as no
one there has a driving licence, let alone insurance.
The recent murder and kidnap of western tourists would make most people
consider a trip to Cambodia a holiday in hell, yet every day more flights
arrive from Bangkok, Paris and Singapore, bringing young backpackers and
latter-day explorers. So what is the fatal attraction?
In the 1930s, Phnom Penh was said to be the most beautiful city in French
Indochina, its wide boulevards lined with palm trees and mansions with
sweeping balconies. But it has suffered years of neglect.
The Khmer Rouge destroyed many of the houses, then abandoned the city and
frogmarched its inhabitants out to work in the killing fields. Later,
occupying Vietnamese troops looted much of what remained.
Since the signing of the Paris Peace Accord in 1991, restoration has begun
in earnest and now, like an elegant madame, Phnom Penh is back on her feet,
dusting herself down and powdering her nose. Good breeding, after all, will
out.
If your nerves can stand it, renting a bicycle is a fast - and usually
painless - way to see the capital. Down broken backstreets stand crumbling
colonial villas with wrought-iron gates and pock-marked porticos. Art Deco
houses once occupied by French merchants and diplomats would be worth
millions in Miami. Some have been restored by foreign embassies, but many
others are occupied by squatters. On patchwork rooftops, turrets lean
dangerously, apparently held up by a spider's web of telephone wires and
electricity cables. Lines of laundry are strung between television aerials,
and green peeling shutters hang from broken hinges. It looks as if one
firmly slammed door would flatten a neighbourhood.
The roads in Phnom Penh were laid on a grid system, but are maddeningly hard
to negotiate. There are no street signs and no apparent logic to the
numbers. Rue 113 runs alongside Rue 105, which is followed by Rue 85, and
then the main thoroughfare Monivong Boulevard, which is also known as Achar
Mean Boulevard.
The city boasts just one set of traffic lights and everywhere bicycles vie
for elbow space, their panniers piled with video recorders, mattresses and
squealing piglets. Unofficial motorcycle-taxi drivers loiter in packs at
every street corner. Some speak a little English, but they all seem
permanently lost.
I pulled up at a busy junction to get my bearings and a French-speaking
policeman drew me a map and waved encouragement as I wobbled off in the
right direction.
Along the main streets, ethnic Chinese families sell everything from tractor
parts to croissants. The shop names have been translated into English and
many are collector's items: Up To Date Elegant Wears, Hung Hut Sell The
Glasses and a bar called Drink Tiger Beer No Problem.
At the central market, a star-shaped yellow concrete building, you can buy
underwear from Thailand, counterfeit watches from Taiwan and handfuls of
fried cockroaches, which I could not bring myself to taste. Nearby is a fast
food joint that proudly claims to sell Cambodia's first take-away
hamburgers. I gave that a miss too.
After getting my leg cleaned up, I ate some spicy fish soup and a baguette
at the Capitol Hotel, the favoured hangout of budget travellers.
It was a fly-blown dive, where German backpackers rubbed shoulders with
bleary-eyed French photographers. One drawling American with a big Russian
motorbike and a handlebar moustache, claimed to be a Vietnam veteran, but
behind the Ray-Bans he looked a little too young.
Later I ventured into the Heart of Darkness, an all-night bar where
travellers play pool and trade tall stories. I had planned to walk there,
but a motorcycle-taxi driver offered me a free ride in the hope that I would
need him on the way home.
Sure enough, when three of us piled out later to go to a nightclub across
town, he was waiting. We raced down deserted unlit streets three abreast,
swerving around potholes as big as bomb craters. Lone soldiers stood at
street corners smoking cigarettes, automatic rifles slung across their
shoulders. Otherwise, the city slept.
After 15 minutes we ducked down a back street past building sites and
ghostly tenement blocks, then turned a corner to see a huge disco heaving
with people. With banks of flashing lights and pounding music it looked like
a party at the end of the world.
The bouncers on the door ignored us: they were busy shaking down a local
teenager who was trying to walk in with two handguns stuffed in his jacket
pockets. Inside it was wall-to-wall hookers.
Dozens of pairs of eyes followed us to the bar. Hair was hastily adjusted
and hemlines wriggled into place. There were 50 or 60 girls there -
Vietnamese, Thai and Cambodian - and we seemed to be the only men.
Phnom Penh has few sights, the most notorious being the Killing Fields
themselves, where a glass stupa packed tight with human skulls stands in a
tranquil meadow. It was there, five miles outside the city centre, that
17,000 people were massacred. Many were first tortured and mutilated, and,
to save ammunition, the Khmer Rouge lined up their victims along the edges
of mass graves and clubbed them to death with axe handles.
Scraps of clothing and human bones lie around the field, but it remains an
inadequate memorial to such a horror. Birds sing in nearby trees and
glittering rice terraces stretch out to the horizon. It fails to shock
which, in a strange way, makes the experience all the more disturbing.
Far more horrific is Tung Sleng, a former school turned war museum once used
by the Khmer Rouge to torture intellectuals. Countless atrocities have been
catalogued there and whole walls covered with pictures of victims, who were
meticulously numbered and photographed when their time came to die.
Despite Phnom Penh's bleak history, most visitors are captivated by its
vitality and prickly energy. There are so few sights, you feel as if you
should not be there, which is part of the fun.
The newspapers were full of 'incidents'. The previous day three people had
died when a train was ambushed by the Khmer Rouge. Such attacks had become
so common that the poor were allowed to ride in the front two coaches
without paying. It was not exactly free travel: if the train hit a mine,
some would pay with their lives.
Cars were stolen by gangs in neighbouring Thailand and waved across the
border by corrupt officials, which was why half the vehicles were right-hand
drive even though Cambodians, officially at least, drive on the right.
Land-mines remain the greatest danger. There are estimated to be 10m buried
around the country, more than one for every man, woman and child.
Next day, I took a cruise up the Mekong River with a group of British and
Australian expats. They had hired a local ferry-boat and were knocking back
Johnnie Walker and Tiger Beer before lunch.
We found a deserted sandbank that would serve as a beach and swam in the
slow murky water as it neared the last leg of its epic journey from Tibet to
the South China Sea.
In the late afternoon, we went in search of food at a riverside village
where wealthy locals spend their weekends. There was a string of floating
restaurants along the bank, but none seemed interested in serving dinner.
At one, a group of soldiers lay slumped across tables piled high with empty
beer cans. Outside, bare-chested men with tattoos of Buddhist temples across
their backs played boules in the dirt.
We got back in the boat for the return journey to Phnom Penh as the sun
dipped low over the water. Clouds appeared to the east near the border with
Vietnam and sheet lightning flickered across the sky like a broken strip
light. We waited for half an hour before the first thunderclap then sat
looking to the heavens as fat raindrops exploded on our parched faces like
tiny, friendly bombs.

FT  10 DEC 94 / How to Spend It: Too late to shop, but not to give - Some
gifts need only a little thought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is too late now to have a portrait painted, commission the necklace you
always knew she wanted, plant a garden, order a customised yacht . . . But
it is not too late for a little thought.
Thinking back through the years to the presents I have loved the best, they
are nearly always the ones with the most personal meaning, the ones that
have involved thought, organisation or perfect timing.
Tickets for the opera/theatre/concert one has been longing to go to,
membership of a club one has wanted to join, a rare plant for a corner in
the garden, a painting, a book by a favourite author or on a specialised
interest, a subscription to a magazine, a lithograph of a much-visited place
. . . all these are presents that will be appreciated and can still be
organised. Here are just some suggestions.
Theatre Tokens, which can be used at more than 150 theatres throughout
Britain, including all those in the West End, can be bought in almost any
denomination, either from branches of W. H. Smith and James Thin Bookseller
(Scotland), or by credit card through the 24-hour line Tokenline: 071-240
8800.
Sadly, Interbook, the service which had the bright idea of sending books in
much the same way that Interflora sends flowers, has folded. However,
Dillons Direct (0345-125704) will send any book in print, and for an extra
Pounds 1 will gift-wrap it, too. Waterstone's mail-order service
(0225-448595) will do likewise, and postage is free for books costing more
than Pounds 35. Usual turnround time is seven days. Waterstone's also offers
to track down out-of-print books (071-434 1195). After finding the book, it
tells the customer what condition it is in and what it will cost, and the
customer is then free to buy or not.
For anybody living in a Georgian house, a good present could be membership
of The Georgian Group at 37 Spital Square, London E1, (071-373 1722). Single
annual membership costs Pounds 20, or Pounds 32 for a family. It publishes
three newsletters a year, organises activities such as holidays, evening
visits and lectures, but possibly most important of all, it offers advice on
architectural matters such as where to track down appropriate materials, how
to convert sympathetically etc.
Membership of the Friends of the Royal Academy is well worth having -
particularly for those who live out of London. For Pounds 37 a year (with a
range of discounts for OAPS and students), the member and a guest, plus up
to four children, get free entry to all Royal Academy Exhibitions (at least
six a year) with 'privileged entry' - which means you do not have to queue.
The Friends' room, where members can rest in peace and quiet, is a great
boon.
For bookworms, consider giving membership of the most distinguished and
useful library in London: The London Library, 14 St James's Square, London
SW1 (071-930 7705). Personal membership is Pounds 120 a year, which allows
the member to borrow 10 books for as long as two months. Out-of-London
members can order by post (postage extra) up to 15 books at a time. The
library can also be used as a reference library for Pounds 12.50 a month.
For the fit and adventurous, a day of action could be fun. Acorne Air Sports
sells vouchers promising a session's flying, gliding, helicoptering, tandem
skydiving, parachuting, ballooning or karting. Prices start at Pounds 51
(for gliding) and go up to Pounds 361 (for tandem skydiving). The nervous or
the wise will include insurance - which is extra - in the package. For a
brochure, write to Acorne Air Sports, Wycombe Air Centre, Booker, Marlow,
Bucks SL7 3DR. Credit card telephone line: 0494-451703.
For drivers who spend hours in their cars or people whose eyesight is not
all it might be, The Talking Book Shop, 11 Wigmore Street, London W1 has
more than 600 different titles.
The best are the unabridged versions of the classics, but there are lots of
others to choose from. Credit card line: 071-491 4117.
'For Lovers of the Morbid, the Macabre, &amp; the Darkly Romantic' The Gothic
Society hopes this description of itself will entice new members. For a
Pounds 20 annual membership fee, you get four magazines covering such
subjects as the old legend of the Wandering Jew and the new legend of the
Highgate Vampire, as well as a chance to buy other books and essays. Send
cheques to: The Gothic Society, Chatham House, Gosshill Road, Chislehurst,
Kent. (081-467 8475).
The overworked, stressed, or overfed will appreciate a pampering day at a
spa. The Dorchester in London's Park Lane has a spa that is new, grand and
as yet not overcrowded. Vouchers can be bought by ringing the Spa direct
line (tel; 071-495 7335). A detoxifying day (for those who have indulged not
wisely but well) offers a heat treatment, an exfoliation (to remove skin
impurities), a hydrotherapy bath, massage and facial and costs Pounds 100,
including a light lunch.

FT  10 DEC 94 / How to Spend It: Timeshare flightpath to joining the jetset
/ How to cut the cost of owning a private aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I had been looking forward to a good hot breakfast, perhaps a glass of
champagne or two, a quiet read of the morning newspapers and a doze before
landing at Antwerp in the luxury of a private jet.
Instead, I was given a cup of coffee in a paper mug and a lecture on why
buying an executive jet for Christmas, costing anything from Dollars 2m for
a good secondhand model to Dollars 25m for a top-of-the-range Gulfstream IV,
was not, as most people seem to think these days, a self-indulgence.
There is nothing quite like travelling around the world in a private jet.
You can forget the tedium of airport lounges and long immigration control
lines. When you land, it is a bit like arriving at a smart hotel in a
Rolls-Royce. You feel pampered, important and free.
On one occasion, when I was living in Paris, I was invited by Alexandre
Couvelair, who runs an air charter and private jet business out of Le
Bourget, for dinner at Eugenie-les-Bains, way down in south-west France. We
set off just after the Paris evening rush hour and were back by midnight
after a grande bouffe at Monsieur Guerard's restaurant.
Another time, Henry Racamier, then head of the Louis Vuitton luggage group,
part of the LVMH luxury-goods conglomerate, flew a little party in the
Hennessy Cognac executive jet to Munich for a Placido Domingo recital. It
was a wonderful flight, sipping Veuve Clicquot over the Alps and listening
to opera through the aircraft's headphones.
But Michael Riegel, managing director of the new UK-based venture called
JetCo, insists executive jets are not just expensive toys for the boys -
and, for that matter, their wives, who usually choose the interior layouts
and furnishings. They are, he says, valuable business tools, which can make
a significant contribution to the efficiency of a company.
Riegel has imported to Europe the US concept of part-ownership of executive
jets. He is touring Europe this week with three corporate aircraft - a
Hawker 800, a Beechjet 400A and a turboprop Beech King Air - to try to
interest potential buyers in acquiring a share of a new business aircraft as
a more cost-effective way of investing in a private jet than buying one
outright.
Although there is still a general appetite to fly in private jets, in the
frugal 1990s there is also a declining desire to own them. Mike Hamlin,
another entrepreneur, who has set up the London JetShare Company, says:
'Financial irresponsibility still haunts the industry.' JetShare also offers
the opportunity to invest in a share of an executive jet, but unlike JetCo
it deals only in secondhand aircraft.
Aircraft 'timesharing' schemes reflect the need to revitalise a Dollars 3bn
annual market, which slumped in the early 1980s when the Inland Revenue
abolished 100 per cent capital allowances on private aircraft. The tax
advantage of owning a private jet had meant that companies went out on a
spending-spree even though they did not always need to own a fleet of
aircraft. When the allowance was scrapped, the late tycoon Sir Charles Clore
got rid of all six of his jets.
Hamlin says: 'What we have seen is a change of customer. Once, people bought
a private jet for tax benefits, now they buy them because they need to go
somewhere.'
Companies have also become reluctant to invest in a private aircraft because
their shareholders and accountants think it is a waste of money. The classic
example is BP. One of the first decisions Bob Horton took when he became
chairman of the oil company was to invest in two Hawker 800s and a
Gulfstream IV. When he was pushed out in 1992, the first thing the new
management did was to sell the three aircraft.
Other private jet owners, such as the late Robert Maxwell and Gerald Ronson,
have given the business a bad image. Statistics suggest that more companies
that own private jets go bust than companies without any. But it is not just
that the 1990s are a cost-conscious decade. Hamlin says the price of owning
a private jet has simply become too high.
The cost lies not so much in the purchase price as in the owning and running
expense. It is a bit like buying a brand-new Daimler car - the depreciation
is immediately in free fall. Fixed and operating costs can also be a blank
cheque. To replace two windscreens smashed by a bird on a Citation costs
about Dollars 50,000, and private jet-owners pay double the amount airlines
pay for fuel and parts because they do not have the same buying power.
Riegel says one of the reasons it is so expensive to own a private jet is
that, on average, owners fly only about 150 hours a year in them.
'A corporate jet flies only about 10 per cent of a normal schedule airline.
They also fly a lot of the time empty on return legs after dropping their
passengers at their destination. About 35 per cent of all corporate aviation
flights in Europe are empty flights,' he says. As a result, private jets are
productive only 3 per cent of the time, making them a somewhat onerous
asset.
This is where joint ownership can help. 'Sharing the asset means you get far
better utilisation out of the jet,' says Hamlin. 'You also get more
flexibility than if you simply chartered an aircraft.' Riegel agrees: 'Our
share scheme is designed to lower ownership costs by 50-60 per cent at the
same time as giving the investment a more responsible image.'
Under the JetCo scheme you can buy shares ranging from a third to an eighth
of a new jet. Depending on the size of the stake, you are guaranteed a
certain number of flying hours a year: 75 hours for an eighth; 150 hours for
a quarter and 200 hours for a third. JetCo will also guarantee you an
aircraft within six hours of booking it.
You will not necessarily always get the same aircraft, but the company is
planning to acquire a sufficient number of new aircraft all fitted to the
same standards to ensure availability.
In some cases, it may have to charter in an aircraft if its own fleet is
fully in use, but the customer will always have an aircraft when he needs
it.
A quarter share in a Hawker 800, which used to be the British Aerospace 125
before the UK company sold its private jet business to the US Raytheon group
last year, costs Dollars 2.7m compared to the aircraft's sticker price of
Dollars 10.8m. The annual costs of keeping the aircraft are also much lower.
With a quarter share, annual depreciation at, say, 10 per cent will total
Dollars 270,000 against Dollars 1,080,000 for a fully owned aircraft.
Annual fixed costs such as insurance and regular maintenance in the JetCo
scheme will amount to Dollars 240,000 compared with Dollars 375,000 if you
owned the aircraft, while variable costs, including the actual time you fly
the aircraft, come to Dollars 315,000 a year compared with Dollars 341,000
under full ownership.
If you add what Riegel calls 'opportunity cost' - that is the annual
interest you would have earned in the bank from the saving in your initial
capital investment by buying a quarter share rather than a full aircraft -
you would save Dollars 1,578,500 a year by investing in a quarter timeshare,
which would probably give you all the private flying you would need in a
year.
It is still not cheap when you consider that total annual costs of owning a
quarter stake in a Hawker 800 amount to Dollars 825,000. But it still beats
paying annual costs of more than Dollars 2.4m if you owned the whole
aircraft.
Even at these costs, the more parsimonious millionaires of the 1990s are
still extremely hesitant about investing in executive jets. For this reason,
both Riegel and Hamlin have stepped up their marketing campaigns to persuade
them of the benefits of corporate aviation.
Business jets can save precious time for top executives who value their time
at around Pounds 500 an hour. 'Think of how many Pounds 500s they are losing
every year hanging around airport lounges,' says Riegel. And Hamlin adds
that a corporate jet can be an important marketing tool in helping a company
win big contracts.
To demonstrate how effective a corporate aircraft can be, Riegel organised a
day-trip from London to Antwerp, Paris and Jersey and back to London which
took just under 11 hours with time for meetings at all three destinations.
By scheduled airline, the same trip would have taken 37 hours and 25
minutes.
Hamlin has gone one better. He holds a Guinness Book of Records accolade for
flying in a corporate jet to all the European Union countries in 19 hours.

could be forgiven for thinking that it describes the panic-stricken weeks of
December in the life of a woman juggling job and family. Work schedules are
telescoped by the impending long break, and the pressure of shopping
escalates.
If you are in charge you must not forget the details crucial to the smooth
running of Christmas day. All this means that you find yourself firmly at
the bottom of the shopping list. This is a pity, for Christmas dressing
deserves a little thought. It is a day of oddly juxtaposed activities where
few rules apply. A leisurely, glamorous breakfast may be interrupted by
hectic present-opening with the children. A trip to church may be followed
by making the gravy.
We all imagine that those who live high-profile lives, who appear to have
made it in life, have sorted out such dilemmas. To find out, we asked a
selection of successful career women and some prominent social high-flyers
to give us their guide to Christmas and how to wear (and bear) it.
BREAKFAST
Rosa Monckton plans to spend Christmas morning at her London flat with her
husband, journalist Dominic Lawson, and daughter Savannah, two. 'We will
have been to midnight Mass but Savannah will be up and excited by 7am so
we'll start then and have a long, leisurely breakfast. Later we may go to my
parents for a traditional lunch.
'I don't want to plan at home because I organise very publicly at work right
up until Christmas Eve. I certainly shan't plan what to wear; clothes are a
low priority. Comfort is essential. I shall assume I have something
suitable, like a wonderful velvet dressing gown, in my wardrobe. Though I
could easily be wrong]'
Patricia Hodge, the actress, currently starring in The Prime of Miss Jean
Brodie at the Strand Theatre in London, will be working until the end of the
Christmas Eve matinee. 'I love 'doing' Christmas, although the preparation
is an enormous headache. I take it in turns with my sister. This is her year
luckily - I have only one day off. There'll be about 20 for lunch and we all
help.
'I shopped in the autumn for Christmas clothes that would be flexible for
other occasions. This silk chenille sweater and panne velvet skirt have the
right mood together but look different when worn with other things. I'll put
a jokey Christmas apron over them for helping in the kitchen.'
Sally Dalzell runs her wardrobe consultancy, Change of A-Dress, with a
partner. The Christmas run-up is their busiest time. 'We lived abroad until
quite recently so I am happy to have a traditional English Christmas in
London. After my three children, aged nine to 12, come home from boarding
school I want to devote myself to them so time for me is bottom of the list.
We will also have my two grown-up stepchildren staying.
'On Christmas morning it's straight into turkey-cooking and present-opening.
I like to look smart although not hugely dressy. Relaxation and comfort come
above all else; I get hot cooking. A loose cashmere sweater and leggings
would be great. I can add a velvet scarf and a coat for church, swap the
leggings for satin pyjama trousers at home. I don't like Christmassy
colours. I would put the outfit together from pieces I already owned.'
Anastasia Alexander, an American, started her Aroma Therapeutics business in
Britain two years ago. It is expanding rapidly in the US and Europe. 'This
is a very busy time both at work and socially, so I have to pre-plan. In
America, Thanksgiving is the family celebration; Christmas is party time. So
for breakfast I would probably still be wearing an evening dress. Here we
prefer to be in the country with my three stepchildren, our 14-month-old
daughter, Alexia, and our nanny.
'I am very organised with clothes, adding a few pieces each season to update
the classics. I like wearably avant-garde designers: Dolce e Gabbana, Romeo
Gigli, Dries van Noten. I have already planned my Christmas wardrobe. In the
morning I will go riding and then have a leisurely breakfast. I would choose
something country-style but festive, like a velvet waistcoat and trousers.'
LUNCH
Ewa Lewis, social editor of The Tatler, is Polish by birth. She has a family
house party for 14 in Gloucestershire, for which preparations have long been
under way and there will be a mix of traditions.
'In Poland, Christmas Eve is the big night so we have a formal dinner with
caviar, borscht and lots of fish. Christmas day is relaxed - presents,
church, champagne, then turkey for lunch. The staff have a holiday so I give
everyone, especially my children, aged 15 and 13, jobs to do. I co-ordinate
it all and cook.
'I don't pre-plan what to wear at home during Christmas but I am very
organised. I shop early in the season from my favourite designers - St
Laurent, Tomasz Starzewski, Bruce Oldfield, Laura B - with festivities in
mind. Knowing that a country Christmas will include sporty and very dressy
occasions, I take down what I need. For any lunch out over the holiday I
think a suit in rich velvet is right; at home I might wear a soft trouser
suit.'
Lady Charles Spencer Churchill, aka interior decorator Jane Churchill, will
go with her three sons, aged from 23 to 11, to the family country home -
Blenheim.
She says: 'Christmas lunch is a fairly informal, family occasion and I think
a suit is right. I particularly like Armani's - they are soft and classic
yet smart. Pastels are very becoming and show off jewellery well. I'm lucky,
I don't have to stuff the turkey so I can relax and enjoy the whole
atmosphere. For the evening I would change to something more formal.'
Alessandra Rossi is a Milanesa, married to a London-based Italian investment
banker. She loves entertaining.
'I shop in September, with Christmas in mind, at St Laurent and Gucci. I
never leave it till the last minute because nothing will be left in my size.
I plan what to take but our family lunch is sporty rather than dressy. The
men wear a tie, the women something with red in it. I think a printed silk
shirt and suede jeans would look relaxed but festive.'
Paola Tholstrup is a mix of Italian, Polish and German but was brought up in
Switzerland. Her husband, Mogens, owns London restaurant Daphne's and they
have a 20-month-old daughter.
'I don't exactly pre-plan my clothes, but I take a selection that I've
bought over the years from my favourite shops - Browns, Joseph, Ronit
Zilhka, Jil Sander. I am not interested enough to look for a specific
Christmas dress. For the Christmas Eve dinner I would take a black cocktail
dress; for lunch something cosy but smart like a knitted dress spruced up
with gilt buttons.'

FT  10 DEC 94 / Fashion: Iron styling puts lingerie on top - A tailored
jacket and black metal jewellery are perfect to set off the slip-dress as it
comes come out of the boudoir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Visualise the counterpoint of iron and lace, specifically, the chiaroscuro
of black Berlin iron jewellery resting on white skin dressed in lambent
satin edged with lace.
For the past two seasons, the American designer Donna Karan has been showing
slips in silk satin - but these slips are not for the boudoir, they are to
be worn as day dresses under neat, plain, tailored jackets. The look is a
natural continuation of Karan's exploration of ways to soften a woman's
wardrobe after the shard-sharp assertiveness of working women's clothes in
the 1980s.
Her bronze satin slip-dress at Pounds 520 and tweed jacket at Pounds 1,075
are available at Brown's in South Molton Street, London W1, and those who
love the Donna Karan look can spend huge sums on buying the original.
However, women on a tight budget will find it is the idea that matters, and
it is worth browsing round the lingerie shops (Janet Reger, Rigby &amp; Peller,
Fenwick's and Janet Whiteman at weekends in the Covent Garden market), where
petticoats and slips can be found for between Pounds 22 and Pounds 29.
Team them with neat, trim-waisted and tailored jackets. It is important to
juxtapose the boudoir tone of the lingerie with the propriety of the
tailored jacket if this look is to work outside the bedroom.
Put together carelessly, it could appear that you had forgotten your skirt
or - worse - leave you looking like a streetwalker. So choose accessories
carefully. Wear fine, skin-toned hosiery, such as Wolford's 10-denier
'Individual'. Absolutely sheer tights look tarty; opaque ones too heavy.
Choose gossamer-light shoes to give the impression that you are barely shod.
Russell &amp; Bromley has an extensive range of pretty, strappy and ribbon-tied
high sandals this season in black, bronze, silver, gold and pink, for about
Pounds 100.
Your jacket should be understated. Avoid loud, gilt buttons or 'novelty'
details. If you are reviving an old, tailored jacket, replace the gilt with
dressmakers' buttons of the same tone as the cloth or, if you cannot find
them, modest mother-of-pearl ones. Above all, grooming should be bandbox
smart and classic: that tousled 'just out of bed' style and lashings of
make-up will only induce unwelcome attention.
The new, on-the-knee length of skirt is perfect - too short, baby-doll
style, looks comical. Avoid transparency, too much lace or too many bows and
ruffles. Keep it simple.
The White House has a particularly wonderful lingerie department. The
workmanship on its embroidered slips is exquisite and there is the added
thrill of receiving your lingerie in a big, white shiny box, lettered in
gold and fastened with ribbons, which, if you live in London, is delivered
to your door free of charge by an old retainer driving a green and gold van.
Such delicacy needs finely crafted jewellery to set it off. Berlin Iron,
which imitates the filigree effect of black lace, has a compelling history.
In 1804 the Royal Prussian Iron Foundry introduced the jewellery as a
sideline. During the Prussian War of Liberation in 1813, aristocrats who had
sacrificed their diamonds and pearls for the war coffers, donned this
patriotic jewellery to proclaim their loyalty in the fight against Napoleon.
Grand duchesses and countesses appeared at political salons and country
house parties wearing black inscribed rings in place of their wedding rings,
and steel cameos depicting the profiles of their war heroes wreathed in
Roman-style laurels.
European ladies swooned with envy, for the Royal Foundry and its fellow
steelworks - Trier on the Moselle in Austria, Gleiwitz in Silesia, and Count
Stolberg-Wernigerode's at Ilsenburg in the Hartz mountains - refused to
disclose how it was done for several decades.
At the Great Exhibition at Crystal Palace in London in 1851, English
craftsmen speculated about the iron's composition. Had phosphorus been added
to the molten iron in the casting process? Perhaps the Germans used iron
without graphite; perhaps it was the inordinately high temperatures of the
charcoal-fired furnaces that allowed such precision? Would-be imitators were
confused and maddened.
Berlin iron was never diminished by the description 'imitation jewellery'.
It was far too defined and demanded such artistry and skill. That the iron
of canons could be turned into fine foliated scrolls, and gothic motifs had
Europe marvelling at its strange beauty. Even the enemy Napoleon dispatched
patterns from Berlin to Paris in 1806 to be copied.
By 1860 its moment had passed. Nickel alloys circulated as poor cousins and
the sacrificial notion was briefly revived during the first world war by the
Germans, but its heyday was gone.
Perhaps the strength of iron, lying lightly on a whisper of lace is the way
to reflect the strong and the gentle side of a woman this winter.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Perspectives: The Greece that too few can see / Thrace,
where suspicion still rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The corporal outside Greek army headquarters in Alexandroupolis glanced
suspiciously at the permit from Athens before disappearing to find an
officer. Twenty chilly minutes later, he was back with encouraging news: no
military escort would be needed for two foreign journalists visiting the
wildlife reserve on the Evros river delta, which marks the Greek-Turkish
frontier in Thrace.
Visiting Thrace, the north-eastern corner of Greece, raises practical
difficulties not usually found in a country that earns more money from
tourism than from exports of goods. As Greece's poorest region, it is keen
to attract visitors. Tourist brochures extol its unspoilt coast and appeal
for environmentalists.
There are pictures, too, of minarets rising above red-tiled roofs: Thrace
has a sizeable Moslem minority. Yet, a surprisingly large area next to the
borders with Bulgaria and Turkey is included in a military zone, closed to
both Greek and foreign visitors without special permits.
Traditional enmity with Turkey was reinforced by hostility towards Bulgaria,
a Warsaw Pact member. The end of communism brought little change in official
attitudes, although Bulgaria is among Greece's fastest-growing export
markets for everything from ice-cream to insurance services. Successive
Greek governments have stalled on Bulgarian requests to open a new border
crossing in Thrace and set up a container terminal at Alexandroupolis port.
The Evros delta, a half-hour drive from Alexandroupolis, is the region's
main tourist attraction: a 190 sq km wilderness of marshes and shallow
lagoons used by more than 300 species of birds that nest, migrate or winter
in Greece. As a wetland that attracts rare bird species, it is popular with
bird-watchers from all over Europe - but they are confined to a small strip
at the western edge unless they wait several weeks for a military permit.
Stella Kaldara, of the World-Wide Fund for Nature, is allowed to take
visitors with permits into the zone. She says: 'We've been trying for
several years to set up a management structure for the delta, co-ordinated
by the environment ministry. That would mean being able to organise groups
of visitors, and more income for people in the villages round here. The plan
is approved in principle, but it isn't being implemented.'
Spyros Kouvelis, of the WWF, adds: 'Wetlands are still being encroached on,
but the Evros region is in better shape than many. The army tries to be
co-operative.'
If getting to the Evros delta is difficult, only the most persistent
traveller can reach the Rodopi mountains, which divide Greece and Bulgaria.
This is where one of Europe's last primeval forests survives, inhabited by
wolves and brown bears. Their numbers have been swelled in the past two
years by bears driven south from the former Yugoslavia because of the war in
Bosnia.
The rules vary according to who you ask, but the consensus is that you need
clearance from the ministries of defence, foreign affairs, interior and
public order ministries, as well as the local police. One official said:
'Many applications circulate endlessly.
'I tell people who are desperately keen to see the primeval forest to make
friends with the forestry service and ride up in a timber truck - or wait
for the next election and follow the campaign trail up there.'
No clear reason is given for making Rodopi off-limits to visitors but it
appears to be linked with the Pomak minority, Moslems whose ethnic origins
are disputed fiercely by Greek and Turkish scholars. The Pomaks, livestock
breeders with little education, live on both sides of the Greek-Bulgarian
border. Together with ethnic Turks and gypsies, they make up a Moslem
minority of around 100,000 in Thrace.
Orhan Hadji-ibrahim, a Moslem lawyer, says: 'There aren't any cold war
excuses any more about keeping people out of Rodopi. The authorities talk
about unmarked minefields but it's really the Pomak issue that's involved.
They have a ridiculous theory that if this border is opened, the Pomaks will
want to join up with their relations on the Bulgarian side and will start
demanding autonomy.'
The Moslem minority, like the much smaller Greek minority in Turkey, remains
hostage to the two governments' political quarrels. The Greek government has
directed more than Dr60bn (Dollars 250m) in EU-financed projects to Thrace
in the past five years and provides generous incentives for investment. But
the Moslems, mostly cotton and tobacco farmers, complain they are excluded
from the government's efforts to develop Thrace.
Education is one of the most divisive issues. The Moslems say they fear
their children may face discrimination at Greek schools. Rather than go to a
local Turkish-language high-school, many Moslem teenagers are sent to Turkey
instead to improve their chances of getting a university place there. On
graduation, they prefer to find jobs in Turkey rather than return home.
Abdulhalim Dedes, an ethnic Turk who runs a radio station in Komotini, says:
'Discrimination here is selective. But, unless education improves, Moslems
can't participate properly in society and Thrace will go on being backward.'

FT  10 DEC 94 / Perspectives: Time-travel, not just a thing of the past -
The Nature of Things
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Time-travel enthusiasts can look forward to a vintage year in 1995. Timecop,
the latest movie in the genre, opens in Europe next month after a successful
run in the US. And the literary world will be celebrating the centenary of
H. G. Wells' The Time Machine, the inspiration of so much science fiction
since its first publication in 1895.
Until very recently, scientists would have dismissed the idea of two-way
time-travel as too implausible to deserve serious study outside sci-fi, even
as a theoretical possibility.
There is no objection to one-way travel into the future. We are all moving
in that direction in normal life, at a rate of one second per second; and
scientists have known since Einstein formulated his special theory of
relativity that we could travel faster into the future by going on a round
trip into space at almost the speed of light. If we returned home after a
year, we would find that several decades had passed on Earth.
However the traditional view that the laws of physics forbid travel into the
past is now being challenged. Some theoreticians have come up with new
solutions to Einstein's relativity equations which suggest that loops in the
four-dimensional structure of space-time, known as closed timelike curves
(CTCs), could provide a route backwards in time.
But what about the well-known paradoxes that appear to rule out time-travel?
Most famous is the 'grandfather paradox': if you go back 60 years and murder
your grandfather before he has any children, how could you have been born?
This paradox - or its less brutal variants - would prevent any attempt to
make alterations to the past.
Another paradox is that time-travel could create knowledge, information or
art out of nowhere. Assume that a literary historian returns to Elizabethan
England, carrying the text of Hamlet, to interview Shakespeare about the
play. He gets his dates wrong, arriving before the young playwright has
written Hamlet - and Shakespeare seizes the opportunity to copy the
time-traveller's text and claim it as his own work. Who then created the
play?
There is a way round such paradoxes, even in classical physics: to say that
all actions must be consistent with past history. This 'consistency
principle' has to over-ride the 'autonomy principle', which normally gives
us the freedom to do what we want in our local environment (so long as it
does not violate the laws of science) without paying attention to what is
happening in space-time elsewhere in the universe.
So if time-travel is possible, the traveller must lose some of his or her
normal 'free will'. If you went back to shoot your young grandfather,
something would prevent you doing the dirty deed; your gun might jam, you
might change your mind - or your time machine might break down on the way
back to the past. Likewise, some mishap would stop you showing a copy of
Hamlet to Shakespeare before he had written the play.
This level of determinism may seem strange, but it does not in itself rule
out time-travel in the context of classical physics.
Entirely different resolutions of the paradoxes are possible if you turn to
quantum physics. A current favourite is the 'multiverse' or 'many worlds'
view, first proposed by the late Hugh Everett at Princeton in 1957 and now
championed by David Deutsch at Oxford.
This view, which is much explored in contemporary fiction, holds that there
is not just one universe with a single history but a huge number of parallel
universes in which all possible histories happen simultaneously. Anyone who
went back in time would end up in a different universe from the one he left
behind.
Imagine trying to enact the grandfather paradox. You leave the universe in
which you have grown up and go back 60 years to another, which had been
identical until the moment you arrive. In the second universe, you emerge as
a previously unknown figure from your time machine and murder an unfortunate
young man before he has any children. But that does not affect the first
universe, where no one appears from the future to stop him having children
and then grandchildren - one of whom eventually disappears in a time
machine.
You keep your free will but you can never create a paradox, according to the
multiverse theory, because quantum physics provides enough linked universes
to accommodate all the conflicting possibilities. Deutsch admits that the
theory is controversial, although it is the prevailing interpretation in
quantum cosmology.
The fact that time-travel is theoretically possible does not mean it would
ever be practical, even for a super-advanced civilisation. CTCs have emerged
as theoretical solutions to Einstein's equations, as a possible path for
time machines, but no one knows whether they exist somewhere or could be
created artificially.
If CTCs do exist on the scale that would be required for time-travel, they
are probably in regions of the universe that would be extremely inhospitable
for the traveller, such as the edge of a rotating black hole. And creating
one would require amounts of energy that are inconceivable with any
technology known today.
Many physicists, including Stephen Hawking of Cambridge University, continue
to maintain that time-travel is impossible. Some argue on theoretical
grounds that CTCs could not exist, except perhaps on an infinitesimal scale
a million-million-million-million-million times smaller than an atom. Others
prefer the practical argument that no one could withstand the radiation and
forces around a CTC.
If our descendants many centuries in the future do find a way to travel into
the past, they will face many constraints. Most important, a CTC cannot be
used to go further back in time than the moment of its creation, so our
descendants could not make one to travel back to 1994. They might find
suitable CTCs already in existence somewhere in the universe, but these
would have to be used very sparingly, since CTCs are non-renewable by nature
and very limited in capacity.
And if the 'many worlds' view turns out to be correct, no one who was
satisfied with his present life would venture willingly into the past,
because he would end up in a parallel universe - with no possibility of
returning.
It is safe to predict, therefore, that time-travel will never be more than a
minority pursuit. We will not be bothered by time-tourists visiting us from
the future.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Pole position for growth - Why
Antarctic explorers make tracks for Tetbury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When things are at a low ebb in the workshop, the thoughts of Richard
Olivier and Roger Daynes turn to the Scott Polar Research Institute at
Cambridge, where one of their Nansen sleds lives, much admired, in
retirement.
It is the veteran of a 3,700-mile international trans-Antarctic dog sled
expedition in 1989-90 - the longest dog sled journey ever made.
Snowsled, the company Olivier and Daynes own jointly, supplied the sled, one
of three used by the six-man team. The other two were American
Greenland-type sleds. When, in mid-transit, the American sleds broke up on
the crevasse-riven terrain, Snowsled was asked to replace it with another of
its Nansen models.
'Our sleds gave no problem and we were naturally very pleased,' said Daynes,
a former British Antarctic Survey base commander.
Daynes, 52, and Olivier, 44, have been making sleds and other expedition
equipment since 1987. The irony is that if they had continued only making
sleds they would probably not be in business now.
Olivier, a joiner and outdoor pursuits enthusiast, and Daynes met in 1986.
Initially, Daynes continued running his carpentry business in North Wales,
commuting for part of the week to help Olivier in his Gloucestershire
workshop.
An order worth Pounds 9,000 from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) in 1987
for two complete Nansen sleds, 130 bridges and many components, convinced
the two that their future lay in making sleds together.
Later the same year, Daynes moved house and joined Olivier in his workshop -
a converted 18th-century barn on Prince Charles's estate at Highgrove House
near Tetbury.
'BAS was bowled over by the workmanship in our Nansen sledges,' said
Olivier. 'They particularly liked the strength, the traditional lashings,
and the way we had adapted a 3,000-year-old design that displays great
flexibility and strength when pulled at up to 20mph by snowmobile.'
'Neither of us was really a businessman,' Olivier said. 'We could not see
that, although we continued to get orders for very high specification sleds,
we were not going to make money unless we diversified.'
By 1989, turnover had reached Pounds 50,000, but after the two had drawn
Pounds 10,000 each in wages they found there was no profit at the end of the
year.
'We had an annual order from BAS and also from its American equivalent -
about Pounds 30,000 in total,' Daynes said. 'We also had a useful order from
the sponsors of the 1989 International Trans-Antarctic Expedition for 40
mini-Nansen sledges at Pounds 400 a time, for sale in stores in the US. But
still we were struggling to keep going.
'We started to complement the sleds by making glass fibre pulks
(lightweight, kit-carrying sleds), but in 1989-90 the business was still
making no profit and we both drew no wages.'
In 1991, the pair formed a limited company. They borrowed Pounds 20,000 from
Lloyds Bank under a small business loan guarantee scheme and a further
Pounds 20,000 from friends, all of whom have a share option in the company.
They also run a Pounds 15,000 Lloyds overdraft.
The money helped them to build up stock and to begin trading seriously in
the Ventile high-performance clothing they had been experimenting with for
the past two years.
Ventile is a highly resilient cotton fabric. During the second world war, it
was found to increase greatly the life expectancy of pilots who had been
shot down over the sea.
Early in 1993, Snowsled took on two women full-time to make Ventile clothes.
Sir Ranulph Fiennes and Mike Stroud wore Snowsled Ventile clothing crossing
the Antarctic on foot that year.
The clothing has the potential for volume production and it was while
investigating this that the two felt out of their depth. Early in 1994 they
commissioned a marketing survey for Pounds 1,000. 'Although much of it told
us things we already knew, it made it clear where our efforts were best
placed,' said Olivier.
Unfortunately, the report urged them to give up manufacturing the dog
touring and racing sleds they had enjoyed making since 1988. 'We think they
are lovely creations. But we sell them in very small numbers, so now our
policy is to make them only to order,' Olivier said.
The other main recommendation of the survey was to place far greater
emphasis on marketing - in which they knew they had few skills.
'Early this year we employed a man with a great deal of marketing experience
to work for us for three days a month at a fee of Pounds 1,000,' Olivier
said. 'After two months he came up with nothing, so we lent on him. He was
hurt to the quick and left. We felt very relieved.'
Despite a year in which cutbacks in their national Antarctic surveys have
meant smaller sled orders from the British and American governments,
Snowsled has sold equipment to Japan and Brazil.
However it has been a good year for the Ventile clothing, which is likely to
account for between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of this year's expected
turnover of Pounds 150,000.
The two are also optimistic about the future of two survival and protection
systems - a vacuum mattress stretcher for spinal injuries and a lightweight

'We see huge potential, but we are spread so thinly between manufacturing,
sales and a great deal of R and D that we have no time for marketing these
two products,' Olivier said.
'We are open to offers from anybody who could take on the marketing of all
our products, and at the same time buy into the business. But it would have
to be the right person.'

FT  10 DEC 94 / Perspectives: Internet's surf city, here we come - Computing
/ First get a modem writes Paul Taylor, in the first of a series on how to
get connected to online databases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging from the rash of newspaper and magazine articles about the Internet
recently, it seems as if almost everyone with a personal computer is
dialling up, logging on and 'surfing the net'.
In the UK alone, three new magazines dealing with the Internet - the
informal system of computer networks which connects databases and computers
across the globe - have been launched in the past two months.
Subscriptions to organisations which provide Internet access are rising by
more than 10 per cent a month and sales of modems, the electronic devices
that enable personal computers to communicate over a telephone line, are
soaring. But, for many owners of personal computers, the online world
remains a mysterious and intimidating environment of technobabble and
acronyms. The first step to entering this world is selecting a modem.
There are two forms of modem - internal and external. Internal modems plug
into one of the spare card slots found inside most PCs, while external
modems are connected to the PC's communications or serial port by a cable.
Both need to be plugged into a spare telephone socket.
For anyone buying a new computer and intending to explore the online world
it makes sense to buy a machine with an internal modem already installed.
If you are planning to add a modem to an existing PC set-up the conventional
wisdom is that external modems are easier to install and monitor because
they are more accessible. Installing an internal modem means opening up the
PC and plugging in the card.
But the advantages of an internal modem are that it does not take up extra
desk space and it will include the high-speed chips that handle
communications between the latest high-speed modems and the microprocessor
'brain' of the PC. Some fast external modems may still need a special
high-speed serial card installed inside the PC.
The other crucial decision for would-be PC communicators is how fast a modem
to buy. One simple answer is the fastest one you can afford.
Modems are rated according to how quickly they can exchange data over a
telephone line. A modem's speed is expressed either in terms of its baud
rate - which, at lower speeds, is roughly equivalent to bits (of data) per
second - or by reference to the V series standards which have been set by
the international telecommunications authorities.
The most common modem speeds are: V22 or 1,200 baud, V22bis or 2,400 baud,
V32 or 9,600 baud, V32bis or 14,400 baud and the latest standard, V34 or
28,800 baud. Each step up effectively doubles the modem speed and therefore
halves the amount of time it takes to send a particular message across a
telephone wire.
Faster speed means less waiting for files to be transfered and, in most
places, other than the US where local telephone calls are free, cheaper
telephone bills.
Until recently, many modems - and most online databases - only operated at a
speed of 1,200 baud or 2,400 baud. However the current business standard is
for data transmission at 14,400bps and the modem purchaser today should aim
to buy a modem capable of this speed.
Modems used to be expensive, partly because telecommunications authorities
in many countries insisted on their own testing procedures before they would
allow equipment to be connected to their networks.
In the UK, modem designs must be tested. Approved modems carry a green
British Approvals Board for Telecommunications (Babt) sticker. In the past,
many modem manufacturers used this requirement as an excuse to charge
premium prices.
However a flood of 'illegal' imports from overseas which did not carry the
Babt sticker but nevertheless worked perfectly well, forced modem
manufacturers to reasses their pricing policies.
As a result, Babt-approved modem prices in Britain have fallen sharply over
the past year and a fast 14,400 baud modem from a mainstream manufacturer
such as US Robotics, Zoom, Dataflex, MultiTech or Pace can now be bought
through a magazine advertisement for Pounds 150 or less.
Once you have bought a modem, the next task is to connect it to your PC.
Most modems are factory pre-set to respond to signals sent by the
microprocessor to the Coms 2 port of the PC - on many PCs the mouse is
connected to the Coms 1 port.
If, however, the modem is pre-set for a different port, or the Coms 2 port
is already occupied by another device, it may be necessary to reset tiny
switches on the modem called 'jumpers'. The documentation that comes with
the modem you buy will explain how to do this.
The communications software - which determines how the two modems talk to
each other - will also need to be set up for the correct communications
port.
Any PC owner running Microsoft Windows already owns a basic PC
communications software package called Terminal which enables a modem
connection to be established and governs the communications 'protocol'
between two computers.
For the more ambitious, software suites such as Microsoft Works also include
communications software. Even more sophisticated software packages such as
Mirror III, Procomm Plus or Hayes Smartcom are also available, at a cost of
about Pounds 50. Many modems are now sold with communications software, and
sometimes with introductory membership to an online service such as
Compuserve or Delphi.
Compuserve, one of the largest online services, like most of the other
US-based online service providers, supplies its own dedicated Windows
communications software. Compuserve's is called WinCim.
However a standard communications package is all that is needed to log on to
many of the hundreds of private or commercial bulletin board systems. For
full access to the Internet, additional communications software, available
from most Internet service providers, may also be needed.
Next week: Signing up with online services.

FT  10 DEC 94 / We all live in a Trident submarine: The men who sleep with
nuclear missiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some time in the next 10 days, HMS Vanguard, Britain's first Trident
submarine, will slip below the waters of Loch Long and head for the river
Clyde. On board will be a crew of 130 officers and men along with 16 Trident
intercontinental missiles, each carrying up to six nuclear warheads capable
of destroying a city the size of Manchester.
Vanguard had those warheads fitted last week at Coulport, Britain's main
nuclear weapons store. It was a delicate operation and the finishing touch
to a programme which has taken almost 10 years. Now the warheads are mounted
on Trident missiles and a few final tests are being run. When they are
completed, Vanguard will simply fade away.
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the idea that Vanguard might fire
live warheads at a city has come to seem remote, unimaginable, to many
people.
But her crew must be ready, day and night, to begin the routine which could
kill 100m people, turn Russia's cities into rubble or, if such an order were
conceivable, destroy Japan.
To meet this terrible responsibility and the psychological pressure which it
brings, Vanguard's all-male crew can draw on the Royal Navy's long
traditions of discipline and camaraderie in cramped quarters.
Old habits, which Winston Churchill described as 'rum, sodomy and the lash',
have given way to a quiet professionalism and confidence that they are up to
the challenge. Yet, to be cooped up under water waiting for the end of the
world, must be a severe test of any tradition or individual.
The patrol which Vanguard is about to start is the first for Britain's new
Trident nuclear deterrent, and the crew will be at sea for, what they hope,
will be a pretty boring three months. Well away from British waters,
Vanguard hopes to chug around the North Atlantic at a stately but silent
4mph, avoiding contact with anyone and waiting for a signal.
If that day comes, the drill for firing the missiles will have been
well-rehearsed. A cabinet decision, made on the advice of the chiefs of
staff, will be sent to the Royal Navy's command bunker at Northwood near
Watford, Herts. In extremis, that decision might have to be made by the
prime minister and chief of the defence staff alone. From Northwood the
coded message would be sent via the very low frequency radio transmitter in
the Midlands to Vanguard.
Once Vanguard receives the launch signal, the captain and weapons officer
have to check the coded message against copies locked in the submarine's
safe. Both officers then have to use separate keys to give access to another
safe which contains the pistol-grip launch button. The Navy is disturbingly
coy about whether the captain and the weapons officer working in collusion
could launch the missiles without a valid authorisation from London.
However, as the Senior Service, the Navy has in the past resisted the call
for 'interlocks' which would require a third political key onshore to fire
the missiles. A naval officer's word is considered enough.
Legend has it that the firing button on both Polaris and Trident is a Colt
45 trigger. In reality it is a custom-made plastic grip. Hanging next to the
safe, is what looks like a standard issue Metropolitan police truncheon.
That may well be Britain's last line of defence against someone running amok
with the nuclear trigger.
The codes specifying the targets are fed from the submarine's computers into
the missiles. Neither the captain nor the weapons officer knows what the
string of numbers means, so they have no idea who will be destroyed by their
missiles.
All they will know is that they are using war plan A, B, C or Z. Once the
codes are entered the submarine moves up to just below the surface and the
missile hatches open. The captain authorises the firing and the weapons
officer uses his pistol grip to launch the missiles in a pre-set sequence.
Trident missiles are blown out of their tubes by an explosive charge. Only
when they are out of the water and into the air does the main rocket motor
kick in. Half way through the 4,000 mile, 40 minute flight, the missile,
clear of the atmosphere, takes a star sighting to make sure it is on course,
makes any necessary corrections and then fires its warheads towards their
separate targets. Each would explode with about 100 times the force of the
Hiroshima bomb.
The people who would fire these weapons are, by and large, family men,
engaging and likeable middle class graduates who have won success rather
than been born to it. Intelligent and reflective people, the captains are
typically in their 40s with weapons officers in their early 30s.
Vanguard has two crews which alternate. Both Commander Peter Wilkinson, who
will captain the first patrol, and Commander Jim Boyd, his opposite number,
have two daughters. Both have served in submarines for more than 20 years.
Provided you steered clear of the subject of the use of nuclear weapons they
and their fellow officers would make excellent dinner table guests.
All appear calmly adjusted to the job they are being sent to do. Wilkinson
acknowledges his 'awesome responsibility'. But significantly he goes on to
add that he is only carrying out the orders his political masters send, 'our
focus is on being professionals, not on politics'.
The officers have clearly debated the morality and efficacy of nuclear
deterrence, although one suspects slightly in the manner of those who know
the conclusion before they start. Having decided that Deterrence is Right,
however, their conversation admits no other view. Nor has that view shifted
with the fall of the Berlin Wall. 'Nothing has changed in our operations and
we always go out fully operational,' says Commander Boyd. Some seem almost
gung-ho. 'If you're not committed,' said one weapons officer, 'you might as
well not be here.'
If anything, the Navy seems keen to extend the technique which won the cold
war to other areas. Military debate is about sub-strategic deterrent: code
for the idea that the use of single nuclear weapons could be threatened to
keep tin-pot third world dictators in line.
The enlisted men seem bogged down in the mundane life on board and
unconcerned by what they may be called on to do. 'Have you read the latest
Tom Clancy?' one rating said to another in a thick scouse accent. He was
standing next to a missile tube containing warheads which could turn a dozen
Russian cities into boiling puddles of radioactive glass. 'It's about them
hostages in Iran and getting them out with helicopters and that, it's
brilliant.'
Tom Clancy's books are generally assumed to satisfy the hankerings of those
who do not know the inside story of military gadgetry and wished they did.
Maybe because the reality is so mundane, that existence on patrols is about
drills and being tidy and listening for things that you hope are not there,
Clancy also serves to retail the myth of hi-tech warriors to the men
themselves. Life not so much imitating art as simply wishing it did.
For both officers and men that mundane routine is much as it was in the old
Polaris boats. Three shifts work around the clock, monitoring the nuclear
reactor, listening at the sonar stations for any sign of ships or other
submarines, practising torpedo firings and the missile launch drill, and
cruising around at walking pace. For the rest it's eat, sleep and wait for
Armageddon.
Conditions are at least somewhat easier on board than on previous submarines
because the new fleet has to accommodate the bigger Trident missiles.
Vanguard is only slightly smaller than the Invincible aircraft carrier, and
at the same time the crew is smaller than on previous boats, as automation -
and a desire to save money - have taken their toll.
Still, while it is possible to walk around the boat without seeing anyone,
there is never a feeling of being alone.
To give some privacy, a personal stereo is supplied to each crew man, who
can listen to music while lying on a bunk
not much larger than a coffin. The macabre feel is emphasised by the fact
that many of the ratings' bunks are packed in around the bottom of the
missile silos: in that sleep near death who knows what dreams shall come.
At about the size of a small second bedroom, the wardroom catering for 15
officers is probably the largest public space on the boat. Its most
redeeming aspect is the lack of pipework - a feature omnipresent elsewhere -
and some soft furnishings.
Yet despite the best efforts of the Navy's designers, it is impossible to
suspend disbelief and imagine yourself away from this cramped place and this
responsibility. At heart, Vanguard is a nuclear-tipped sardine can with more
than 100 men locked closely together for months at a time. Every nook and
cranny is packed with electronic equipment, every ceiling a sprawl of
hydraulic pipework.
The tang of the air is familiar to anyone who has been inside a power
station or an engineering workshop. It is the metallic bite of machine oil
and the dry warmth of reconditioned oxygen. There is a constant background
hum from the nuclear reactor which is not so much heard as felt. It soaks up
through the soles of your shoes. This is a soulless place drifting on a
soulless mission.
The missile compartment is surreal. In the Polaris submarines they used to
call it The Forest, with 16 tall trunks stretching along the compartment.
Standing among them stretches the imagination beyond breaking point: could
the contents of these tubes mean the end of humanity?
It goes without saying that it takes a particular kind of person to survive
three months squashed inside a tin can waiting for the unimaginable. The
pressure from boredom and claustrophobia is obvious, the weight of the sea
above flattens the soul.
Yet there is also a paradoxical feeling of agoraphobia: thousands of miles
of empty ocean stretching away on all sides added to the vertigo of hanging
two or three miles above the sea bed. Whether the kind of person who can
adjust to such conditions is the right person to have a finger on the
nuclear trigger would make a good psychology finals question.
Stress is a problem. More than one sub-mariner has had to be brought back
from a Polaris patrol under sedation because he was unable to cope with the
psychological demands.
It cannot help that not all of the submarine's crew are volunteers. The
submarine service does not have sufficient applicants, so some have to be
pressed into service from other parts of the Navy. Even Commander Boyd
originally had ambitions to be a naval pilot. For all the Navy's proud
history of turning reluctant recruits into a fighting force, the demands
which are being made now are unimaginable to any crew member who genuinely
contemplates them.
That stress can only increase as the gap between the rhetoric of deterrence
and the likelihood of its being needed to counter an overwhelming threat in
the real world gets wider. Handcuffs hang ready to subdue anyone who cannot
cope. Its infirmary retains a high stock of sedatives.
The difficulty of matching the real world to Vanguard's capabilities is not
confined to the crew. For the Royal Navy, the launch of this spanking new
deterrent is also a slightly awkward affair. Tensions between the great
powers are at their lowest for 50 years, while the US and Russia are busy
dismantling 80 per cent of their nuclear weapons. This is not the best time
for the UK to launch a hideously expensive submarine fleet which
substantially increases the number, range and accuracy of nuclear warheads
Britain can deliver.
In part the Navy's weakened rationale for Trident explains the search for a
new role in deterring those who might land the odd Scud missile on the UK.
It is also behind the argument that nothing much has changed and that Russia
could soon turn hostile again.
Yet it is hard to hide the apparent pointlessness of long and stressful sea
patrols to safeguard against a sneak attack which is not going to come.
Perhaps the boat is at sea because a Trident submarine sitting in port would
be a white elephant even harder to hide. It can only be hoped that the
Navy's long run of avoiding large accidents continues.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Who is to judge?: A bargain with public opinion means Myra
Hindley should never be freed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Myra Hindley should not be released. That is easy to say, but, for some of
us, painful to contemplate. She was 23 when, along with Ian Brady, then 28,
she was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of 17-year-old Edward
Evans and 10-year-old Leslie Anne Downey. In 1987 she confessed that two
other children had been killed. Now in her fifties, she has spent 28 years
in prison. Her accomplice has asked not to be let loose but she has
repeatedly applied for a line to be drawn under her sentence, most recently
in a TV programme this week.
She has paid her debt to society, she argues; she has changed, say those who
advocate parole; there is a time for redemption, says the good Christian
conscience. In 1966, it is protested, she was young, and under the thrall of
her lover. She was forced to participate in sadistic acts. This excuse is
disputed, but we need not seek to establish its truth. For none of the above
arguments, overrides the social imperative that must determine the case.
This is simply put. Justice and mercy come second. Sometimes a government
must bow to a popular desire for revenge.
If that awful proposition is ever true, it is true in this case. The details
of the four killings need no repetition here; all who have heard of the
Moors murders will know how vile were their perpetrators. The public memory
of what happened is enduring. The torture of children cannot be forgiven. It
is perhaps fanciful to say that if Myra Hindley was freed her own life would
be in danger. It might be possible for her to change her name, and her
appearance, and seek the safety of obscurity. Yet she could be no more
genuinely free outside Cookham Wood prison in Kent than she is within its
walls.
Those of us whose attitude to penal reform is liberal cannot escape this
reasoning. If you oppose the death penalty, as we do-gooders do, you cannot
shirk the fact that a majority of the electorate would support it. In
Britain, but not the US, that biblical form of retribution is quite properly
resisted by the majority of our elected politicians. We must be thankful for
that. But there is a price, an implicit bargain with public opinion. If the
House of Commons is to maintain its civilised stance, brutal killers must be
given particularly long sentences, including, in the worst cases, detention
for the rest of the murderer's natural life.
In this matter, although in few others, my view is in accordance with that
of Mr Michael Howard. Following a recent ruling in the House of Lords, the
home secretary is obliged to tell lifers just how much time they are likely
to serve. It is suggested that about a score of the most notorious
murderers, including the Moors killers, will be informed that they will
never be released. Others may have to endure more years in jail under Mr
Howard's rules than under those of his predecessors.
The implications of this harsh regime must be faced, particularly by those
of us who reject the home secretary's contention that 'prison works'. To
deny anyone freedom is to deny him or her one of the principal attributes of
life. Most British jails are not the cushy hotels depicted in tabloid
newspapers. Many are overcrowded, grim, austere. They are, in the words of
an earlier home secretary, universities of crime. The inmates may not be
stealing car radios or burgling homes while locked up but many of them more
than make up for lost opportunities once they are back in general
circulation. Prison does work, but perversely.
Britain has a higher proportion of its population in jails than any other
country in the European Union save Luxembourg. This has not reduced crime,
nor made people feel safe. That is why a succession of Conservative home
secretaries focused more on prevention than on get-tough measures. The
balance of the rhetoric of the present incumbent is the other way. Mr
Howard's record at the home office would long ago have had him slung out of
any cabinet save one so divided and desperate as his own.
It is possible that when he announces his decisions on lifers, he may be
challenged in the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. He probably
should be. To say that those who commit particularly ghastly murders should
be given 'life means life' sentences is not to accept that the power of
incarceration should be in the hands of a minister.
Sentencing is properly the job of the courts, not elected politicians. At
present there are two types of lifer. 'Discretionary' life sentences may be
imposed for crimes such as rape, or manslaughter. Judges decide the term. In
cases of murder, life sentences are 'mandatory,' which means that the home
secretary can determine the length of incarceration. Various advisory
committees, including the parliamentary all-party penal affairs group and a
select committee of the House of Lords, have suggested that all life
sentences be discretionary.
This might not have made any difference in the Hindley-Brady case. Most
judges are as politically aware as any minister. The power to impose
full-life sentences would certainly be exercised in the worst cases. These,
fortunately, are rare. Against that there are types of murder, including,
perhaps, crimes of passion, for which a compulsory life sentence is
inappropriate.
Finally, we face children who kill children. The recent decision by Mr
Howard to increase the length of detention of the murderers of James Bulger
from the judge's eight years to 15 is questionable. Mary Bell, convicted at
age 11 of the manslaughter of two boys aged three and four, spent 11 years
in detention and now, aged 36, lives under an assumed name. You may
challenge me to say which outcome I support - the 11 years imposed in the
earlier case or the minimum of 15 years imposed now. I cannot; perhaps only
a judge can.

FT  10 DEC 94 / 'Stop squabbling', Major tells feuding Tory MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ESSEN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major acknowledged yesterday that his government's remaining hopes
of political recovery rested on an end to the Tory civil war over Europe as
senior ministers disclosed plans for a new strategy to unite the party.
The prime minister, speaking at the summit of European Union leaders in
Essen, Germany, warned Conservative MPs that the electorate did not expect
'the governing party to squabble'.
Blaming a string of by-election defeats on the feuding, and anticipating
another loss in Dudley West next week, he said he understood the voters'
anger.
In a reference to the recent backbench rebellions over Europe and over Mr
Kenneth Clarke's Budget, Mr Major said pointedly that Conservative MPs had
been elected to support the government. He added: 'I think it is time it
(the squabbling) stopped.'
His comments came at the end of a week which has seen Labour's lead over the
Conservatives in the opinion polls jump to the highest level recorded by any
political party in the postwar period. They followed the government's
ignominious parliamentary defeat over value added tax on domestic fuels.
But there was little sign that Mr Major's call for discipline was being
heeded by rebel Tories. Mrs Teresa Gorman, MP for Billericay, said the prime
minister could not drive his party into policies which it wanted to reject.
Sir George Gardiner, chairman of the rightwing 92 group of Tory MPs, who has
been at the centre of a row over claims that he plotted to remove Mr Major
from the leadership, said: 'This kind of paranoia, where you get one group
of the prime minister's supporters attacking another group, really doesn't
help us at all.'
The concern within the cabinet that divisions over Europe could destroy
hopes of a political recovery has led to an acceleration of work on
Britain's negotiating stance for the EU's 1996 inter-governmental
conference. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, has told colleagues he
has produced a framework for the talks which he believes will unite 'the
vast majority' of Tory MPs.
The strategy centres on proposals to slim down the European Commission and
make it more accountable to member states, and to enhance the role of
national parliaments in the scrutiny of EU legislation.
Mr Hurd's ideas, to be discussed by the cabinet's overseas committee during
the next two months, include plans to strengthen the inter-governmental
dimension of EU co-operation - particularly on security and defence.
But he may anger Tory Eurosceptics with a separate call for a considered
national debate on the merits and demerits of a single European currency.
Mr Hurd believes that a rational discussion on the pros and cons of economic
and monetary union would take the political heat out of the issue. But his
stance will be seen by hardline Eurosceptics as an attempt to open up the
possibility of Britain eventually joining a single currency.

FT  10 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Audit committees
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is the UK moving surreptitiously towards German-style two-tier boardrooms?
The original Cadbury Report on corporate governance studiously avoided
recommending the Teutonic approach. But the Audit Agenda, a discussion
document published this week by the Auditing Practices Committee, recommends
an expanded role for audit committees.
The report proposes that these committees, typically comprising
non-executive directors, should be beefed up to take on greater
responsibility for monitoring aspects of management performance on behalf of
shareholders. If adopted, the proposal would mean non-executives taking on a
watchdog role, not dissimilar to that of the German supervisory board. The
danger of this approach is that it could sow tension between executive and
non-executive directors. It also threatens to divide the so-called unitary
principle, established in UK company law, which lays down that the board as
a whole is responsible for a company's affairs.
As the near-collapse of Metallgesellschaft shows, the problem with the
German system is that in times of crisis it is not clear who has the
ultimate responsibility for the company. In that case the supervisory board
simply blamed the management for the debacle. Audit committees are a good
thing insofar as they focus management attention on audits and internal
controls. Their growing popularity since Cadbury helps correct some of the
deficiencies of UK governance. But further expansion of their powers should
not be at the expense of lower standards of accountability.

FT  10 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: US airlines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The tumble taken by the US air transport sector last week after Southwest
Airlines' profits warning is understandable. If Southwest, the most
consistently profitable US airline, is heading into turbulence, the outlook
for the others must be grim. The paradox is that the industry's
macroeconomic environment is bright. The US economy is in the fourth year of
recovery; passenger growth this year is a steady 4 per cent and fuel costs
are near all-time lows. The industry is also helping itself by cutting
domestic capacity. Yet the industry is not prospering. While people are
travelling more, they are paying less. Discounting is acute because the
barriers to entry in the airline industry are so low. Each time an
established airline cuts staff and aircraft it gives new carriers the chance
to pick up jets and trained staff on the cheap. Costs at Valujet, a
no-frills airline, are 40 per cent below those at USAir.
The big airlines can cut distribution, maintenance and staff costs further,
but not far enough. Consolidation would help, but only for a while, until
new low-cost carriers took the place of those merged or closed. Those with
high margin routes to markets such as Latin America and Asia may prosper.
For large carriers cornered in the domestic market, prospects are bleak.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Equities have suffered a jittery week. Yesterday the FT-SE 100 index plunged
below the 3,000 mark. US, continental European and Far Eastern shares have
also been under pressure. The main cause is investor concern over rising
interest rates. Last month's 75-basis point increase in US rates is still
fresh. But the US economy is growing so fast that many shareholders are now
expecting further action from the Federal Reserve when it next meets on
December 20. At some point, this year's sharp increase in borrowing costs
will knock the economy and corporate earnings. Another worry has been the
extraordinary events in Orange County, California. This is not merely a
morality tale about the risks of leveraged investment. Markets have become
jumpy at the thought that Orange County's bankruptcy may not be an isolated
case. If other public and private institutions are found to be in the same
boat, there could be a mass liquidation of investment portfolios.
Still, amid all these troubles, the good news is that government bond
markets are holding up. This is mainly because the higher interest rates
that shareholders fear are finding favour with bond investors. There has
been a pronounced 'flattening' of the yield curve over the past month;
short-term yields have risen, but long-term yields have not. In the UK, this
week's base rate increase has reinforced the view that the government is
prepared to take a tough line to pre-empt inflation. So long as bond markets
remain calm, there will be some underpinning for jittery equities.

FT  10 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: GEC steams ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GEC exudes quiet confidence. At the half year, operating profits are up 13
per cent and turnover up 10 per cent - a creditable performance for a
company so often accused of losing momentum. The trio of core businesses is
in rude health. Telecommunications is positively buoyant, with profits up 22
per cent in the first half. Profits at electronic systems may be flat at
present, but future earnings will benefit from a crop of contracts poised to
come out of the development phase. Likewise, a head of steam is building up
behind GEC Alsthom.
All this is encouraging for shareholders, who have suffered underperformance
of more than 50 per cent, taking a 10-year view. But it will not be enough
to inspire a re-rating. GEC's Pounds 3bn of cash earns a low return and
medium-term earnings growth will be pedestrian, if solid. For so rich a
company, GEC's dividend payouts are not generous, even if there has been a
gentle decline in cover over the years. Dividend growth, for this year and
next, is not likely to match that of the market. For that reason it is
appropriate that the shares stand on a 20 per cent prospective yield premium
to the market.
The lacklustre outlook for the shares could change if the company chose to
give some some of its cash to investors. Lord Weinstock, GEC's managing
director, sees the Pounds 3bn as a cash hillock - but it looks mountainous
in the eyes of covetous shareholders. But Lord Weinstock probably has the
cash earmarked in part to promote a merger of GEC's defence operations with
those of British Aerospace, a longstanding ambition which he would like to
see fulfilled before he retires. Compared with this, the temporarily
frustrated VSEL bid looks small beer.

FT  10 DEC 94 / RJB raises Pounds 894m to secure coal pit deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RJB Mining, the coal company, yesterday confounded critics of its
controversial bid for British Coal's English regions by announcing it had
signed a purchase deal with the government and raised the Pounds 894m needed
to finance it.
The agreement will return the English industry to the private sector at the
end of this month after 47 years of nationalisation.
It is a significant achievement for RJB and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, its
financial adviser, which yesterday placed with institutions all the shares
being issued to help fund the acquisition after underwriting the offer.
RJB's Pounds 815m bid has been sharply questioned within the coal industry
because it is based on what rival bidders say are over-optimistic
assumptions about coal markets.
The fund raising, through which the company aims to triple its value to
Pounds 552m, has also coincided with difficult stock market conditions.
However RJB's existing institutional shareholders have been strongly
supportive, buying 80 per cent of the 125m shares on offer.
The share issue will raise Pounds 400m. In addition a banking syndicate
including Barclays, Chemical and Midland has agreed to lend the remaining
Pounds 494m. RJB needs Pounds 894m to pay the bid price and provide working
capital.
The shares are being issued at 320p, 20p less than the 340p which BZW had
previously told institutions.
Some analysts said the price fall suggested that placing the shares had
proved more difficult than expected. BZW said the placing price reduction
reflected market conditions.
However even analysts who have been sceptical about the bid said the level
of support suggested the price of RJB's shares would be steady, assuming a
reasonable market, when trading in them resumes on December 30.
Of the shares being issued, 85 per cent have been sold to institutions and
the rest placed conditionally. This is to allow small investors up to 15 per
cent.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Caribbean nations win day after US banana drama
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tiny nations of the Windward Islands stared the US in the eye this week,
and it was Washington that blinked.
The US has backed down in a hard-fought battle over bananas to maintain
harmony at this weekend's summit of the Americas in Miami.
President Bill Clinton had boasted that the meeting would bring together
every democratically elected leader in the western hemisphere and exclude
only President Fidel Castro of Cuba. But the anger of Dominica, St Kitts, St
Lucia and St Vincent at US opposition to their preferential banana export
deal with the European Union had put that boast in peril.
The EU's banana import regime favours ACP countries - African, Caribbean and
Pacific nations which are mostly former colonies - over Latin American
producers and US-owned banana multinationals.
A full house was only assured when the US agreed at talks in Geneva not to
oppose the EU's request for a waiver from the terms of the newly completed
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for the banana regime.
'The US has now withdrawn its reservations in Geneva and come up with a form
of words in Gatt that we can live with,' said Mr James Mitchell, prime
minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines. 'We are satisfied that this
banana hurdle is moving out of the way.'
With this obstacle removed, Mr Clinton said the Miami summit is expected to
agree to 'begin immediately to construct the Free Trade Area of the Americas
in which barriers to trade and investment will be progressively eliminated'.
Negotiations would be completed by 2005.
'Here in Miami we have the chance to act and we're going to take it,' Mr
Clinton said as he welcomed his guests in the art deco district of Miami
Beach.
'By the year 2005 we will be selling more to Latin America than to Japan and
Europe.' He hailed a 'dazzling opportunity to build a community of nations'.
The meeting started yesterday in the 1920s splendour of the Biltmore Hotel
where Al Capone and the Duke of Windsor stayed, and will move on today to
the Italianate Vizcaya mansion on Biscayne Bay.
The summit is the first to bring together the Americas since a meeting at
Punta del Este, Uruguay, in 1967, when 10 of the leaders represented were
military dictators.
'Today, 34 of the leaders have won their posts through ballots, not
bullets,' Mr Clinton said.

FT  10 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rebounds to close nearly
flat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Share prices bounced back from early-morning lows yesterday to finish nearly
flat amid growing fears of another rise in interest rates, writes Lisa
Bransten in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 5.38 at 3,691.11. The
more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 1.52 at 446.97, the American
Stock Exchange composite down 2.15 at 420.66 and the Nasdaq composite fell
0.07 at 719.05. Trading volume on the NYSE came to 338m shares.
The Dow fell more than 30 points at one point yesterday before rebounding as
investors bought cheap equities at the bottom of the market and traders
covered their short positions.
Late in the morning the market turned mixed with the Dow momentarily
positive, but most of the indices proved unable to hold on to positive
terri-tory.
While the stock market worried that another interest rate increase could
erode corporate earnings, the bond market was relishing the realisation that
the Federal Reserve did intend to hold a firm line against inflation.
The long bond price jumped in the morning before sliding back to gain 1/8 by
midday, while the price of the two-year note showed modest declines.
Stock and bond markets, which have moved in tandem for much of this year,
continued their recent decoupling as stocks skidded sharply in the early
morning, while the long bond shot upward before falling off slightly.
The stock market continues to alternate between moving with the bond market,
and acting as a mirror image of it.
Financial troubles in Orange County continued to trouble the market. Stocks
have been volatile all week amid uncertainty over the ramifications of huge
losses made by the California county and its declaration of bankruptcy on
Tuesday. Also causing worry were fears that individual investors might begin
to pull money from mutual funds in the wake of several sharp selloffs,
including a loss of nearly 50 points on Thursday.
Technology stocks received a boost from figures showing rising demand for
semiconductors.
Texas Instruments gained Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 72, National Semiconductor
rose Dollars 1 at Dollars 18 3/8 and Applied Materials increased Dollars 2
at Dollars 43 1/4 . Intel was unchanged at Dollars 62 3/4 .
Cyclical stocks were mixed. United Technologies dropped Dollars 1 1/4 at
Dollars 58 1/8 , Caterpillar fell Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 50 7/8 and
Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber lost Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 32 7/8 . Shares posting
gains included Hewlett-Packard, up Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 95 1/8 , Dow
Chemical Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 62 7/8 , Roadway Service, which is traded
on the Nasdaq, Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 48 1/4 and Motorola Dollars 1 3/4 at
Dollars 55 3/8 .
Canada
A late-session rally took back the bulk of early losses in Toronto as stocks
closed modestly lower in moderate trading.
The TSE 300 composite index dropped 12.24 points, or 0.30 per cent, to
4034.33, with losers over winners 450 to 253. Volume traded of 43.999,000
shares and value of CDollars 522.7m were down from Thursday's 53,634,000
shares and CDollars 655.4m.
Overall, 11 of the 14 sub-indexes were down led by real estate,
conglomerates, pipelines and communications stocks. Mexico
Mexican stocks finished lower for a third straight session yesterday in
light trade ahead of Monday's Virgin of Guadalupe holiday. The market's key
IPC index settled off 32.11 points to 2,467.79 - a loss of 1.28 per cent. At
the end of 1993, the IPC stood at 2,602.63.
Buying, especially foreign buying, was again stunted by fears of a renewed
outbreak of violence in the troubled state of Chiapas.
Volume totalled a light 468 million new pesos, on 35.7 million shares
traded.

FT  10 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong off 3.5% at
year low

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Stocks fell precipitously near the end of the session, wiping out early
gains and putting the Nikkei 225 below 19,000 for the first time since
December 2, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo
After closing above 19,000 all week, the 225 index slid 201.74 under a
barrage of arbitrage unwinding to finish at 18,978.30, having moved between
19,240.15 and 18,972.29 during the session.
When futures started to tumble in the afternoon due to position covering,
the market was deluged by arbitrage-related sales, pushing prices lower.
Volume on the first section soared to an estimated 492m shares, more than
twice the 211m shares traded on Thursday. Brokers attributed more than half
the day's volume to transactions stemming from Friday's special-quotation
settlement of index futures and options.
The Topix index of all first-section stocks dropped 14.98 to 1,506, while
the capital-weighted Nikkei 300 edged down 2.89 to 277.61. Losers swamped
winners 772 to 237 with 168 stocks unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.40 to 1249.25.
Sega Enterprises broke a nine-day winning streak and ended Y50 lower at
Y5,660 after climbing to Y5,910 earlier in the day. Nintendo shed Y200 to
Y5700.
In Osaka the OSE average fell 197.18 to 20,984.92 in volume of 29.4m shares.
Roundup
The region was sharply weaker following Wall Street's overnight loss.
HONG KONG closed a dismal week with a further 3.5 per cent decline to record
another low for the year. The Hang Seng index lost 279.24 to 7,789.07, down
5.3 per cent over the week, amid heavy selling by foreign investors worried
about rising US interest rates and fallout from the Orange County
bankruptcy.
The futures market pointed to further declines. The December share index
contract ended at a discount to the physical market at 7,750, down 230 in
heavy volume.
Shares fell across the board with mainland China companies hardest hit.
Investors feared that China's entry into Gatt would be delayed, dampening
opportunities for mainland companies. The Hang Seng China Enterprises index
fell 44.95, or 4.3 per cent, to 1,002.61.
SINGAPORE fell 1.8 per cent to its lowest level since April as fund managers
followed the trend seen elsewhere, selling stocks to raise cash.
The Straits Times Industrials index closed 37.40 lower at 2,102.28 but off
an intra-day low of 2,078.33. The index fell 5.1 per cent over the week.
KUALA LUMPUR finished at a 13-month low as foreign investors continued to
sell blue chips. The composite index closed 14.08 points lower at 911.26 for
a 6.8 per cent fall on the week.
SEOUL saw broad based selling for the third straight day, amid continuing
worries of a liquidity squeeze and the composite index lost 16.03 to
1,037.67, for a 1.5 per cent decline on the week.
Dealers said rumours that the central bank would allot to financial
institutions Won1,300bn worth of monetary stabilisation bonds chilled
sentiment, while news that a securities watchdog would inspect recent risers
as an anti-corruption measure took its toll on a rally led by
smaller-capitalisation companies.
SYDNEY retreated to a 16-month low with the All Ordinaries index closing
down 24.1, or 1.3 per cent, at 1,850.9, a week's fall of 1.6 per cent.
Turnover was ADollars 325.3m.
Among the movers BHP lost 44 cents to ADollars 18.56, CRA 28 cents to
ADollars 17.18 and News Corp 13 cents to ADollars 4.97.
MANILA mirrored other markets with a decline of 51.49 in the composite index
to 2,604.87, slightly up since the previous Friday after a strong
performance earlier in the week. Petron dipped 3.6 per cent to 19.75 pesos
while PLDT shed 2.2 per cent to 1,275 pesos.

FT  10 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Global airline stocks follow
Wall Street lead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Problems peculiar to the short-haul market in the US hit airline share
prices around the world yesterday, after falls in Continental Air and
Southwest Air in New York overnight, writes Our Markets Staff.
In Europe, KLM dropped Fl 1.60, or nearly 4 per cent, to Fl 41.60 and
Lufthansa by DM4.20, or 2.2 per cent, to DM185.20. This had nothing to do
with European airline operating conditions, and everything to do with
fragile bourse sentiment, said Mr James Halstead, airlines analyst at SBC.
FRANKFURT also saw weakness in carmakers as the Dax index lost 13.88 to
2,028.33 on the session, and slid further to an Ibis-indicated 2,024.19 by
the end of the afternoon, down 0.8 per cent on the week.
Turnover fell from DM4.2bn to DM3.8bn. In the automotive sector BMW lost
DM11.50 at DM739, Conti DM3.50 at DM210.50, Daimler DM13.50 at DM736 and
Volkswagen DM8.50 at DM410.
At Lehman Brothers Mr Christopher Will, the motor industry analyst, said the
carmakers were following a trend evident across Europe: 'Car stocks have
underperformed gently since cyclicals saw their peak in April, but they have
been extremely vulnerable in recent weeks.'
Mr Will added that institutions were being cautious about the sector,
perhaps on the prospect of relatively modest profits recovery in 1995. 'But
this might be the time to buy,' he said, 'given that, in a month's time,
people will be looking at prospects for 1996.'
PARIS continued to track the US situation and the CAC-40 index fell 17.10 to
1,936.99, for a week's decline of 2.3 per cent. Turnover was about FFr3bn.
Michelin eased FFr1.70 to FFr192.9 in good volume.
Outside the CAC-40 index Eurotunnel went against the trend, rising 95
centimes to FFr22.85, on news that the company would get permission to run
passenger shuttle services from December 15.
Switching out of Elf Aquitaine into Total continued, the former losing FFr5
at FFr379.20 and the latter rising FFr1.20 to FFr321.
MILAN fell to an 11-month low as worries resurfaced about the outlook for
the Berlusconi government and its budget prospects. The Comit index lost
12.08 to 601.52, down 4.7 per cent on the week.
Telecom Italia fell L175, or 4.4 per cent, to L3,780, foreigners selling the
stock after prospects faded for a cut in its payment to government for its
mobile telephone concession. Stet, the parent company, lost L165 to L4,437.
Against the trend, Cartiere Burgo, the paper group, put on L312 to L10,450,
taking its rise over the last two sessions to 6.4 per cent. Mr Roger Hornett
at Societe Generale Equities International, who recommended the stock this
week, forecast a 29 per cent surge in current year sales, a return to strong
profits in 1995 and added that the share price still had the potential to
double.
AMSTERDAM closed the week on the downgrade, the AEX index losing 2.97 at
406.32 for a 0.9 per cent decline on the week.
VNU resisted the downtrend for most of the session, after Thursday's news
that it was in talks with a rival television production company. The shares
saw a high of Fl 175 at one stage, before retreating to close unchanged at
Fl 171.50.
KPN, the telecommunications group, off 10 cents at Fl 54.40, confirmed it
had been having talks with Belgacom, the Belgian operator, which is due to
be privatised.
Akzo Nobel was down Fl 2.90 at Fl 191.60 and announced that it was setting
up a joint venture in China to manufacture and sell organic peroxides.
ZURICH finished lower in very thin trading, with the firm dollar and bund
futures limiting losses. The SMI index lost 13.3 to 2,576.0, with Wall
Street and the Orange County bankruptcy still taking their toll. The index
was little changed on the week.
Banks provided the day's feature. CS Holding, which announced plans on
Thursday for a single class of registered share, saw the registered hold
steady at SFr105 while the bearers declined SFr4 to SFr524.
SBC, which said it had no plans to follow CS Holding and UBS in creating a
single share class, fell SFr6 to SFr355.
Interdiscount, the electronics retailer, extended the week's sharp loss on
analysts' lower earnings forecasts, declining SFr60 to SFr1,440.

FT  10 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Helsinki quivers after rise in interest
rates - The Finnish bourse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Helsinki may be small; it is certainly not dull. For the second year
running, it has been Europe's top performing bourse; but the pace of
Finland's recovery, attendant inflationary fears and their consequences
prompted the market to trim its sails yesterday.
The FT-Actuaries Finland index, taking this year so far, had risen by 23.2
per cent until Thursday; in dollar terms the rise was an even more
spectacular 46.4 per cent, thanks to the strengthening markka. However, the
Bank of Finland's increase in its tender rate yesterday from 5.01 to 5.50
per cent was the first indication that the Finnish interest rate cycle has
turned, and the Hex index responded with a fall of 31.2, or 1.7 per cent, to
1,836.4.
The earlier scenario was less straightforward than it looked. First, the
market has actually fallen since the overheated few weeks at the start of
the year, before US interest rates first went up. Second, a huge divide has
developed between Nokia, Finland's booming telecommunications group, and the
rest of the market. Exclude Nokia from the equation and the Helsinki bourse
is slightly down on the year.
Nokia, the world's second largest manufacturer of mobile phones, accounts
for a staggering 27 per cent of Finland's total FM180bn market
capitalisation. At the start of the year, it accounted for just 15 per cent.
The company's share price has more than doubled this year on booming sales
and surging profits. Since September 1992, the group's shares have risen
15-fold.
By contrast, other segments of the market have fallen this year. Most
surprising has been the slight decline in the forestry index. This has come
at a time when all of Finland's quoted pulp and paper groups have reported
excellent profits and when price rises in the sector have been higher than
anticipated a year ago.
Less surprisingly, banks and financials are down 20 per cent. This reflects
the continuing losses being suffered by the leading banks and slow recovery
from the country's 1992 financial crisis.
Global bond market turbulence has weighed on the non-Nokia market. Corporate
share issues and an increase in the pace of the Finnish privatisation
programme have also soaked up liquidity.
Finally, foreign investors, whose heavy buying of Finnish shares in the last
two years has helped to drive prices up so sharply, have been locking in
gains. Last month foreigners were net sellers of Finnish shares for the
first time since September 1992.
Foreigners have been attracted to the Finnish market by a combination of
circumstances. The economy has made a strong recovery from its most severe
recession between 1991 and 1993, when gross domestic product fell by 15 per
cent.
Restructuring, a weak currency, and an upturn in the international economy
suddenly transformed the prospects of the big exporters and cyclical stocks
which dominate the Finnish stock exchange. At the same time, interest rates
have been standing at levels not seen in 30 years and restrictions on
foreign ownership of Finnish shares have been relaxed.
The consequence is that a stock market which has always been volatile
because of its heavy cyclicals component could become even more volatile now
that foreigners own as much as 30 per cent of it. If there was ever a big
rush for the door, domestic investors would find it hard to absorb the load.
Most analysts still believe the market remains good value, particularly on a
European comparison. Shares are selling on a multiple of only 9-9.5 times
next year's projected earnings. Mr Kim Lindstrom, managing director of UBF
Fund Management, says: 'The market is too cheap. Never in Finnish economic
history has there been such a rapid and dramatic corporate earnings
recovery.'
Mr Lindstrom expects the market to regain momentum in the New Year. Not only
might foreigners be back in the market then, but money tied up in domestic
fixed-term bank deposits is expected to be released for share purchases. He
also believes that companies will be paying much bigger dividends than last
year, partly because of strong profitability and also because of tax
changes. 'Whereas the total corporate dividend payout for 1993 was FM1.4bn,
for 1994 it could rise to between FM3bn and FM3.5bn,' says Mr Lindstrom.
Finland's gross domestic product could grow by more than 6 per cent next
year as recovery in the export sector spreads to the domestic economy. But
there are concerns.
Inflation fears are being fuelled by the annual wage tussle between industry
and unions. In the pulp and paper sector, unions are seeking as much as 10
per cent and they have threatened a strike from next Friday if their demands
are not met.
There is also the continuing privatisation programme which could present the
market with a digestion problem. An initial public offering from Neste,
Finland's biggest industrial group by sales, is widely expected in the
spring.
The other worry is a continued strengthening of the markka. That might lift
foreign investors' stock market returns but it will inevitably harm the
competitiveness and earnings of Finland's big exporters.

What a week of shocks. Fuel tax, VSEL, Warburg and Magellan. Magellan? In
between the big quakes came a small announcement from America: Magellan Fund
is skipping its year-end payment to its 3m investors.
So what? Well, all's well that ends well: just a minor accounting glitch -
apparently. But, for a brief few hours, the markets were full of rumours
that selling by Magellan was going to torpedo share prices round the world.
Magellan is a mutual fund - the American equivalent of a unit trust. But it
is not just any old mutual fund: it is the mutual fund equivalent of General
Motors - and when Magellan sneezes, world markets catch cold.
This is not just because Magellan is big: its assets total around Dollars
36bn. It is because its performance over many years gave the lie to those
who reckon that no fund manager can continue to beat the market.
From 1977 to 1990, the fund was run virtually single-handed by Peter Lynch.
When he moved in, it was worth Dollars 18m; when he retired, it was worth
Dollars 14bn. Anyone investing in Magellan when Lynch took over would have
been nearly 30 times richer by the time he retired. And although growth had
begun to slow even before Lynch left, the myth of the unbeatable fund
remained.
Lynch's approach to investment appeals to personal investors partly because
it sounds so easy to emulate themselves. Indeed, he has written a couple of
books explaining how the plain man can beat the professionals*.
One of the more ironic aspects of this week's rumours was the suggestion
that massive losses on derivatives were behind the skipped pay-out to
investors. Lynch himself argued vehemently that picking stocks was enough
for any red-blooded investor:
'I've never bought a future nor an option in my entire investing career, and
I can't imagine buying one now. It's hard enough to make money in regular
stocks without getting distracted by these side bets, which I'm told are
nearly impossible to win unless you are a professional trader.
' . . . If this is sensible investing, then the Titanic was a tight ship . .
. The large potential return is attractive to many small investors who are
dissatisfied with getting rich slow. Instead, they opt for getting poor
quick.'
Not, of course, that it is just small investors who take the fast lane to
penury. One reason rumour-mongers were so ready to pin derivative upsets on
to Magellan was that losses on derivatives and other highly leveraged
investments have been making the headlines with such regularity.
This week, for instance, Bankers Trust, one of Wall Street's premier
investment banks, had to sign a written agreement to make its derivatives
salesmen behave better. On the other side of the continent, a Californian
county has gone bankrupt - or tried to - because another sophisticated
financial toy exploded in its face.
Both the woes of Bankers Trust's customers and the wrangles over Orange
County's losses come back to the same thing: investors dissatisfied with
getting rich slow who learn how to get poor - fast.
To shoot oneself in one foot might be regarded as a misfortune. To shoot
oneself in both looks like carelessness. Great Universal Stores' Pounds 300m
special dividend payment has a careless tinge to it.
The market had been hoping the group would use part of its Pounds 1.5bn
excess cash to buy back some of its outstanding shares, which improves the
earnings capacity of the remaining shares. Instead, it is handing out 30p a
share to all shareholders as a special dividend - which slightly reduces
future earnings potential. That is bullet-through-foot number one: long-term
shareholder value.
But perhaps the deal has benefited shareholders in the short term? The
explanation by GUS for choosing a cash repayment rather than a buy-back was
that it was fairer to individual shareholders, since only professional
investors can normally sell shares in a buy-back. Well, up to a point, Lord
Wolfson.
The market was so disappointed by the announcement of the 30p a share
hand-out that the share price dropped 36p. Any investor paying 40 per cent
tax will have to pay another 7.5p tax on the 30p net dividend, and so ends
up with only 22.5p in the hand: notably less than the 36p fall in the share
price. Sounds like a double whammy.
*One up on Wall Street (Penguin) and Beating the Street (Simon &amp; Schuster,
New York). Both by Peter Lynch, in conjunction with John Rothchild.

BUSINESS
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke turned to smokers, motorists and drinkers in a
mini-Budget designed to plug the gap in the government's finances caused by
the Commons' rejection of a further increase in VAT on domestic fuel.
The government moved swiftly to hold the confidence of financial markets in
the wake of its VAT defeat by pushing up interest rates 0.5 points to 6.25
per cent.
Less than an hour after Clarke stood up to deliver his mini-Budget, Northern
Rock became the first mortgage lender to announce a rise in its home loan
rate.
Companies could be forced to secure shareholder approval for executive
salary awards under proposals to be considered by a cabinet committee next
week.
The Queen is to allow oil exploration in the grounds of Windsor Castle.
Experts believe there could be up to 100m barrels, worth about Pounds 1bn,
300m below the castle.
Fifty dissatisfied customers started court proceedings against Hoover, the
electrical group, over the company's free flights offer.
Demand for credit among UK consumers eased slightly in October although it
continued to run at a high level.
Local authorities in England and Wales have detected Pounds 34m worth of
fraud in the past financial year - Pounds 9m more than 1992-93, according to
the Audit Commission.
Equalising the state pension age at 65 will cost women between 20 and 44 an
average of Pounds 14,756 each, according to the Trades Union Congress.
The stock exchange is pressing ahead with proposals to halt trading in
individual companies' shares if there is evidence that price-sensitive
information has leaked.
A teddy bear from the late Lt Col Bob Henderson's collection of 500 was sold
at Christie's in London for Pounds 110,000, double the previous world
record.
COMPANIES
SG Warburg, the largest UK investment bank, announced that it intended to
give up its independence by merging with the US investment bank Morgan
Stanley in an effort to create a stronger global bank. The news set alight
trading in the merchant bank sector.
Mercury Communications, British Telecommunications' largest competitor in
the UK, will cut 2,500 jobs, nearly a quarter of its workforce, over the
next 12 months and withdraw loss-making services - including its public
payphones - in an attempt to return to profits.
The Anglo-French company GEC Alsthom has beaten the Swedish/Swiss-owned ABB
Transportation to win an Pounds 800m to Pounds 900m order for new trains on
the London Underground.
Morgan Grenfell Investment Management was fined Pounds 180,000 by Imro, the
fund management self-regulatory body, in connection with losses from pension
schemes controlled by the late Robert Maxwell.
Brisk profits growth at Holiday Inn, the global hotel chain, allowed Bass to
report a 9 per cent rise in full-year pre-tax profits despite a further fall
in beer profits and sluggish performances from pubs and leisure.
Graeme Bowler, chief executive of grocery discounter Kwik Save since July
1993, was paid a total of Pounds 586,000 in his first year - 72 per cent
more than his predecessor, Graeme Seabrook, received in his final nine
months with the company.
Great Universal Stores, the mail order, retail, property and financial
services group, is to hand Pounds 300m of its Pounds 1.5bn cash pile back to
shareholders in the form of a 30p a share special dividend. But with the
special dividend payable only to those holding shares on Thursday, and lower
than expected profits, GUS shares fell 35p to 496p.
The acquisition of Scandinavian Leisure Group last April helped Airtours to
boost profits by 66 per cent and sales by almost the same amount.
A strong first-time contribution from the Chef &amp; Brewer pubs chain helped
Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the beer and leisure group, report a 28 per cent rise
in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 114m to Pounds 145m.
Racal Electronics' share price fell 6 per cent on Thursday after the company
revealed it would fall short of its stated target for profits from its data
communications division this
year.
The administrators to Polly Peck International, part of the collapsed
business empire of fugitive businessman Asil Nadir, announced a breakthrough
in settling the claims of creditors. An interim payment is likely to be made
to up to 1,500 creditors by early summer.
Shares in NFC, the UK's largest transport and logistics group, fell on
Tuesday after it revealed a fall in full-year operating profits because of
losses in European logistics and a declining contribution from removal
services.
Fidelity Investments' Magellan fund, the biggest mutual fund in the US, said
it would not make a year-end distribution to its 3m investors - the first
time it has not made a year-end cash payment since 1988.
Bryan Townsend, chief executive of Midlands Electricity, said he did not
expect an announcement on the flotation of the National Grid until after
mid-January.
National Westminster Bank is planning to open several branches over the
coming Sundays to take advantage of the pre-Christmas shopping rush.
Stagecoach Holdings, the UK's largest bus group, announced a 64 per cent
rise in pre-tax profits.
Trade and industry secretary Michael Heseltine referred bids from both
British Aerospace and GEC for the submarine maker VSEL to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission. The decision surprised the City, which was confident
both bids would be cleared, and VSEL's share price fell sharply.
MARKETS
The UK equity market on Wednesday successfully rode out what, potentially,
was one of the most turbulent trading sessions in recent months. This was in
spite of the serious defeat of the government over VAT in the House of
Commons the night before, a rise of  1/2 percentage point in domestic
interest rates, a Pounds 2bn gilts auction, and a warning of possible
further US interest rate increases in the short term.
Hong Kong closed at a 14-month low on Thursday as the spectre of rising US
interest rates continued to undermine sentiment.
Gilts were whipped around by political worries but they rallied sharply on
the Bank of England's unexpectedly early announcement that it was raising
its minimum lending rate. They were bolstered further by encouraging
comments on inflation from Bank governor Eddie George.
Oil prices weakened further on Monday as unseasonably warm weather persisted
in many parts of Europe and the US. They recovered slightly later in the
week.
US share prices fell sharply late on Thursday afternoon amid renewed
interest rate fears and uncertainty about what fall-out there would be from
Orange County, California, filing for municipal bankruptcy.
South Africa's first international bond offering since the end of apartheid,
a Dollars 500m (Pounds 304.8m) issue, was over-subscribed. The issue was
increased to Dollars 750m.

FT  10 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Banks active
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks' traders were yesterday examining the implications for the sector, and
the market, of the potential merger between SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley of
the US.
Some analysts were pointing out that the initial implications of the Warburg
situation were discouraging for the sector. BZW's Mr Philip Gibbs said the
sketchy details implied the UK's leading merchant bank would be prepared to
surrender control at no premium to net asset value. That would suggest a
share price of below 700p.
However, he acknowledged that the share movement was assuming some form of
rival interest. The market sees the situation as little more than an opening
gambit and most believe that even Pounds 10 a share would be a low price to
pay for Warburg.
Yesterday, the soggy market and a bout of profit taking saw the shares, up
47 at best, close 8 lower at 783p. Schroders also dipped back 25 to 1435p.
Kleinwort Benson and Smith New Court, however, were still attracting bid
premium. The former closed 15 higher at 537p while the latter ended the day
24 up at 420p.
Retail group Great Universal Stores stood out in a poor market and a retail
sector beset by worries of reduced Christmas trading.
The shares advanced 9 to 503p, on turnover of 3m as the market continued to
celebrate Thursday's surprise Pounds 300m special dividend. A clutch of
brokers' recommendations boosted sentiment and analysts also said the group
had the lowest exposure to the retail market of all the stocks in the
sector.
Doom and gloom continued to overhang the rest of the retail stocks.
Kingfisher tumbled 11 to 416p, in busy trade of 5.4m shares as Smith New
Court joined the long list of brokers downgrading profit expectations. Smith
reduced current year profit expectations by Pounds 20m to Pounds 310m, and
reduced the following year's figure by Pounds 25m to 340m.
Boots continued to slide and gave up another 15 to 464p, as it quashed
market rumours suggesting 4 of the Do it All stores, jointly owned with WH
Smith, had been sold. Smith hardened 2 to 429p. Bid speculation, together
with hopes for a good set of interim figures on Monday, saw Northern
Electricity advance 13 to 881p though political worries continued to cast a
shadow over several stocks among the utilities. East Midlands relinquished
12 to 711p, and among water stocks Severn Trent gave up 16 to 502p.
Satellite television group BSkyB lost most of the premium achieved at its
unofficial debut on Thursday and closed 8 lower at 260 1/2 with 11.7m shares
dealt.
Britannic Assurance jumped 8 to 408p as Hoare Govett told clients the shares
were cheap against fundamentals and 10 per cent dividend growth could
support a share price that was some 25 per cent higher.
Legal &amp; General firmed a penny to 429p as some analysts started to calculate
the disparity between net asset value and the underlying share price. One
said: 'Regardless of difficult trading conditions it is offering value.'
Worries over margins at Unigate saw the shares slump 10 to 319p.
A buy recommendation lifted Hillsdown and the shares closed 3 ahead at 173p.
Fare war fears among US airlines after fourth-quarter profit warnings from
Continental and Southwest Airlines washed over on to British Airways,
pushing the shares down 10 to 351p in 3.6m turnover.
Thanks to a no-frills, low-cost strategy, Southwest is one of the more
profitable US airlines. In contrast, USAir, in which BA has a 25 per cent
stake, is a lossmaker and widely believed in danger of being forced out of
business.
BA has underperformed the market by 3 per cent in the past three months,
partly on worries about heavy provisions against its Dollars 400m investment
in USAir.
Electronic giant GEC dipped 4 1/2 to 270 1/2 p after the interim results
warn of a more even profits distribution between the two halves of this year
plus the prospect of an early return to pension fund contributions.
Up 5 per cent at Pounds 378m, the six-month profits were broadly in line
with market expectations but the pragmatic tone of the group's statement led
some securities houses to shade full-year estimates. Turnover in the shares
was relatively modest at 3.9m.
Racal clawed back 7 of Thursday's interim results-led decline of 13, rising
to 210p in 1.5m trades.
Car parts group Lucas ended 7 lower at 195p in 3.6m turnover after a placing
of 29m news shares at 193p aimed at financing a recent US acquisition. The
new shares (a 4 per cent addition to the group's equity base) went through
smoothly, helped by Lucas's recent outperformance. The shares have risen 12
per cent relative to the market during the past three months.
A number of housebuilders were actively traded by the recent standards of
volume in the construction sector, with both Barratt and Bryant tumbling
sharply in turnover of more than 1m shares. This week's interest rate
increase was seen as the catalyst for the selloffs, with Barratt falling 7
1/2 to 151p in 1.2m trades and Bryant easing 7 to 122p in turnover of 1.1m.

FT  10 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Coats hit by broker review
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Textile group Coats Viyella tumbled 11 to 192p on heavy turnover of 7.8m
shares as one of the company's brokers cut its forecasts and another
securities house also reduced its estimates.
Blue-blood broker Cazenove never comments on market intelligence but rivals
said it had reduced its 1994 forecast by Pounds 10m to Pounds 155m and next
year's figure by Pounds 20m to Pounds 170m.
Meanwhile, SG Warburg took a gloomy view of the whole sector and argued that
Coats, being on a higher relative p/e than the market was most vulnerable to
a fall. Analyst Mr Lawrence Rubin said rising raw materials, unseasonally
warm weather and sluggish sales could push down the sector by 5 to 10 per
cent against the market. Pending statements from Courtaulds Textiles on
Friday and Coats around December 21 he reduced to Pounds 152.5m for this
year and Pounds 162m for 1995.

FT  10 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Switching from equities to gilts hits
FT-SE 100 - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Talk of big switching activity by a number of UK pension funds and general
investment portfolios, out of equities and into gilt-edged stocks, plus
another erratic performance by Wall Street, drove the UK equity market
sharply lower yesterday, pushing the FT-SE 100 index firmly below the 3,000
level.
The FT-SE 100 index closed a worrying session a net 36.5 lower at 2,977.3,
leaving the market's premier index down 40 points on the week. The pain
extended to many of the second liners where the FT-SE Mid Cap 250 index gave
up 32.1 to 3,359.8.
Gilts, meanwhile, progressed throughout the session, closing around 5/8
higher, as the switching stories circulated in the market.
But the real damage to London was done overnight on Wall Street, where the
Dow Jones plunged more than 50 points before staging a minor rally, amid
growing fears that yet another rise in the Fed Funds rate could occur soon.
Wall Street remains the key to world markets and has been hit by a series of
bearish stories over the week, notably the Orange County bankruptcy, worries
about the Magellan mutual fund not paying its year-end distribution and
increasing fears that the Federal Reserve may increase interest rates again
when it meets to discuss monetary policy on December 20.
Markets took fright again during the afternoon, when Wall Street fell more
than 30 points shortly after the opening, in the wake of persistent stories
of forced selling of equities and bonds in the US.
Equity market strategists said the market's problems were centred on the US.
'London has coped very well with its domestic worries, including two
budgets, the government's defeat and the rise in interest rates. But until
Wall Street settles down we can't go anywhere,' said Mr Rob Buckland at
NatWest Securities.
At Charterhouse Tilney Mr Richard Jeffrey insisted the UK equity market
would be sustained by gilts. 'You can't have gilts rallying when equities
are slipping away. A fall in the yield ratio to 2.0 is as clear a buy signal
as you will get at this stage of the economic cycle,' he said.
The FT-SE 100 opened sharply lower, slipping below 3,000 and never really
showed any signs of stabilising during a difficult trading session during
which traders took fright at stories of enormous sell programmes about to
hit the market. These stories impacted around midday when a long list of big
trades moved across the screens, only to be cancelled later in the session
and described as 'trade reporting errors'.
But with the market running scared of another poor showing by Wall Street,
share prices began to slide again and slithered to their lowest levels at
the close.
The chancellor's moves to increase tax on beer, wine, spirits and fuel in
his mini-budget on Thursday, failed to cause any real damage in those areas
of the market. Scottish &amp; Newcastle, in fact, was one of only nine FT-SE 100
stocks to end the session in positive territory. Other good performances
included Great Universal Stores, after the recent interim results and the
special dividend.
The merchant banks and securities houses continued to hold the market's
attention after more talk that merger discussions between SG Warburg and
Morgan Stanley will trigger a wide-ranging rationalisation of the European
securities markets, involving the likes of Kleinwort Benson and Smith New
Court.
Turnover in the equity market reached 709.9m shares, the highest of the
week, but was inflated by heavy turnover in two of the market's penny
stocks, Ticketing Group and Sunleigh which attracted turnover of 84m and 55m
shares respectively and accounted for 140m shares or 20 per cent of the
total.

FT  10 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Stock index futures tumbled steeply, ending the week in a soured mood with
the FT-SE 100 December contract significantly adrift of the 3000 level,
writes Jeffrey Brown.
At the close of pit trading the December contract was 2965, down 51 points
for a net decline on the week of 40 points. The performance produced a
discount to the cash market of 12 points or 14 points under fair value.
Allowing for spread trading into the March contract volume was probably a
bit better than on Thursday with 16,629 contracts traded.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Dollar steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concern about Orange County bankruptcy developments and weak US stocks kept
the dollar trading in a narrow range yesterday, writes Philip Gawith.
With no fresh economic data to trade off, markets had a quiet day. The
dollar closed in London at DM1.5773, from DM1.5777, and at Y100.165 from
Y100.465.
The most interesting event was the decision by parliamentary supervisors in
Finland to reject a proposal by the central bank to raise the base rate by
50 basis points to 5.75 per cent. The bank did, however, raise its key money
market rate, the tender rate, to 5.5 per cent, from 5.01 per cent.
Sterling finished the day slightly weaker, constrained by political worries
and an opinion poll showing the Labour Party with a 39.5 percentage point
lead over the ruling Conservative party. It closed at DM2.4601, from
DM2.4674.
In Europe, the D-Mark finishing slightly weaker against most currencies.
Ms Sirkka Hamalainen, Bank of Finland governor, downplayed the significance
of the rejected base rate increase. She said the tender rate was 'much more
important' from a monetary policy perspective.
Ms Hamalainen said the base rate was more an instrument for distribution of
income than a key monetary tool.
She said the board of management had been unanimous that it would have been
a good signal to raise the base rate. 'I think it would have had a positive
effect on inflation expectations,' said Ms Hamalainen.
The most recent Merrill Lynch global investor survey, conducted on December
1, reveals some interesting currency portfolio shifts. The survey shows that
since the third quarter, global fund managers cut back some of their
overweight exposure to the D-Mark, while lifting modestly their exposure to
the US dollar. Investors are now similarly weighted in both dollars and
D-Marks.
Investors 'significantly raised' their exposure to the British pound, and
appeared most overweight in the ADollars /NZDollars currency bloc.
The survey found that investors continued to be very underweight the
Japanese yen. This is a function of it being overvalued on a purchasing
power parity (PPP) basis. Merrill Lynch point out that PPP is a particularly
poor criterion for valuing the yen, which moves more closely in tandem with
Japan's long-term current account trends.
The biggest portfolio shifts occurred in the non D-Mark continental European
currencies (French franc and Italian lira), and the Canadian dollar. The
survey said the portfolio shifts 'clearly indicate a preference on the part
of investors to move into currencies where the domestic monetary authorities
are exercising the greatest restraint.' Currency positioning also appears
'to be influenced more and more by shifts in short-term interest rate
differentials.'
There is increasing evidence that Orange County is beginning to affect US
interest rate expectations. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank
in London, said that concerns about wider financial system risks, reflected
in weakness on Wall Street, 'affect the timing, rather than the direction in
which interest rates are going. I don't think it alters the general profile
of a tighter monetary policy over the next 12 months.'
The Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds 345m, and Pounds 759m
at established rates, to UK money markets, after forecasting a Pounds 1.1bn
shortage.

Early this week pepper prices started stabilising at the lower levels
reached during the previous week, reports Man Producten. Accumulated selling
pressure, mainly from India and Brazil, and the lack of buying interest in
consuming markets sent prices down steeply. However, buyers gradually
realised the sudden drop might be overdone and from the middle of the week
values began slowly to recover. Black pepper, faq, ended at about US2,400 a
tonne and white at Dollars 3,450.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper bounces to fresh highs -
Week in the Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Metal Exchange copper market recovered from a mid-week shake-out
to climb yesterday to a fresh four-year peak. The three months price closed
at Dollars 2,937.50 a tonne, Dollars 22.50 below the day's high but Dollars
80.50 above Wednesday's low.
The upturn started in earnest on Thursday as traders looked forward to the
announcement yesterday morning a sizeable reduction in LME warehouse stocks
of the metal. They were not disappointed - the stocks total was down 4.4 per
cent tonnes at 304,275 tonnes - and renewed speculative buying was
encouraged. The heavy stocks drawdown was thought to reflect physical
shipments to China, and more is expected to be heading in that direction
over the next few weeks.
The other main bullish factor affecting copper was continuing tightness of
nearby availability, which resulted in the cash/three months premium
widening to Dollars 60 from Dollars 41 at the end of last week.
Aluminium stocks were down a little more than copper's but the fall was
relatively modest by recent standards. In any case, continuing erosion of
the LME stockpile is taken for granted as internationally-agreed production
cuts work through to the market.
An early attempt yesterday to push the three months LME price back through
the Dollars 1,900-a-tonne mark ran into overhead resistance and the price
subsided to Dollars 1,877.50 at the close, down Dollars 67.50 on the week
but Dollars 17.50 off Wednesday's low.
The nickel market held on to most of last week's spectacular advance as
uncertainty about the situation at Russia's troubled Norilsk complex, the
world's biggest producer of the metal, discouraged sellers. The three
month's price touched a fresh 3 1/4 -year high of Dollars 9,600 a tonne on
Monday but ended the week at Dollars 8,865, down Dollars 87.50 on balance.
Silver continued to lead the retreat in the precious metals markets. Support
above Dollars 4.90 a troy ounce was broken by renewed investment fund
selling on Monday and the London cash price closed yesterday at Dollars
46.90, adding 23.50 cents to last week's 25-cent fall.
Gold fared little better, falling Dollars 1.60 overall to Dollars 377.60 an
ounce. But dealers were looking for a rally. 'The market is oversold,' one
told the Reuters news agency, 'and the reluctance of people to go long now
may give any technical bounce more impetus when it eventually happens.'
At the London Commodity Exchange March delivery robusta coffee futures
briefly pushed above Dollars 2,900 a tonne in mid-week. But buyers backed
off after the publication of a Brazilian stock audit, which was broadly in
line with recent market estimates. The price closed yesterday at Dollars
2,805 a tonne, up Dollars 23 on the week.
The mild northern winter continued to weigh on the oil market, pushing
prices at London's International Petroleum Exchange below Dollars 16 a
barrel on Monday. Buyers were attracted at that level, however, and in late
trading yesterday the February position was showing a modest rise on the
week.
A buoyant shiping market lifted the LCE's Baltic Freight Index above 2,000
points for the first time in its history on Thursday. The index, which forms
the basis for Biffex freight futures, reached 2,027 yesterday, up 77 on the
week. Three months ago it was at 1,435.
'These are volatile times for the market driven by a significant build-up in
international trade for grain an minerals, said Philippe van den Abeele,
chairman of the LCE Biffex market committee.

FT  10 DEC 94 / International Company News: Surge in sales fails to lift
Cott in third quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cott Corporation, the fast-growing, private-label soft drinks maker, failed
to lift third-quarter profits, in spite of a 49 per cent jump in sales.
The Canadian company's virtually unchanged earnings reflect slimmer margins
as its much bigger brand-name rivals, notably Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, fight
to regain market share lost to Cott products.
Cott earned CDollars 9.9m (USDollars 7.2m), or 16 cents a share, in the
three months to October 29, compared with CDollars 9.8m, also 16 cents, a
year earlier.
The surge in sales, to CDollars 261m, reflected strong growth in the US and
overseas. Almost three-quarters of Cott's sales are outside Canada. But the
contraction in margins, from 17.7 per cent to 15.8 per cent, was largely due
to price wars in Canada, where Cott's market share is highest, and some
parts of the US.
While sales volumes in Canada grew by 13 per cent, revenues were up only 4
per cent.
Margins were dented by higher packaging costs and a shortage of plastic
bottles early in the quarter which hit sales of some high-margin products.
Cott's rapid growth stems mainly from the wider profit margin which
retailers can earn from their own private-label brands than from
heavily-promoted national brands such as Coke and Pepsi.
However, opinion is divided whether retailer-controlled brands can expand
their beach-head on supermarket shelves in the face of a concerted
counter-attack from brand-name manufacturers.
Cott supplies about 90 retailers, up from 65 a year ago. It recently formed
a joint venture with the UK's Virgin Trading to develop a range of Virgin
food and beverage products. The first product, Virgin Cola, was launched
last month.
Other new customers include Safeway and Woolworth in the UK, and Dunnes
Stores, Ireland's biggest retail chain.
The third-quarter results were within the range of analysts' estimates.
Cott's shares, which reached a peak of CDollars 42.38 earlier this year,
edged up 25 cents in early trading on the Toronto stock exchange to CDollars
12.38.

Consob
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Consob, the Italian stock exchange watchdog, yesterday gave Credito Italiano
(Credit), the Italian bank, permission to press ahead with its L2,800bn
(Dollars 1.7bn) bid to buy a 65 per cent stake in Credito Romagnolo (Rolo)
of Bologna.
Consob said it had approved publication of a prospectus. That means the bid
 -now more than six weeks in gestation - could be launched formally next
week. Credit received Bank of Italy authorisation for the operation on
Tuesday.
Credit has indicated it would offer L20,000 a share for 65 per cent of Rolo,
against the market price of just under L18,000. Rolo's directors had
rejected plans for an earlier L19,000-a-share bid as hostile. They agreed
last weekend that the new proposal, backed by guarantees on management
autonomy and minority shareholder rights, was an improvement on the previous
plans, but left themselves room to recommend a counter-bid.
Cariplo, the Milan-based savings bank, is understood to be considering an
alternative offer, in alliance with IMI, the financial services and banking
group, and Bank Austria. Such an offer is unlikely to be launched until the
terms of the Credit bid have been published.

FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Ferranti gets DTI grant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is giving Pounds 500,000 in regional selective assistance to
help fund the management buyout of Ferranti Technologies in Oldham, Greater
Manchester. The deal was completed yesterday, a year and a week after the
company went into receivership, writes Ian Hamilton Fazey.
The money will reduce the company's overdraft requirements to about Pounds
2.5m. The management is buying the business from Arthur Andersen, the
receiver, for Pounds 3m, of which one-third is deferred for two years and
the rest split equally between equity funding and a bank loan.
Ferranti Technologies makes computer systems and components for the avionic,
transport and defence industries. Mr Trevor Tuckley, who will head the
company, said the grant from the DTI had been the final funding link to
close the deal.

Brent Walker yesterday announced the appointment of Mr John Leach as chief
executive of the bookmaking and public house group which is laden with
Pounds 1.4bn of bank debt.
Mr Leach, the former finance director, takes the helm almost two years after
Mr Ken Scobie resigned as chief executive. The board has since been led by
Sir Keith Bright, who resigned as chairman in September.
Mr Leach was appointed finance director in 1991 after the resignation of Mr
Wilfred Aquilina.
Formerly managing director of the LEP freight forwarding group, Mr Leach has
overseen the refinancing package which allowed Brent Walker to keep control
of the William Hill betting chain.

FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: McCarthy &amp; Stone back in the black with
Pounds 4.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McCarthy &amp; Stone, the retirement home building group, yesterday reported a
return to the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.2m for the year ended
August 31, against losses of Pounds 11.2m previously.
The group attributed the turnround to the continuing improvement in the
housing market and efforts by the company in cutting costs and focusing on
its core operations.
Turnover was only slightly ahead at Pounds 71.2m (Pounds 71.1m), while the
operating profit improved sharply from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 6.8m. Earnings
per share were 4.1p compared with losses of 15.6p in the previous 12 months.
The dividend was again passed, but the company said it hoped to resume
payment this financial year.
The shares rose 1p to 64p yesterday.
During the year, the group sold its fixed freehold investments and
management services operations for Pounds 30m, which together with the
proceeds from the summer's Pounds 15.5m rights issue and the underlying cash
generation, eliminated borrowings.
The number of units sold fell 45 to 936, although the average selling price
rose 5 per cent to Pounds 64,700 (Pounds 61,300). Mr Matthew Thorne, finance
director, said the group had managed to withstand many of the cost pressures
being experienced by the rest of the building industry.
'We are not in competition with other residential builders for the type of
land we buy, which tends to be town centre sites,' he said. The company's
widespread use of contractors also offered some protection from materials
and labour price rises.
He added that although the group's market had largely recovered from the
recession, it was currently static and that sale prices were unlikely to
rise in the foreseeable future. However, margin improvement was likely to
come from new higher margin sites and lower overheads.

FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Lucas raises Pounds 56m for US purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lucas Industries, the automotive and aerospace components group, yesterday
raised Pounds 56m through the placing with institutions of 29m new shares at
193p.
The placing followed the completion in the US of its acquisition for Dollars
87m (Pounds 53m) of Lake Center Industries from Guy F Atkinson. The company
brings with it Dollars 13m of debt and its consolidation by Lucas will
involve the write-off of Dollars 51m of goodwill.
The shares closed down by 7p at 195p.
The decision to finance the purchase of LCI by a share issue reflects
Lucas's concern not to extend its gearing, which during its last financial
year fell to 39 per cent from 46 per cent.
The group is engaged in strengthening core businesses and selling peripheral
interests. LCI, with control panels among its products, fits into Lucas Body
Systems.
Lucas also said that it expects by the end of this month to have settled the
criminal aspects of its dispute over contract compliance with the US
government. It made provision of Pounds 87.6m, which it insists is adequate,
to cover the costs of both restructuring and the litigation.
Overall, Lucas has started its current year in encouraging fashion with
first quarter sales showing a 12 per cent improvement on the comparable
period.

FT  10 DEC 94 / UK  Company News: US investment banks look to Asia - The
build-up of resources in London likely to slow down next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
London has been the most profitable centre for US investment banks since
last year, following a build-up of resources in Europe's biggest financial
centre in the early 1990s. However, the recent pressure on banks' profits in
the US, together with a switch in their investment towards Asia, is set to
slow the boom in London considerably next year.
The surge of profits in Europe has helped to turn the focus of the banks'
attentions away from the US markets, which have traditionally provided
almost all their profits.
Morgan Stanley employs nearly 2,000 people in London, almost identical to
its Canary Wharf neighbour, CS First Boston, the unit of Credit Suisse which
is run from New York. Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, employs 1,600 at its
European headquarters in Fleet Street, while Lehman Brothers has built its
numbers to 1,300.
The figures represent a substantial increase over the past two years as US
banks have invested part of their huge profits from the booming US capital
markets.
One result has been that, since last year, their London-based businesses
have for the first time earned a higher return on capital than domestic US
operations, said Mr Steven Berger, managing director in charge of Lehman's
European investment banking business. 'The cross-over occured in 1993, for
all of us.' Also, the banks' Asian operations 'became profitable for the
first time' in 1993, or in some cases 1992. 'There's been a big change in
where the firms are making their money.'
The push overseas looks set to continue, given the big increases in capital
achieved by a number of firms recently. Operations in overseas markets,
particularly for privatisation or other new issue work, have been more
profitable than similar work in the US.
'No doubt US securities firms are flush with capital from the recent
(profits) cycle, and some may be keen to put those profits back into the
business,' said Mr Michael Flannagan, a securities industry analyst at
Lipper Analytical.
In addition, some firms have received infusions of new capital this year,
further bolstering their international businesses. CS First Boston, for
instance, now has Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.09bn) of equity capital, up from
Dollars 1.3bn at the end of last year, as part of a plan to strengthen its
position in international financial markets. Lehman's equity capital base
soared to Dollars 3.6bn this summer after it was spun-off by American
Express following a capital infusion to secure it a strong credit rating as
a stand-alone company.
Although the banks do not provide figures for the amount of capital
committed to non-US markets, or their overseas profits, most confirm that
international operations have become a far more significant part of their
businesses.
Commenting on the amount of capital that Lehman has tied up in European
markets, Mr Berger said: 'In the mid-1980s, it would have been 5-10 per cent
of the (total) capital. Now, it is much, much more.'
Although Europe might see a further small increase in headcount, he added,
the bank was shifting its focus to Asia - in part using profits from Europe
to grow the business in the faster-growing financial markets there.

FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: SelecTV to turn broadcaster with launch of
cable channel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SelecTV, the independent television production company that makes Lovejoy
and Birds of a Feather, will launch a cable TV channel within the next few
months.
The general entertainment channel will draw on the 300-hour library of
programmes made by SelecTV, combined with acquired programmes.
Two cable companies have already agreed to take the new channel. Mr Alan
McKeown, SelecTV's chief executive, believes most members of the Cable
Communications Association, the industry trade body, will distribute it.
The channel, which will run for 59 hours a week - 5pm to midnight on
weekdays and longer hours at the weekend - is due to launch in the first
quarter of next year and will be 'cable exclusive'.
The cable industry is keen to improve the range of its programming, partly
at least to differentiate itself from satellite television and to make
itself less dependent on British Sky Broadcasting. A cable-exclusive news
channel for London, Channel One, was launched recently and Mirror Group is
planning a channel based on live events next year.
The move to being a broadcaster will mean SelecTV losing its independent
producer status, and so its programmes will not count towards the 25 per
cent independent production quota required by law for the four main
broadcasting channels. Mr McKeown believes it is essential to be a
broadcaster in order to have an outlet for programmes.
Channel One and Mirror Group's Live TV are believed to have negotiated cable
subscription deals of 25p a month for each subscriber. The SelecTV channel
will get about 22p or 23p a month. So, even though audiences will be small
and advertising revenues tiny, there should be an immediate revenue stream .

FT  10 DEC 94 / International Company News: Groupe Bull privatisation sees
interest from overseas rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The privatisation of Groupe Bull, the loss-making French computer
manufacturer, has drawn a response from some powerful participants in the
international computer, telecommunications and electronics industry,
according to sources speaking after the close of the offer period yesterday
evening.
The candidates, which are largely in line with expectations, include NEC of
Japan, which holds 4.4 per cent of Bull's shares and is thought to be
seeking to raise its participation to 10 per cent. Quadral, a holding
company which controls CSEE, the French electronics group, is proposing a
joint offer with AT&amp;T of the US to take a stake of up to 40 per cent of the
state-owned computer manufacturer.
Motorola, which recently concluded a technology partnership with Bull has
declined to comment on whether it is seeking to invest in the French group,
as has IBM of the US, which holds 2.1 per cent of Bull. But sources
indicated that the privatisation had drawn interest from several groups,
including non-Japanese Asian companies. These are reported to include
Samsung of South Korea and Acer of Taiwan.
Government officials declined to comment on the number and nature of the
proposals which had been received. The offer from AT&amp;T and Quadral is
thought to involve a joint company with a majority holding for the French
group. AT&amp;T has declined to confirm whether it is seeking access to the
French telephone services market as a condition of the proposal.
The French government wants to reduce its 76 per cent stake in Bull to a
minority holding by next spring. Although the company is reducing losses
which have totalled more than FFr20bn (Dollars 3.7m) since 1989, its
precarious position has prompted its state shareholder to seek privatisation
through the formation of industrial partnerships rather than through a
public offer for shares.
Under the terms of the privatisation process, the various proposals will be
reduced to a short list after consultation between the government and the
privatisation commission, an independent body which advises the government
on the sale of public sector assets. The selected companies will have six
weeks to proceed with a detailed examination of Bull's condition, after
which they may make a binding offer.

FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Warburg speculation boosts MAM shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Mercury Asset Management, the fund manager which is 75 per
cent-owned by SG Warburg, jumped 58p to 711p yesterday on speculation that
Warburg and Morgan Stanley would buy out minority shareholders if their
merger went ahead.
It is thought they propose to fold Morgan Stanley's asset management
business into MAM, which is more than twice the size, creating a group with
almost Pounds 100bn funds under management.
Such a move would require the approval of more than 50 per cent of MAM's
minority shareholders. It is possible that the 15 per cent held by funds
managed by MAM and by its employee trust would also be excluded leaving the
decision up to investors representing just 10 per cent of the shares.
The merged banks could be forced by the Takeover Panel to make an offer to
the minority shareholders. But it now appears that this is their plan
anyway.
Many of MAM's senior staff are also significant shareholders - the directors
alone hold more than 2m shares worth Pounds 14m - and can be expected to
demand attractive terms.
But one of MAM's institutional investors voiced concerns about such a move.
'Once their shares have been bought out there is nothing to stop them
trotting across the road to Schroders or whoever. MAM has a lot of very
marketable people.'
Even if MAM buys out most of the minority shareholders any opposed to a
merger with Morgan Stanley's asset management business could still cause
trouble.
The merged banks would only be able to force shareholders to sell once 90
per cent of the 25 per cent had accepted.
Some observers believe that the banks may have decided to buy out the
minorities merely to make the deal easier and may refloat MAM at some stage.
'It would be a very handy source of capital for them,' said one institution.
Sources close to Warburg argued that the benefits of independence have not
been as great as predicted when Warburg originally floated off 25 per cent.
On the other hand its efforts to expand internationally and into the UK
retail would be boosted by the Warburg and Morgan Stanley names.
Valued at almost Pounds 1bn, Warburg's stake in MAM represents more than
half its own market capitalisation and is seen by both banks as a key
element of the deal.
MAM will announced its choice of independent financial adviser on Mon-day.

FT  10 DEC 94 / International Company News: Investors issue writ against
News Corp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A long-running row between News Corporation and investors in securities
issued in 1989 by its subsidiaries has flared again after 18 private
investors issued a writ in Frankfurt against the media group owned by Mr
Rupert Murdoch.
The dispute goes back to December 1993, when News Corp published a notice in
the Financial Times and the German Borsenzeitung telling holders of its
preference shares and convertible bonds - exchangeable for shares which News
held in Pearson - that they would also get Royal Doulton shares when
exercising their exchange right.
However, in February, News Corp issued another notice saying investors were
not entitled to shares in Royal Doulton, the fine china manufacturer
demerged last year from Pearson. The convertibles were denominated in
D-Marks and the preference shares were in sterling and Dutch guilders.
News Corp's conflicting notices had serious financial implications. The
value of the conversion package was less without the Royal Doulton shares
than the redemption value of the bonds. Moreover, many holders had sold
Royal Doulton shares they did not own in anticipation of receiving them as
part of the exchange property. The loss to investors, including covering the
short positions, has been estimated at Pounds 15m (Dollars 24.6m).
The 18 claimants demand delivery of the Royal Doulton shares, or the
financial equivalent, and compensation for their transaction losses
The case will be closely watched by UK-based bankers and investors involved
in the dispute. In September, News Corp rejected arbitration when a group of
disgruntled investors and banks tried to take the case to the City Disputes
Panel in London.
Last night, News Corp said: 'We have not received a copy of any German
proceedings, and cannot therefore comment at this stage.'

FT  10 DEC 94 / International Company News: Baseball strike holds back John
Labatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Labatt, the Canadian brewing and entertainment group, posted a small
increase in earnings for the half year, with beer gains largely offset by
the impact of the strike by baseball players in North America and the ice
hockey lock-out.
Labatt, which is the majority shareholder of the Toronto Blue Jays baseball
team, said that the strike, which began in August, lopped CDollars 13m
(USDollars 10m), or 14 cents a share, off earnings in the three months to
October 31. SkyDome, Toronto's sports stadium in which Labatt has a 41 per
cent stake, was hit by the strike.
Net earnings edged up to CDollars 107m, or CDollars 1.09, for the six months
to October 31, from CDollars 104m, or CDollars 1.06, a year earlier.
Second-quarter earnings slipped to CDollars 45m, or 46 cents, from CDollars
47m, or 48 cents.
Six-month sales, which climbed to CDollars 1.77bn from CDollars 1.32bn, were
lifted by a four-fold jump in revenues at BCL, Labatt's live entertainment
arm, due to sell-out tours by rock groups Pink Floyd and the Rolling Stones.
Plans to spin off the bulk of the broadcast and entertainment businesses
have been delayed by the baseball and hockey disputes.
Mr George Taylor, chief executive, said the company intended to announce
details of the disposal of non-core assets by the end of next April.
Labatt, which has extensive brewing interests in the UK and Italy, acquired
a 22 per cent stake in Femsa Cerveza, Mexico's largest brewer, in September.
Financial results from Femsa have so far exceeded expectations.

FT  10 DEC 94 / International Company News: Hopewell turns its back on bond
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopewell Holdings, the property and construction group controlled by Mr
Gordon Wu, has never been a company to do things by halves. In June 1991,
the group pulled off Hong Kong's biggest rights issue, raising HKDollars
5.7bn (USDollars 740m), and last year notched up the colony's biggest
spin-off when it sought a separate listing for its power stations in a
combined HKDollars 5.94bn offering.
This week, Hopewell said it had secured a HKDollars 7bn loan arrangement
facility with the colony's two biggest banks, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
and its subsidiary Hang Seng Bank. The innovative structure of the loan,
which grants non-transferable options to subscribe for shares over five
years, will see the banking group take a long-term strategic stake in the
company with which it has been closely aligned since Mr Wu was a bright
20-something engineer.
Details of the financing package, taken favourably by the market, end weeks
of mounting speculation that attended the run-up to December 6, when
Hopewell's second instalment on its partly-paid shares in Consolidated
Electric Power Asia (CEPA), the spun-off power interests, fell due.
Peregrine Holdings, Hopewell's merchant bank, had been eager to launch its
own foray into the bond markets with a USDollars 1bn issue for Hopewell.
Peregrine's endeavours, which included the acquisition of a credit rating,
have not been wholly in vain and its fixed income team will play a role in
the planned bond issues for CEPA.
For Hopewell, whose gearing according to stockbroker Jardine Fleming now
climbs from 35 per cent to 46 per cent, the decision to rely primarily on
bank loan appears a sound one. It was assigned a BBB- senior implied debt
rating by Standard &amp; Poor's, which would not totally have excluded it from
the capital markets but certainly increased its entrance fee.
W. I. Carr (Far East) reckons Hopewell would have had to pay about 10 per
cent interest on a bond (being US Treasury bond rates plus between 200 and
300 basis points), whereas the loan is understood to be set at around 100
basis points above the London interbank offered rate (Libor is used as the
bulk of the funds to be drawn are US dollar denominated).
Unlike the coupon on a bond, interest is paid only when funds are drawn, and
at least HKDollars 2bn - representing the final instalment on the CEPA
shares - will not be required until this time next year. The second
instalment, also of HKDollars 2bn, was paid earlier this week.
Hopewell's mooted bond was also shelved because of the poor market
conditions, which would have exacerbated the difficulty of distributing a
big issue. CEPA, which is sitting on cash of about HKDollars 5bn to
HKDollars 6bn, can afford to wait and pounce when the time is right, a
luxury not afforded to Hopewell which has some HKDollars 11bn worth of debt
on its balance sheet.
As a pure play on the power sector, CEPA is a more straightforward and,
perhaps, attractive animal to investors than Hopewell which is evolving from
a Hong Kong property company into one involved in infrastructure projects
throughout Asia.
Its net cash position increases its likelihood of obtaining a better credit
rating than its parent.
The bank loan facility secured by Hopewell should see it comfortably through
the next 12 months, analysts say. About HKDollars 3bn remains after the
third and final instalment is paid on the CEPA shares next December and the
bulk of this money is likely to be targeted at the super-highway project in
Guangdong province and the southern Guangzhou ring road.
On a broader scale, Hopewell's lengthy review of its options reflects the
changing dynamics between Asian companies and their bankers. Before the
review, Hopewell's banking relationship was principally with Hongkong Bank
and it has cemented that relationship by granting the sweetener options
which enable the HSBC group to take a stake of up to 4.2 per cent in
Hopewell.
Mr Simon Moules, senior manager for corporate banking at Hongkong Bank says:
'This type of structure is innovative and somewhat unconventional and
reflects the closeness of our relationship with Hopewell.' However, he notes
that the bank holds stakes in a number of Hong Kong corporates, especially
those related to infrastructure development.
By going for bank financing, Hopewell is reaping cost advantages and
benefiting from a simpler, more flexible package - although it remains prey
to rising interest rates. But equally, CEPA will raise its funds on the
capital markets - a trend which HSBC insists is complementary to, rather
than competitive to, its own activities.
Besides, Mr Moules adds: 'The vast majority of project financings which have
been undertaken in the region in recent years have been financed by bank
loans and export credit, and not by capital market instruments. As far as
corporate lending goes, we have seen capital markets activity grow, but the
volume of loans is not down.'

FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Misys withdraws RM offer but does not admit
defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tussle for control of Research Machines subsided yesterday when
computing services group Misys announced it had withdrawn its proposals for
the educational computer and software supplier.
The move came as RM unveiled a placing price of 175p a share for its
forthcoming flotation, valuing it at Pounds 29.5m. Misys' first conditional
offer, made on Tuesday, offered a minimum 235p a share in cash.
This was followed by a second proposal to acquire a 29.9 per cent stake at a
price of at least 210p a share. Both were rejected by the RM board.
A Misys statement said: 'We will be watching RM's progress with interest.'
The company would not comment on whether a hostile bid would be considered
after the group's listing.
The float will raise just Pounds 200,000 net for the company. But the
listing is being instigated ostensibly to enhance the company's profile
rather than for financial considerations. 'We have been the world's
least-known Pounds 65m (turnover) computer services company for some time,'
said Mr Mike Fischer, RM chief executive.
Existing shareholders are selling close to 19 per cent of shares on
flotation, leaving directors and their families holding 29 per cent of the
issued share capital, other employees, former employees and families with 11
per cent, existing institutional shareholders with 38 per cent and
institutional placees with 22 per cent.
The placing has been fully underwritten by SG Warburg Securities. The
company faced complete restructuring in 1992 as it withdrew from the design
and manufacture of electronic sub-assemblies and decided to concentrate its
energy on the educational world.
The Oxfordshire company, which employs more than 450 staff, expects its main
market to remain in the educational field.
Flat sales in the year to September 30 coupled with a nervous market has not
put it off a placing.
'The question of whether we might disappoint the market has been enormously
scrutinised,' said Mr Fischer. 'We are not coming to the market without a
huge degree of confidence.'
Pre-tax profit for the year to September 30 was Pounds 3.8m compared with
Pounds 2.5m last time. Total dividends were 4.8p net (2.5p).
Trading is expected to begin on Wednesday.

Booth Industries Group, the specialist engineering group, edged back into
the black with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 8,405 in the six months to
September 30, against a Pounds 377,970 loss last time.
The company, which makes high security doors - including the front door for
10 Downing Street - and fire and blast resistant systems, reported a Pounds
2.12m loss at the year end, although this was struck after a Pounds 1.43m
provision for reorganisation.
Mr Gerrard Booth, chairman, said that though markets remained competitive,
sales targets were achieved while maintaining positive margins. The UK
market was static but overseas opportunities were encouraging.
Turnover dropped to Pounds 4.9m (Pounds 8m), which included Pounds 1.9m
(Pounds 5m) arising from certain structural steelwork contracts being
concluded this year. Earnings per share were 0.21p (9.45p losses) and there
was again no interim dividend.

FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Norweb claims PowerGen rejected plant
approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norweb, the regional electricity company, yesterday claimed PowerGen had
rejected its approach to buy plant which it must sell to meet the industry
regulators' demands for increased competition.
The news comes just a day after Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry
regulator, expressed impatience with the two main generators over their
progress on plant disposals. National Power and PowerGen have been ordered
to sell between 5,000MW and 6,000MW of generating capacity before the end of
next year.
Mr Ken Harvey, Norweb's chairman and chief executive, said at the company's
interim results meeting that he had approached PowerGen in conjunction with
other 'potential generators'.
'PowerGen told us they did not wish to proceed any further,' Mr Harvey said.
'They said they had other options.'
PowerGen denied it had rejected Norweb outright. The generator had decided
initially to pursue options with potential European partners.
'Options include asset swaps or potential joint venture arrangements,' the
company said. 'We have made it clear that the priority at the moment is to
pursue proposals with European parties, but we have not ruled out other
options.'
Mr Harvey said Norweb was talking to National Power about the possible
acquisition of plant.
Mr Harvey's comments came as the group announced a 19 per cent jump in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 77.5m (Pounds 65.1m) in the six months to
September 30. Sales were up 5 per cent to Pounds 677.3m.
Norweb also announced it was reducing its standing charge to domestic
customers by Pounds 1.50 to Pounds 9.34 a quarter. This means prices to
domestic customers have fallen by about Pounds 25 a year, including the 6
per cent tariff cut in April. These reductions more than offset the 8 per
cent VAT charge, Mr Harvey said.
The distribution business increased operating profits by 5 per cent to
Pounds 62.5m, while supply profits jumped from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 13.3m.
The interim dividend was increased to 8.2p (6.7p). Earnings rose from 27.1p
to 33.9p.
COMMENT
These were strong results and the underlying growth in the distribution
business is even better than it appears. Profits there were held back by
provisions for the restructuring which will further enhance the utility's
performance. The only real question over Norweb now is the decision to
expand the retailing division. This is likely to leave the market with a
certain degree of unease for the immediate future. Forecasts are for profits
of about Pounds 196m. The forecast dividend of more than 27p leaves Norweb
with a prospective yield of about 4.4 per cent. On that basis, the shares
appear to be fairly valued.

FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Fuller attacks duty increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Record operating profits at Fuller Smith &amp; Turner, the west London-based
brewer, have not diminished the chairman's anger over Thursday's increase in
beer duty.
'I am amazed that the Chancellor, having detailed at length in his original
budget speech his awareness of the effects that personal imports are having
on the British drinks industry, has nonetheless increased duty rates to
satisfy political expediency,' said Mr Anthony Fuller yesterday.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to October 1 increased from Pounds 3.76m
to Pounds 4.15m. Sales grew from Pounds 41m to Pounds 42.8m, although volume
beer sales were down 5 per cent.
Operating profits improved from Pounds 4.37m to Pounds 4.55m. The latest
figure was struck after a one-off redundancy charge of Pounds 162,000
following the reorganisation of the distribution fleet, and a Pounds 138,000
loss on Classic Ales, the beer wholesaler.
Fuller sold its 75 per cent interest in Classic to Greenalls last week, and
will realise an exceptional Pounds 500,000 profit in the current half.
The increase at operating level was driven by the 94 managed houses, which
increased profits by 18 per cent. Hotel and Country Table profits were 24
per cent higher, helped by a 10 per cent rise in occupancy.
However, the 108 tenanted houses 'suffered badly' from the negative effect
of imported beers and wines from Calais, Mr Fuller said.
Volumes in the traditional free trade dropped 8 per cent, reflecting the
dominance of national brewers in a tough market.
Earnings per share increased from 10.62p to 11.66p, and the interim dividend
is raised from 2.52p to 2.65p.

FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Project Hawk takes flight - The British
Coal deal is in the bag for RJB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Project Hawk was the codename given by Barclays de Zoete Wedd to its work on
the RJB Mining bid for British Coal. But outside the company there were many
who doubted that the bird would fly.
Yesterday they had their answer when RJB signed a deal to pay Pounds 815m
for the English mining assets of British Coal. In extremely difficult
circumstances, it had raised the Pounds 894m needed to finance the bid.
That means its acquisition of the 17 deep mines, including two which are
mothballed, and 16 opencast sites is in the bag.
Even the company's critics acknowledged yesterday that RJB and BZW have done
well. 'We doubted it when they said they could raise the money,' said one.
'They should be congratulated for doing a deal against the odds.'
One difficulty for RJB was the recent weakness of the stock market. Several
companies have had to pull out of, or scale back, fund-raising exercises.
But RJB's biggest potential problem was persuading the institutions to
accept its view of the potential in English coal rather than those of its
rivals.
It has predicted profits of Pounds 220m in 1999 on sales of 1.2bn. The
resulting margin of 17 per cent would be one of the highest of any
international coal company.
But rivals say RJB's projections are based on an over-optimistic view of
markets.
Whereas RJB assumes it can sell 34m tonnes of coal at an average price of
Pounds 32 a tonne, Mr Malcolm Edwards, chairman of Coal Investments, whose
bid failed, reckons that 24m tonnes at Pounds 26 would be more appropriate.
In an extraordinarily bitter series of exchanges between the two companies
RJB has dismissed Mr Edwards' comments as an attempt to destabilise its bid
so that he could press forward with his.
But Mr Edwards is not alone. Most executives within both the coal and
electricity industries are closer to the gloomier, Edwards view.
The institutions think otherwise, or are at least prepared to give RJB and
Mr Richard Budge, its chief executive, the benefit of the doubt.
'There are an awful lot of numbers knocking around and, because coal has
been in the public sector for so long, the City's knowledge is not good.'
said Mr Neil Richardson of Threadneedle, one of the institutions which is
buying shares.
'However, we know the supply of coal is much closer to demand than for a
long time and that world coal prices are rising.'
Mr Richardson also believes there is more scope for cost-cutting than RJB
has allowed for in its forecasts. RJB assumes it will cut costs by just 3
per cent a year.
Most of the institutions backing RJB say they invested when the company was
floated last year because they were impressed by its track record and
nothing has arisen since then to change their minds.
A wide airing of events surrounding the collapse two years ago of AF Budge,
of which Mr Budge was a director for 20 years, has seemingly failed to deter
many investors.
'None of the deals struck then was illegal,' says one shareholder. 'Most of
them were typical of what happens when private companies collapse.'
Fund managers concentrated instead on the finances. Assuming the company
meets its after-tax profit projection of of Pounds 75m next year, the shares
are being sold at 320p on a 1995 prospective price earnings ratio of 6.4,
compared with a stock market average of 12.
But what really made Project Hawk fly was the projections of profits and
dividends after 1998, when the debt is scheduled to be paid off. There
remain many doubters about RJB's assumptions, but the company's investors
prefer Mr Budge's version of the future.

FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Kalon shares fall after profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kalon, the decorative paints group, yesterday warned that full-year profits
would disappoint City expectations after weak sales in the UK retail market.
The shares fell 16 1/4 p to 123 1/2 p yesterday as the company said pre-tax
profits for 1994 were expected to be about Pounds 19.5m, compared with
forecasts of Pounds 22m.
Mr Mike Hennessy, chief executive, said sales and prices in the UK paint
industry had deteriorated in the second half, although there was a slight
recovery this month.
The company also suffered as a result of the UK's unseasonally warm weather,
which affected sales of its Vallance heating and insulation products. The
group acquired Vallance in February for Pounds 6.2m.
Kalon's French subsidiary, Novodec, is reported to have increased its paint
volumes, while margins have come under pressure from competition. Novodec
was acquired for Pounds 22m in February 1993.
After raw material price rises of about 0.2 per cent in the first half,
Kalon expects to raise its prices next year.
'Prospects for 1995 will be influenced by the recovery of the UK retail
market, the ability to offset the impact of higher raw material prices and
the growth in Kalon's paint volumes,' Mr Hennessy said.
'In the UK the Leyland trade centre opening programme will be accelerated
and the retail market should be stimulated by the introduction of a new
product range in the first half year.'
Kalon reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 18.8m on turnover of Pounds 142.4m
last year. In the first half, pre-tax profits rose 15 per cent from Pounds
8.7m to Pounds 10m on turnover 10 per cent ahead at Pounds 83m, as trade
sales replaced retail sales.
Despite the disappointing profits, Mr Hennessy said the company was still
looking for an acquisition worth less than Pounds 40m in continental Europe.

FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Chesterton pays Pounds 6.25m for
consultancy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Chesterton International, the property consultancy, has continued its
acquisition drive with the purchase of Cyril Sweett, the construction, cost
and project management consultancy, for Pounds 6.25m.
The consideration will be met by the issue of 4.24m new ordinary shares,
Pounds 1.74m nominal of loan notes repayable over 7 1/2 years and Pounds
700,000 of convertible loan stock.
Chesterton, which came to the market in June, has this year already acquired
Consolidated FPM, the facilities management company and Conroy Hunter, the
Scottish property agency.
The deal will enable the group to extend its facilities management operation
which it believes to be a growth area. Mr William Wells, Chesterton
chairman, said: 'This acquisition will significantly increase the range of
services Chesterton is able to offer.'
Cyril Sweett has operations in western Europe and east Asia. It employs
about 190 people and, among other projects, has completed the Lakeside
shopping centre in Thurrock.

FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Portals wins Pounds 100m contract with
Indian government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Portals, the specialist papermaking group, yesterday announced a Pounds 100m
contract to supply the Indian government with banknote paper.
The news provided a further boost to the group's share price, which had
already shot sharply forward on news earlier this week that Portals had been
approached by De La Rue, the printing group.
Portals shares closed up 10p yesterday at 833p, and ahead 128p on its close
of Monday evening.
The group was forced to make an announcement over the De La Rue approach on
Tuesday when its shares began rising rapidly.
The Indian contract is the largest value banknote paper order in the
industry ever and was won through a public tender.
Mr John Lloyd, managing director, said that the order, which will begin
early next year, should allow the group to operate at capacity for the
foreseeable future.
He refused to comment on the De La Rue talks.
It is the second time this year that the two sides have been in potential
takeover negotiations. De La Rue approached Portals in May - a move which
again sent the share price soaring - but the two groups called the talks off
after failing to reach agreement.
Following this week's news, De La Rue has said it would not make a hostile
bid without the agreement of the Portals board and underlined the close
commercial relationship between the two companies.

FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: GEC advances 6% to Pounds 378m - Increasing
turnover and operating margins please City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Electric Company, the defence and electronics company, yesterday
reported a 6 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profit from Pounds 360m to
Pounds 378m on turnover up by 10 per cent to Pounds 4.8bn, against Pounds
4.39bn.
The interim dividend is increased to 2.95p (2.81p) from earnings per share
of 8.8p (8.2p).
However, the profits increase for the six months to September 30 masked a
much better performance from most operating companies.
The City was pleased that turnover and operating margins were increasing,
and that the company was not reliant on cost-cutting for improved profits.
Lord Weinstock, managing director, also said that the company would continue
to pursue its bid for VSEL, the submarine maker, with the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
Analysts said that the profits showed the productivity benefits of previous
rationalisation were feeding through now that the US and UK economies were
recovering. Operating profits were up by 14 per cent at Pounds 296m (Pounds
260m) and only a decline in interest income from Pounds 81m to Pounds 70m
held back the pre-tax improvement.
There was a particularly strong performance from Gilbarco, the US petrol
pumps business, and profits in its division doubled to Pounds 30m. A mixture
of underlying growth in the US petrol market and changes in environmental
legislation, forcing the replacement of old equipment, were responsible.
GPT, the telecommunications joint venture with Siemens, also showed improved
profits on last year's depressed levels. Analysts expect figures for the
year to be modestly ahead of the Pounds 120m achieved last time.
Equipment orders from cable tv companies expanding into the UK market, along
with software orders for BT and improved exports were responsible for the
improvement.
GEC Alsthom, the power and transport joint venture, saw turnover grow by 22
per cent but operating profits were only up by 8 per cent. GEC's forward
order book was down from Pounds 13bn to Pounds 12bn a year ago, largely due
to a fall in GEC Alsthom's orders.
GEC, however, attributed the fall to timing differences and said that the
figure took no account of the Korean high-speed train contract which had
since been signed, or of the deal announced this week to supply trains and
maintainance for the Northern underground line in London.
The company expects its order book to return to last year's levels by the
end of March.
GEC-Marconi, the defence and electronics subsidiary, had flat profits on a
maintained turnover. Lord Weinstock said that conditions remained very tough
in defence. However, profits should improve once the production phase of
Eurofighter's radar and flight control systems come on stream.

FT  10 DEC 94 / New tune for Irish reel: Political change has trailed social
shifts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ireland's Fianna Fail, so long seen as the natural party of government,
appears to be losing its grip on power.
A political scandal involving the party has triggered the break-up of the
government that it led, and efforts to rebuild the coalition with the Labour
party have foundered.
Last night, Fine Gael, the opposition party, was locked in discussions with
Labour over a new administration. But in the absence of a strong alternative
to Fianna Fail, the chance of stable government in Dublin looks remote.
The political crisis in Ireland has been aggravated by the painful
adjustment of a conservative, rural country to the new reality of an
urbanised existence, underpinned by the sudden advent of prosperity from
membership of the European Union. While Irish society has been transformed,
the political system has been agonisingly slow to change.
The two main political parties, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, are almost
equally conservative - their only serious distinguishing factor is that they
were on opposite sides during the Irish civil war. Fianna Fail tends to be
more rural and republican in its support and instincts, while the
traditional Fine Gael 'blue shirts' are the small tradesmen and middle
classes of the little market towns of the Irish countryside. The Labour
party, condemned for years to a minority role on the opposition benches, was
the only representative of secular European left-right politics.
Today Dublin and its suburbs contain more than a third of the country's 3.5m
population, after rapid urbanisation that has also caused an upheaval in the
traditional political divide. It is an upheaval that could see Fianna Fail
and Fine Gael forced into a conservative coalition, a prospect that causes
horror to party traditionalists.
Above all, it amounts to a seismic shock for Fianna Fail, which has regarded
itself as the natural party of government since it was founded by Eamonn de
Valera in the 1920s.
The party is unashamedly populist, with an extensive grass-roots
organisation. During its decades in power, it has used political patronage
to reward supporters with civil service appointments.
The most recent crisis was triggered when Mr Albert Reynolds, the Taoiseach
or prime minister, overruled the objections of his Labour coalition partners
to appoint Mr Harry Whelehan, the attorney general, as the Irish High Court
president. Labour withdrew from the government and Mr Reynolds resigned as
leader of Fianna Fail. But efforts by Mr Bertie Ahern, his successor, to
re-establish the coalition foundered this week when new revelations emerged
about the extent to which parliament had been misled over the appointment.
The political turmoil that has resulted has launched an impassioned debate
about official impropriety, and croneyism in public appointments.
'They've always controlled all the jobs,' says one Labour member of
parliament, who compares Ireland to the corruption of Latin America.
The cause of Mr Whelehan's downfall - his failure to act on a UK extradition
warrant for a paedophile Catholic priest - has also raised questions about
the role of the church which still exerts an influence over moral and social
questions such as education, divorce and abortion. With new charges against
the clergy revealed by newspapers almost every day, the church's failure to
deal with errant priests has shocked public opinion in the Republic.
An alternative coalition may be hard to construct. Fine Gael, the main
opposition party, could form a government if it were able to persuade the
Labour party and one or both of the minor parties to join it.
But while Labour has entered coalitions with Fine Gael before, the latter
has adopted a much more free market approach to economic policy that may
prove hard for Labour to endorse. There is also bad feeling between the
leaders of the two parties: relations between Mr John Bruton of Fine Gael
and Labour's Mr Dick Spring were soured when Labour entered government with
Fianna Fail following the 1992 election.
Last night, a three-party coalition seemed the most likely arrangement,
linking Fine Gael and Labour and one of the two smaller parties, Democratic
Left and Progressive Democrats. The smaller parties are resisting pressure
to enter a four-party coalition, that would reduce their ability to demand
concessions.
Democratic Left is understood to be the favoured choice of Labour. This
left-leaning party is the successor to the Official IRA, from which
Provisional IRA split to pursue the armed struggle in 1970. The party would
have natural affinities with Labour on welfare questions, and would be more
in tune on labour issues.
The alternative is the right-wing Progressive Democrats, now led by Ms Mary
Harney. A breakaway from Fianna Fail, the PDs would prove more difficult
partners for Labour because they are more right-wing than Fine Gael.
If a new coalition cannot be formed, the only alternative is a general
election, which Labour in particular is concerned to avoid. The party's
strategists believe the party would be hard-pressed to repeat its 1992
success, when the party won 32 seats.
An election would also bring a protracted period of political uncertainty to
the peace process in Northern Ireland. As UK officials began exploratory
talks in Belfast yesterday with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, the
absence of a stable government in Dublin could hold up progress.
Even if there is an election, there is no guarantee that this will resolve
the impasse. The opinion polls suggest that no party is likely to emerge
with an overall parliamentary majority. Ireland would be facing exactly the
same difficulties over the formation of a coalition in a month's time.
Whatever the outcome of the current negotiations, Ireland is moving slowly
and painfully towards a more traditional left-right political divide.
Strategic thinkers within the parties, like Mr Maurice Manning of Fine Gael,
are beginning to think the previously unthinkable: that a conservative
coalition may be inevitable.
It would mean both Fine Gael and Fianna Fail abandoning their old civil war
prejudices. It would also require Fianna Fail, above all, undergoing a
thorough cleansing of its secretive, anti-democratic ways. But a
transformation of southern Irish politics from sterile old republican
rivalries is as much a part of the peace process as negotiations between
unionists and republicans in the north.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): I'm suing my solicitors
 -Briefcase Q&amp;A
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I intended to sell my house in 1987 but the deal fell through because of a
defect in my title to the property. I am now pursuing the solicitors
involved for damages, including interest charges on the money I would have
had if the sale had proceeded. Are such charges assessable for income
purposes?
Broadly speaking, interest on damages is taxable as interest but any
interest element in the calculation of damages is not. The damages
themselves are liable to capital gains tax, of course, but you probably
would escape by virtue of extra-statutory concession D33 (capital gains tax
on compensation and damages). You can get the free booklet of concessions,
IR1, from your tax office.

Briefcase Q&amp;A

<TEXT>
What is the probability of an investment trust or unit trust going bust?
Both investment and unit trusts are collective investment schemes.
Investment trusts are limited companies and unit trusts are constituted
under a trust deed with an independent trustee. Unlike a public limited
company, we believe a unit trust cannot, technically, go bust.
In the case of investment trusts insolvency is, in practical terms,
extremely remote.
Performance figures for these investment vehicles are often difficult to
examine because of the frequency of mergers and amalgamations. (Reply by

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): British or French
Inheritence Tax? - Briefcase Q&amp;A
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My mother-in-law has come to live with us in France. She has all her assets
in the form of cash, stocks and shares, and chattels. Assuming she remains
domiciled in the UK, am I right in thinking her assets in France will be
subject to French inheritance tax, and those in the UK or Channel Islands to
British inheritance tax? Thus, would it be worth dividing her assets between
the countries so as to take advantage of the abatements available in each?
Generally speaking, those domiciled in the UK are liable to UK inheritance
tax on their worldwide assets, irrespective of where they are. This means
that, prima facie, her French assets would be within the UK tax net, relief
being given for any French tax paid.
As I understand the position, the estate of a non-French domiciliary is
taxable only in respect of assets in France. You should confirm this
independently. As the French assets appear to incur tax in two countries,
recourse must be had to the Anglo-French Inheritance Tax Treaty. Under this,
the French-sited property will be subject to French tax but the UK will
allow a credit for it. (Reply by Barry Stillerman of accountant Stoy
Hayward).

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Competition): A winning choice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The choice of the name Fledgling for the new FT-SE-A share index is the
result of a competition among FT readers.
The winner is Basil Scott, a 70-year-old retired accountant who lives in
Leamington Spa, Warwickshire.
Scott was one of seven readers who chose the name Fledgling in the form
(singular) and spelling (not Fledgeling) deemed most appropriate by the
panel of judges.
His entry was the first pulled out of the hat in a tie-breaker and his prize
is three magnums of pink champagne.
The competition produced 1,500 entries and more than 600 different names
were submitted, ranging from the amusing (Pink Dwarf, Dolly Mixtures), to
the oddball (Amoeba, Anthill and Maggot), and the conservative and worthy
(Microcap).
There were also plays on letters (Mice - Minor Company Equities and Mopsi -
Minor Organisations Prices Share Index).
Many of the names were drawn from nature: Acorn, Bantam, Bambi, Bronco,
Chrysalis, Cubs, Cygnet, Grubs, Minnow, Sapling, Sprats, Smolt and Tadpole.
The index, to be launched on January 3, will cover companies too small to be
included in the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share Index, which covers more than 98
per cent of UK stocks.
The competition was judged by a three-member team from the organisations
which sponsor the FT-SE Actuaries series of indices: the Financial Times,
the London Stock Exchange and the Institute and the Faculty of Actuaries.
The judges were concerned that the name for the index should reflect the
character of an index composed of very small companies and be consistent
with, but distinct from, the existing FT-SE-A share indices.
They also felt the name should, ideally, reflect both the potential and
risks of investing in very small companies, which do not necessarily turn
from little acorns into mighty oaks.
They decided that Fledgling - which implies vulnerability as well as
possible growth - best met all of these criteria.
The name also has the attraction of alliteration: the FT-SE-A (or 'Footsie')
Fledgling index.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Competition): When small means Fledgling -
Next month sees the launch of a new FT-SE-A share price index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new FT-SE Actuaries Fledgling index, to be launched on January 3, has
been established because of increasing interest by fund managers and
individual investors in the very small companies sector.
It will cover companies too small to be included in the FT-SE Actuaries
All-Share index, the main benchmark for assessing UK portfolio performance.
This, from the start of January, will cover around 920 of the largest and
most actively-traded British stocks, each with a minimum market
capitalisation of Pounds 40m. The All-Share covers roughly 98.2 per cent of
the UK equity market by value.
The Fledgling index will encompass 800 companies, both with full listings on
the London Stock Exchange and on the Unlisted Securities Market, but will
cover just 1.8 per cent of the UK market, including investment trusts.
Investor interest in very small companies has been underlined by the recent
launch of two other indices covering this end of the market, both devised by
two professors at the London Business School, Elroy Dimson and Paul Marsh.
One is the Hoare Govett 1,000 index, which started formally in August
although it was calculated from January 1993. This contains the bottom 2.5
per cent of the UK equity market, including investment trusts. At the start
of this year, none of its 1,000 constituents had a market capitalisation of
more than Pounds 51m.
The other is Gartmore's MicroCap index, unveiled last month, which covers
the smallest 1 per cent of the market and gave its 676 constituents a
maximum market capitalisation of Pounds 28.7m at the start of this year. It
excludes investment trusts; the Fledgling and HG 1,000 are calculated both
with and without trusts.
Hoare Govett and Gartmore recently launched investment trusts which aim to
track the performance of their indices. The Gartmore new issue offer closes
on Tuesday. Other fund managers may decide to establish products based on
the FT-SE-A Fledgling.
So, why is there increased interest in this segment of the market? What are
the investment hazards? And what distinguishes the various indices?
The vogue for the sector stems in no small part from statistical research
into the so-called 'back history' of small stock indices. This reconstructs
their performance over the past few decades (assuming they existed then). It
indicates that, over long periods, these indices have outperformed the
larger UK equity market substantially.
The HG 1,000 produced an annualised return of more than 21 per cent from
1955 to 1993 (assuming re-investment of gross income) compared with 14.5 per
cent for the FT-SE-A All Share, while Gartmore's MicroCap produced 22 per
cent.
This year, too, the sector has produced better returns than the wider
market. The MicroCap, for example, returned about 4.7 per cent in the first
11 months of the year, outperforming the All-Share by around 11 per cent.
There have, however, been periods - often around recessions - when small cap
stocks have underperformed the wider market, such as in the early 1980s and
between 1989 and 1993 (see chart).
Moreover, whatever the past performance of these indices, history is no sure
guide to future success and investment in the very small company sector
carries some significant risks. For while the indices will include some
fast-growing stock market stars of tomorrow, they will also be home to many
burnt-out cases. The danger of insolvency is higher at this end of the
market.
Small company share prices are also particularly volatile, due partly to a
lack of liquidity in these stocks: there are not many shares in issue and
many tend to be held in very few hands.
It is not easy to buy or sell significant amounts of stock without moving
the price against yourself.
The Fledgling index differs from others covering small companies in two main
ways. One is the percentage of the market covered. The other is its
treatment of liquidity.
Unlike the HG 1,000 and the MicroCap, it employs a screen to exclude stocks
with poor liquidity. First, at least 25 per cent of a company's shares in
issue must be available publicly for investment.
That percentage is also a requirement for a company to get a full stock
exchange listing, but the USM insists on only 10 per cent. This means some
USM stocks will be omitted from the FT-SE-A index.
Second, for inclusion in the Fledgling, a company's stock must have traded
on at least 50 business days in the previous 12 months.
Some investors are likely to be attracted by the Fledgling's use of
liquidity screens, while others may prefer the more inclusive form of
bottom-fishing offered by other indices.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pity the Norwegians, still out in the
cold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs LIV-ELLEN KENNEDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As an ex-Norwegian, dismayed and frustrated by my compatriots' capacity
to make the same mistake twice at intervals of only 20 years, I would like
to clarify some of the misconceptions expressed by our neighbour (Letters:
December 6).
As for the bloated bureaucracy, the total number of officials, taking all
the EU institutions together, is rather less than half of the number of
employees of the commune of Oslo. To take another example, the staff of the
European Commission is roughly the same as that of the UK Department of
Transport.
For Norwegians, paying CAP prices for their food would indeed be a
privilege. One of the issues during the recent referendum campaign was the
wish of many Norwegians (on the No side) to continue to provide price
support for the agricultural commodities produced in Norway far exceeding
the levels paid by the CAP, resulting in even higher food prices than those
to which EU citizens are accustomed.
As for the economic blight produced by a fixed exchange rate, the
catastrophic collapse of Norway's banking and insurance sector, in which
Norway's leading commercial banks had to be bailed out by the government, is
surely an argument for more, rather than less, external financial
discipline.
Finally, as a result of the referendum and, consequently, of Norway's
continued membership of the rump European Economic Area (it is hard to
imagine what interests are shared by Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein),
crucial decisions relating to the Norwegian economy will now be taken by
bodies in Brussels, Strasbourg and Frankfurt, in which its voice will not be
heard and over whose implementation it will have not the slightest
influence.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Will he, won't he?: If Jacques Delors decides to run in the
French presidential election, he would start as favourite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By his own account, Mr Jacques Delors has made his decision about whether to
run as the socialist candidate for the French presidency. The outgoing
president of the European Commission has promised to announce it to an
expectant France some time before Christmas - perhaps as early as his
prime-time interview on French television tomorrow.
His countrymen, of all political persuasions, are on tenterhooks over his
decision, which could determine the course of the election and possibly the
country's political structure after the final presidential vote next May 7.
If Mr Delors decides to run, he would start as favourite in the election.
His candidacy would encourage the entry of another anti-European candidate
from the right, and strengthen the claim of Mr Edouard Balladur, the
gaullist prime minister, to be the standard-bearer of the governing
coalition.
Ironically, a decision by Mr Delors to stay out of the Elysee race could
have even greater consequences by precipitating a political re-alignment on
the French right.
Mr Delors has acquired an extraordinary aura in his native France through
his role in relaunching Europe over the past 10 years. He returns from
Brussels to a country with a political system of weak parties and strong
personal rivalries, which is currently deeply unsettled by corruption
scandals at home, the pace of global economic change, and the growing
insecurity on the European Union's borders.
This is why Mr Delors continues to rise ever higher above his rivals in the
opinion polls, even though it has been some time since he achieved anything
markedly new in Brussels.
An astonishing 69 per cent of respondents in a Louis Harris poll published
this week said they 'would not exclude' voting for him, a far bigger
catchment area than exists for his potential gaullist rivals, Mr Balladur or
Mr Jacques Chirac, the mayor of Paris.
He also out-polls this pair in popularity among business leaders. Although
business leaders might have been expected to be suspicious of Mr Delors'
socialist ticket, they recognise that he presided over the creation of the
single European market.
If Mr Delors decides to run, it would make Europe the issue of the campaign.
He would, inevitably, be the target for the slings and arrows of France's
anti-Europeans. Mr Delors would do his best to avoid this, and the knowledge
that he would fail could be the argument that tips the balance towards not
running.
But if he does run, he would draw in against him Mr Philippe de Villiers,
the dissident conservative whose anti-Maastricht ticket scored well in last
June's European Parliament elections. Equally certain is that ex-President
Valery Giscard d'Estaing, whose chief remaining stock-in-trade is that he is
more pro-European than the rest on the centre-right, would stay out.
A Delors candidacy would frighten his two gaullist rivals, though the prime
minister slightly less. The Balladur camp has been brandishing the threat of
a Delors candidacy to promote their man as the only one capable of uniting
centre and right to block this socialist menace. The prime minister has
already marked his distance from Mr Delors by criticising Euro-federalism as
outdated, and he would further sharpen this angle of attack.
Mr Chirac would suffer worse from the candidacy of Mr Delors. No poll has
ever shown the mayor of Paris beating the Commission president. If the
dogged Mr Chirac were to drop out early, the Eurosceptic slot in the
mainstream conservative spectrum might be filled by his ally, Mr Philippe
Seguin, the anti-Maas-tricht president of the National Assembly.
A long campaign would see Mr Delors' popularity fall from its present dizzy
height. But he would almost certainly make it through the first round of
voting on on April 23.
If he won in the final two-man run-off on May 7, he would face a National
Assembly in which the current RPR and UDF governing coalition holds 80 per
cent of the seats. Unlike President Bill Clinton, who must live with a
Republican-controlled Congress for the next two years, a President Delors
would have the power to dissolve parliament. He would almost certainly use
it to avoid cohabiting with a conservative government and parliament for
three more years.
Alternatively, he could try to prise France's pro-European centrists out of
the current ruling coalition. But, if elections or alliances failed to give
a President Delors a working majority, France would face a long impasse that
might favour a fundamental revision of its quirky constitution.
Some of those closest to Mr Delors are convinced he will decide not to run.
This week he said he felt much better after making his 'entirely personal'
decision. It would be entirely in tune with his contrarian temperament to be
upbeat about a decision that he knows would be deeply unpopular.
A No from Mr Delors would devastate the Socialist party, which has no other
credible standard-bearer. Mr Michel Rocard was ousted as leader last June
when he gained the party only 14.5 per cent of votes in the European
Parliament elections. He will not return to the fray, even if the party
wanted him.
The man who replaced him as party leader, Mr Henri Emmanuelli, is too
leftwing to appeal to voters in the centre. He is, in any case, due to stand
trial in March for alleged illicit campaign funding.
Mr Pierre Mauroy, mayor of Lille and President Mitterrand's first prime
minister, is well-regarded in the party but not by the electorate at large.
Mr Jack Lang, the flamboyant former education and culture minister, has
ambitions, but no experience outside the ministerial portfolios he once
held.
Ironically, Mr Delors' own daughter, Mrs Martine Aubry, who was the last
Socialist labour minister, is perhaps the best of the younger crop of
Socialists. However, her electoral hopes might suffer if there was a
backlash among voters against her father's decision not to stand.
The odds would be that no leftwinger would make it into the final run-off -
for the first time since 1969. That would hand victory to a conservative -
but probably at an awesome cost to the unity of the RPR gaullist party.
Instead of attempting to kiss and make up after the first round vote, Mr
Balladur and Mr Chirac would slug it out until the bitter end, possibly
breaking up their RPR party in the process.
In the past, Mr Balladur has publicly urged a merger of his own party with
the centrist UDF federation to create a unified centre-right movement
similar to those in the rest of Europe.
He hates mention of this at the moment, because he knows it deeply disturbs
the RPR. But if he were to win, he might well try to unite the pro-European
part of the RPR with the UDF, leaving behind an anti-European gaullist rump
probably led by Mr Seguin.
Whichever way Mr Delors jumps, Europe looks like being the big issue in the
French presidential campaign. It may prove the rock on which the French
right breaks up, and re-forms itself.

Sir, Many companies will welcome the proposal by the European commissioner,
Mr Raniero Vanni D'Archirafi, to introduce laws giving businesses the right
to charge interest on late payments of debt ('Brussels' answer to slow
payers', December 1).
However, the European Commission might like to consider similar action to
deal with late payment of EU grants to the large number of organisations
(many non-profit making) which are critically dependent on such funding.
The Commission and the EU member states should set an example by putting
their own house in order first.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your article 'Ringing the tills' (December 8) you comment that one
in five customers phoning shops for information failed to get through at the
first attempt.
This company has just carried out a survey of more than 5,000 UK businesses,
which revealed that 33 per cent failed to answer their phones. This implies
that one in three businesses around the country are unwittingly turning away
potential customers every day of the week.
However, the survey revealed that not all businesses are unhelpful - 36 per
cent manage to answer their phones within two or three rings. More
impressive yet was the fact that 4.8 per cent pick up their phones within
just one ring.
The telephone is often the first point of contact between supplier and
customer, and companies should make sure their staff are trained properly to
answer calls promptly and politely.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CS GUEST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am no defender of British Rail but I recently came across a copy of
Punch, dated May 19 1937, in which the LMS Railway made the proud boast that
the cost of its third-class travel was one old penny (0.4166 new pence) a
mile. l decided to put this to the test against the Pounds 19.50 I recently
paid for a day return from Bristol to Torquay (196 miles there and back).
In 1937 this journey would have cost me 16 shillings and 4 pence (8l. 66p).
On this basis, the journey price has gone up by a factor of 23.88.
Taking an average take-home wage of Pounds 3 a week in 1937 and of Pounds
150 today, wages have gone up by a factor of 50. If anyone can prove
otherwise, I will withdraw my assertion that rail travel today represents
better value than it did in 1937.

Sir, I am not in the habit of writing to papers but have been moved to do so
by 'Letter from Hanoi' (December 3/4).
I wonder if Victor Mallet made any inquiries as to how the dogs that he so
much enjoyed eating were killed. In many parts of south-east Asia they are
killed by slow strangulation or are beaten to death, as this is supposed to
make the meat more tender.
I am not a vegetarian, and have just enjoyed a meal of roast pork, but I am
confident that the pig was killed quickly and painlessly and it certainly
was not kept in a cage in my kitchen while another pig was being cooked.
I suggest that Mallet makes a donation to the International Fund for Animal
Welfare, which is working hard in south-east Asia to prevent the torture of
dogs and cats before they are eaten.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Move over, mutant turtles: This year's children's Christmas
present phenomenon - Power Rangers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four years ago, it was pizza-loving turtles that lived in sewers. This year
it is US high-school kids who draw on the spirit of dinosaurs to
metamorphose into karate-kicking superheroes and fight evil.
The fickle and unpredictable nature of children's taste makes selling toys
one of the most difficult branches of retailing. Few in the trade -
including their Japanese manufacturer, Bandai - predicted that Mighty
Morphin Power Rangers, dolls based on characters from a children's
television series, would become the hit of 1994.
But the toys have not merely sold well - as did Tracy Island, a replica of
the headquarters of Thunderbirds from the revived 1960s sci-fi puppet
series, last Christmas.
They have become a phenomenon of the ilk of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in
1990, launched on the back of a successful film; Transformers, the
futuristic cars and aircraft that converted into robots, in 1985; and
characters from the film Star Wars in the 1970s.
Indeed, Bandai claims they are likely to be the best-selling toys ever in a
single Christmas, having sold 9m in the UK already - against 3m Ninja
Turtles in 1990.
Bandai, one of Japan's largest toy manufacturers, does not yet know how many
Rangers have sold around the world this Christmas. But retail experts
believe the dolls will beat the original estimate of Y30bn (Pounds 190m)
sales in the US and Europe, pushing the Bandai group's pre-tax profits for
the year to March 1995 above current forecasts of Y13.5bn - compared with
Y5.4bn last year.
The toys range from 10cm models of the Rangers for Pounds 3.99 each to
22cm-30cm 'zords' - the robot dinosaurs into which the Rangers 'morph' when
they have to fight particularly tricky enemies - at Pounds 28-Pounds 50.
'They really are a phenomenon for this year,' says Stephen Woodbridge,
managing director of Hamleys, the toyshop in London's Regent Street. 'They
are one of those things where you just don't know how many you could sell,
if only you could get the stock.'
Getting the stock is proving a problem. Parents have been queueing for hours
outside Toys R Us and Argos waiting for deliveries, only to find there are
not enough to go round. Pirate copies have emerged to meet the demand.
Bandai has even been forced to run advertisements apologising for the short
supply.
The company admits that it underestimated demand. But once interest in the
toys started to become apparent in the autumn, its ability to respond was
constrained by European Union import quotas on toys from China, where most
of the toys were originally produced. Bandai was forced to switch production
elsewhere: some 33 factories across Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong and
Mexico, as well as China, are now turning out the products 24 hours a day.
Bandai has a good record in picking winners, as the manufacturer of Ninja
Turtles. But forecasting the big hit of the year is tricky. Many in the
trade had thought merchandise from Disney's film The Lion King would be this
year's best performer.
It was the unexpected success of the Power Rangers TV series that boosted
the toys. It also lifted the ratings of Britain's GMTV, the breakfast
television show that first screened it in the UK. The series is now being
brodcast by BSkyB, the satellite channel, and is showing in 80 countries.
'It is the first time a toy company has had to deal with the simultaneous
launch of a programme in so many countries worldwide,' says Bandai.
The success of the TV series has perhaps caused most bemusement in Japan,
which has been familiar with the characters, known there as Go Rangers, for
17 years in comic books and then on television.
Japan's Go Rangers were five anonymous superheroes, who battled with
monsters using martial arts and huge robots, usually to save Tokyo from
disaster. In late 1992, a Califor-nian production company called Saban
Entertainment brought the characters to a wider audience by turning them
into American teenagers. It interwove newly filmed storylines with action
se-quences from the original Japanese programmes.
In spite of its popularity, the television series has aroused controversy. A
Norwegian channel took it off the air following complaints of copycat
violence by children. In the UK, a four-year-old boy from Bristol was taken
to hospital with a split kidney after a friend kicked him in imitation of a
Ranger. However, the controversy has had little effect on the sales of the
toys.
Just why Power Rangers have taken such a hold on childish imaginations is a
mystery. 'We don't think anyone really knows why they're so popular,' says
Bandai.
It suggests the TV series combines a number of elements that appeal to
children: martial arts, science fiction, a battle between good and evil, and
dinosaurs. Also, two of the five Rangers are girls, so they appeal to both
sexes.
Bandai also detects a trend away from computer games back towards toys such
as dolls, which require more imagination on the part of children. That view
is supported by the resurgence this year of old favourites such as Barbie
dolls and Action Man.
This is a trend the company hopes to gain from further, thanks to the
'evolving soap-opera' format of the Power Rangers series. New characters are
already being introduced in the US, which could be the best-sellers of next
Christmas.
However, whatever plans and marketing initiatives the toy companies come up
with, ultimately they have to win approval from the toughest judges of all -
the children.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Betting on the upturn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This week, two rather different institutions - the UK government and Orange
County in California - paid a heavy price for guessing wrong. A year ago
they made essentially the same bet: that growth in the Anglo-American
economies would continue to be modest. Underestimating the recovery's
strength will not be the forecasting error of winter 1994. Financial markets
are betting that the entire world economy is heading for a year of strong
and inflationary growth. Likely as not, that will be wrong too.
Last year the UK chancellor made a judgment call on the strength of the
recovery. Mr Clarke decided to stick with a phased increase in value-added
tax on fuel, rather than impose it on consumers all at once. It was a
sensible enough decision. An economy expected to grow 2.5 per cent, after a
long recession, needs to be treated gingerly. And the public finances were
likely to be scary enough in spring 1995 for tax increases to be easily
defended.
As it turned out, Mr Clarke was wrong on both counts. The country prospered
from his mistake, but this week the error temporarily cost the exchequer
Pounds 1bn in voted-down tax revenues. The damage to the government's
credibility will be permanent.
Taxpayers in Orange County are facing a Dollars 1.5bn-Dollars 2bn bill for a
similar misjudgment by their local authority. Mr Robert Citron, its
treasurer, invested on the expectation that the 1993 pattern of steady US
growth and stable or falling short-term interest rates would continue
through 1994. Unfortunately for him, the economy raced onward. Mr Alan
Greenspan raised US interest rates six times, eventually losing the county
so much money that on Tuesday it filed for bankruptcy.
Less obvious
Those who remember the past make sure that they do not repeat it. The steep
yield curve in markets around the world indicates that investors are
discounting strong economic growth, higher inflation and sharp rises in
short-term interest rates in 1995. Some of these ingredients are already
present in the US and UK. The case for all three, in all of the world's
industrialised economies, is less obvious.
Mr Greenspan's November rate increase dispelled some fears that he had
fallen behind in the race to slow the economy before inflationary pressures
emerge. He improved his hawkish credentials further on Wednesday, testifying
to Congress that inflation fears may mean another rise in federal funds rate
 -now 5.5 per cent - in the months ahead. The US economy has yet to show
clear signs of slowing from the real growth rate of roughly 4 per cent
recorded over most of the year. Investors appear to expect US interest rates
to rise further. Other things being equal, that is the simplest way to lower
the gap between long and short-term interest rates. But markets have to
co-operate, by lowering their expectations for inflation. Before Orange
County's losses disturbed them, the signs were that bond traders were at
last beginning to trust Mr Greenspan's judgment. US 10-year bond rates fell
briefly to 7.7 per cent on Tuesday, compared with over 8 per cent three
weeks ago.
Same effect
Mr Eddie George of the Bank of England will be hoping to get the same effect
out of the half-point rise in UK interest rates which he won from Mr Clarke
on Wednesday morning. The gap between regular and index-linked government
bonds fell slightly after the rise, but investors are still betting against
them achieving their medium-term inflation target.
Rising short-term interest rates to accompany strong real growth seems the
most probable recipe for a continued flattening of the yield curve in the US
and UK. But is it sensible to expect a similar outcome elsewhere? German
money markets took Thursday's higher-than-expected rise in third-quarter
west German GDP as another reason to expect higher interest rates from the
Bundesbank.
The gap between actual and potential German GDP is currently only about 1
per cent. Companies may well come up against capacity constraints relatively
quickly as production picks up, so the Bundesbank can fairly reliably be
expected to try to pre-empt inflation in the coming months. The Bank of
France, as ever, may be forced to follow the same path, although the French
output gap is a good deal larger.
Oddest of all is the current betting on Japan, where short and long-term
interest rates are about 2.8 per cent apart, the same as in France and
Germany. Although a slow and fragile Japanese recovery is finally under way,
prices are still more likely to rise than to fall. Part of the explanation
lies in the mistakes of the past: Japanese banks need artificially low
interest rates to deal with the loans made when they expected the late 1980s
inflationary boom to continue. It will be governments, not investors, who
suffer if today's high nominal bond rates turn out to have overstated
inflation. But if this week taught anything, it is that someone pays for
surprises, even a pleasant one like strong, non-inflationary growth.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Conservative Rebels in the News: The whipless wonders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It had been a hard slog. But the British government's business managers
reckoned they had pulled it off.
Minutes before Tuesday's crucial House of Commons vote on value added tax,
one whip thought that the government would win by two votes. He believed
chancellor Kenneth Clarke's last-gasp concessions, offering pensioners an
extra Pounds 100m of compensation for the proposed increase from 8 to 17.5
per cent in the rate of VAT on domestic fuel, had snatched victory from the
jaws of defeat. But he reckoned without the whipless wonders.
These are the Tory MPs who were suspended from the parliamentary party, with
one resigning voluntarily, after a vote last week on the controversial
European Union finance bill. Eight of the nine extended the rebellion to VAT
 -voting against the government or abstaining. Their defiance consigned the
government to defeat by eight votes, and blew a Pounds 1.5bn hole in Mr
Clarke's Budget arithmetic.
The rebels appear to have decided to defy the government at a secret meeting
attended by eight of them during the VAT debate. This element of
co-ordination has seen them labelled as a party within a party. In numbers,
they are on a par with the Ulster Unionists which, with nine MPs, is the
fourth largest party in the House of Commons.
But as a force, they have little in common other than their hardline
Euroscepticism. They are a disparate group:
Sir Teddy Taylor is an engaging former Glasgow Herald journalist, with an
encyclopaedic knowledge of EU spending, if not of some more pedestrian
concerns (he once told a Sunday newspaper that he thought Ikea, the
enormously successful Swedish furniture retailer, was a cocktail).
Mrs Teresa Gorman is Westminster's vivacious version of Essex Woman - the
brash and gaudy stereotype;
Mr Richard Shepherd is painfully earnest;
Mr Michael Carttiss is a ferociously independent East Anglian labourer's son
with a complexion as ruddy as a sugar beet farmer's;
Mr John Wilkinson, a former flying instructor, is energetic, but intense;
Mr Christopher Gill is the soft-spoken chairman of a family sausage-making
company;
Mr Tony Marlow is a parliamentary thug, who exudes great personal animosity
towards Mr Major;
Mr Nicholas Budgen is a slight, Cambridge-educated barrister with a
devastatingly dry wit, who, alone of the nine, supported the government in
Tuesday's vote; and
Sir Richard Body is a maverick agriculture specialist - reputedly the
original Old Muckspreader in Private Eye - who supported the government in
the Europe vote, but then resigned from the parliamentary party.
Westminster wags have suggested that these MPs should perhaps be given a
room to set up their own whips' office, if they are going to behave like a
separate party.
But the group is not so much a party within a party as a minority within a
minority. By choosing to defy Prime Minister John Major's decision to make
the European vote an issue of confidence, the rebels confirmed that the 30
or so hard-core Eurosceptics, who came so close to blocking the UK's
ratification of the Maastricht treaty, have splintered into three factions.
The first group decided months ago not to make trouble over the EU finance
bill in the interests of party unity. The second fell into line when the
confidence card was played. But the remaining Group of Nine apparently had
such an aversion to earmarking more funds for the EU budget that it was
prepared to risk triggering a general election.
This recklessness risks undermining not only Mr Major's leadership, which
the rebels might regard as a bonus, but also the Tory party's prospects of
winning the next general election, due by mid-1997.
It has reinforced the impression, already forming after last month's
climbdown on Post Office privatisation, that ministers are powerless to push
through their agenda.
Even with the support of the rebels, Mr Major can muster an overall majority
of just 14. When the opposition unites, it therefore takes just eight Tory
troublemakers to disrupt the government's plans. Backbenchers are becoming
adept at exploiting this. One minister this week referred to this state of
affairs as 'government by clique'.
The rebels' actions have also caused division within the party over the best
way of handling the group. Rightwingers have called on Mr Major to readmit
the nine to the parliamentary party as quickly as possible.
But the whips' office is sore at what it sees as the rebels vindictiveness
in signalling that they would support the government and then changing their
minds. 'They could have started bridge-building on Tuesday,' snapped one
business manager.
The rebels seem to be taking the view that being ejected from the
parliamentary party leaves them free to judge issues on their merits. But
the party leadership has indicated that they must show clear and consistent
support for the government in order to be accepted back.
For the moment then, there is stalemate. This might not matter because the
government's 1994-95 legislative programme seems to contain little more that
is controversial - with the possible exception of the parts of the finance
bill implementing the Budget.
Meanwhile, there is some confusion over what the rebels are trying to
achieve. Mr Marlow says the group is motivated by the belief that the party
cannot be re-elected without a policy on Europe with which 'people can feel
at ease'.
But the Tory party's centre of gravity on Europe appears to be shifting. If
Mr Major's recent hint at a possible referendum on European integration was
hardened into a commitment, it would do much to allay the misgivings of the
100 or so mainstream Tory Eurosceptics.
If the Group of Nine did not fall into line at that point, they would be
widely dismissed as rebels without a cause.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Not yet the death knell: The emergence of global investment
banks leaves a role for smaller City institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At one stroke, the rules changed this week for the merchant banks and
stockbrokers of the City of London. SG Warburg, the UK institution with the
most serious ambitions to compete alongside the dominant US firms as a
global investment bank, abandoned its independence. It announced that it
intends to merge with the US bank Morgan Stanley to create a stronger global
force. If Britain's flagship investment bank makes such a decision, what
hope is there for the others?
The City of London, with its ingrained habits and rules for capital raising
that encourage the continued separation of merchant banks and stockbrokers,
has outlasted many farewells before. Institutions such as Cazenove &amp; Co, the
stockbroker, and Schroders, the old-established merchant bank, were not
given long to live in their traditional form when the City was deregulated
in the 1986 Big Bang. They are still there, arguably more successful than
ever in their old incarnations.
Yet the shock of Warburg's decision to merge was still being absorbed
yesterday, as bankers and brokers pondered whether it finally marks the
demise of the old City. Many believe that two waves of rationalisation will
combine to sweep away the past. One will be the integration of remaining
merchant banks and brokers into the combined investment banks of the
American model. The other will be a renewed push by foreign banks to snap up
the remaining brokers.
'We are coming to the second stage of Big Bang now. Warburg has started a
bandwagon rolling, and it will roll to the end,' says the chairman of one
broker.
'It is difficult to conclude anything other than the process of
rationalisation is going to go further,' says the head of a merchant bank.
Bankers question the future of brokers such as Cazenove and Smith New Court
that are not owned by merchant banks, as well as medium-tier merchant banks
like Kleinwort Benson and Barings.
The City itself is unlikely to be damaged by Warburg's move. Indeed the
merger, if anything, will reinforce London's position as Europe's financial
centre. Morgan Stanley has already built up a substantial operation in
London since it opened an office in 1977, with 2,000 of its 2,200 European
employees based at its Canary Wharf office in the former docklands area. Yet
the decision to merge with Warburg means a recognition that it needs to
reinforce its London base even more strongly.
The move follows the decision by Deutsche Bank, the largest German bank, to
base investment banking operations in London and partly integrate its
operations with those of Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank it acquired
five years ago. Despite the claim of Frankfurt, many European banks have now
recognised London's lead in equity raising and in trading new products such
as derivatives - instruments that derive their value from that of an
underlying asset or index.
'It is good for the City because it reinforces the moves by a number of
people to commit capital and people to London. From that point of view,
hurrah,' says one banker.
This means that the evolving global investment banks are increasingly
operating out of three centres: New York, London and Tokyo. The leading
players are the US banks - known as 'bulge bracket' firms - such as Goldman
Sachs and Merrill Lynch, which have largely built up their operations in
London and Asian centres such as Hong Kong organically. Other emerging
competitors are large commercial banks such as Deutsche Bank and the big
three Swiss banks.
As London has grown into a more international centre, a presence in other
markets for UK banks has become more important. In the first 11 months of
this year, Pounds 59.7bn of shares from abroad were traded in London,
compared to Pounds 48.1bn of UK and Irish equities. 'This merger symbolises
an international financial services industry based in one country, but with
a smaller domestic business,' says Mr Richard Weir, director general of the
Institutional Fund Managers Association.
The banks that have adapted best to compete internationally are those which
have integrated stockbroking with traditional merchant banking, as Warburg
did at the time of the Big Bang. It bought two stockbrokers and combined
them with a jobber - the firms that used to buy and sell shares wholesale -
to create a single investment bank. After that, it started a gradual
expansion in Asia and the US, opening 39 operations in 23 countries.
Other UK firms have become international investment banks, but on a more
modest scale than Warburg. Kleinwort Benson has capitalised on its research
skills in the electricity industry to help it win mandates for
privatisations around the world. It has managed to sell these shares in the
US, despite a relatively modest sales staff of around 20. Barclays de Zoete
Wedd, the investment banking arm of Barclays Bank, also has global
ambitions.
Yet despite all the pressures on the medium-sized banks and brokers of the
City, many have survived remarkably well in the eight years since Big Bang.
There is still a significant number of traditional merchant banks - which
concentrate on providing advice. Some firms have stuck to their roots, but
tried to expand overseas. Examples are Robert Fleming, which has a
partnership in Asia with Jardine Matheson, and Barings, which also has a
strong Asia business.
'Many companies are suspicious of the conflicts of interest that can arise
at an integrated bank that offers both broking and advice,' says one banker.
As well as using a merchant bank for advice on matters such as takeovers of
other companies, many companies also value having an independent broker of
their shares. This allows them to get an independent view of the pricing of
share issues. The firm which has gained most strongly from this conservatism
is Cazenove.
Even more important for the survival of traditional firms have been the
rules governing the raising of equity capital in London, which are out of
line with practice in the US and continental Europe. The most significant of
these is pre-emptive rights - rules requiring companies wishing to raise
equity capital to offer new shares to their existing shareholders first.
This means that UK companies have to use UK brokers with good access to
investing institutions such as pension funds to distribute new shares.
The fees for these rights issues have remained impervious to competition:
all advisers and brokers earn fees of  1/2 and  1/4 per cent of the value of
a rights issue regardless of the quality of the issuer, or prevailing market
conditions. These fixed fees have helped to cushion the business of the
niche firms that specialise in them, and there has been little need for
firms that excel at UK corporate broking to build up an extensive
distribution network abroad.
The Warburg-Morgan Stanley merger is likely to put more pressure on some of
London's traditions. Warburg has already adopted US methods of canvassing
institutional investors to fix the price of an equity issue - known as
'book-building' - in some international issues. Beyond this, regulators such
as the Office of Fair Trading and the Securities and Investments Board are
starting to question whether some London traditions are fair, further
encouraging a shift of methods.
Moreover, the owners of UK shares are becoming more international. Recent
figures show that the fastest-growing category of shareholder on the UK
market is foreign shareholders, particularly from the US. This may encourage
companies to hire advisers who can not only help them distribute shares to
their traditional UK shareholders, but widen their investor base abroad.
Firms with an exclusively or largely domestic orientation may have more
difficulty getting business.
But the squeeze may be more drawn-out than some suggested in the wake of the
Warburg move. UK companies show enormous loyalty towards advisers, even when
their broker or merchant bank has been acquired by a foreign bank. One
example was the former broker Phillips &amp; Drew, which was acquired by Union
Bank of Switzerland. 'I have always been struck by the way their clients
stuck with them after the acquisition,' says an executive at a rival
investment bank.
Furthermore, many of the medium-sized banks and brokers are under less
pressure than Warburg because they do not have the expensive international
network. Warburg made only a Pounds 5.5m profit on investment banking
operations in the first half of the year because financial markets were weak
and it could not pull in its horns as easily as some of the smaller, nimble
players. It also had to operate in many developed countries where margins
have been squeezed by competition.
Smaller firms that do not have to operate in all global centres do not need
such high costs. This means that they may be able to ride out the current
weakness in markets and wait for an expansion in better times. Many
medium-sized merchant banks have grown through a range of niche operations
such as trading the debt of less developed countries rather than competing
head-on with US firms. They can shed or grow these operations depending on
how profitable they are.
'It is not necessarily size and size alone that makes you successful in this
business. You can operate with a few people producing clever ideas instead
of having a massive overhead,' says the head of one merchant bank.
Furthermore, a smaller merchant bank may be able to offer services to small
and medium-sized companies that do not want to pay the large fees associated
with US firms. Such fees are required to support large number of employees
and high salaries.
These trends may mean that instead of heralding the end for many of the
merchant banks and brokers of the old City, the Warburg merger may simply
mean a more stratified market. At the top will be global players such as
Warburg-Morgan Stanley, competing across the world with the likes of Goldman
Sachs. But smaller UK firms will be able to survive by offering a
distinctive approach in the UK market, combined with careful growth into
more profitable overseas markets.
'We are all scratching our heads and trying to work out what it means,' said
a banker yesterday. 'I would be surprised if some of the firms are around in
a few years time, but I think the process could take longer than people
think.'
The end of the old ways of the City of London has been predicted several
times before. Some of its traditions may not be able to endure forever, but
the Warburg-Morgan Stanley merger is not yet the death knell of its
traditional firms.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Saving and Borrowing): Bank code 'not enough'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A married couple who deposited their savings in a bank's 30-day notice Extra
Interest account, only to find they would have got more interest if they had
put the money in the Instant Savings account, received compensation after
taking their case to Laurence Shurman, the banking ombudsman.
In another case, a couple sold their car for Pounds 6,000 to a person paying
by banker's draft and went abroad. They called their bank to check and
received a telegram back confirming the draft had been 'received and
credited'. They then allowed the new owner to take the car - but later found
their account debited by Pounds 6,000.
The bank said the draft was a forgery and the couple should have asked
whether it had been 'cleared' rather than 'credited'. But the ombudsman
decided the bank should have taken care to avoid confusion, since it was
likely the customers did not know the difference. The bank refunded the
Pounds 6,000.
Shurman, who this week presented his 1993-94 annual report containing these
and other cases, said the revised Code of Good Banking Practice still did
not go far enough in setting standards.
Banks, he said, were still not doing enough to display the official code in
branches, or to make their staff aware of it and their internal complaints
procedures. He cited the case of a customer who telephoned his bank to find
out how to complain, and was surprised after holding for several minutes to
be told: 'I cannot find a bank in Ombudsman. Have you got the sort code?'
The Code of Good Banking Practice is a voluntary scheme drawn up in 1992
along the principle that banks should 'act fairly and reasonably in all
their dealings with their customers'. But Shurman urged inclusion of a
requirement that terms and conditions be 'fair in substance'.
The report, to end-September, showed that complaints against banks fell in
the period but a higher proportion of customers received compensation
compared with the previous 12 months.
There were 8,027 preliminary complaints, a fall of 16 per cent on 1993. The
number accepted for full investigation also fell (by 25 per cent) to 833.
Of the 1,095 full investigations completed in the year, 44 per cent were
resolved in favour of the complainant compared with 36 per cent in 1992-93.
The average award also rose to Pounds 1,464 from Pounds 1,352, with the
range from Pounds 5 to Pounds 53,250.
The single biggest category of complaint needing full investigation was
mortgages and lending. Common mistakes were the amount of repayment
instalments and the calculation of final redemption figures. Another
concerned fixed-rate mortgages where applicants were not told about early
redemption penalties.
Shurman said he had to reject some mortgage complaints because banks did not
have to give 'best advice' about mortgages. A code of lending would help, he
said.
Complaints about automated teller machines were the next highest category.
Shurman said banks had to take more action against cash machine fraud, even
if the cost of safeguards outweighed the probable savings.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Daf claims creation of 1,200 extra jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About 1,200 extra jobs have been created in the businesses which arose out
of the crash of Daf, the UK-Dutch truckmaker, early last year.
According to Mr David Gill, managing director of Leyland Daf Trucks, another
3,600 have been created at component suppliers.
Mr Gill said that of the total 1,500 were in the UK, with the rest on the
Conti-nent.
When the British businesses were revived, mainly by management buy-outs from
the Daf receivers, they collectively employed 2,700. This total had risen to
3,200, said Mr Gill, with another 1,000 spread among suppliers.
The UK businesses comprise Leyland Trucks Manufacturing, a management
buy-out led by Mr John Gilchrist; LDV, another buy-out led by Mr Allan Amey;
and the similar ventures Albion Automotive and the distribution company
Multipart.
Mr Gill's company, Leyland Daf Trucks, is the UK marketing subsidiary of Daf
itself.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Slow Christmas trade makes retailers shiver: Sales should
rise but margins are in doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wednesday's rise in interest rates was another blow to a retail trade
already feeling jittery about prospects for the busiest shopping period of
the year.
With sales of winter clothing hit by the warm weather in October and
November, and other sectors reporting a slow start to Christmas, stores
groups were concerned that the rate rise could damage fragile consumer
confidence.
The importance of Christmas to retailers cannot be overstated. Some
retailers see 50 per cent of annual turnover in the three months from
November to January and - with fixed costs spread over the year - up to 90
per cent of annual profits.
Marks and Spencer, the clothing and food chain, said: 'The biggest
proportion of our profits are made at Christmas. Our food market share all
but doubles in the six weeks to Christmas. It's the time when people
traditionally flock to us.'
Back in September the outlook for Christmas seemed bright. A survey of
stores groups by retail analysts at Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank,
found several experiencing strong reactions to their Christmas ranges and
gifts - a month earlier than usual. Most believed this showed an underlying
improvement in consumer confidence. The next two months, however, were
patchy.
Mr Grenville Peacock, chief executive of Bentalls, the south-east department
stores, said: 'Business in general was a bit flat in October and November.
But things picked up a bit again at the start of this month.'
Part of the reason for lacklustre sales was the mild weather, causing many
consumers to postpone buying winter coats and woollens, with a knock-on
effect on other purchases.
Mr Tim Daniels, president of London's Oxford Street Association, cites one
retail chain which sold 30,000 pairs of gloves in a week in November last
year, but only 3,000 in the equivalent week this year. Meanwhile, John Lewis
Partnership reported sales of winter coats in the third week of November
were down from last year in all its 22 department stores, by between 2.5 per
cent and 30 per cent.
Clothing shops hope to recoup some lost sales provided there is a cold spell
soon. But with Christmas fast approaching many are nervous of being left
with excess stock that would have to be marked down to clear in the new year
sales - cutting profits.
The temptation is to cut prices now, to encourage sales before Christmas and
reduce markdowns in January. A stroll around London's Bond Street suggests
some independent retailers and specialist chains are already doing so. At
least one chain is rumoured to be toying with the idea.
One department store group said: 'Our fear is that someone will be panicked
into breaking ranks and launching a pre-Christmas sale. Then everyone
follows suit and loses the benefit of selling at full margin when demand
should be at its highest.'
Other sectors are performing better. Toy retailers report healthy demand. Mr
Stephen Woodbridge, managing director of Hamleys, said: 'Judging by the
supply problems our suppliers are having, toys are selling well everywhere.'
John Lewis has reported encouraging sales of some household goods, as well
as furnishing accessories and furniture.
The reality is that, in spite of the interest rate rise, this Christmas is
almost certain to be better than last. The question is by how much, and how
much of the sales will be at full margin.
In today's low-inflation environment no one expects the double-digit sales
increases common in the late 1980s.
Mr Hugh Clark, trading policy director of the British Retail Consortium, the
industry body, said: 'In no month in the last two years have retail sales
been down year on year, either by value or volume. But they have only been
modestly up.'
Year-on-year increases in monthly sales have varied between 3.5 per cent and
4.6 per cent this year, and there is no reason why December should mark a
strong break with the underlying trend.
John Lewis forecast an increase of 4.7 per cent in total group sales in its
second half-year, including the Christmas period. With 17 weeks gone,
cumulative sales growth is ahead of its forecast, at 5.8 per cent, in spite
of the problems with clothing.
Furthermore, many retailers believe the trend in recent years has been for
consumers to start Christmas shopping later. That tendency may have been
heightened this year by the fact that Christmas day is a Sunday, at the end
of a full trading week.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Marquess nets Pounds 20m from art clear-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Marquess of Cholmondeley, the owner of two of the nation's finest
houses, Houghton Hall in Norfolk and Cholmondeley Castle in Cheshire, this
week gained more than Pounds 20m after selling 146 lots of furniture,
pictures and works of art.
The money, from an auction through Christie's, will pay tax bills and be
used for the maintenance of Houghton Hall, from where the items came.
The saleroom had cautiously expected to raise Pounds 15m but few were
surprised that this, the most important clear-out from a British stately
home since Mentmore in 1977, did much better.
There was something for everyone, provided they were extremely rich.
The best endowed international museums, such as the Getty at Malibu, would
be entranced by Jean-Francois de Troy's conversation piece of the 1730s, La
Lecture de Moliere. It sold for a record Pounds 3.9m to Mr Simon Dickinson,
the dealer, who obviously has a client in mind.
Lovers of the ornate would have gone for the ormolu mounted porcelain vases
 -one pair with gilt lions as handles sold for a record Pounds 1.92m, far
above Christie's top estimate of Pounds 600,000.
Two pairs of chairs commissioned in the 1720s by Sir Robert Walpole, the
first prime minister and creator of Houghton, from William Kent, the leading
designer of the day, sold for Pounds 219,500 and Pounds 397,500.
This seemed small beer compared with the Pounds 881,500 paid for a grander
pair of George I armchairs, or the Pounds 1.54m for a pair of Louis XIV
marriage chests made by Boulle. A Rubens oil sketch was bought by Agnew for
Pounds 1.76m and a pair of gold mounted ewers sold for Pounds 1.26m.
With the rooms packed with bidders rather than spectators, with dealers
recovering their confidence and voices, and with more than20 telephone lines
pumping in demand from overseas, the art market seemed to have left
recession behind.
The marquess secured a record Pounds 21.268m from a dispersal from a British
stately home, although Christie's will keep just over 10 per cent.
The result was predictable. Works of art of this quality and provenance
rarely come on the market. What was more unexpected was Lord Cholmondeley's
decision to sell. Less than three years ago he relinquished the jewel of
Houghton, Holbein's portrait of a lady with a squirrel, and a Gainsborough
self portrait to the National Gallery for about Pounds 12m.
This should have enabled him to pay off death duties, provide for his
sisters, and secure the future of the hall. But Houghton costs a reputed
Pounds 500,000 a year to keep going.
Lord Cholmondeley looked at various solutions to this persistent financial
haemorrhage. Discussions with an American university to convert it to a
study centre came to nothing. The bright idea of selling the furnishings to
the nation for Pounds 10m, with the proviso that they remained in situ in
the Hall, was scuppered by the Treasury, although Lord Cholmondeley hopes to
avoid liability on Thursday's windfall by offering other immovable items to
the nation in lieu of tax.
A grand auction seemed the easiest answer. Most of the items offered came
from the attic - it was reckoned that Sir Philip Sassoon's French furniture
did not gel with the William Kent decor. Lord Cholmondeley's pruning could
be justified as returning the house to the time of Walpole. When it reopens
next year the gaps will be scarcely noticed.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Eggar gives approval for gas pipeline: Pounds 440m link will
boost exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 440m pipeline linking Britain with the European natural gas grid
received the go-ahead yesterday, paving the way for large-scale gas exports
from the UK by the end of the decade.
Nine companies, led by British Gas, agreed to fund the pipeline, known as
the interconnector, which will run from Bacton on the East Anglian coast to
Zeebrugge in Belgium, one of the hubs of the Continental gas grid.
Mr Tim Eggar, industry and energy minister, yesterday said the pipeline
'will be of great strategic benefit to the UK and the rest of Europe'.
He predicted that the interconnector would 'give an important stimulus' to
attempts to open up access to monopoly gas pipelines on the Continent.
Liberalisation of the Continental gas market has lagged well behind the
reforms taking place in Britain.
British Gas yesterday said the interconnector should 'open up new
opportunities for the company in Europe'. The company, which has substantial
gas reserves in the North Sea and off the west coast of Britain, expects
that a surplus of gas might develop later in the decade.
A planning application for the pipeline will be submitted early next year,
in time for construction to begin in the spring of 1996. The pipeline is
likely to be completed in the autumn of 1998. It will carry 20bn cubic
metres of gas annually.
Officials close to the project believe the flow of UK gas to continental
Europe will last for between 10 and 15 years. The likely depletion of
British reserves after that could then result in a reversal of the flow,
officials say.
Gazprom, the Russian company which is the dominant exporter of gas to
western Europe, has a 10 per cent stake in the project, even though the
prospect of exporting gas to the UK is some way off.
The construction of the pipeline will also open up the possibility of
Norwegian gas exports to the Continent being routed through the British gas
grid. The Frigg line currently runs from Norway to Scotland.
Such a development may, however, necessitate considerable expansion of
British Gas's national, high-pressure transmission system. Officials at
TransCo, British Gas's pipeline subsidiary, have estimated that hundreds of
millions of pounds may have to be spent on the grid to cope with the
additional flows of gas.
The companies participating in the scheme include Amerada Hess of the US,
British Gas, British Petroleum and its Norwegian partner Statoil, Norsk
Hydro, Conoco of the US, Belgium's Distrigaz, Elf of France, Ruhrgas of
Germany and Gazprom of Russia.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Income): The new rules test
skill of managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new rules for personal equity plans are keeping fund managers busy as
they try to work out the best ways to take advantage of them.
Andy Harrison, chief executive of Clerical Medical unit trusts - which
postponed launching a new Extra Income trust, investing in fixed interest
and equities in equal measures - says he can see a Pep with 45 per cent
invested in gilts, 15 per cent in convertibles, and 40 per cent split
between debentures and preference shares.
Although a direct holding of gilts does not qualify for the full Pounds
6,000 annual general plan allowance, a unit trust which holds at least 50
per cent of its assets in eligible Pep investments does qualify.
Harrison is cautious about using convertibles (shares or bonds which pay a
fixed rate of interest and give the holder the right to convert them into
the company's ordinary shares).
This is because their link to the underlying share value makes them more
volatile than preference shares or bonds. But Justin Urquhart-Stewart, a
director at Barclays Stockbrokers, believes in convertibles as a way of
offering protection against inflation.
He says, however: 'These are the golden rules. Never buy a convertible of a
company in which you would not want to be an ordinary shareholder.
'Make sure the income from the convertible is higher than the yield on the
ordinary shares, and that the conversion premium is not so high that future
conversion into the ordinary shares is unlikely.'
He adds: 'If someone wanted high income with safety, I would suggest 40 per
cent in bonds and preference shares, 40 per cent in convertibles, 10 per
cent in cash, and 10 per cent in overseas (European or US) equities.'

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Income): Bonds with Pep appeal
/ Advantages seen in the corporate equivalent of gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kenneth Clarke's Budget proposed that certain UK corporate bonds, along with
UK and EU preference shares, should be eligible for personal equity plans
from April 6 next year. It is not yet clear exactly which bonds will be
allowed - but stock market prices of all bonds that looked likely to qualify
rose promptly in the hope of increased demand from Pep managers - even
before next April.
Doughty personal investors may prefer to pick their own bonds and put them
into a self-select Pep. We explain the basics.
What are corporate bonds?
They come in several different varieties. In essence, they are the corporate
equivalent of gilt-edged stocks, but without the government's rock-solid
guarantee behind them. As a result, they tend to pay a higher rate of
interest.
Gilts - which come in units of Pounds 100 - are that part of government debt
which is traded on the stock market. They pay a fixed rate of interest twice
a year and the bonds are repaid at a specified date in the future. The
Treasury 8 per cent of 2009, for instance, pays interest of Pounds 4.00 for
every Pounds 100 twice a year until 2009, when it is repaid in full.
But the price investors pay for existing gilts goes up or down as interest
rates vary. At present, an investor would pay about Pounds 95.50 for the
Treasury 8 per cent 2009, and get a slightly higher effective interest rate
of 8.37 per cent.
Investors in gilts also have the advantage that they can sell them on the
stock market at any time if they need the money, rather than wait until they
are repaid by the government.
Corporate bonds are very similar to gilts. Many are priced in the same way
as gilts, in units of Pounds 100. Companies issue them as an alternative to
borrowing from the bank or issuing new shares.
Many corporate bonds are issued through the Eurobond market these days, and
some Dollars 400bn was raised that way last year. That, though, is a market
used mainly by professional investors.
Some corporate bonds are still traded on the stock market and personal
investors can buy these easily in amounts as small as Pounds 1,000 -
although the spread between buy/sell prices might be as high as 0.75 to 1.0
per cent, compared with around 0.375 per cent for large deals.
Who buys corporate bonds?
Corporate bonds and gilts are bought by people who want to lock in a fixed
rate of interest on savings for a longer period than is normally possible
with a deposit. Fixed deposit rates are only really available for up to
three years or so.
Bonds can give fixed interest rates for 20 years or more. But that also
means that investors should be cautious about locking themselves into fixed
bond interest rates when general interest rates are low, as now.
Corporate bonds fall into two main types: loan stocks, which are very much
like gilts and are sold in units of Pounds 100 (such as the Enterprise Oil
10 3/4 per cent loan stock 2013); and debentures (such as the LASMO 10 3/8
per cent debenture 2009), which are bonds secured on particular assets
belonging to a company, often property. Most have a fixed repayment date and
a fixed annual interest rate.
How safe are corporate bonds?
Because companies can go bust, unlike the government, they carry a higher
risk than gilts and so pay a higher rate of interest. Broadly, the smaller
and riskier the company, the higher the interest rate it pays on its bonds.
Take a debenture from a large property company, British Land 9 3/8 per cent
2028. This now offers an effective interest rate of 9.1 per cent, while one
from a much smaller property company, Derwent Valley 10 1/8 per cent 2019,
offers an effective interest rate of 9.9 per cent. The former offers the
investor 0.7 per cent a year more than the comparable gilt; the latter
offers 1.6 per cent more.
As well as carrying the same risk as gilts - that their prices will go up
and down as interest rates move - they carry a small but significant credit
risk that the company could at some point go bust.
What is credit risk?
Effectively, it is the risk that a company will go bust before it repays
you. In practice, though, because bonds are usually issued only by
reasonably large and respectable companies, the risk of failure is small.
What is market risk?
Just like shares, bond prices go up and down on the market, and bondholders
can get a guaranteed return on their investment only if they hold it until
the bonds are redeemed. Bond prices move up and down in response to bank
base rate changes and inflation worries.
In broad terms, the longer a bond has to run before it is repaid, the more
volatile it is likely to be meanwhile: that is, the more sharply its price
will move for a given shift in interest rates, and the wider its swings on
either side of its underlying trend.
Remember, too, that bond prices rise when interest rates and yields fall as
they become more attractive investments. Similarly, bond prices fall when
interest rates and yields are rising.
What is a yield?
The annual rate of interest you get on a bond at its existing market price.
Any fixed interest stock with a fixed repayment date has two yields: the
current (or interest) yield and the redemption yield (or yield to maturity).
The annual interest rate on any bond is fixed in relation to its value at
redemption - usually Pounds l00. But if the market level of yields is higher
or lower than the nominal rate on a particular bond, the market price of the
bond will move down or up - until its current yield comes into line with
market rates.
Which yield should I look at?
If you are holding to redemption, look at the redemption yield if you want
to know your total return. But check the current yield to find out your
annual income.
What kind of yield do these bonds offer now?
High-quality, medium-dated debentures are yielding around 9.5 per cent, and
long-term ones just under 9 per cent. But if you are willing to go for a
bond from a smaller company, you can probably get about half a percentage
point more.
Where can I find out about bonds?
This is a big snag. Very few prices are quoted, even in the FT, on a daily
basis. You will find some of the prices in the dealings page in the first
section on Saturday. But it is hard to get the information needed to choose
in the first place and hard to monitor your holdings afterwards. Ask your
broker to look them up in the Stock Exchange Daily Official List (also in
large libraries).
Should I buy bonds now?
Possibly not. While prices have fallen this year as rates have started to
rise, they may drop further yet. The best time to buy is when interest rates
are near their peak (as they were in 1990 when base rates were 15 per cent).
At such times, bonds offer the best rate and you can lock in high interest
rates. Interest rates in the UK have further to rise yet, so hang on to your
building society deposits for now.
Next week: Preference shares, convertibles and other bonds

FT  10 DEC 94 / Seasonal chart-topper retains selling power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This time last year Take That, the teen idols, took on Mr Blobby - and lost.
This year East 17 and Mariah Carey are slugging it out against the Mighty
Morph-n Power Rangers for the top slot in the 1994 Christmas pop charts.
A Christmas number one not only wins the dubious accolade of becoming the
year's office party anthem but is also extremely lucrative. Usually twice as
many singles are sold in the two or three weeks before Christmas than in the
same period at any other time of the year.
The competition for the top of this year's Christmas chart is hotter than
ever. The music industry has rebounded from the recession and had a good
year. Record companies have been rushing out seasonal releases in the hope
that their artists can cash in on the pre-Christmas spree.
Mr Graham Sharpe, who runs a book on the Christmas number one for William
Hill, the bookmaker, said: 'This is one of the most exciting Christmas
charts ever. There are lots of Christmas singles out there and there'll be a
real race for number one.'
The phenomenon of the Christmas number one dates from 1955, when Dickie
Valentine's Christmas Alphabet topped the charts. Harry Belafonte continued
the tradition two years later with Mary's Boy Child.
There were no truly Christmassy number ones in the 1960s. But the festive
spirit revived amid the kitsch ethos of the early 1970s when Slade hit the
top spot with Merry Christmas Everybody in 1973 followed by Mud with Lonely
This Christmas in 1974.
The 1970s also marked the emergence of Christmas hits as a significant
source of sales. Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody and Mull of Kintyre by Paul
McCartney and Wings topped the Christmas charts when they were released in
1975 and 1977 respectively. Each went on to sell 2m copies.
They were out-sold by Do They Know It's Christmas?, the Band Aid charity
single which sold 3m copies and scored two Christmas number ones, in 1984
and 1989.
More recent Christmas hits have had more modest sales. According to the
British Phonographic Industry the music market peaked in 1979, when 89m
singles were sold. The singles sector reached its nadir in 1992, when sales
fell to 53m due to the recession and the decline in the number of teenagers
 -the chief purchasers of singles.
The market has since revived as the recession has ended and the teenage
population has started to grow. The BPI estimates that singles sales rose to
Pounds 95m, or 62m units, in the 12 months to September, a 12 per cent
increase from the same period last year.
This bodes well for Christmas. Even in the lean years it has been the
busiest time of the year for the market as many people who do not normally
buy records pick up singles for parties or presents.
CIN, the market research consultancy which compiles the singles chart,
estimates that a Christmas chart-topper sells between 150,000 and 200,000
copies a week, compared with between 50,000 and 100,000 a week at any other
time of the year. Christmas hits have the chance of repeat sales if they are
re-released in subsequent years.
As a result record companies invest heavily in the Christmas market.
Columbia, a subsidiary of the Sony group, recorded its seasonal offering,
Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You, in February.
Her single went straight into the charts at number six last week and might
dislodge East 17, the current number one, in the new chart when it is
unveiled tomorrow evening.
East 17 is still ahead in William Hill's books, with odds of 6-4, compared
with 3-1 for Mariah Carey. But the Power Rangers are steaming up from the
rear with odds of 9-2 as they try to follow in Mr Blobby's footsteps as the
1994 gimmick ticket.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Truck sales up 50% this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recovery in the UK truck market is proving stronger than expected with
demand running at an annual rate 50 per cent higher than at the end of last
year, according to industry estimates.
Sales and orders are running at an annualised 50,000 for trucks over 3.5
tonnes, compared with 33,000 this time last year, according to truck market
leader Iveco-Ford and second-placed Leyland DAF Trucks.
Their estimates are supported by statistics from the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders which show strong rises last month in light
commercial vehicle as well as truck registrations.
Coupled with SMMT figures published earlier this week showing another rise
in business car purchases, the statistics provide evidence of increasing
economic activity - while leaving the motor industry to seek other
explanations for a slump in new car purchases by private motor-ists.
According to SMMT statistics new registrations of trucks over 3.5 tonnes
jumped 43.7 per cent in November, to 4,905 compared with 3,414 in the same
month a year ago.
They lifted registrations for this year's first 11 months to 41,473,
representing a year-on-year rise of 23 per cent, and put the industry on
course for total sales this year of about 45,000 units. This compares with
36,3507 last year and 31,398 in 1992.
Both Iveco-Ford and Leyland DAF indicated that truck sales could reach
50,000 next year.
At 19,824, total registrations of all types of commercial vehicle last month
were 17.1 per cent higher than in the previous November.

FT  10 DEC 94 / XJ range leads Jaguar's drive to profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jaguar, the UK luxury carmaker, is expected to return to profit in the last
quarter of this year for the first time since 1989.
The company has been in loss since it was taken over by Ford of the US, the
world's second biggest vehicle maker, for Pounds 1.56bn in late 1989 and has
run up total pre-tax losses of Pounds 776m from 1989 to 1993.
Jaguar sharply reduced its loss in the third quarter this year to Dollars
53m from Dollars 108m for the same period last year. Its loss in the first
nine months this year fell to Dollars 155m from Dollars 226m in the
corresponding period of last year.
The company's fortunes were boosted in the last quarter by the autumn launch
of its XJ range of luxury saloons, which led to an increase in its wholesale
deliveries to dealers worldwide.
Jaguar registrations in the UK in November rose 41 per cent year-on-year to
553.
Ford is expected to start negotiations with the UK government in January
over state aid for its project to build a range of smaller Jaguar sports
saloons to compete with cars like the BMW 5 series.
Code-named X200, this car is due for launch in 1998. It would be an addition
rather than a replacement to the range, and would more than double Jaguar
output to more than 100,000 a year by 1998/99.
The car is being designed as a derivative of a Ford world car programme
under development in the US which is expected to be submitted for approval
by the Ford board in March or April next year.
No decision has been made on a production location, but it is expected that
the car will be built either at Jaguar's existing locations in Coventry and
Birmingham or at one of Ford's US plants in Michigan.
The Ford application for UK selective regional assistance will be based on
an analysis of the cost benefits of production in the US versus the UK. The
aid sought could total between Pounds 80m and Pounds 100m.
In March the government agreed to pay Pounds 9.4m in grant aid to Jaguar to
deter Ford from moving the assembly of the next generation Jaguar XJS from
the UK to Portugal.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Growth): Disasters dog US
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some fortunes have been made in the US biotechnology industry but rather
more have been lost, writes Daniel Green. There have been three big
successes, all from California, the latest of which came to global attention
only last month. The 13-year-old Chiron was valued at Dollars 4.2bn when
Swiss drugs giant Ciba took its stake from less than 5 per cent per cent to
49.
The transaction did not come out of the blue, however. Chiron was already
the world's third-biggest biotech company. The number two, Genentech, was
snapped up by another Swiss company, Roche, in 1990. Roche paid more than
Dollars 2bn for its 60 per cent stake.
Amgen, the dream investment of the sector, remains independent. It has two
of the world's top half-dozen drugs, blood treatments Epogen and Neupogen,
and a market capitalisation of around Dollars 6bn, two-thirds the size of
Britain's Wellcome. Not bad for a business founded in 1980.
Unfortunately for investors seeking to make sense of the sector, hindsight
reveals little about how these and not other companies made it. And if the
success stories are inspiring, the failures are frightening. Indeed, the
past year has seen a series of corporate disasters in the US sector where
shares have fallen by about one-quarter on average.
Most infamously, Colorado company Synergen managed two disasters in 18
months. It had a drug for septic shock for which the Phase 3 trial results -
the last before submission for regulatory approval - in 1993 were
inconclusive.
Failure here normally means the end of the road for a drug but Synergen
persevered and, at the same time, built a high-tech manufacturing plant
ready for the approval it thought it would get.
The drug failed again and was abandoned in July. Last month, Amgen offered
to buy Synergen for just over Dollars 9 a share, compared with the Dollars
66 the stock had reached in December 1992.
Other failures this year included Celtrix, Telios, Biogen and even a
merchant bank, D. Blech &amp; Co., that had backed several biotech company
financings.
These events show a subtle difference between biotechnology and
pharmaceuticals companies. A pharma company tries to develop a lot, perhaps
hundreds, of products at once. It is in the company's interest to eliminate
borderline drugs early, especially before costly, late-stage clinical
trials.
For biotech companies, a drug that gets to Phase 2 is probably one of the
few hopes of glory. Pressing on to Phase 3, even with a questionable
product, can be crucial to maintain the confidence of nervous, but ignorant,
shareholders.
You have been warned.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Sinn Fein comes in from the cold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a detail a newcomer to Northern Ireland would probably have missed -
a flash of blue around the neck of a woman talking to a policeman outside
the gates of Stormont Castle.
'Look at that. She's wearing a Rangers scarf. That's unashamed bigotry that
is,' the driver remarked as his cab reached the end of the mile-long drive
to Stormont.
For the Roman Catholic from the Short Strand Road in Belfast the scarf of
Glasgow Rangers football club was as much a symbol of Protestant supremacy
as the imposing neo-classical facade of Stormont Castle, once the home of
the Northern Ireland parliament, hated by republicans.
On a bright, bitterly cold day Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, came to
start the first public meeting with British officials in 25 years at
Stormont - from where unionists ran the province for more than 70 years
until direct rule from London began in 1972.
Security was low key. Nine years ago there were 1,800 policemen on duty when
British and Republic of Ireland ministers met at the height of loyalist
opposition to the Anglo-Irish agreement. Yesterday there were 16 constables,
three sergeants, one superintendent and one chief superintendent.
Sinn Fein arrived in a bullet-proof blue Ford Granada and a black
London-type taxi. After briefly posing for photographs they entered the
swing doors to the left wing of the building to be greeted by Mr Quentin
Thomas, head of the five-strong government delegation.
Yes, said one government official, there had been a handshake. 'Its no big
deal, though it probably will be tomorrow,' he added, anticipating unionist
reaction.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Samsung complex receives more aid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Public-sector assistance for the electronics complex that Samsung, the
Korean industrial group, is to develop at Wynyard, Cleveland has increased,
according to figures released yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade
and industry secretary.
Infrastructure spending on the site by the government-sponsored agency
English Partnerships is expected to exceed Pounds 12m. Support from
Cleveland local authorities, Teesside Training and Enterprise Council and
Teesside Development Corporation is estimated to be worth Pounds 16.7m over
six years.
When the project - the biggest Korean investment in western Europe - was
announced in October English Partnerships' input was put at Pounds 9m and
the package from the Cleveland authorities at just less than Pounds 12m. The
figures come from the Northern Development Company, the regeneration body
for north-east England and Cumbria.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Invalidity switch set to save Pounds 2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government announced yesterday that it expects to claw back nearly
Pounds 2bn in social security spending in the next three years by replacing
invalidity benefit with an incapacity benefit from April next year, James
Blitz and David Owen write.
Amid growing controversy about social security reforms Mr William Hague,
minister for the disabled, said yesterday that savings from the benefit
would grow dramatically in its first years.
The savings will largely come from tougher medical tests and a reduction in
the number of people eligible for support.
Mr Hague said in a parliamentary written answer that the tests would save
Pounds 210m in 1995-96. This would rise to Pounds 700m in 1996-97 and Pounds
1bn in 1997-98.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, attacked the change,
saying it would force 90,000 'into the dole queues' in its first year and
190,000 in its second.
Five companies will compete for the contract to automate 20,000 post offices
and the benefits payment system, the Department of Social Security announced
yesterday.
They are British Telecommunications, IBM, ICL, Cardlink UK, and the
Electronic Data Systems division of General Motors. The department says the
introduction of a smart card system will help eliminate fraud.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Businessman acquitted only to be arrested
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Malcolm Johnson, an Australian business and mining consultant, was
yesterday cleared of stealing about Pounds 1m from Energy Capital, an oil
and gas exploration company, to support the company's Pounds 3.5m rights
issue in 1988.
After his acquittal at the Old Bailey, however, Mr Johnson was immediately
arrested and served with an extradition warrant on behalf of the Australian
authorities.
The Australians want to question Mr Johnson about his involvement with an
Australian company's purchase of oil interests in the US Burbank field. Mr
Johnson, from Kitzbuhel, Austria, spent last night in custody and is
expected to appear before Bow Street magistrates today to apply for bail.
The prosecution at the Old Bailey alleged that Mr Johnson stole Pounds 1m
from Energy Capital - later renamed Claremont UK - to support the
sub-underwriting of its rights issue.
The money was used as security for a loan by a Swiss bank to companies
controlled by Mr Johnson and acting as sub-underwriters, the jury was told.
The defence said he had no involvement in the money transfers. He was
acquitted of two charges of theft.
The prosecution was part of a much larger case brought against Mr Johnson
and others by the Serious Fraud Office. It initially brought a number of
charges against Mr Johnson concerning the operations of Duralite
Manufacturing, a company he owned.
He and two other men were charged with conspiring to induce investors to
back a mining venture by the company, by issuing false forecasts about its
assets.
These charges were dismissed by an Old Bailey judge, who ruled that there
was insufficient evidence.

FT  10 DEC 94 / PC-based share dealing system to be tested
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A pilot project is to be launched early next year for an electronic share
dealing system which enables anyone equipped with a personal computer and a
modem to buy and sell shares
Electronic Share Interchange hopes to go live by the middle of the year and
create a UK-wide share-dealing market which will specialise in trading in
small companies and the floating of new ones.
Electronic Share Information, the Cambridge company which is developing the
system, believes that using computer technology can dramatically reduce the
cost of dealing in shares, enable more companies to raise money by issuing
equities and attract more individual investors.
The new market would not involve stockbrokers or other intermediaries, and
companies coming to it would not need to be sponsored by a stockbroker.
ESI would compete with the London Stock Exchange - in particular with AIM,
the alternative investment market that the exchange hopes to launch next
year to replace the Unlisted Securities Market.
This week the company received an indication from the Securities and
Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, that although it was proposing
a market without intermediaries, it would not be impossible for SIB to
approve it as a recognised investment exchange. ESI has not yet made a
formal application.
ESI believes it could have a similar impact on share trading that Direct
Line, the telephone-based insurance company, had on the selling of motor
insurance.
Settlement of payment for transactions would be electronic and payments
transferred in seven seconds, using the services of a clearing bank.
ESI is talking to Bank of Scotland about the provision of services for the
pilot project, which is expected to start in February or March at the
business school of Glasgow Caledonian university. Lecturers and students
will trade in fictitious companies and respond to 'news' and financial
information about them.
ESI has been devised by a group of electronics specialists. The chairman is
Mr Hermann Hauser, a founder of Acorn, the computer company which now
belongs to Olivetti. The technical director is Mr Jack Lang, a computer
specialist and entrepreneur. Software has been developed by TCAM Systems of
Edinburgh.
ESI may locate its computer operations in Scotland. It sees an initiative on
business start-ups spearheaded by Scottish Enterprise as a promising base
for trading in regional shares.
The system is aimed at individual investors rather than institutions.
Investors would pay Pounds 100 for computer software and a Pounds 15 a month
subscription. They would buy shares by logging on via a modem, passing
security procedures and striking a deal to buy packets of shares at a price
quoted on ESI's public order board. The bank would immediately transfer
payment from the account of the buyer to that of the seller.
If a user wanted a better price than that offered on the board he would
enter an offer anonymously. ESI would levy a charge of 0.1 per cent on each
transaction on ESI stocks, with a minimum of Pounds 5. The low charges would
enable bargains of as little as Pounds 200 to be struck.
ESI's users could buy London-quoted shares, routed through a broker. The
system would list existing quoted companies and encourage new ones with a
turnover range between Pounds 1m and Pounds 20m. New entrants would not
require a trading record, and sponsorship by a broker or other intermediary
would be optional.
They would, however, have to publish a prospectus, with directors legally
responsible for its accuracy, and publish price-sensitive information.
Quarterly trading results would be expected. ESI would make available as
much information as possible about companies and their industrial sectors.
Mr Lang believes the availability of accurate information is often more
important to individual investors than the sponsorship of intermediaries in
making investment decisions. He accepts that sponsorship is important to
institutions. A possible flaw is that if institutions do not invest, it may
discourage individuals from joining.
ESI aroused considerable interest at a presentation in Glasgow this week.
One banker said he saw it more as a way of encouraging more people to dabble
in investing in shares than in helping companies raise money.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Margin warning on mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The margin for lenders in the mortgage market is likely to halve from about
2 per cent to 1 per cent in the next five years, partly because of the entry
of aggressive competitors, according to brokers Merrill Lynch.
It says that the arrival of Direct Line, the telephone-based insurance
company, in selling mortgages to its customers is intensifying competition.
Its standard mortgage rate of 7.4 per cent is already undercutting that of
Royal Bank of Scotland, its parent, when the cost loading is higher than it
would be in a mature mortgage business.
Mr Ian McEwen, banking analyst at Merrill Lynch, said that current mortgage
margins were unusually high. It was this factor, rather than the particular
efficiency achieved by organisations, which made the greater contribution to
the current cost/income ratios of building societies, which are generally
lower than those of banks, he said.
The research says UK mortgage margins are high in terms of international
comparisons, and elsewhere in Europe margins are about 1 per cent to 1.5 per
cent. This should be profitable enough for the bigger mortgage lenders in
the UK.
While the trend will be towards narrower margins, lenders are likely to be
able to take advantage of movements in interest rates. These often give them
an opportunity to widen margins on the savings side even if not in lending.
The research says the attraction of smaller societies - those below the five
or six biggest - as merger partners or targets for takeover is often
exaggerated and their longer-term viability is in doubt.
House prices in southern England will rise by 55 per cent to 60 per cent in
the next five years, well above the 30 per cent increases in the north and
the 50 per cent average for the UK as a whole, according to stockbrokers
UBS.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Former Gulf Group chairman remanded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Abbas Gokal, former chairman of the Gulf Group shipping organisation, was
remanded in custody by City of London magistrates yesterday after UK
authorities investigating the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International charged him with six offences of fraud.
Mr Gokal was extradited from Frankfurt on Thursday after a request from the
government on behalf of the Serious Fraud Office. He was arrested by German
police in July.
He was escorted to the UK by City of London police and formally charged on
two counts of conspiracy to defraud, one of conspiracy to account falsely
and three of false accounting.
The charges of conspiracy to defraud allege that Mr Gokal conspired with his
brothers Mustafa and Murtaza Gokal, Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, the former BCCI
chairman, Mr Swaleh Naqvi, the bank's former chief executive, and others to
defraud BCCI investors and shareholders between 1985 and 1991.
It is alleged that this was done by Mr Gokal and others concealing the true
nature of the relationship between BCCI and Gulf Group, creating companies
to fraudulently receive funds from BCCI, creating documents to facilitate
fraudulent transactions, falsely procuring the signatures of Gulf Group
employees, preventing the BCCI auditors doing their job properly and
arranging false payments into the Gulf Group accounts to give the auditors
the impression that its loan exposure had been reduced.
The charge of conspiracy to account falsely alleges that between 1985 and
1991 Mr Gokal conspired with Mr Abedi, Mr Naqvi and others to falsify
documents relating to Gulf Group and obtaining signatures by deception.
The three false accounting charges allege that in 1988 Mr Gokal falsified
letters of instruction which suggested that three money transfers totalling
Dollars 3.8m were bona fide.
Mr Gokal was remanded in custody until December 13.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Plea on executive pay disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's biggest shareholders' group is urging its members to sack
non-executive directors who do not fully disclose all details of executive
pay and explain how it was awarded.
The National Association of Pension Funds' investment committee met
yesterday to discuss proposals, aired last week by government officials,
that shareholders ought to have greater ability to control excessive pay for
executives.
Mr John Rogers, investment committee secretary, said association members
were not eager for new powers to vote down executive pay contracts. He said:
'Shareholders appoint boards as their agents.' Boards had to decide what pay
levels are appropriate, not shareholders.
The investment committee is urging that remuneration committees consist
entirely of non-executive directors and that these non-executives retire and
stand for re-election each year. At present the recommendations of the
Cadbury committee on corporate governance call for remuneration committees
to be mainly composed of non-executives.
The remuneration committees should make full disclosure of policy and the
principal factors leading to remuneration decisions.
Also, they should make full disclosure of all the elements of each named
director's remuneration.
Shareholders have complained that they know too little about the true cost
of each executive because the terms of share option schemes and pension
arrangements are hidden in the small print of lengthy executive contracts.
Shareholders would expect the non-executives to ensure that there are no
reciprocal arrangements between non-executives of different companies.
The association said that those non-executives who failed to follow the
guidelines should not have their contracts renewed by shareholders.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Taylor Woodrow quits Channel rail link group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taylor Woodrow, the property and construction company, has pulled out of
Union Link, one of the four consortia bidding to build the Pounds 2.9bn
Channel tunnel rail link with London.
The company said that it had decided to withdraw 'in view of the speculative
expenditure and on-going risks' of the project.
Bids to build and operate the link are due to be submitted by March 14 and
the winning consortium is expected to be announced late next year.
The Department of Trade and Industry has said that its decision will be
influenced by the degree of risk which the bidder is prepared to take on and
the amount of public-sector subsidy it requires.
The other members of Union Link are John Mowlem, the UK construction
company, Philip Holzman and AEG of Germany, Spie Batignolles of France and
WS Atkins, the consulting engineers. Union Link said that the nature of the
project had not changed since it was chosen as one of the four bidders in
August.
It said: 'The fact that Taylor Woodrow has gone does not remove any
particular skill which none of the other parties in the consortium possess.
We will go ahead with our bid as planned.'
The three other consortia bidding for the project are: Eurorail (BICC, GEC,
HSBC Holdings, National Westminster Bank, Seeboard, Trafalgar House); London
and Continental (Ove Arup, Bechtel, Blue Circle, Halcrow, National Express,
Virgin, Warburg); and a group including Hochtief, Costain, Nishimatsu and
Siemens.
Construction should start in early 1997 for completion in 2002.
The fast rail link will cut 30 minutes off the three-hour journey between
London and Paris.
The consortium that builds the route will also be granted a 999-year lease
to operate services.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Car fire leads to evacuation of Channel tunnel train
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hundreds of Channel tunnel train passengers were evacuated yesterday after a
car caught fire just after vehicle loading was completed at the tunnel's
Folkestone terminal in Kent.
No passenger was hurt and no other vehicle was damaged.
The incident could mean a slight postponement in Eurotunnel's being granted
a full operating licence for the Le Shuttle car service which is running on
an invitation-only basis.
Last night a report on the incident was being studied by the Anglo-French
intergovernmental commission - the body which grants the licences for the
various tunnel services.
The alert happened soon after 10am when a Ford Escort on the upper deck of
the train caught fire. As soon as the blaze broke out the train crew closed
fireproof doors to isolate the fire within one wagon.
Passengers were then evacuated as fire crews dealt with the blaze.
There were further problems for Eurotunnel later when a freight shuttle
train stalled in the tunnel for 20 minutes - delaying other services
including a high-speed Eurostar train.

The chancellor's decision this week to raise base rates reinforced the need

Mr Davies noted the statement on Thursday by Mr Eddie George, the Bank

FT  10 DEC 94 / Gerrymandering charges 'still hold'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nothing about the strength and nature of the charges of gerrymandering
brought against 10 current and former Westminster councillors and officials
has changed, the inquiry into the case was told yesterday.
In the first of the closing submissions to the inquiry Mr Andrew Arden,
acting for the group of residents who first aired the gerrymandering
allegations, said nothing the accused had said or argued at the seven-week
public inquiry would get them off the hook.
The district auditor, Mr John Magill, had accused the 10 of wasting Pounds
21.25m by selling homes at a discount to draw likely Tory voters into
marginal wards.
The inquiry was adjourned until Tuesday.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Tories face big defeat at Dudley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservatives face abject defeat in the Dudley West by-election on
Thursday, if opinions expressed in the latest poll carry through into the
voting booths.
An NOP poll of 769 electors for the Express &amp; Star newspaper in
Wolverhampton and Central Television News, published yesterday, gave 65 per
cent of potential votes to Labour, 23 per cent to the Conservatives and 10
per cent to the Liberal Democrats.
The division of opinion is a local reflection of the national standing of
the parties in The Daily Telegraph's Gallup poll, also published yesterday.
This put Labour's support at a record 61 per cent and that of the
Conservatives at 21.5 per cent.
Dudley West electors were interviewed by NOP between Monday and Thursday
against the background of the government's fight with recalcitrant Tory
backbenchers over value added tax on fuel, its climbdown after a lost vote
in the Commons and Mr Kenneth Clarke's consequent mini-Budget.
The poll found that 73 per cent of voters, regardless of voting intentions,
think Labour will win. It found disillusion with the government right across
the political spectrum, with 81 per cent expressing dissatisfaction with its
performance since the last general election.
Labour is seeking to win back a seat it lost to the Conservatives in 1979.
At the 1992 general election the Tories held Dudley West with a majority of
5,789 votes, or 48.8 per cent of the total.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Unison says cuts will secure its future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER, Employment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unison, Britain's biggest trade union, said yesterday that its financial
future was secure after a voluntary redundancy programme which cut staff
numbers by nearly a quarter.
It also said it had signed up 92 per cent of its 1.3m members to pay their
subscriptions by check-off.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary, denied reports that the union faced a
financial crisis, although he said it would have a small deficit this year
and might have to borrow up to Pounds 5m to help cover the Pounds 13m costs
of the redundancy programme - the biggest by a UK trade union.
Unison was formed 18 months ago from the merger of three public service
unions - Nupe, Nalgo and Cohse. By the end of this year it will have shed
340 full-time jobs and 40 contract workers, bringing its staff down to just
less than 1,200.
Those accepting redundancy received payments of up to Pounds 70,000, with an
average of Pounds 31,000. The redundancy exercise will reduce annual
staffing costs by Pounds 11m.
Mr Jinkinson said the terms had been best received by staff with easily
marketable skills, such as secretaries and word processor operators. The
enlarged union was still 'a bit top-heavy' with full-time officials.
Mr Jinkinson said the 92 per cent check-off sign-up level had been achieved
by mid-November and was still increasing. He conceded, however, that the
figure of about 100,000 members still to be signed up represented 'a
significant loss of potential income.'

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): NFC's glamour fades - Simon
Davies analyses its sagging fortunes and what needs to be done / Company in
the news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NFC's 1993-1994 profit figure, announced on Tuesday to market gloom, was a
sour finale to a year that has seen the former glamour stock dragged down
from grace with an almighty thud.
Once the leading participant in the high-growth logistics and distribution
sector, it rode the recession with extreme ease and steady profits. But the
slide in the economy finally caught up with the former government-owned
National Freight Consortium.
Throw in the shock departure of its chief executive, plus the first-ever
suspension of profit-sharing to employees in a company renowned for its
paternalism, and the result has been a free-falling share price.
Each of the past three sets of quarterly results has been met with a share
price decline of at least 7 per cent. In late trading on Friday, NFC's
shares stood at 145p, representing a hefty decline from the start of the
year when they stood at 234p.
NFC has two major businesses. It owns Allied Pickfords and has a substantial
house-moving operation. This, inevitably, was a casualty of weak property
markets in the UK and the US, and its recovery has been slow.
NFC's fortunes were, however, supported by its transport and logistics
business. (Logistics is the jargon term for the new breed of former haulage
and transport companies).
Once, retailers tied up their own money in expensive stocks. No longer. In
the mid-1980s, logistics companies installed complex computer systems,
expanded their warehouse space and emerged as one-stop shops for the
efficient storage and distribution of goods. Retailers pushed the burden of
controlling stocks on to the middle-man. Typical customers are retailers
such as Sainsbury and Marks and Spencer.
This new and exciting concept was extraordinarily profitable in the
mid-1980s and had the added attraction of contracts of up to five years in
length. Companies such as Exel, Hays, Tibbett &amp; Britten, Christian Salvesen
and Transport Development Group all made merry. But, when the recession
came, clients had to continue paying the same rates under long-term
contracts.
It was different when the contracts came up for renewal. Because of
increased competition among logistics companies, and retailers' ability to
resume their own distribution, reduced rates were quickly on offer.
NFC looked at two routes to avoid this this path. First, it moved to
persuade other industries, from oil companies to manufacturers, to pass on
their distribution activities at better rates than retailers would pay. This
proved reasonably successful.
Second, NFC moved into Europe and the US, both comparatively undeveloped
markets, offering attractive business opportunities. But market development
overseas has been slow, and acquisitions have proven difficult.
Indeed, acquisitions worth Pounds 10m in Germany contributed an unexpected
level of loss last year.
Against this more difficult background, Peter Sherlock stepped unto the
breach early in 1993. He came up with a Pounds 45m strategic plan, focusing
NFC on distribution and moving services and attacking its cost base. The
ideas won support, but patience became stretched at the absence of results
and he left suddenly in August.
NFC intends to continue the programme, at an increased cost of Pounds 50m,
but is now looking to accelerate the cost-cutting process. Profits' growth
will be slow, however: UBS Securities, the house broker, forecasts a pre-tax
figure this year of Pounds 115m.
NFC now needs to bring in a credible new chief executive and re-focus
attention on its skills as the leader in the increasingly sophisticated UK
logistics market. It could, however, take some time to win back its faded
glamour.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Scottish &amp; Newcastle A selection
of comments from this week's FT / Pick of Lex
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past two years, shares in Scottish &amp; Newcastle have risen 22 per
cent against the brewery sector. The reasons are clear: it has made a series
of well-timed and well-executed strategic moves. It pulled out of hotels at
the right moment and diversified effectively into the continental European
leisure industry. It also had the nerve to buy the Chef &amp; Brewer pub chain
at a price which competitors deemed high, but which now looks reasonable.
The figures on Monday were short on detail but the message was clear - the
integration of Chef &amp; Brewer is proceeding better than planned. Annual cost
savings should amount to an ample Pounds 14m by the end of the year.
That said, without the first-time contribution from Chef &amp; Brewer, the group
would have struggled to produce much growth in either earnings or operating
profits. Even if problems in malting accounted for half the decline in beer
profits, the underlying business was subject to a familiar squeeze in
margins. The industry backdrop remains challenging. Competition in the beer
market is intense, volumes are falling as the drift to wines and spirits
continues. The absence of a 'feel-good' factor means that there is little
likelihood of a swift pick-up in retail profits as the economy recovers. The
shares now enjoy a market rating and the outperformance is unlikely to
continue.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Mercury A selection of comments
from this week's FT / Pick of Lex
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury Communications delivered a classic strategic U-turn on Monday. In
pulling out of payphones, directory inquiries and two other peripheral
businesses, the company returns to its roots, providing business customers
with long distance and international telephone services. This re-focusing
goes hand in hand with welcome cost cuts, but it does not provide much
comfort for investors in Cable &amp; Wireless, Mercury's parent.
Times have changed since the days when Mercury and BT carved up the UK
telecommunications market. Since the duopoly came to an end in 1991,
competition has intensified across the board, but especially so in the
business customer segment. Mercury's traditional policy of competing on
price, rather than on the range and quality of service, has left it
vulnerable to attack from powerful new entrants such as Worldcom and
Energis, not to mention a revitalised BT. Over the past year, BT has
successfully implemented price cuts designed to hurt Mercury, demonstrating
how well BT has adapted to the new environment.
The announced cost-cutting gives Mercury a chance to restore its
competitiveness. The reduced cost base will help Mercury's profits momentum
in the short term. But the medium-term future remains uncertain; and for
those investors who do not share the euphoria about the development of
Hongkong Telecom, C &amp; W's highly profitable Hong Kong subsidiary, the
uncertainty over Mercury's strategy provides further good reason for selling
the stock.
The shares are down by 19 per cent against the market over the past 12
months, but the prospective yield is still a modest 3.3 per cent. This could
rise sharply if investors sense that C &amp; W's growth stock rating is no
longer deserved.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Merger merchants - A selection of
comments from this week's FT / Pick of Lex
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SG Warburg is selling control of itself to Morgan Stanley without receiving
a control premium. That would be a cynic's verdict on Thursday's
announcement of merger talks which, if successful, will leave the US
investment bank's shareholders owning two-thirds of the combined entity. It
may be an unfair verdict, but Warburg will have to convince its shareholders
that a merger advances their interests more than would a straight cash sale.
At present, Warburg merely talks about the 'uniquely complementary' nature
of the two businesses. One way of reading this is that Warburg has finally
reached the conclusion that, in trying to create an integrated global
investment bank from its own resources, it has bitten off more than it can
chew. October's profit warning rammed this home. Warburg is not merely
under-capitalised compared with its larger US rivals; despite great effort
and expense, it is weak in the all-important US market. Merging with Morgan
Stanley will fill that hole.
Morgan Stanley, which lost its competitive edge late in the 1980s, has
strategic weaknesses, too. Adding Warburg's expertise in the UK and some
other markets will potentially enable it to achieve global reach faster and
more effectively than building the business organically. So, there is some
theoretical logic in the tie-up.
Whether a merger will pay off, in practice, is less clear. On the positive
side, the combined group may be able to generate more advisory,
capital-raising and fund management business by leveraging off its enhanced
international reach. There should also be plenty of scope to cut costs.
Successfully merging these people businesses will be hard, though. In
hundreds of cases, it will be necessary to decide whether a Warburg or a
Morgan Stanley employee is in charge of a particular operation and whether,
indeed, one of the two must lose his/her job. There will also be upward
pressure on Warburg salaries; although its staff are paid more than most
British bankers, they are paid less than their US counterparts. While all
this is happening, some of the best staff may walk. There is also a risk
that the banks will be so involved with such internal matters they may take
their eye off the ball of winning business.
Still, if the merger succeeds, it will be a powerful force in global
investment banking. The likes of Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch would then
face a tougher competitor, but there will be a silver lining. The number of
banks operating on a global scale will have shrunk by one. The industry
could even settle down into a stable oligopoly, with large profits for all.
But smaller UK merchant banks and brokers are likely to feel naked. Banks
such as Schroders and Rothschild may come under pressure to team up with
brokers such as Cazenove and Smith New Court to create integrated houses.
Meanwhile, integrated groups such as Kleinwort Benson may well conclude
they, too, need US partners. Such re-structuring may lead to the control of
famous names slipping out of British hands. But if it enhances the City's
position as a global financial centre, that may be a price worth paying.

FT  10 DEC 94 / S African tax reforms seek to pull in evaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A government-appointed commission has called for a comprehensive revamping
of South Africa's tax system, including reforms in tax collection, an
increase in the top marginal rate of income tax to 45 per cent, and a
one-off tax amnesty to try to draw in evaders.
Unveiling the report in Johannesburg yesterday, Prof Michael Katz,
commission chairman, said it aimed to set out a framework that would reduce
the tax burden on the poor and middle classes while maintaining an
investor-friendly environment to promote domestic investment and attract new
foreign capital.
However, Prof Katz stressed that the key to the proposed reforms' success
was continued government commitment to reducing the budget deficit. 'Unless
government spending is curbed, no tax system in South Africa will be
adequate,' he said.
Supporting the government's pragmatic line on fiscal policy, the
wide-ranging document acknowledges that South Africa's big wealth
disparities raise the temptation to try to alleviate the lot of the poor by
reducing value added tax (VAT) on items such as foodstuffs and increasing
corporate taxes and income taxes on the rich. But it warns that such moves
would be counterproductive in the long run.
Instead, it recommends that only the marginal rate on people earning more
than R150,000 (Pounds 27,200) a year should be increased, while arguing that
no new VAT exemptions should be made. It also proposes the abolition of the
marketable securities tax and approves in principle the creation of
tax-exempt export processing zones to facilitate foreign investment in the
stock market and industry.
The report also urges the revamping of the existing tax collection system,
including making the Inland Revenue department autonomous, and significantly
increasing staff numbers and improving training. To complement this it
recommends a one-off amnesty for tax evaders, who include many blacks who
have never registered as taxpayers, to help develop a culture of tax
payment.
Analysts largely welcomed the report, which they saw as a compromise between
fiscal constraint and social responsibility. However, some labour
representatives expressed disappointment that the commission had not
recommended boosting VAT on luxury goods while reducing it on basic
products.
The report will be submitted to parliament for approval in early January,
ahead of the budget which is due in March.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Ailing Japanese banks thrown lifeline: Credit unions pushed
close to bankruptcy by lending to troubled property group
</HEADLINE>

The Bank of Japan moved yesterday to save two ailing credit unions, in the
first publicly backed bank rescue since before the second world war.
A new bank is to be set up to absorb the assets and liabilities of the Tokyo
Kyowa and Anzen credit unions, which are on the brink of bankruptcy. The two
institutions have total non-performing loans of about Y100bn (Pounds 637m),
accumulated mainly through lending to EIE International, a troubled property
group.
The central bank will become the largest shareholder in the new institution,
providing half its Y40bn capital. The remainder is to come from the private
sector - including commercial, trust, regional, and long-term credit banks.
The plan marks a shift from recent Japanese financial rescues, in which big
private banks have been encouraged to take on ailing counterparts. It is
also a reminder of the deep wounds left on Japan's financial system by the
bursting of the 'bubble economy,' triggered by the asset price inflation and
speculative investments of the late 1980s from which the country is only
just recovering.
The move is the first publicly backed bank rescue since 1927 and the first
time the Bank of Japan has extended funds to any financial institution since
1965, when it helped rescue Yamaichi Securities.
The central bank stepped in over the credit unions after concluding it would
be difficult for them to attempt reconstruction on their own or find
financial institutions prepared to absorb them.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, central bank governor, said that although the problem of
bad debts had peaked, 'there are still a number of small and medium-sized
financial institutions that need help, and not extending support could lead
to instability of the Japanese financial system'.
He and Mr Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister, said the rescue plan was an
emergency measure which did not reflect a change in the government's policy
of not using public funds to bail out financial groups. There were no plans
to use the new bank to rescue other institutions.
The bank, which could begin operating as early as February, will continue
deposit, loan and other banking operations. Non-performing loans will be
transferred to another body that will receive financial support from the
Tokyo metropolitan government, which has jurisdiction over credit unions.

India's governing Congress (I) party is facing serious defeat in the latest
round of state elections, according to results announced yesterday.
As vote-counting continued in Andhra Pradesh, home state of Mr Narasimha
Rao, the prime minister, Congress faced its most humiliating and politically
significant defeat at the hands of the regional Telugu Desam party.
In Karnataka, the centrist Janata Dal was emerging as a clear winner, and
Congress was also trailing in the border state of Sikkim.
'Our performance is simply shattering,' said Mr Pranab Mukherjee, commerce
minister, on television.
In the western state of Goa, the party was faring better, running neck and
neck with an alliance led by the Hindu nationalist Bhartiya Janata party.
The outcome could herald a disruptive bout of squabbling among party chiefs
but is not expected to threaten the stability of Mr Rao's government.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Bids and mergers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The big news this week in the bids and deals arena has to be the proposal to
merge the merchant banks, SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley, to create a global
investment group.
The deal, if it goes through, would be the most significant transatlantic
merger the investment industry has ever seen.
The banks were forced to make an announcement on Thursday, after rumours in
the London market drove up Warburg's share price.
On the surface, the synergies seem obvious. Warburg has a modest presence in
the US capital markets, while Morgan Stanley is one of the leading Wall
Street houses. In London, Morgan Stanley would benefit from Warburg's strong
client list and trading position in the UK and on the Continent.
However, there is always the possibility that the merger plans could fall
apart. Particularly if disrupted by a counter bid from another institution.
Meanwhile, both bids in the on-going battle between British Aerospace and
GEC for the submarine maker VSEL were referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission by the trade secretary Michael Heseltine on Wednesday. The move
stunned the stock market. VSEL's shares fell from 1535p to 1338p on the week
as the battle went on hold.
Mr Heseltine kicked the increasingly contentious bids into touch after the
Office of Fair Trading recommended GEC be referred because it owns the
competing warship yard at Yarrow on the Clyde. BAe was referred on the
rather ill-defined grounds of 'national security'.
Sending both to the MMC avoids a nasty choice between over-ruling the OFT
and not referring GEC on competition grounds, and upsetting GEC by referring
its bid alone and allowing BAe to win by default. It was widely seen as the
government opting for the easy way out.
The MMC has been given until March 15 to report, and so both bids have now
technically lapsed. BAe has said it will continue with the fight, GEC is
currently deciding whether it wishes to go ahead. Most analysts expect that
the bids will eventually be cleared, though GEC may have to give
undertakings about the future of both yards.
Since VSEL is almost certain to be taken over by one company or the other
for at least the previously offered Pounds 14, the shares are not likely to
fall much further. Meanwhile, VSEL shareholders and employees will have to
wait to know their fate.
Finally, Portals, the security paper manufacturer, was this week forced by a
sharp rise in its share price to reveal that De La Rue, the banknote
printer, was again in bid talks with the company.
Seven months ago, the two groups called off bid talks, after failing to
reach agreement following an approach by De La Rue. This time round, De La
Rue has said it would not make a hostile bid without the agreement of
Portals board and emphasised the close commercial relationship between the
two companies.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Buy-backs boost the recs - The
week ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MONDAY/TUESDAY
WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY: Dividends will be on everyone's minds when seven of the
12 regional electricity companies (recs) report. Analysts are expecting
average growth of about 20 per cent.
One reason for such healthy increases is that most of them have been busily
buying back their shares over the past year. By spreading the same amount of
cash over fewer shares, they have found a reasonably economical way of
enhancing shareholder returns.
A few companies such as Eastern (Monday) and Southern (Tuesday) have not
been as active in share buy-backs, so their dividend increases will be of
special interest. Forecasts are for pre-tax profits of about Pounds 85m for
Eastern and Pounds 92m for Southern, and dividend increases of almost 20 per
cent. Eastern's propensity for surprises has some market observers hoping
for news of a special pay-out.
Yorkshire (Thursday), which is forecast to report profits of about Pounds
98m, is also a promising candidate for special payments. The failed bid for
a Swedish energy group has left it with a cash pile of about Pounds 100m,
which it had not expected to have. Needless to say, investors are hoping for
an early Christmas present.
Northern Electricity (Monday) is expected to show one of the larger dividend
increases with a rise of about 22 per cent. The market is anticipating
pre-tax profits of about Pounds 61m. South Western (Thursday) and London
(Wednesday) are likely to trail behind with dividend increases of about 18
per cent. Forecasts are for interim profits of Pounds 46m at South Western
and Pounds 85m at London.
Some investors are hoping for a little clarification from Manweb
(Wednesday), which is expected to report profits of about Pounds 53m.
Questions are likely to be asked on the abrupt departure of its finance
director earlier this year.
TUESDAY: Greenalls Group is expected to report pre-tax profits for the year
to September of about Pounds 76m (after Pounds 9m of reorganisation costs),
against Pounds 68m a year earlier. The diverse group with pub, off-licence,
hotel and drinks distribution interests will be boosted by the first
full-year contribution from the Devenish pub estate.
WEDNESDAY: Southern Water is expected to report interims of about Pounds
68.5m, a 6 per cent increase on last year. The dividend could rise by almost
10 per cent to 8.45p. Southern is one of the few water companies to enjoy
earnings enhancement from its non-regulated businesses. This is likely to
show further improvement.
WEDNESDAY: Chubb Security, the electronic alarms and locks group, is
forecast to report pre-tax profits of Pounds 38m-Pounds 41m (Pounds 34.2m)
for its first six months.
WEDNESDAY: Half-year results from British Land could be overshadowed by
events at Stanhope, the troubled developer from which it is hoping to
acquire a half share in the City of London's Broadgate office complex. If
Stanhope goes into receivership when its banking facilities run out next
Monday, British Land will lose its 29.9 per cent stake in the developer.
Analysts are expecting the interim figures to show profits before tax of
about Pounds 20m, against Pounds 13.1m last year. THURSDAY: The City will
pay close attention to the core engineering activities of Trafalgar House,
the UK-based group with interests ranging from property and construction to
ocean liners. Analysts forecast full-year profits of between Pounds 50m and
Pounds 55m, after a Pounds 16m restructuring charge, against losses last
time of Pounds 347.2m after Pounds 397m exceptional costs.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The flotation of BSkyB, the year's biggest issue, was described by the
satellite broadcaster as 'heavily oversubscribed' when details of the
pricing were unveiled this week, writes Christopher Price.
The price was set at 256p, valuing the group at Pounds 4.4bn, which was
towards the upper end of the range implied by the company at the time of the
pathfinder prospectus.
On Thursday, the first day of conditional trading, prior to the shares being
officially listed on December 14, the stock went to a 5 per cent premium
with some 45m shares changing hands in just two hours.
The group will receive approximately Pounds 824m from the global offer.
BSkyB said that there was strong demand for the shares in each of the three
tranches of the offer, with market talk of it being five times
oversubscribed.
Over 36m shares have been allocated to successful applicants of the UK
retail offer. As the offer was an open one, those investors who said they
did not want to participate over 250p have not been allocated shares.
The success of the float will provide a boost to the rating attached to
multi-media stocks, which have been the subject of heated debate among
industry analysts and institutional investors, particularly in flotations
and acquisitions. The range of valuations on BSkyB, for example, ranged from
Pounds 2.6bn to Pounds 4.6bn.
Elsewhere, this week, Hill Hire, a commercial vehicle rental group, and
Datrontech, a supplier of computer components, both postponed flotation
plans, blaming adverse market conditions.
Hill Hire's delay was caused by prolonged negotiations between Birkby, which
owns 60 per cent of the group, and institutional investors. The company
hopes its shares will begin trading on December 29.
Datrontech said it believed its share placing would take place in the first
half of 1995. It was expected to value the company at Pounds 50m and raise
about Pounds 5m.
Shares in Rap Group, a distributor of rubber and plastics, went to a 3p
premium to its flotation price of 142p, when dealing began on Thursday. The
market capitalisation at the placing price was Pounds 15.1m, with Pounds
3.55m being raised.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Thai coalition near collapse as party quits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Thailand's coalition government was near collapse yesterday after a split
over local administration prompted the abrupt departure of its second
largest member, the New Aspiration party led by the interior minister.
Mr Chuan Leekpai, the prime minister, who now controls only 141 of the 360
seats in the lower house of parliament, must persuade one of the right-wing
opposition parties to join the government or call a general election.
There are fears the break-up of what is probably Thailand's least corrupt
elected government in recent history could dilute the vital but
unspectacular efforts to revamp the country's mediocre education system and
boost the incomes of the rural poor, which have been the hallmarks of its
two years in office.
Mr Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the interior minister and former army chief,
pulled his party's 51 MPs out of the coalition after helping to defeat a
government move to have village headmen elected. He sought to find favour
with powerful bureaucrats who can deliver many rural votes at the next
election.
Mr Chuan said his Democrat party, the largest single grouping in the
coalition, would lead a minority administration during talks to form a new
government, partly to ensure parliament passed proposed constitutional
reforms, such as lowering the voting age to 18.
This leaves him vulnerable to a no-confidence vote, which could occur during
an emergency session even though parliament goes into recess for four months
on December 21.
If the government is unable to accommodate the demands of the two big
opposition parties, parliament will probably be dissolved early in the new
year, dashing hopes that Mr Chuan's coalition could be the first to survive
a full four-year term. General elections would be held in April or May.
The opposition had no hesitation in helping to humiliate the government,
even though they originally proposed the election of local government
officials.
'I think Chuan has the fight of his political life now,' said Mr Amnuay
Wirawan, who recently stepped down as a deputy prime minister to form a new
party.
This is an awkward time for the Democrat party to fight an election as it
has seen its relatively clean image tainted by scandal. The party's deputy
agriculture minister, Mr Suthep Thaugsuban, resigned his cabinet post on
Tuesday following allegations that he helped transfer land to rich friends
on the holiday island of Phuket.
However, few people expect to see the military step into the political arena
after its chastening experience in 1992, when Mr Chuan's coalition swept
into power on a wave of opposition to the violent suppression of
pro-democracy protests.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Survey shows recovery is gathering pace
</HEADLINE>

   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's economic recovery is gradually gathering impetus, although weak
capital investment suggests the upturn will continue to be slow, according
to the Bank of Japan's latest quarterly survey.
The bank's index of business confidence showed that the balance between
manufacturing companies reporting poor or good conditions improved to -29 in
November, from -39 in the previous survey in August. The index, covering
nearly 10,000 companies, is Japan's most authoritative measure of the
short-term economic outlook and guides the central bank's monetary policy.
According to the survey, big companies plan to cut capital spending by 3.9
per cent this year, slightly more than they were forecasting in August,
although less steep than last year's 11.3 per cent fall in investment.
Corporate investment caution reflects the weak sales outlook, with turnover
forecast to rise by a mere 0.8 per cent this year, after a 5.8 per cent fall
in 1993.
Excess employment is still a problem, with a balance of 32 reporting that
their payrolls are too large. However, manufacturing employment is declining
at 2.5 per cent annually, according to the latest labour ministry report,
suggesting this problem might soon start to diminish.
Surplus production capacity also continues to be a burden, although a
declining one, the survey says.
Manufacturers told the central bank that profits would rise by 24 per cent
in the year to the end of next March, better than the 16.1 per cent increase
they were expecting in August.
Service companies, dragged down by the financial sector, have revised their
expected profits decline to 1.8 per cent, from 5.1 per cent in the last
survey.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Officials break with tradition to reassure financial system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The launch of a lifeboat for two ailing Japanese banks was greeted by
analysts yesterday as a rare sign that the authorities are acting decisively
to ensure the financial system's stability, writes William Dawkins.
The Bank of Japan's decision to set up a rescue bank, partly funded by
public money, to take over two small, virtually bankrupt credit unions early
next year is its first post-war use of such funds for a bail-out.
Tokyo Kyowa and Anzen will be closed and the rescue group will try to
recover some of their Y100bn (Pounds 637m) bad debts, before selling the
remnants back to the private sector.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, outgoing central bank governor, had recently hinted at a
switch away from the traditional preference for smoothing over financial
problems.
He told a meeting of BoJ economists: 'Failure of an institution that has
reason to fail is necessary from the viewpoint of nuturing a sound financial
system built on competitive mechanisms.'
This will be the first publicly backed bank rescue since 1927, when the
government and private sector launched the jointly owned Showa Bank to take
over the assets of failed financial institutions during the slump of that
time. Showa, unlike the new vehicle, was privately funded, with the central
bank simply co-ordinating the rescue.
This new lifeboat reduces the likelihood that commercial banks will be
cajoled by the finance ministry, as in the past, into taking over their
weaker counterparts, although they will be asked to contribute to the
rescue. It was, on balance, a 'positive sign,' a senior commercial banker
said.
Ms Alicia Ogawa, equity analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia, said the lifeboat
might speed up a reduction in the number of small loss-making banks, thereby
freeing market share for the financially secure commercial banks. This would
be welcomed by the bigger institutions, as the domestic market is shrinking;
total loan volumes have declined by 1 per cent so far this year, according
to the BoJ.
However, it was unclear yesterday whether the lifeboat would be enlarged to
take on bigger potential threats to financial stability, such as the seven
housing loan corporations whose bad debts stand at an estimated Y6,000bn. Mr
Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister, said he believed the rescue was on
offer only to the two credit unions.
The credit unions suffered from a combined Y100bn of bad loans to EIE
International, an aggressive property developer hit by the slide in property
prices which led to its five main banks halting lending last year. Mr
Harunori Takahashi, EIE's president, is also the head of Tokyo Kyowa. He and
the management of both unions are resigning.
The amounts at stake are small in comparison with the property related
bankruptcies to have hit builders and developers, such as Muramoto
Construction which last year collapsed with Y590bn of debts.
And yet Mr Mieno had good reason to act swiftly before he hands over next
Friday to his successor, Mr Yasuo Matsushita, who would be constrained by a
newcomer's reluctance to rock the boat.
The recent embarrassing failure of a finance ministry plan to merge three
regional banks in northern Japan, blocked by customers and unions, may also
have contributed to the decision to tackle the problem openly. Moreover, the
finance ministry and central bank are secure in the knowledge that the
credit unions' problems are limited to their increasingly small sector; the
lifeboat will boost confidence rather than trigger panic.
The credit associations and credit unions are a specialised relic of the
fragmented traditional banking sector, now facing tougher competition from
the big city banks. They were intended to lend to consumers and small
businesses, to leave larger players free to channel capital to industry. But
in today's less regulated banking market, Ms Ogawa believes, they are no
longer economically viable.
They have missed out on the economies of scale and technology achieved by
larger competitors, while lending is limited by law to individuals and small
businesses. As a result, the 812 credit associations and unions had a mere
11.2 per cent of private sector loans by the end of last March.
This may explain why Tokyo Kyowa and Anzen were tempted, in apparent
disregard of official guidelines, to stray beyond their usual markets into
property lending.
The cost of local credit banks' funds remains high, while their big
competitors are exploring ever cheaper sources of capital. The deregulation
of interest rates on deposits, completed two months ago, has also increased
competition for customers' cash.
Some have responded with costly marketing gimmicks, to the finance
ministry's anxiety. Johnan Shinkin Bank, the largest credit association,
last month started a new trend by offering savers cash prizes. Others have
started to raise deposit rates, confident the government will not allow them
to collapse.
Yesterday's announcement shows the authorities are ready to take a tough
line with those who go astray.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Russia applies for entry to WTO

Russia yesterday applied to join the new World Trade Organisation, a day
after the formal decision to launch the WTO next month.
Mr Oleg Davydov, Russia's trade minister, said his country was determined to
continue trade liberalisation and was ready to comply with WTO rules and
disciplines. Russian membership would permit the new organisation to become
'truly universal', he said.
Moscow applied to join the 124-member General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
last year and these negotiations, on trade in goods, are well under way. Mr
Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, welcomed Russia's WTO move. He said
it showed a willingness to drive trade and economic reforms forward 'with
vigour'.
WTO entry will require Russia to open markets for services as well as goods
and enforce international rules to protect intellectual property.
Trade officials said yesterday that if all went well Russia could join the
WTO in 1996.
Meanwhile, China's chief Gatt negotiator, Mr Long Yongtu, told Gatt's annual
meeting yesterday that Beijing's decision to set a year-end deadline for
concluding 'the substantive stage' of its Gatt/WTO entry negotiations had
'begun to play a positive role' in the eight-year-old talks.
This view contrasts with earlier remarks by trade diplomats from the US, the
EU and other western nations, who say negotiations are not going well.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Tougher stance on money laundering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MIAMI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders from the Americas and the Caribbean are expected to agree on tougher
measures to combat money laundering at their summit in Miami this weekend.
Final drafts for a declaration of principles due to be issued by the 34
leaders tomorrow call for a co-ordinated strategy to combat drug trafficking
in the hemisphere and to tackle the laundering of money from other
activities, including tax evasion.
'While drug trafficking continues to be a significant source of illegal
funds, the money laundering industry increasingly deals with the proceeds of
all types of criminal activity. An integrated and balanced approach that
includes respect for national sovereignty is essential to confront all
aspects of these problems,' the draft says.
US officials said the inclusion of non-drug offences will vastly widen the
net of regulations to combat money laundering.
It could also have implications for fair trade, by making it more difficult
for companies to obtain an unfair competitive advantage by concealing their
revenues from tax inspectors.
The leaders will agree to order a conference of working level officials on
money laundering, to be followed up by a ministerial conference which may
consider establishing an inter- convention on money laundering.
The money laundering plank of the draft declaration has been strongly pushed
by Colombia, which has often been the butt of other countries' complaints
because of its huge cocaine cartels.
The issue has created friction with some Caribbean countries, as well as the
US and Canada, because of fears that new inter-American rules could conflict
with national bank secrecy laws.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Nafta aims for swift Chilean entry: US expected to request
'fast-track' negotiating powers from Congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of the US, Canada and Mexico will announce tomorrow an immediate
start to work on bringing Chile into the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
The announcement will be made at a press conference following the conclusion
of the Summit of the Americas in Miami tomorrow, at which the Chile's
President Eduardo Frei will also be present.
Five working groups of trade experts from the four nations will be
established to examine Chile's readiness to join Nafta. The first meeting of
specialists from the three current member states will meet before Christmas
to discuss the broad principles to cover Chile's incorporation into the
accord.
In the next step, the US administration is expected in the spring to
introduce a trade bill into Congress that would grant it 'fast track'
negotiating powers. It is not yet clear whether the administration will
request fast track only for Chile, or attempt to secure broader fast track
authority. Fast track avoids line-by-line scrutiny by Congress of trade
accords negotiated by the administration, restricting the legislature to a
vote for the agreements on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.
The tentative timetable would be for the agreement to be negotiated in time
to present it to the US Congress by next October and to be ratified before
the year's end. This would avoid the accord becoming embroiled in the 1996
presidential election campaign.
The technical aspects of the negotiation are, for the most part, not
expected to be difficult. In many respects - intellectual property
protection, for example - Chilean legislation offers higher standards than
in some existing Nafta members. Chile has indicated its willingness to sign
on to labour and environment 'side accords' that accompanied Nafta, though
not all the issues negotiated with Mexico - for example those relating to
the Mexico-US border - will be relevant.
The working groups - there were 10 in the case of Mexico and a maximum of
five for Chile - will cover issues such as market access measures, trade
remedies such as subsidies and anti-dumping rules, agriculture and dispute
settlement.
A broad commitment to leaving the existing Nafta treaty unchanged is
expected to emerge, although some areas may need minor alterations.
The plans to expand Nafta and the establishment at the summit of 2005 as the
year to complete negotiations on a free trade accord covering all of the
Americas were expected to underpin the success of the summit.
Until a few weeks ago many Latin American governments had not expected much
of substance to emerge from the summit.
The summit will also agree to follow-up meetings by the hemisphere's trade
ministers next June and in the following March.

Peace has come to stay,' he told a crowd of thousands in Maputo's

Dhlakama, leader of the main opposition Renamo party.
Mr Chissano also made a plea for reconciliation. 'This is a time for us to
continue healing all our wounds and overcome distrust. We must know how to
begin a new relationship, without preconceptions and without rancour. We
must bury forever our hatreds and renounce vindictiveness once and for all,'
he said. 'Let us forgive the wrongs of the past.'

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Finland's central bank surprised financial markets yesterday by raising
official interest rates for the first time in two years to damp rising
inflation expectations and cost pressures which it said threatened price
stability.
The move, lifting its 'tender' rate for short-term money market lending to
5.5 per cent from 5.01 per cent, came despite historically low inflation
rates in Finland. Year-on-year inflation is running at 1.9 per cent after a
deep recession which shrank the economy by 15 per cent and pushed
unemployment to almost 20 per cent of the workforce. But the central bank is
worried that a surge back to strong economic growth - gross national product
is expected to rise by more than five per cent in 1995 - could trigger
renewed inflation growth through wage claims and capacity shortages.

<TEXT>
Talks between Russian and Chechen officials are scheduled for Monday at
Vladikavkaz, near the border of Chechnya, the breakaway Russian republic.
The Russian side, led by Mr Vyachselav Mikhailov, is also to meet
representatives of the opposition groups fighting the Chechen rebel regime
of General Dzhokar Dudayev. However, in Moscow, President Boris Yeltsin
ordered his government to use 'all measures available to the state' to
disarm opposing forces in the republic.
In Chechnya, the main opposition group, the Provisional Council, said it
would put its forces on a war footing from Monday - a move which seemed
designed to put pressure on the Russian forces massed on the border to enter
Chechnya. At the same time, the reformist groups Yabloko and Russia's Choice
appealed to the president not to use force - saying that the move could turn
Russia into a police state. 'You would lose the support of millions of
Russian citizens who have set as their goal the peaceful democratic
development of Russia,' they said.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Fallout): Marking time over rates -
Banks and societies await next move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's defeat on Tuesday night over value added tax on domestic
fuel was followed swiftly by a half percentage point base rate rise on
Wednesday morning. And while the markets had been expecting an increase, its
timing could have been accelerated by events in the House of Commons.
The base rate now stands at 6.25 per cent but Eddie George, governor of the
Bank of England, indicated that further rises could be necessary to control
inflation, although he hoped they would reach a plateau 'fairly soon'.
Banks and building societies have been reluctant to respond. Many may be
waiting for indications of when the next base rate rise is due. If they
think it will come soon, they may decide to save administrative costs by
making a single move then.
One exception was Northern Rock, which broke ranks soon after chancellor
Kenneth Clarke delivered his mini-Budget on Thursday. It will raise its
mortgage rate to new and existing borrowers on December 19 from 8.14 per
cent to 8.54 per cent. The rise will add Pounds 11 a month to payments for a
Pounds 40,000 loan.
General manager Alan Applegarth said: 'I find this government very hard to
read, so there is no point in waiting. I can't see the others holding out
for very long.'
Halifax, the largest society with 12m savers and and 1.8m borrowers,
maintained yesterday that it had no immediate plans to put up mortgages but
said: 'Savings rates are the crucial element.
'Moving on the mortgage side does not influence us but, if rates to savers
go up, we will have to put ours up to be competitive.'
Since Northern Rock will increase its rates to savers from January 5, there
might not be long to wait. It hopes to announce the size of the increase by
the end of next week.
One reason for lenders' reluctance to put up mortgage rates is the potential
dampening effect on the housing market. The Halifax said it was 'very
disappointed' because the base rate rise would damage an already fragile
housing market recovery.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders added yesterday: 'The housing market is
still quiet, and the recent announcements of cutbacks in income support and
rising interest rates are unlikely to assist its recovery.'
The National Association of Estate Agents is resigned to the move. Its
president, Eva Lomas, said: 'It is better to have the increase in the
pre-Christmas period, in what is traditionally a quiet time, than to have it
foisted upon us in the new year or early spring when the property market
usually picks up.'
Housing affordability still remains good, but the CML said the negative
psychological impact was harder to quantify. 'If people are worried about
the future direction of interest rates or about their own financial
prospects, this will weaken their confidence in choosing to buy a home.'
Ian Darby, of mortgage-broker John Charcol, believes that the profits of
many societies are healthy enough to allow them to put up rates to savers
and keep mortgage rates unchanged.
'That is one option,' the Halifax conceded. 'But the standard mortgage rate
has become less important than before because of the availability of
discounts.'

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Fallout): New blow to investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY BAILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The small print of the chancellor's main Budget last week dealt a big blow
to two forms of investment popular among those averse to risk: guaranteed
income bonds (Gibs) and guaranteed equity bonds (Gebs).
Gibs are fixed-rate investments which either pay a regular income for a set
number of years or roll up the income and pay it back with the original lump
sum at the end of their life.
Gebs come in several forms. They usually last for around five years and
guarantee a pay-out linked to the rise in a particular stock market index,
such as the FT-SE.
In the event of a market fall over the period, investors are promised the
return of their original capital, sometimes with some guaranteed growth.
While the return on these investments is reasonably easy to understand, the
way they they are constructed and taxed is notoriously complicated. The
chancellor last week closed a loophole which could cut future returns on
these bonds. The move has led to some life companies withdrawing from the
market.
Most of the products are written as single premium, whole-of-life policies.
The regime under which they are taxed is impenetrable to nearly everyone -
except their designers and the Inland Revenue.
Life companies must pay basic-rate tax on the investment returns, and any
pay-out is considered to be net of basic-rate tax in the hands of the
investor. Higher-rate taxpayers must pay the extra higher-rate tax on the
proceeds. But some life companies have avoided basic-rate tax, allowing them
either to boost their own margins or increase the return to the investor, or
both.
The companies have taken advantage of a system under which assets could be
passed to an offshore re-insurance company which paid no tax on the
investment returns. Now, this loophole has been plugged and, in future, life
companies will have to pay tax on the profit they make through contracts
they have re-insured.
Not all life companies are affected; the rate of tax a company pays depends
on the type of business it does and its asset structure.
Amanda Webster, of Save &amp; Prosper, says: 'We have known for a while that the
Inland Revenue was looking at this. A large part of the guaranteed bond
market could be decimated. The change will have a dramatic effect on the
terms that can be offered. Effectively, we are looking at moving from a
gross to a net return, and that could mean a reduction of around 25 per cent
in returns.'
Derek Wright, spokesman for Laurentian - one life company which has
withdrawn its products - reckons the Revenue is unlikely to earn any extra
tax. 'It is ordinary consumers who will pay more because they are more
likely to divert their savings to less tax-efficient bank and building
society accounts,' he says.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Fallout): Take VAT] Now for refunds -
The options for those who paid in advance for fuel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Paying for fuel in advance was this spring's surprise tax-saving trend. More
than 1m households settled gas or electricity bills one or more years ahead
to avoid incurring value added tax on what they used. According to British
Gas, 600,000 of its account-holders paid an average of Pounds 650 or Pounds
700 before the first stage of VAT was imposed in April this year.
If you were one of them, how do you stand now that the planned rise in the
VAT rate from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent is not going to take place? And
should you try to reclaim some or all of the money?
Gas and electricity companies have indicated that they will provide refunds
if asked. But accountants say that if you paid one or two years ahead, it is
not worth claiming it back, particularly if you are a higher-rate tax payer.
Indeed, the pre-payment should still turn out to be a reasonably good
investment. Maurice Fitzpatrick, of accountant Chantrey Vellacott,
calculates that paying in advance from March 1994 for two years of fuel
bills will result in an average tax-free net return of 6.6 per cent a year.
(This assumes annual fuel bills of Pounds 750, spread evenly over the year,
and a 4 per cent rate on money left on deposit).
A 6.6 per cent return is not as high as projected originally when the second
year's VAT rate was expected to be higher, but is still better than most
people would get from a building society or other low-risk investment.
What if you paid for more than two years? Logically, this was never an
option - after two years or so, the amount of interest lost made pre-payment
look less and less attractive. Nonetheless, a number of people - perhaps
keen to deprive the Treasury of some tax, even at their own expense - did
pay for five or 10 years' worth of fuel. For them, reclaiming money covering
bills after spring 1996 probably is worth-while.
Fitzpatrick, however, raises a potential problem. If refunds are available
freely, he says, it is conceivable the Customs &amp; Excise could argue that
money paid in advance was, in fact, a deposit rather than genuine
pre-payment.
On this basis, it might be able to demand back payments of VAT on bills
already paid at the zero rate. So far, though, there is no indication that
it will take this view.
If you move home within the two-year period, of course, you will have to
reclaim your pre-payments. But there is unlikely to be any problem here.
If you opted to cut your tax bill by increasing the energy efficiency of
your home with double glazing, insulation and so on, your improvements will
now take longer to pay for themselves - although they should still prove a
good buy eventually. After all, reducing fuel consumption for environmental
reasons was a major reason for introducing the tax in the first place. It is
the surest way of lowering your tax bill over the long term.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Fallout): Smokers, drinkers and
drivers hit by mini-Budget
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Thursday's mini-Budget, resulting from the government's defeat over
extending VAT on fuel to 17.5 per cent, was bad news for smokers, drinkers
and drivers. Duty on alcohol and tobacco is raised by about 4 per cent from
midnight, December 31. This means an extra 6p on 20 cigarettes, 1p on a pint
of beer, 5p on a bottle of wine, and
26p on a bottle of whisky. Duty on petrol and diesel will go up by 1p a
litre (4.5p a gallon) at the same time. Planned extra payments to compensate
pensioners and social security claimants for the higher VAT rate will be
scaled back. The earnings threshold for NI contributions will be Pounds 58
rather than Pounds 59 a week from April 1995.

<TEXT>
Mr John Elliott, the Melbourne-based businessman and former president of the
Liberal party, was yesterday committed for trial on charges of theft and
conspiracy. Three other former executives at his Elders IXL brewing and
agribusiness group, one of Australia's most prominent companies in the
late-1980s, were also ordered to stand trial.
The ruling by Melbourne magistrate Graeme Hicks that the matter should go to
trial follows four months of committal hearings, during which the
prosecution alleged that the individuals had been involved in sham foreign
exchange transactions totalling ADollars 66.5m (Pounds 33m). The purpose of
these transactions, it was claimed, was to transfer money from Elders to
companies connected to Mr Allan Hawkins, the now-jailed New Zealand
businessman.
The prosecution relied in large part on the testimony of Mr Ken Jarrett,
another former Elders executive, who was orginally charged alongside Mr
Elliott but subsequently pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and agreed to
give evidence against his former boss. Mr Hicks, in his ruling, acknowledged
Mr Jarrett was a self-confessed perjurer and had a motive for minimising
involvement in the sham. However, he also said Mr Jarrett did not appear to
be a manipulative and cunning liar, but a reliable and honest witness.

FT  10 DEC 94 / US to cut weapons funding by Dollars 7.7bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, yesterday announced substantial cuts
in several big weapons systems under development in the US. The move will
save Dollars 7.7bn (Pounds 4.9bn) over five years, although Mr Perry said
the cuts would have been Dollars 20bn if President Bill Clinton had not
recently increased overall military funding by Dollars 25bn.
The most significant casualty is the Tri-Service Stand-Off Attack Missile
which has been cancelled. TSSAM was being developed by Northrop Grumman and
was to have produced the next generation of ground-hugging cruise missiles
which incorporate radar-avoiding stealth technology.
The Boeing Bell Comanche scout helicopter for the US army also took a direct
hit. Two prototypes of the Comanche will be built, but there are no funds in
the budget for its production.
Other programmes were also affected. The number of Aegis cruiser ship radar
systems will be cut from 18 to 16, the third New Generation hunter-killer
attack submarine is being put back by a year, and funding for the F-22
stealth fighter programme is being trimmed slightly in 1996. However, these
cuts do not threaten any of the projects and represent only a small setback
for the companies involved. The air force and Lockheed had seen securing
funding for the Dollars 71bn F-22 programme as a priority.
Several programmes were unaffected by the cuts. The V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor -
a cross between a helicopter and a turbo-prop aircraft - will continue. The
Osprey had won strong congressional backing and was the most important new
system wanted for transporting marine corps troops to battle zones.
A new army battlefield artillery system and the Joint-Service Primary
Aircraft Trainer system (JPATs) also emerged unscathed.
The cuts follow a leaked memo from Mr John Deutch, deputy defence secretary,
earlier this year which questioned the cost of the 10 most expensive
equipment development programmes.
The Pentagon has decided to put more resources into keeping its current
forces at a high state of readiness, rather than spending on modernisation.
Only the increased funding provided by Mr Clinton prevented several more
high-profile programmes being axed, provoking suggestions that the
administration was unwilling to see defence industry cuts on the scale which
would have been required.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Britain and France firm on Bosnia

Britain and France, the two powers with the most troops in Bosnia, yesterday
reassured their EU partners they would resist pressure to 'cut and run' from
the war-ravaged region.
Although Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, warned at the EU summit in
Essen that the 23,000-strong UN peacekeeping force could be forced to
withdraw in 'a matter of weeks' unless the Bosnian Serbs accepted the UN-EU
peace plan, there was still a strong consensus yesterday that a diplomatic
solution could be found in Bosnia.
Mr Hurd and his French counterpart, Mr Alain Juppe, both gave assurances to
Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and other EU partners who have despatched
troops to Bosnia.
Fears of a collapse of the UN peacekeeping effort grew this week after
renewed Bosnian Serb aggression and US confirmation that it was willing to
supply more than 20,000 troops to assist in a forced withdrawal. The US
offer matched Nato contingency planning, but it could also spur calls in the
new US Congress for a lifting of the UN arms embargo against the Bosnian
Moslem government.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, the summit host, was determined to
maintain a consensus within the EU in favour of a diplomatic solution. This
approach was confirmed, albeit with difficulty, at a meeting a week ago of
the contact group on Bosnia - France, Germany, Russia, the UK and the US.
Mr Hurd is pinning his hopes on a three-point plan which relies heavily on
President Slobodan Milosevic, the erstwhile aggressor, putting pressure on
his former Bosnian Serb allies to accept a settlement. The plan involves:
An early ceasefire, particularly in the besieged Moslem enclave of Bihac.
Acceptance by the Bosnian Serb assembly in Pale that the Serbs occupy 51 per
cent of Bosnia and the Moslems 49. Further land swaps between the Serbs and
Moslems, perhaps trading Serbian gains in eastern Bosnia with a
consolidation of Moslem territory around Sarajevo.
The aim would be to create a confederation between the Bosnian Serbs and the
Serbian government in Belgrade which would have a 'parallel special
relationship' with the confederation already established between the Bosnian
Moslems and the Croats.
France and the UK are hoping President Milosevic will simply bypass his
former ally, Mr Radovan Karadzic, and win over the majority in Pale. Mr Hurd
has been in regular contact with Mr Milosevic in the past few days,
according to British officials.
Both countries were last night pressing European partners not to issue a
strong summit statement attacking Serbian aggression for fear of
destabilising Mr Milosevic. Laura Silber adds from Belgrade: A UN relief
convoy yesterday reached besieged Moslems in the Bihac enclave, for the
first time in more than two months as artillery and mortar attacks
intensified. Serbs from Croatia yesterday finally allowed the passage of 90
tonnes of emergency food aid.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): The moment of truth is approaching
 -Big change, including full disclosure of charges, are imminent / Life
insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
    By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the life insurance sector was being advised by one of its own sales
agents, one of the first items to check would be that it had an income
protection plan in place. The difficulty might be finding an acceptable
premium to cover the short-term risk, given the industry's immediate past
record.
As the chart shows, shares in the quoted life sector have already been
underperforming the FT-SE-A All-Share index for more than a year. But this
sector does not give a full picture of the industry.
Although it includes two of the giants - Prudential and Legal &amp; General -
others, such as Norwich Union and Standard Life, do not feature because they
are mutual organisations owned by their policyholders.
It also excludes such subsidiaries as Allied Dunbar, which is owned by BAT
Industries, and Barclays Life, which is part of the Barclays Bank group.
Neither of these is quoted separately, and nor are the life operations of
composite insurers.
Yet, even if the picture is not a full one, it does not mislead in
indicating that the industry as a whole has been finding life hard over the
past year or so. And the sector knows it must face fresh uncertainties in
the coming months.
From January, there will be new rules requiring life companies and
independent advisers to give customers more information about policies,
charges and commissions. These rules are expected to have a short-term,
disruptive impact on sales, although the longer-term implications for new
business are harder to read.
Some results for life insurers themselves, however, are already becoming
clear. Over the past few months, company after company has announced
re-structuring of policies, cuts in costs, or changes in paying sales agents
and advisers.
Sun Alliance today becomes the latest to announce a new range of policies to
be sold from January in response to the new rules. It is introducing nine
new products, including six personal pensions with a common core and
intended to be simpler and more flexible than present policies. (The company
is keen to build up its pensions business, where its market share is low
compared with its other sales areas.)
One aim of the changes is to provide customers with better value if they
have to stop making payments early in what should be a long-term policy.
This is one of the elements highlighted by the new rules.
The improved value is achieved by spreading the commission paid to the sales
agent more evenly over the duration of the policy, rather than taking all
the charges from the initial payments as often happens now. This cuts
sharply how much can be invested early on, and so reduces the amount
building up in a fund for the customer.
Take a man of 36 who buys a Pounds 200 a month Sun Alliance personal pension
plan now with the aim of retiring at 60. He would get only Pounds 1,392 -
scarcely more than half of the amount he had paid - if he decided to
transfer out of the policy after two years. Under the new arrangements, he
would get Pounds 4,710.
Life companies hope that higher surrender values will not lead to early
lapses of long-term policies. Instead, one theory is that larger amounts
invested early on should mean higher values as well when the policy matures.
Sun Alliance's plans differ in some ways from the route taken by Standard
Life, which believes that customers will be ready to accept a slight dip in
maturity values as the price for higher early surrender values. But Standard
has sought to minimise this aspect by cutting its own margins so that, in
some cases, the maturity values for the new policies are slightly higher
despite the change.
While companies are adopting various approaches to improving surrender
values, at least one aspect of Sun Alliance's plans reflect themes common
across the sector.
The company says it will move straight to meeting the entire range of
disclosure requirements from January, even though companies need not bring
in all of them until the summer.
Last week, the Prudential also announced it would give each customer full
information at the start, and many other companies are taking the same
stance. But it might be a mistake to see this as a rush of altruism: making
one change to computer systems is cheaper and less disruptive than three
successive ones.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Over-stretched Orange turns into a
lemon - County's bankruptcy shock raises the ugly spectre of recession /
Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is Wall Street predicting a recession, and could the Orange County
investment debacle bring such an eventuality nearer? This might seem an odd
question given that the US economy is growing at an impressive 4 per cent a
year; that corporate earnings are strong; that the labour market is as close
to full employment as it is ever likely to get; and that Orange County's
problems, serious as they are, are likely to be confined to the
once-prosperous municipality which occupies a few thousand square miles of
southern California.
Yet, judging from the performance of financial markets this week, traders
and investors appear to be anticipating a sharp slowdown in economic growth
early next year, and quite possibly a slide into recession before the end of
1995. Also, some commentators on Wall Street believe the Orange County
crisis could inflict serious damage on both investor and consumer
confidence, hastening the onset of recession.
To take the markets' economic forecast first. One of the most revealing
developments of the past few weeks has been the flattening of the yield
curve. The curve, a graphical depiction of the yields on securities with
varying maturities, has been flattening rapidly because yields on short-term
government paper have been rising, while yields on long-term paper have been
falling. In the past week alone, the difference (or 'spread') between yields
on two-year notes and 30-year bonds has narrowed from 60 basis points (each
basis point is one hundredth of a per cent) to 35 basis points, its lowest
level since mid-1990.
The curve is flattening because investors are buying long-term government
securities in the belief that the Federal Reserve's aggressive tightening of
monetary policy this year will keep inflationary pressures in check by
engineering a sharp deceleration in economic growth in 1995. At the same
time, investors are selling short-term securities because they are worried
about the possibility that the Fed will initiate another increase in
short-term interest rates soon,
If the trend of selling at the short end of the bond market and buying at
the long end continues, the yield curve will be flat before the end of the
year - and a flat yield curve, as analysts have been quick to point out,
occurs typically when the bond market sees recession ahead.
None of this has escaped the attention of the stock market, where share
prices remain under pressure as investors increasingly become concerned
about the outlook for economic and corporate earnings growth. In the first 4
1/2 trading days of this week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more
than 75 points, or 2 per cent, and broader measures of the market -
particularly the indices of small-capitalisation stocks - suffered even
larger losses. The traditional December rally in share prices now looks more
unlikely than ever.
Adding to the market's tribulations has been the bankruptcy of Orange
County, California, the fifth largest county in the US and - until this
week, at least - one of the wealthiest. In the strictest terms, the county's
woes are not the stock market's problem. Orange's finances are in a mess
because it borrowed billions of dollars and invested them in a range of
fixed-income securities (and some derivatives) in the expectation that
interest rates would remain low.
The sharp rise in rates destroyed that strategy. Now, the value of the
county's portfolio has fallen sharply and it cannot meet its debt
obligations. This week, Wall Street firms which had lent money to Orange
rushed to sell more than Dollars 7bn in securities which they had held as
collateral against the loans. Although this fire sale created considerable
unrest in the bond market - and, in some cases, depressed prices and raised
yields - there was no direct impact on share prices.
The crisis, however, had a noticeable impact on investor sentiment. The
bankruptcy filing by Orange was by far the largest of its kind in the
history of local government in the US. Concern has grown on Wall Street that
other counties or cities may have pursued similar highly-leveraged
investment strategies which could lead to further bankruptcies. A meltdown
of municipal finances would hit local economies hard and worsen the expected
nation-wide slowdown in business activity next year.
The Orange County debacle is likely to overshadow the market into the new
year and at least one leading Wall Street economist, Michael Metz of
Oppenheimer, believes it is a watershed, the beginning of the end of what he
called 'financial buccaneering' in America. By buccaneering, he means the
excessive use of leverage, the use of complex derivatives for speculation,
and the high-risk strategies of hedge funds.
While an end to these activities may not necessarily be bad for the stock
market, or even the economy, Wall Street has made a lot of money from them,
and would be loath to let them go.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Batten down for a bear to beware -
The end of a 19-year bull market / In the Pink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BOB BECKMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a widespread view, particularly among analysts in the US, that
global equity markets have entered a bear market phase. Obviously, that
conclusion is a consequence of the sell-off in markets that began early this
year.
Certainly, 1994 was a bear market year, although that hindsight observation
is not particularly useful unless it provides insights as to what the future
might hold. In this respect, it would be appropriate to consider the
historical behaviour and functions of bear markets.
A cursory glance at the price movements of the FT-30 share index since
January 1975 would suggest that the 1994 sell-off in the UK equity market is
no different from any of the other market declines seen over the duration of
this 19-year-long bull market.
In fact, it can be seen readily that the fall in share prices since the peak
of the FT-SE index of 3,539.2, reached on February 3 this year, has been far
less severe than a number of the market slides that have punctuated the long
bull market.
The most important observation is that the fall in share prices that began
on February 3 1994 is distinctly different, in two major respects, from any
of the market falls that took place since January 1975. The first is the
duration of the sell-off.
A bull market is characterised by rising peaks and troughs over the price
cycle. Since February 1994, there has been a pattern of descending peaks and
troughs for a longer period than that of any interruption experienced by the
bull market since it began.
Second, both institutional and private investors have, for most of the past
19 years, been more afraid of missing the next upswing than of exposure to a
severe decline. In recent months, investors have been more scared of
exposure to a serious decline than missing the next upswing.
All financial markets have a tendency to over-shoot historic valuation
levels. The function of a bear market is to correct the excesses in the
over-shoot occurring during the bull market, restoring values ultimately to
an historic equilibrium.
The number of index points and the time it takes to restore proximity to a
valuation equilibrium - plus an under-valuation 'over-shoot' - determines
the duration and amplitude of any subsequent bear market.
The duration normally is related to the duration of the bull market, the
excesses of which it is acting to correct. Likewise, the amplitude usually
is related to the amount of ground covered during the the previous bull
market which led to excessive over-valuations.
Historically, bear markets tend to correct one to two thirds of the gains
made during the previous bull market. When a bull market becomes a 'bubble
market' - as happened to the Japanese and Hong Kong equity markets, plus
several newly-emerging markets - a bear market reduction of around 80 to 90
per cent of the peak values achieved by these markets has become the
historical norm.
Over the past 19 years, investors have had one of the longest and strongest
bull markets in stock exchange history. Empirical evidence suggests it would
not be unreasonable to expect the bear market that began in February 1994 to
be one of the longest and deepest ever experienced. (The longest and deepest
known in the UK so far was that between May l972 and January 1976 which
slashed more than 73 per cent from the value of the FT-30).
During the course of the bear market, investors will be tempted to look to
foreign markets - where bear market conditions may not appear to prevail -
for better investment opportunities. But I believe this could be fruitless.
Bear markets in the US, UK, Germany, Italy, France and other countries are
likely to trace a pattern of commonality that is more pronounced than usual
due to the Dollars 12,000bn derivatives market, where we find the tail
wagging the dog of the cash market.
Several studies have noted that even though derivatives themselves may not
be a source of systemic risk, it is likely that they have increased the
integration of global markets, acting to transmit a shock that occurs in one
area to other markets and institutions.
Those who subscribe to my analysis will no doubt be in a quandary as to
where they should invest. The most logical choice for inveterate equity
investors during a bear market are the counter-cyclical groups.
During previous bear markets, the counter-cyclical groups have been the
entertainment industry, foods, wines, spirits, tobaccos and Australian
mining shares. During the 1972-1975 bear markets, the counter-cyclical group
was the gold mining sector. During this bear market, I believe it will be
the biotechnology industry.
For those who are not inveterate equity investors, bond markets look
extremely tempting. It might come as a surprise, but they are not linked
inextricably to equity markets. The biggest bull run in bond markets was in
the US during the 1930s' depression.
Yields in the UK have been over 8 per cent. At 8 per cent compound interest,
the investor doubles his money every nine years and is exposed to virtually
no risk if the plan is to purchase at, or below, par and hold government
bonds to maturity. In the real world of investment, very few investors
double their money every nine years with any consistency.
Investment profits are a lot like sex: a lot of people think there is an
awful lot of it going around and somebody, somewhere, is getting a share
that they should be getting. The truth is that there isn't that much going
around and nobody is really getting much of a share at all.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): After the turmoil, it wasn't all
bad - A week of political drama / London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most embarrassing parliamentary defeat for a British government in
years; a half point rise in interest rates; and an emergency mini-Budget. In
short, a state of political turmoil which might seem guaranteed to sow
despondency in the stock market.
Yet, London's initial response to the drama played out at Westminster this
week was remarkably sanguine - certainly, far more so than the bout of
bearishness which suddenly overtook the equity market yesterday.
The measured reaction to prime minister John Major's problems is perhaps
understandable: a substantial degree of political risk must have been
factored into share prices long before this week's alarums, given Labour's
enormous opinion poll lead. And while Major's humiliation by Conservative
party rebels in Tuesday night's fuel VAT vote makes the government look
extremely weak, Labour's opinion poll strength means Tory rebels will hardly
be keen to force an early general election.
At the same time, the market still generally likes the government's handling
of the economy. This week's increase in base rates might have been prompted
in part by a need to calm City nerves over politics, but many analysts also
regarded it as justified purely on economic policy grounds.
The economy is growing at more than 4 per cent a year, which is probably
unsustainable over the long run. And while inflation is at its lowest point
in 27 years - several companies reporting results this week welcomed a
recent softening of commodity prices, which rose sharply earlier this year -
the government, by raising rates now, could have nipped incipient
inflationary pressures in the bud.
A solid rally yesterday in gilts - the market which is probably most
sensitive to political risk - suggests that the equity sector's end-of-week
nervousness originated in large measure from the mood on Wall Street, which
has tended to dominate sentiment on both sides of the Atlantic for most of
this year.
The US debt and equity markets were rattled this week by the bankruptcy of
Orange County, California, the fifth largest county in the nation, after a
change in the direction of interest rates exposed it to at least Dollars
1.5bn of losses from investments in complex securities. Nerves were also
frayed by an announcement from Fidelity Investments' Magellan fund,
America's biggest mutual fund, that it would not make a year-end
distribution to investors, because of US tax-accounting rules.
A sharp fall on Wall Street late on Thursday thus set a negative tone for
London yesterday, and the FT-SE 100 index closed down 40 points on the week.
Against these bearish forces, London gained some heart from an announcement
on Thursday that SG Warburg, Britain's pre-eminent investment bank, was in
merger discussions with Morgan Stanley, one of Wall Street's leading
investment banks.
Warburg's share price, which had been rising for some days on bid rumours,
shot up on the news, which also sent other quoted UK investment banks and
brokers - such as Schroders, Kleinwort Benson and Smith New Court - sharply
higher.
Analysts suggested that if Warburg - Britain's leading contender as a global
investment bank and with a strong presence in the main markets around the
world - felt it necessary to link with a large foreign ally, then the rest
of the independent UK securities sector would also have to think along
similar lines. It could, in other words, mark the second stage of London's
Big Bang - the first being the round of mergers in the mid-1980s which
accompanied the abolition of fixed commissions.
The more immediate question is whether the Warburg-Morgan Stanley marriage
plans will be consummated. The two companies look a good fit in terms of
relative product and geographical strengths, but there is some overlap which
is bound to lead to redundancies. And the melding of investment banking
cultures is notoriously hard to pull off - as Big Bang I demonstrated.
These cultural difficulties mean that it would be hard for a rival bidder to
launch a hostile offer for Warburg, but other leading foreign houses may
weigh an approach to the bank with a friendly offer above the price which
emerges in any eventual agreement with Morgan Stanley. The present plan is
to create a new holding company which would, presumably, offer shares in
exchange for existing Warburg and Morgan Stanley equity.
The week also marked the debut of British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite
television group, which floated this month through a successful offer for
sale. Its shares opened for trading on Thursday at an 11p premium to the
256p price at which its offer was fixed.
But shares in submarine manufacturer VSEL dived on Wednesday when Michael
Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission bids for the company from both British Aerospace and
General Electric. The two offers now face three months of close scrutiny.
The decision surprised the City, which had expected both bids to be cleared.
But analysts' calculations were upset by the insistence of the Office of
Fair Trading - which advises the government on competition policy - that
GEC's bid should be referred since it already owns Britain's other large
warship-maker, Yarrow, on the river Clyde.
Heseltine referred the BAe bid on grounds of 'public interest involving
national security,' a vague phrase which seemed designed to head off the
storm which would accompany the referral of the GEC bid alone. A touch of
expediency, in other words, in a week in which it was singularly lacking on
the Tory benches.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Delors' competition plan finds favour - even with UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ESSEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Industrialists' ambitions to wield greater influence over European Union
policies and legislation which affect their fortunes were given a
substantial political boost at the opening session of the summit yesterday.
A proposal to establish an international council of expert advisers on
competitiveness, tabled by Mr Jacques Delors, outgoing Commission president,
was given an unexpectedly warm welcome by EU leaders.
Although Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, appeared uneasy about
allowing too intimate a link between ministers and commerce, Mr Delors'
suggestion of a six-person 'advisory council' was generally accepted as an
important element in an emergent policy to address the European economy's
structural difficulties.
A similarly enthusiastic endorsement was awarded to Monday's agreement among
finance and economic ministers on guidelines for improving conditions in the
labour market.
According to a senior Commission official, the European leaders were
demonstrating increased sensitivity to the argument that a cyclical economic
recovery would not generate enough jobs to have a significant impact on the
European Union's jobless total of 17m. 'I was really quite surprised to see
how consensual it all was,' he said.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, for once enthusiastic about a
suggestion from the Commission president, urged that the summit should agree
on the spot to set up its 'advisory board on European competitiveness'. In
return, Commission officials said, Mr Delors offered some flattering remarks
on progress made in Britain on stimulating employment.
German officials, however, said the proposed 'council for global
competitiveness' had first to be discussed in the council of ministers.
Mr Delors' outline idea is that a group of six people, comprising
experienced business leaders with international experience and possibly an
eminent economics expert, should be appointed to advise EU ministers on ways
of competing effectively with newly-industrialised countries.
Although UK officials claimed the notion was spawned at talks between Mr
Major and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany this spring, it bears a striking
resemblance to a series of proposals from Unice, the European employers'
association, and the European Round Table, a group representing 40
multinationals based in the EU.
Unice's appeal last month called for a 12-member advisory group of
industrialists, labour representatives and academics which would 'act as a
watchdog by subjecting policy proposals and new regulations to the test of
international competitiveness'.
Any suggestion that an outside group be allowed such influence over the
formulation of legislation is certain to rouse resistance, not least in
Germany. Britain, meanwhile, appeared eager yesterday to establish a team
which would be invited to scrutinise draft legislation and offer advice on
the basis of its potential impact on business.
However, the lack of any fundamental disagreement among the governments of
the Twelve that European competitiveness is failing, suggests that some sort
of international benchmarking group will be established.
Benchmarking is a technique in which a manufacturer or service provider
examines globally available products, identifies the best according to a
wide range of cost and performance criteria, and adapts its own methods to
compete.
Britain also claimed the lion's share of the credit for this week's package
of labour market measures approved by economics and finance ministers on
Monday.
The ideas, including increased wage flexibility, more mobile labour forces,
more training, lower indirect labour costs and restructured social benefit
systems, and special measures for the long-term jobless all stemmed from the
UK, London officials claimed.
One reason for the popularity of such notions is that they impose far lower
burdens on tight national budgets than traditional work creation schemes.
They are becoming particularly popular in Germany, where the government is
under intense pressure from the Bundesbank to rein in spending.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Move to end transport funding dispute

The European Commission yesterday moved to end a dispute with European Union
ministers over funding for multi-billion dollar road and rail links in an
effort to sharpen EU competitiveness.
Under pressure from France, which is keen to press ahead with a fast rail
link to Belgium and Germany, the Commission said it would be willing to draw
down a further Ecu1.2bn (Pounds 932m) of EU budget reserves to supplement
the Ecu1.9bn already allocated to the 14 infrastructure projects under the
Union's high profile Trans European Networks programme.
Mr Henning Christophersen, the commissioner responsible for economic and
monetary affairs, said there were no objections to the proposal from member
states as it would not increase the overall EU budget.
'There are many difficulties we can expect as far as financing these
projects is concerned,' said Mr Christophersen, after talking to EU heads of
state at the European summit in Essen. 'One difficulty will be a lack of
equity.'
The decision to draw on extra funds may go some way to easing tensions
between Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, and economics and
finance ministers of the member states. Mr Delors has persistently argued
that without extra public funding, many of the projects will not get off the
ground.
His will, however, has been frustrated by the more cautious economics
ministers who believe sufficient resources already exist - from existing EU
funds, national exchequers, loans from the European Investment Bank and the
private sector. They were worried that excessive EU borrowing would create
inflationary pressures and unsettle financial markets.
'Mr Delors believes that for infrastructure projects, free enterprise is not
always enough,' said a Commission official.
To secure the extra resources for the Ecu91bn projects, the Commission must
be asked formally to put forward a proposal to the council of ministers.
'Some member states have asked if we can have additional resources. My
answer is Yes if the European council asks us to do so,' said Mr
Christophersen.
A working group headed by Mr Christophersen has identified 14 priority
projects. These include high-speed rail links from Paris to Strasbourg and
Munich to Berlin; a rail-road tunnel through the Brenner pass in Italy;
motorway routes between Lisbon in Portugal and Valladolid in Spain; the
Channel tunnel link and development of Milan's Malpensa airport.
After talks on the Trans European Networks programme, European heads of
state backed a report drawn up by experts from across the Union. This report
also proposes adoption of 10 international energy network projects plus
pan-European air traffic control measures.
So far, financing is only in place for three of the 14 priority projects.
These are the airport at Milan, the Cork-Dublin-Belfast-Stranraer rail link
and a fixed road and rail link between Denmark and Sweden.
The Commission has meanwhile received requests for funding of more than
Ecu2bn for three other of the listed projects, including a high-speed train
linking Paris, Brussels, Cologne, Amsterdam and London. Reluctant to
encourage further EU borrowing, Mr Christophersen has argued that member
states should find more imaginative and more efficient financial
arrangements.
Financing is not always the principal reason for delay in the other areas.
Administrative problems and different regulatory programmes between member
states have also acted as a hindrance. Mr Christophersen's report says
governments must work to change regulations that hinder development and to
ensure co-ordination to avoid basic problems such as different electrical
systems.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Siemens forced to close key uranium plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Siemens, the German electronics, power and engineering group, said yesterday
it was being forced to close its important uranium processing plant at
Hanau, near Frankfurt, as licensing standards required by the left-wing
state government of Hesse had made it unprofitable.
Hanau is one of three plants worldwide where Siemens processes uranium. The
work would be transferred to other sites within the company or awarded to
outside contractors, the company said.
'We want to remain one of the world's leaders in fuel assembly,' Siemens
said. 'We just want to put the business on a profitable footing.'
The closure is a blow for the German nuclear lobby and comes just ahead of
difficult talks to decide on how Germany's power generation mix is
structured between nuclear, coal and other sources. The talks were broken
off in October 1993 without a decision on the future of nuclear power in
Germany.
The Bonn government and the country's three large electricity utilities  -
RWE, Veba and Bayernwerk - are determined to retain nuclear power, which
accounts for about 30 per cent of the country's electricity, as a key
element in the national energy production plan.
However, the Hesse government, which is run by a coalition between the
Social Democrat party (SPD) and the environmentalist Greens, is just the
noisiest of several SPD-controlled Lander which have been calling for an end
to nuclear power in Germany.
As the SPD now controls the Bundesrat, the upper chamber of the federal
parliament which must approve any outcome from the energy talks, the
forthcoming round may be more difficult than usual.
The Hanau decision has no direct implications for the battle over Gorleben,
the controversial nuclear waste disposal site in Lower Saxony, but it is
likely to throw the nuclear lobby further on to the defensive.
The decision to close Hanau was taken recently, a spokesman said, but was
part of a wider restructuring programme begun earlier this year in an effort
to return the fuel assembly business of Siemens' power generation division,
KWU, to profit. KWU is suffering big losses because of growing competition
and falling prices.
The Hanau site had the capacity to process up to 1,200 tonnes of enriched
uranium fuel rods into pellets for re-use in fuels rods. However, pellet
production was suspended last summer and since then the plant merely
assembled pellets produced in the US.
Siemens said Hanau would be formally closed by September 30 1995, with the
loss of about 250 jobs,
KWU supplies fuel to 49 nuclear power plants around the world.
A spokesman said the other reprocessing plant, at Lingen in Lower Saxony,
was working at capacity and that other work would be transferred to a third
plant at Richland, Washington.
Yesterday's decision will not affect another plant at Hanau which will
reprocess plutonium into mixed-oxide fuel elements, but which the Hesse
government is also seeking to block.
'Work will be continued with the approval of the German utilities,' Siemens
said.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Major presses for drive against fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ESSEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday pressed his partners to agree a new drive against
fraud, arguing that mismanagement, waste and criminal activities were
undermining popular faith in the European Union.
Speaking in the wake of the recent political rows in Britain about the level
of fraud, the UK prime minister called for an increased role for the
Brussels Commission in scrutinising expenditure.
In a presentation to the summit which drew approval from a number of other
EU governments, including the Netherlands, Luxembourg and the new Nordic
entrants, Mr Major called for the summit to give political impetus also to a
draft regulation to protect the Union's financial interests. The council of
ministers meanwhile should conclude rapidly a legally binding instrument
against criminal fraud.
Mr Jacques Santer, the incoming president of the European Commission, is
expected to make tight financial management a priority when he takes over
from Mr Jacques Delors in January. The precise extent of fraud is an unknown
proportion of the annual Ecu65bn (Pounds 51bn) budget but the bulk is
concentrated in the common agricultural policy.
Calling for the summit to endorse further work by finance ministers to
reduce both waste and fraud, Mr Major said that member states should be
required to report individually to the finance council on the action they
were taking to protect EU funds.
In proposals likely to be endorsed in the summit's final communique, he
called also for more vigorous use of its powers by the Court of Auditors and
more intense scrutiny of financial arrangements by the European Parliament.
Mr Major's hopes of a concerted drive to reduce the level of fraud have been
strengthened by signs that France intends also to make it a central issue
during its presidency of the EU.
The Paris government, which takes over the presidency next month, intends to
ask the commission to draw up an inventory of all breaches of existing EU
laws and to attach to all future draft EU legislation clauses specifying the
sanctions to be used for breaking it.
The intention is to ensure the even and proper enforcement of EU laws.
Mr Alain Lamassoure, French EU affairs minister, said that investigations
into the same fraud covering several states had shown that some countries
were very strict while others showed complicity towards fraudsters.
Companies operating in stricter states were placed at a competitive
disadvantage.
Despite his broad welcome for the French initiative, however, Mr Major is
likely to be cautious about the possibility that the union-wide action
proposed by Mr Lamassoure might reduce national powers to decide
punishments.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Italy faces EU telecoms investigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission believes the last Italian government may have
discriminated in favour of the state-owned telecommunications company by
making competitors pay for the right to operate the country's second digital
mobile telephone network.
Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, said yesterday that
Brussels was planning to extend its investigation into the liberalisation of
Italian mobile telecommunications to cover the award of the mobile phone
contract in March.
A Commission spokesman said yesterday that Mr Van Miert was concerned that
Sip, the state telecoms operator which is now part of Telecom Italia, paid
nothing for the right to build the country's first, small, digital network.
The international consortium Omnitel-Pronto Italia, which is headed by
Olivetti, the Italian computer company, paid L750bn (Pounds 296m) for the
second digital licence.
Yesterday's comments by Mr Van Miert indicate that Brussels is likely to
take a hard line if the government grants any further concessions to Telecom
Italia.
Telecom Italia wants the government to relax regulation of the existing
national analogue network, over which it has a monopoly. The company wants
the freedom to set prices on the analogue network, allowing it to compete
directly with Omnitel on all mobile phone services. Telecom Italia is also
seeking a reduction in the annual fee it pays the government.
The ministers concerned are to debate Telecom Italia's demands on Thursday.
The analogue service is only available to subscribers in Italy, whereas
subscribers to the digital network can use their mobile phones in many other
European countries which have adopted the 'GSM' standard.
Yesterday, the company broke its silence on the issue, warning that if the
government maintained the current tariff system, the long-term investment
Telecom Italia had made in the analogue network would be jeopardised. The
company also implied that such a decision would have repercussions on the
forthcoming privatisation of its state-controlled parent company, Stet.
Yesterday's statement by the Telecom Italia board was a direct reaction to a
letter to ministers this week from Mr Giuliano Amato, former Italian prime
minister and now head of the country's antitrust authority, warning that he
might have to intervene if Telecom Italia won concessions on tariffs.
The political sensitivity of the issue is heightened by the fact that in
winning the licence Omnitel outbid a consortium which included Fiat and
Fininvest, the media business owned by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, who is now
Italy's prime minister. He has deliberately taken no part in the cabinet
discussions on the terms of the licence.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Setback for Deutsche Telekom as chief quits two years early
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Helmut Ricke, chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, said yesterday he was
quitting two years early, dealing a severe blow to the company's hopes of
making a smooth move to privatisation.
Deutsche Telekom said Mr Ricke was leaving next month for 'personal reasons'
and declined to give further details. Mr Wilhelm Pallman, a board member,
will take over temporarily but the company said it had begun the search for
a new chief executive.
Mr Ricke's departure will leave Deutsche Telekom without its top executive
at arguably the most important moment in its history, as it changes from a
state-owned monopoly to a leading private telecoms operator. The company,
due to become a joint stock company on January 1, will then be partially
privatised through a DM15bn (Pounds 6.1bn) sale of shares early in 1996.
Just two weeks ago the company unveiled an international consortium -
including some of the world's leading investment banks - to manage the
placement of shares, one of the largest issues ever undertaken.
Officials suggested Mr Ricke was unhappy that Deutsche Telekom's new 10-man
supervisory board, appointed this week by the government, included five
political appointments. Mr Ricke, they said, had been pushing for Deutsche
Telekom to be as free from political influence as possible in the run-up to
privatisation.
Mr Ricke said in a recent interview with the Financial Times that his
contract had been renewed earlier this year and he would stay until the end
of 1996 to complete the job he began five years ago.
However, a series of setbacks recently is believed to have disheartened the
58-year-old chief executive.
Last month the European Commission refused to approve MSG, a three-way
venture between Deutsche Telekom, the media group Bertelsmann and
KirchGruppe, one of Europe's biggest private television companies, because
of fears it would dominate the pay television market.
It is also still unclear if Brussels will approve the strategic alliance
between Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom, the French state-owned
operator. There was no suggestion that Mr Ricke's sudden departure was
connected with press reports this week alleging that several thousand
Deutsche Telekom employees were working with criminal gangs to syphon off
the charges from overseas phone calls.
Deutsche Telekom has had little luck with recent senior appointments. Mr
Dieter Gallist, the board member who dealt with private clients, died
earlier this year, and Mr Horst Gellert, responsible for corporate clients,
is leaving to take charge of Detecon, a subsidiary.
Mr Ricke previously worked for Loewe Opta, a leading manufacturer of
telecoms equipment, and had been appointed because he was the only
representative of medium-sized business on a Telekom advisory council.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Ulster talks face arms hurdle: Debate on IRA guns dominates
historic Sinn Fein meeting with government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN

<DATELINE>
   STORMONT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The decommissioning of the IRA's huge stockpile of weapons emerged yesterday
as the crucial issue that has to be resolved to keep the Northern Ireland
peace process on track.
Although historic exploratory talks between the UK government and Sinn Fein,
the political wing of the IRA, were seen as constructive, sharp differences
emerged over the timing of the disposal of IRA arms and explosives.
After the first public talks between UK officials and Sinn Fein in 25 years
of troubles, the two sides appeared on a collision course. The government
insisted that the decommissioning of the IRA's arsenal would be a condition
to Sinn Fein being allowed to enter all-party talks on the future of Ulster.
Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland political affairs minister, said
after a briefing by Mr Quentin Thomas, head of the UK's five-man delegation,
that 'their continued retention will constitute a barrier to other political
parties, as well as to the government itself, in joining with Sinn Fein in
substantive political negotiations'.
The minister warned that if the talks are 'to be taken to a successful
conclusion, then the question of the decommissioning of arms must be
resolved to satisfaction'.
Nevertheless, he called the meeting 'constructive and business-like' while
Mr Martin McGuinness, leading the five-strong Sinn Fein delegation, said it
was 'a good beginning'.
Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, however, warned the government that it
should not place conditions on the talks process. 'History will judge the
British badly if they make excuses for not moving the peace process
forward,' he said.
The exploratory meeting at the former Northern Ireland parliament building
at Stormont Castle in Belfast came exactly 100 days after the announcement
of the IRA ceasefire.
Condemned by hardline unionists, the meeting is viewed as an important part
of wider negotiations started by the British and Irish governments, which
aim to bring all the political parties in Ulster into discussions to craft a
constitutional framework for the province.
Mr John Major, who received a report on the meeting at the European Union
summit in Essen, told other EU leaders that contacts with the republicans
were designed to turn a 'ceasefire into a lasting peace'.
He underlined that London and Dublin were close to a framework agreement to
provide the basis for round-table talks on a new political settlement.
Mr Ancram said yesterday's discussion had raised a 'very large areas of
subjects'. Both sides had 'a good trot around the course', he said.
Mr McGuinness, said the talks 'should have happened a long time ago'. The
two sides agreed to meet again on December 19.
Meanwhile, the Ulster Democratic party, one of the loyalist groups invited
to talks next week with UK officials, warned it was reconsidering the
invitation because of the presence at the Stormont meeting of a councillor
from the Irish Republic.
Sinn Fein delegates, who included the Old Bailey bomber Mr Gerry Kelly,
called for an end to British military operations and a speedy release of all
political prisoners. Sinn Fein said these issues should be addressed as a
matter of urgency.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Top jobs to be split in planned Warburg merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley, the investment banks that intend to merge to
form a global bank next year, are to split the chief executive's role in the
new organisation. They will also have an almost evenly balanced board of
directors.
The banks are likely to announce shortly that the board of the new holding
company will have four executive directors from Morgan Stanley, and three
from Warburg, with the banks' chief executives being named as co-presidents.
The structure - under which each bank will nominate three non-executives to
make up a 13-strong board - is likely to be cited by Warburg as evidence
that the merger does not constitute a takeover by Morgan Stanley, the larger
firm.
Morgan Stanley's shareholders are to be offered two-thirds of the equity in
the new firm, with Warburg's shareholders taking the remaining equity. The
banks intend the merger to create the strongest global investment bank.
The chairman of the new holding company is to be Mr Dick Fisher, Morgan
Stanley's chairman, with Sir David Scholey, Warburg's chairman, becoming
vice-chairman. Sir David was to step down from the helm of Warburg next
year.
The co-presidents in charge of the day-to-day running of the firm are to be
Lord Cairns, Warburg's chief executive, and Mr John Mack, Morgan Stanley's
president. Mr Mack was expected by observers to gain a stronger position in
the new firm.
The other executive director to be drawn from Warburg will be Mr Hugh
Stevenson, chairman of Mercury Asset Management, which is 75 per cent owned
by Warburg. Acquisition of MAM is thought to be a prime attraction for
Morgan Stanley because it provides a stable stream of earnings.
Warburg's shareholders yesterday reacted cautiously to the proposed merger,
with many predicting that it would flush out rival offers. The formation of
a joint company means that the premium price from an outside bid will not be
paid. 'On the surface it looks as if Morgan Stanley is getting control of a
damn good business very cheaply,' said one shareholder.
Most institutions believe the move makes strategic sense, but is risky.
'These mergers are an incredibly difficult and dangerous business. With so
much money and so many egos at stake they can go horribly wrong,' said one
shareholder.
The two firms are still working on the management structure of the new bank,
after being forced to disclose the merger talks two weeks early when rumours
in London led to a sharp rise in Warburg shares.
Some Warburg executives believe that they retain a strong measure of
geographical control over European operations in the new bank. although
global responsibility is also likely to be allocated for functions such as
equity broking.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Essen summit agrees on plan to help EU compete
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ESSEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union leaders reached a broad consensus yesterday on measures to
strengthen competitiveness and job creation at a summit overshadowed by the
failure to stop the war in Bosnia.
With the host, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, nudging colleagues toward
areas of co-operation, the summit rallied behind proposals for a new
advisory board on European competitiveness, likely to be headed by a
European business leader.
The focus of the two-day summit in Essen is the German-led strategy for
integrating the former communist countries of central and eastern Europe,
but the opening sessions were devoted to talks on how to compete more
effectively with the US and Japan.
Taking their lead from Chancellor Kohl's pledge to 'move the European Union
forward', summit leaders avoided earlier ideological clashes over
deregulation and labour market mobility. Instead, they balanced pledges to
lift burdens on industry with a commitment to training and action to help
the long-term unemployed.
Senior diplomats said the 'steady as she goes' mood suited leaders, several
of whom are beset by health or political problems. They include President
Francois Mitterrand of France, Mr Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, Mr John Major
of the UK and Mr Albert Reynolds of Ireland, who is leaving office.
The idea for an advisory council on competitiveness was put forward by Mr
Jacques Delors, outgoing president of the European Commission. Mr Delors cut
a serene figure at this 28th European Council summit, despite a flurry of
speculation that he will disclose tomorrow night whether he will enter the
race for the French presidency.
Mr Major warmly praised Mr Delors and supported the Commission's suggestion
of an annual report on member states' progress in tackling unemployment in
Europe, which stands at around 18m.
The mood of harmony grew as leaders backed an Ecu300m (Pounds 236m) aid
package for Northern Ireland to encourage the peace process.
Chancellor Kohl also sought a meeting with Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's prime
minister, to defuse Spanish threats to block the entry of Austria, Sweden
and Finland into the Union next year unless it improves its fishing rights.
Germany also backed Franco-Spanish demands to establish parallel funding for
eastern Europe and the Mediterranean countries, despite reservations by the
UK and the Netherlands.
The discordant note came over Bosnia, with Britain and France warning that
pulling out United Nations peacekeeping troops could lead to a massacre and
a wider war in the Balkans.
Belgium, the Netherlands, and Denmark want the summit to restate strongly a
commitment to keep troops in the region. Britain and France assured their
partners that they would seek to stay as long as possible.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Brave new biotech world - Scientists are
trying to reshape nature. What's in it for investors?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The children of biotech are re-designing life on earth. A clutch of tiny
companies, run by scientists, is creating fantasy products - and gobbling up
capital. Morphosys is selling made-to-order evolution, finding the best
performer from a billion versions of a single molecule. Zylepsis is creating
new foods and cosmetics. GeneCo is breeding pest-resistant crops.
Yet, the typical biotech company makes no profits. Neither has it sales or
revenues. Its health is assessed by calculating the rate at which it is
burning up investors' money, which gives an estimate of the number of months
it can expect to survive.
Why any investor would start watching burn rates - a process akin to
calculating the distance between a lemming and the edge of the cliff - is a
good question. The answer, to judge by the nearly 200 British biotechs that
investors have helped launch in the past decade, lies in the hope that any
one could produce a blockbuster before it burns out.
Since the discovery in 1973 of a way to cut and splice DNA, the molecule
that contains the design code for living organisms, biologists have been
equipped to have a second try at nature. They can eliminate flaws, design
new molecules, and mass-produce those extracted previously from a living
host.
Three big prizes beckon:
The chance to improve food supplies by creating crops that generate higher
yields more quickly, and by growing them in previously hostile conditions.
The promise of crops that no longer give out the biological signals that
attract particular pests to them, so providing an alternative to chemical
pesticides.
The hope that biotechnology could produce cures for a multitude of human and
animal diseases - the biggest prize of all.
These are the dreams. Translating any one of them into reality requires a
team of dedicated scientists, up to 10 years - and close on Pounds 100m.
Even then, failure is possible.
Products for human use must undergo numerous laboratory and animal tests
before clinical trials. Then comes testing on human volunteers (for adverse
side effects), followed by trials on a small sample of those the product is
designed to help (for dosage).
Finally, the product is tested on a much larger sample (for a statistically
significant improvement in their condition).
Products can fail at any of these stages. Even the brightest of estimates
suggests a success rate of less than one-third for products that begin
clinical trials. Others run at closer to one in 10. Of those that do get
through trials, not all will succeed in getting licences from the national
regulatory authorities.
The traditional approach to these risks, taken by the large pharmaceuticals
companies, has been to run a development pipeline supported by an existing
sales stream, providing both funding and a spread of risk. But the
companies, keen to get into biotechnology, have been unable to attract the
scientists they need.
Leading-edge biologists are interested in commercial applications - but not
in trading their autonomy for middle management posts overseeing programmes
ruled by commercial considerations. Preferable by far is the option of
running their own companies and their own programmes, while making the most
of their academic roots through development meetings with university
researchers, or by employing former colleagues as consultants.
As company heads, scientists have been active in setting up technology
transfer agencies to link commercial and university researchers, and a few
have been backed by investors willing to fund academic teams as a way of
gaining access to new ideas. Yet, such a package, while a golden opportunity
for scientists, is a tall order for investors who are backing business
novices in the riskiest of ventures.
In the US, a tradition of wealthy business angels, and the existence of the
Nasdaq stock exchange for young and growing companies, spurred a shower of
biotech start-ups in the 1970s, and a flood during the 1980s.
In the UK, however, things moved more slowly. 'Biotechnology is the
antithesis of attractive investment capital,' says David Leathers, of UK
venture capitalist Abingworth.
The quality of British science, with 12 British or UK-based Nobel prize
winners in biotechnology research since 1970, did eventually attract the
braver venture capitalists. But even this proved insufficient.
In 1992, British Biotech, the UK's leading company in the field, began
urging the London Stock Exchange to accept research and development
companies. It succeeded, with a rule change in December 1993 that opened the
exchange to blue-sky issues based on companies' potential rather than their
track record.
Other biotech concerns have turned to pharmaceutical companies, giving up
some of their production and marketing rights in exchange for development
funds, although some in the industry describe this as giving away the
biotechs' birth-rights. But companies such as Celltech, another leading UK
biotech venture, see themselves as research boutiques rather than future
large-scale manufacturers. For them, the lump-sum payments as they reach
milestones in the development process, and the prospect of royalties, have
been sufficient incentive to enter such collaborations.
The problem for the pharmaceutical giants is knowing which biotech company
to back. Many of them adopt a portfolio approach: backing several promising
research programmes in the hope there is a winner among them. It is,
however, a hit and miss business. In an industry where innovation is
everything, the invention of a more reliable method of picking winning
ventures could be the greatest biotechnological breakthrough of all.

FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Breaking with the inflationary past - The
1990s could yet turn out to be the decade of the bond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five years ago, I wrote an FT article considering the spectacular, but
surely unrepeatable, returns on equities during the 1980s. Later, in a
column in mid-1992 - a quarter of the way through the 1990s - I speculated
on whether this would turn out to be the decade of the fixed-interest bond.
Halfway through the decade, here is an update.
Bonds are indeed still ahead and equities continue to struggle (they have
had a bad week). It looks as though, in 1994, we are heading for the second
year of equity price declines in the 1990s. Investment institutions stuck
with a backward-looking orientation towards equities are grappling with the
problem of whether they should re-shape their fundamental strategies.
Remember that the world's stock markets delivered wonderful returns in the
1980s. For the British investor, the pre-tax total rate of return (dividend
income plus capital growth) averaged 24 per cent annually on UK equities and
about 23 1/2 per cent on overseas stock markets. The average annual return
on UK government bonds was just under 15 per cent  - not bad in itself, but
a yawning 9 per cent short of the return on equities.
Here, though, are the numbers for the 1990s thus far. British government
fixed-interest bonds have returned 11.8 per cent a year against just 9.1 per
cent on the FT-SE-A All-Share index. Globally, the Salomon Brothers World
Government Bond index has returned 9.8 per cent (in dollars) against a
corresponding dollar return on the FT-A World index of no more than 4 per
cent. Even as I calculated them this week the figures were shifting further
in favour of bonds.
The pattern is not yet repeated in the US, however, where the return on the
Standard &amp; Poors 500 index has just beaten the return on US Treasury bonds -
by a margin of 8.6 against 7.8 per cent a year. The reason is that dollar
bonds have taken a much bigger caning than US equities in 1994. But Wall
Street stocks are now looking very fragile.
Why have equities generally proved so disappointing since the end of 1989?
The simple answer is that they became over-valued in the 1980s as investors
chased historical performance without proper regard to reasonable
expectations of potential future returns. This was most obviously true in
Japan.
There has been a serious world recession, too. Economic growth in the OECD
member states has slowed from 2.7 per cent in the 1980s to 1.8 in the 1990s
(although a marked acceleration is under way).
Inflation also has slowed sharply around the world, not least in the UK
where it averaged 6.9 per cent in the 1980s but has fallen recently to the 2
to 3 per cent range. These economic trends generally have been favourable to
bonds, although recent signs of economic over-expansion in the US have hurt
bonds badly.
The failure of equities to generate a higher investment return in recent
years - the so-called 'risk premium' earned normally by investors from risky
rather than safe assets - has led to considerable investment theorising.
Last month, a paper called The Risk Premium on Ordinary Shares was published
by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. In it, David Wilkie discusses the
reasons for the historical existence of an equity risk premium over bond
returns as wide as 7 per cent.
He points out that when actuaries make valuations of pension schemes, they
assume a much lower extra return on equities - of the order of 1 to 2 per
cent. Perhaps that reflects professional caution but, certainly, the 7 per
cent figure is an historical aberration which is related, in broad terms, to
unanticipated post-war inflation and (although Wilkie does not say this) to
the isolation of the British capital markets during a 40-year period of
foreign exchange controls. As for the future, Wilkie thinks it would be
reasonable to expect 3 per cent in the long run.
Such a future pattern of returns, however, could be assumed only from the
starting point of an equilibrium relationship between bond and equity
yields. Recently, though, the yield ratios have looked rather stretched and
equities therefore over-valued, especially in the US, although there has
been a degree of correction within the past two months.
The UK yield ratio has dropped over the past few weeks from 2.3 to 2.1;
this, to my mind, is still too high for a period of low inflation, but
opinions differ. A fall in the ratio towards, say, 1.75 would generate
further outperformance by bonds in the short to medium term. On the other
hand, equity dividends are now growing strongly, which they were not in the
early 1990s, and this is positive for shares.
Certainly, the recent outperformance by bonds can be regarded as exceptional
but it is not necessarily temporary. In UK terms it marks a definite break
with an inflationary past.
This change is putting pressure on investment institutions. The average UK
equity unit trust, for instance, has performed rather worse over the past
five years (when it has returned a modest 6.4 per cent annually) than the
average gilt and fixed interest trust (which has returned 6.9 per cent). But
unit trust companies are geared overwhelmingly to promote equity funds -
which, counting only the UK sectors, are worth Pounds 45.5bn against merely
Pounds 1.5bn for gilt funds.
Similarly, many pension scheme trustees in the UK are wondering about the
level of risks associated with their typical 80 to 85 per cent exposure to
equities. Such an investment strategy might have made sense in the 1980s,
when the equity risk premium was running at 9 per cent, but does not look so
clever when the risk premium temporarily has gone negative and might be only
3 per cent in future.
After five years, we are halfway to the millennium. In the 21st century, you
can bet that equities will again outperform in the long run. But the 1990s
could yet be the decade of the bond.

Ares-Serono, the Geneva-based biotechnology drugs group, has reported a 40
per cent slide in net income in the third quarter to Dollars 8.3m, mainly
because of a surge in research spending.
Sales were flat at Dollars 149.6m, reflecting the group's rapid adjustment
to the removal last year of many of its products from the approved medical
list in the Italian market.
R&amp;D spending rose more than a third to Dollars 35.1m, as the group stepped
up its efforts in developing products in the field of immunology/oncology.
Pre-tax profit fell 40 per cent to Dollars 10.4m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mannesmann Mobilfunk (MMO), Germany's first private mobile telephone
operator, said it would for the first time make a 'significant' profit in
1994, after almost doubling turnover.
The company is also changing its tariff structure next year in an attempt to
capture more of the mass market, a move which it expects to result in a
further big increase in sales.
Its D2 mobile telephone net is expected to have 850,000 subscribers by the
end of the year, up from around 500,000 this time last year.
Turnover in 1994 rose 88 per cent to DM1.7bn (Dollars 1.1bn) from DM902m the
year before. The group would not give any details about likely profits in
1994, but analysts expect them to be between DM100m and DM150m.
Around DM2.4bn has been invested in MMO since the company - a subsidiary of
the Mannesmann engineering group - was started five years ago.
Another DM1.6bn will be invested over the next five years to increase the
capacity of the D2 mobile telephone net, especially in airports and railway
stations where there is an unusually high number of users.
Recently, MMO has taken the battle for the mobile telephone market to its
two competitors, DeTeMobil, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, and E-Plus, a
consortium run by Veba and Thyssen.
Last month, MMO slashed the cost of calls on its D2 network, a move
DeTeMobil was obliged to copy shortly afterwards.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Dominant Republicans cloud Clinton successes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday signed the implementing legislation of the
Uruguay Round - completing the second of three foreign and trade policy
successes which were supposed to end his year on a high note.
However, the Republicans, still buoyant over their takeover of Congress,
have been capturing the daily headlines with their proposals. The effect has
been to marginalise Mr Clinton in both domestic and foreign policy arenas.
A new poll attests to Republican successes. The survey found 41 per cent of
voters approved of Mr Clinton's presidency, while 47 per cent disapproved.
Two-thirds of Democratic voters wanted to see the president challenged in
his re-election campaign.
This was not how administration planners saw the end of 1994. Mr Clinton was
to set a date for regional free trade at the Asia-Pacific economic summit,
win approval for Gatt, and complete an historic summit of democratically
elected Latin American leaders with a strategy for hemispheric free trade.
But domestic concerns have overshadowed the events. At an emotional ceremony
in the ornate hall of the Organisation of American States in Washington
yesterday, Mr Clinton tried to address the anxious US middle class. 'It is
true that one of the reasons for stagnant wages is intense competition in
our markets. . . by people who work for wages our people can't live on,' he
said. However, stability could not be restored without growing exports.
'We must go into the 21st century convinced that the only way to preserve
the American dream is to be involved with the rest of the world.'
The Gatt ceremony was not televised and few Americans will know it took
place. Instead, they were hearing from Mr Newt Gingrich, the House
speaker-in-waiting.
On Wednesday he slashed funding for congressional caucuses - which brought
charges of 'ethnic cleansing' from the black caucus. Yesterday he proposed
eliminating federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,
which provides a counterbalance to the religious right and conservative talk
show hosts who hold sway over the radio airwaves.

'On that date Schengen starts being applied and the signatory countries must
take measures to get rid of border controls before the summer,' he said.
Officials from the nine are due to meet in Heidelberg, Germany, on December
22 to set an official implementation date, which has been put back since
January 1993. Last month, Germany said the accords should come into effect
by April at the latest. Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium,
Luxembourg, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece have signed the accord.
Austria, which joins the EU next month, has observer status. Britain,
Ireland and Denmark have kept their distance as have the two other new
members, Finland and Sweden.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UN sees proliferation of Serb missile sites
</HEADLINE>

Serb forces have installed missile batteries covering at least 40 per cent
of Bosnia to blunt Nato air power in a further blow to the viability of the
United Nations mission in the country, Reuter reports from Zagreb.
UN officials said that surface-to-air missile systems, springing up on
Bosnian Serb-held terrain before and after Nato air raids on Serb targets,
have compounded problems clouding the future of UN operations in Bosnia.
Serb forces have set up missiles trained on '40 per cent of Bosnian air
space or more' in a challenge to Nato, whose sorties over Bosnia are meant
to deter attacks by combatants on UN humanitarian operations.
The rocket sites were thought to be concentrated around the capital
Sarajevo, Bihac and Banja Luka. The first two are government-controlled
enclaves ringed by Serb forces, while Banja Luka is the largest Bosnian Serb
city and bastion of their most vaunted army corps. UN officials said the
proliferation of Serb air defence systems, coupled with the Serbs' detention
of some 300 UN peacekeeping soldiers and increased shooting attacks on UN
patrols, were wreaking havoc with the peacekeeping mission.
'This sort of outrageous behaviour is affecting the reassessment of the
Unprofor mission going on in national capitals. There is a limit to what we
can endure,' UN protection force spokesman Michael Williams told reporters
in the Croatian capital.
He said Unprofor's plight was symbolised by a new Serb mobile SAM-6 missile
battery outside Sarajevo thwarting any resumption of a vital UN airlift to
the Bosnian capital. The Serbs also have shoulder-fired SAM-2 and fixed-site
SAM-7 missiles. The airlift was suspended after the Serbs threatened
retaliation over Nato air strikes last month that knocked out several rocket
sites and an airfield to punish the rebels for bombing Bihac, a supposed UN
'safe area'.
The Serbs' warning, given teeth by repeated pinpointing of patrolling Nato
jets by their air defence radar, also prompted Nato to ground its aerial
task force for a week.
'There's been no let-up in Serb harassment of UN personnel (despite UN
requests),' Mr Williams said.
'(For example) the detention of UN personnel hardly contributes to a
favourable assessment for (continuation) of Unprofor's mission. Detentions
are part of a larger picture, increasingly preventing a successful operation
of Unprofor. 'The limits must be decided by the national governments and the
UN security council,' he said. 'Our credibility is obviously a matter of
considerable concern now.'
Mr Williams added that the Bosnian Serb high command was 'quite adamant' in
telling Unprofor last Monday that it would not restore safety guarantees for
the Sarajevo airlift as long as its forces were exposed to Nato air attack.
The aerial bridge into Sarajevo has provided 83 per cent of the vital
supplies for the Bosnian's capital's 380,000 inhabitants since it was
started more than two years ago. There are fears that the city will start
running critically short of supplies if the airlift is not resumed within a
week.

<TEXT>
Belgium's defence minister, Mr Leo Delcroix, resigned on Thursday following
allegations of tax fraud in connection with a villa he owns in the south of
France, Reuter reports from Brussels.
Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the prime minister, said he had accepted the
resignation of the 45-year-old politician, who denied the allegations on
Wednesday. The Flemish Christian Democrat Mr Karel Pinxten has been named as
Mr Delcroix's successor. Mr Pinxten, 42, was a member of the European
parliament from 1989 to 1991 when he was elected to the Belgian parliament.
Mr Delcroix, who became defence minister in March 1992, was previously
general secretary of a leading Belgian political party, the Christian
Democrat CVP, Mr Dehaene's party. In his resignation letter he said: 'In my
new situation I can defend myself better against the insinuations and
accusations. . . . which I consider extremely unjust.'
The Belgian magazine Humo alleged earlier this week that he had defrauded
the tax authorities in connection with his French villa and had used 'black
labour' to build it.
Three Belgian socialist politicians, including deputy prime minister Guy
Coeme, resigned from central and regional government posts last January over
the so-called Agusta affair involving alleged bribery in an army helicopter
contract.
Earlier this year Mr Delcroix denied he owned a home in France but said on
Wednesday he had been deliberately vague about it so as not to compromise
his chances in European parliament elections. He did well in the poll but
did not take up a seat.
He told a news conference on Wednesday he owned a majority stake in a French
company, Capricorne Sud, whose main asset is the villa and the land it is
built on. He said he had acquired the stake for about BFr300,000 (Dollars
9,400).
Political analysts said yesterday that a lot of questions remained after Mr
Delcroix's explanation. One claimed that Mr Dehaene had apparently tried to
limit the damage to his government by asking the minister to resign.
The Humo report, headlined 'Chronology of a lie', quoted a tax expert as
saying that many Belgians using black or undeclared money to buy a villa in
southern France use the cover of a French company. 'Capricorne Sud fits
entirely into this scheme,' Humo said.
Mr Delcroix said the money for the villa came from 'my family, my wife and
myself, from parents and parents-in-law. It is just a family project.'
He estimated it was worth between BFr15m and BFr20m (Dollars 468,000 and
Dollars 625,000), rebutting suggestions that it was worth BFr70m (Dollars
2.18m).

FT  09 DEC 94 / Bosnia clouds EU summit hopes on eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, ESSEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EU leaders open a two-day summit in Essen, Germany, today to discuss future
integration of eastern Europe, an issue clouded by the Bosnian crisis.
The summit is also affected by Spanish threats to block the entry of
Austria, Sweden and Finland into the Union next year unless Madrid receives,
improved fishing rights.
These 'hostage-taking' tactics were denounced this week by Mr Jacques
Delors, outgoing president of the European Commission and possible contender
for the presidency of France. With host Chancellor Helmut Kohl, he is
expected to be central to the summit.
At a meeting of the European socialists in Essen yesterday, Mr Delors said
he would try to convince EU leaders to consider new ways to combat
unemployment. But the 'intellectual laziness and traditionalist ideas of
some' would make it difficult, he said.
The focus of the Essen summit is a German paper on the integration of six
former communist countries - Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia,
Bulgaria and Romania - into the European Union.
Leaders of the six will tomorrow be offered further modest trade
liberalisation, broader political contact, and promised guidelines, next
spring, for adapting their economies and legal codes to the single European
market. However, the package avoids a commitment to reform the common
agricultural policy and regional aid funds, without which the cost of
admitting the east Europeans would be prohibitive. 'This is one of the big
weaknesses in the document,' said a senior EU official.
This reflects intra-EU tensions over the German-led desire to secure stable
borders to its east. A Franco-German compromise committing minimum sums of
Dollars 6.7bn over the next five years to the east Europeans, and Dollars
3.27bn to North Africa and the Middle East, is likely to be agreed. Despite
Chancellor Kohl's consensus-building skills, senior diplomats predict
difficult discussions over Bosnia. The UK and France have contributed the
bulk of European forces in the UN peace-keeping effort, and are nervous
about possible German support for lifting the UN arms embargo against the
Bosnian Moslem government.
They believe that this would force a humiliating withdrawal of UN troops,
fuelling tensions within Nato and with Russia, which has become bolder in
its support for the Serbian government headed by President Slobodan
Milosevic.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (17): Favoured status for relocation -
Bristol Region / There is almost uninhibited development north of the city -
posing a challenge to central Bristol
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After some years in the doldrums, the property market in the Bristol region
is beginning to detect a fair wind, fanned by its favoured status for
relocation.
Mr Edward Cussen, partner in charge at the Bristol surveyors King Sturge,
speaks of 'some outstanding development opportunities and signs that demand
is increasing.'
The most obvious example of relocation is the construction, north of the
city, of more than 1m sq ft for the procurement headquarters of the Ministry
of Defence. Costing Pounds 254m at 1993 prices, it is designed for 5,700
staff.
Another big project nearby, on the Parkway business park, is a 600,000 sq ft
headquarters for Sun Life which will house 2,400 staff. Pearce Developments
has started infrastructure work for a second Parkway business park on 40
acres. North-east of Bristol, a first phase of 80 acres of commercial
development could start soon at Emersons Green.
Already well-established in north Bristol is Arlington's 157-acre Aztec West
business park, where there are 86 companies. Manager Philip Carter says that
in recent months there has been a little more activity in inquiries and
commitment. Rents of about Pounds 14 to Pounds 18 a square foot did not fall
during the recession, although more flexibility was given on terms.
A further example of the almost uninhibited development north of Bristol is
Cribbs Causeway, a regional shopping centre planned by Prudential Assurance
and JT Baylis. Marks and Spencer and John Lewis, which is moving out of the
city centre, will be anchors, accounting for 230,000 sq ft of its 650,000 sq
ft.
Due to open in 1997 and dependent upon the shopper with a car, Cribbs
Causeway would be unlikely to win planning consent today. Together with the
surrounding development, it poses a serious challenge to central Bristol,
where the main retail centre, Broadmead, is outdated and office demand has
been handicapped by limitations on car space.
Developers have not hastened to replace outmoded stock and there is now a
severe shortage of quality offices in the city. The most recent big
relocation was by Direct Line into the 65,000 sq ft Cathedral Square, which
leaves little available modern space.
One active plan is for Stonecutter Court, where Chesterton is seeking an
occupier for a proposed 113,000 sq ft office building. Eaglebrook Properties
has consent for Marlborough Gate, with 47,000 sq ft. One speculative but
smaller scheme is by Helical Bar at Venturers House, funded by Norwich
Union.
King Sturge reports rents have held below Pounds 20 per sq ft, but says
incentives to tenants are disappearing and it expects that level to be
breached with the next wave of development.
An important piece of city infrastructure was the opening this year of
Bristol Development Corporation's spine road. This gives direct access to a
26-acre retail and leisure complex which is near completion by Wilson
Connolly.
The BDC's flagship site is Quay Point, a proposed retail, leisure and office
scheme of 2m sq ft next to Temple Meads station. Mr Miles Collinge, the
corporation's chief executive, envisages the area becoming the business
heart of Bristol.
Bristol city council, fearful about the impact upon Broadmead of Quay Point,
as well as Cribbs Causeway, is making belated plans for its improvement. But
King Sturge says there is strong demand for prime sites with rents at Pounds
130 per sq ft.
The council is also concerned about the effect of Quay Point on the proposed
Harbourside, a long-needed redevelopment of vacant land at Canon's Marsh, on
the waterfront. A framework for mixed use has been agreed among the land
owners.
In south Bristol, redevelopment of the 56-acre redundant Hanson site at
Hartcliffe has yet to proceed. To the west, the successful Bristol port and
the construction of the second Severn bridge are stimulating large-scale
industrial and commercial development at Avonmouth and Severnside.
ICI intends to develop 1,500 acres of its landholding there, starting with a
distribution park. A 60-acre Severn Gate scheme is proceeding for AMEC
Developments and RTZ Estates with Chesterton quoting typical rents at less
than Pounds 5 per sq ft with incentives. Close to the port, infrastructure
work is finishing on a 30-acre Portbury West business park.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (16): Cardiff Bay 'key to city's
development for five to 10 years' - Cardiff Region / The regeneration of
2,700 acres of docklands gained impetus this year with the start of work on
the barrage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM

<TEXT>
Cardiff Bay is the key now to the next five to 10 years of Cardiff's
development,' says Mr Peter Kelly of DTZ Debenham Thorpe, the property
adviser.
The bay is inevitably the most eyecatching project in south Wales. The
regeneration of 2,700 acres of docklands gained impetus this year with the
start of work on the long-delayed barrage, which will transform low-tide
mudflats into a freshwater lake.
A less controversial but essential part of the project will be the
completion next year of a distributor road to link westwards with the M4
motorway. Equally important will be a boulevard, named Bute Avenue, and a
light-rail system to reunite the waterfront with the city centre. Work on
this infrastructure is expected to start next year.
Mr Kelly, chairman of DTZ's Cardiff office, is convinced that the
metamorphosis of the docklands will succeed: 'Any doubters will finally be
happy when they see Bute Avenue completed and integrated transport.'
In the bay, work has begun on the manufacturing plant of a joint venture by
Nippon Electric Glass and Schott Glaswerke. TBI, the property group, has a
speculative industrial development at Ocean Park.
Wilson Bowden Properties is the developer for 320,000 sq ft of non-food
retail, leisure and commercial space at Ferry Road.
Over the next 15 years, the corporation has a target of 4m sq ft of office
space, 5m sq ft of industrial floor space and 6,000 homes. Two pre-let
office deals have been agreed with Grosvenor Waterside, the property arm of
Associated British Ports.
The Welsh Health Common Services Authority has now occupied a 150,000 sq ft
building, and a 119,000 sq ft UK headquarters for NCM Credit Insurance is
being completed. Headline rentals have been over Pounds 14 per sq ft,
although there is grant assistance.
On the bay's fringe, there has been a freehold sale of 45,000 sq ft to AXA
Insurance in a Pounds 10m investment.
Meanwhile, confidence in the city centre was shown this year by the opening
of Queens Arcade, an Pounds 80m investment by BICC Developments and SPP-LET
International of 140,000 sq ft with 44 units. It is three-quarters let with
rents at Pounds 80 to Pounds 130 per sq ft.
The arcade reflects the reputation of the Welsh capital as one of the UK's
most profitable retail centres. Rents for prime sites are beginning to pick
up again and Pounds 160 per sq ft is being quoted for the best locations.
For offices, there is scant interest in space over 20,000 sq ft. Chesterton,
the property consultant, says the annual average take-up over the past
decade has not been achieved this year, although there has been a reasonable
level of inquiries for small offices and incentive packages are declining.
Increased investment activity earlier this year, and a shortage of good
stock, encouraged commitment to two quality schemes. Knox Court, developed
by NIG Sheridan Properties and forward-funded by Scottish Life, and Helical
Bar's Magnet House will provide a total of 120,000 sq ft. Chesterton
predicts that rentals are likely to reach Pounds 16 a sq ft; Pounds 2 a sq
ft above existing prime levels.
Outside the centre, Cardiff Business Park at Llanishen has seen lets to
Zurich Insurance and Camelot, the national lottery consortium, and rentals
of more than Pounds 13 are quoted, reducing the disparity with the capital.
Cardiff Gate business park, beside the new Pentwyn link road with the M4
motorway, has 90 acres for commercial development, including a speculative
60,000 sq ft office building.
Elsewhere in south Wales, the completion this autumn of a 'missing' stretch
of the M4 in west Wales is seen as a stimulus to investment, especially in
Swansea and Llanelli, which have substantial development sites.
King Sturge's latest survey of industrial floor space in Wales shows
stability, with the floor space coming on to the market almost equal to the
amount removed. However, Mr Kelly of DTZ stresses that although many
companies are full to capacity, they are reluctant to add to costs by taking
extra space. Rents are static.
Overall, the picture in south Wales has brightened. 'The property market
went quiet but never dead,' Mr Kelly says.
'It is emerging with reasonable confidence which I think can be sustained.'

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (15): Another piece of the jigsaw slots
in - Scotland / Even though the Edinburgh office market is still moving
fairly slowly, the scene in the capital is the most upbeat in Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A few days ago, funding was agreed for a 100,000 sq ft office development in
the heart of Edinburgh. The project, known as Exchange Plaza, is one of the
largest speculative developments being undertaken in the UK.
It will slot into place another piece of the jigsaw in the Lothian Road area
whose realisation at the end of the 1980s looked problematic as developers
failed.
Exchange Plaza, which is being funded by the Scottish developers
CALA-Morrison and by Railways Pension Trustee Company, will stand near the
new Edinburgh International Conference Centre, and a new headquarters being
built for Standard Life.
It will help relieve Edinburgh's shortage of modern open-plan office space,
a shortage that has been masked by the comfortable supply of available
office stock, much of it either old or requiring refurbishment, according to
the chartered surveyors Ryden.
Even though the Edinburgh office market is still moving fairly slowly, the
scene in the capital is the most upbeat in Scotland. When restrictive
planning policies were eased in the mid-1980s, demand for space far exceeded
supply, pushing rents up to peaks of Pounds 27 per sq ft.
Now there is space available in the Georgian New Town and city centre, rents
for modern accommodation are between Pounds 18 and Pounds 20 a sq ft,
comparable with UK cities such as Leeds and Birmingham.
'Edinburgh has come back into the pack,' says Mr Alan Robertson of Jones
Lang Wootton's Edinburgh office. 'We now have space and rents to attract
incoming businesses.' He points to surveys where Edinburgh comes near the
top of preferred relocation destinations.
New developments are building up steadily on the western fringe of the city,
close to the motorway system. The two big Scottish banks have moved many of
their activities there and the first projects are taking shape for Edinburgh
Park, a high quality business park.
But the move by financial institutions and professionals into new office
buildings around Lothian Road area has left about half of the stately
Charlotte Square empty. However the recent granting of planning permission
to Helical Bar for a project to develop at the rear of the square while
maintaining the Georgian houses intact appears to offer a way in which the
square can be revived.
There is rather less movement on the Glasgow property scene. In the late
1980s Glasgow, traditionally the biggest and most stable market in Scotland,
renewed much of its office stock and extended the core down to the river
Clyde.
But as Mr James Thomson of Jones Lang Wootton's Glasgow office says: 'things
have been very quiet for the past three years.' Much of the new property
took a long time to fill up and although the amount of office space let each
year has increased steadily there is still a considerable number of empty
floors.
Yet paradoxically the city also has a shortage of large open-plan floor
space. 'If you wanted 50,000 sq ft of space in a building you'd be pushed to
get it,' says Mr James Thomson, a partner in Jones Lang Wootton's Glasgow
office.
'There is a lot of second-hand space hanging over the market, with tenants
unable to get out of their leases. Site values are back at the levels they
stood at in the mid-1980s before the last upturn.' Prime rentals, according
to Ryden, have fallen back to Pounds 17.50, backed by substantial
incentives.
Whereas a year ago there was not a single crane working on a private sector
development in central Glasgow, now two construction projects are going
ahead.
Hill Samuel Life Assurance and London &amp; Wiltshire are building a 23,000 sq
ft building on a speculative basis in St Vincent Street, and Scottish Life
House nearby is being refurbished.
One of the most important developments is promised for a 49-acre site about
a mile from the city centre at Pacific Quay, used for the Glasgow Garden
Festival in 1988 and lying idle ever since.
Miller Developments and CTP are working on a project whose key element, in
addition to leisure facilities, is a 250,000 sq ft business park.
According to the Glasgow Development Agency which owns the site, the city's
performance in winning inward investors continues to suffer because of the
shortage of good quality serviced industrial-business premises, particularly
in comparison with the new towns of East Kilbride and Cumbernauld.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (14): Confidence seeping back -
Birmingham and the Midlands / Developers remain very cautious about
speculative development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Price Waterhouse, accountants, recently decided that it might have a better
chance of renting out an office building it had not used for two years if,
instead of offering a rent-free period to any tenant prepared to take over
its lease, it offered a cash payment of Pounds 1m.
It was an indication of the slack market for second-hand property in
Birmingham, the leading office centre of both the East and West Midlands.
Richard Ellis, chartered surveyors, noted that of the 204,000 sq ft taken up
in the year to last June, only one third of the total was taken up after
January.
Indeed, Healey &amp; Baker, chartered surveyors, calculated that on average
city-centre rents in the West Midlands declined by 1.5 per cent over broadly
the same period. Although this compared with a decline of 10.4 per cent for
the UK as a whole, it was in vivid contrast to the East Midlands.
There, rental growth of 4.7 per cent took place in the first half making it
the fastest-growing region in the UK with, as Healey &amp; Baker put it, 'the
upturn in the market mainly concentrated on the two largest towns, Leicester
and Nottingham.'
That said, more activity was expected in Birmingham, with, Richard Ellis
predicted, 'the steady demand for small second-hand units likely to continue
and the prospect of further developments starting which could assure more
pre-lettings.'
Developers remain very cautious about speculative development but some
confidence is seeping back into the market. This is reflected in the
activity of the London-based property institutions.
British Airways Pension Fund is purchasing an office building at
Brindleyplace and Schroder Exempt Property Unit Trust has bought offices not
only in Birmingham city centre, but also at Birmingham Business Park,
adjacent to the airport south of the city - and is funding a Bryant
Properties distribution park near Coventry.
The institutional interest in offices is linked to space. 'The shortage of
supply of offices is a key factor in this. Rents are more likely to rise
here in Birmingham than in any other regional city. If you want 100,000
square feet now, you'll have to wait two years,' said Mr Alan Chatham,
director of Brindleyplace, a subsidiary of Argent Group.
Although development has continued steadily at Birmingham Business Park,
this has not been the case in the city centre. The Temple Court development
of Richardson Barberry Properties has been pre-let to the Lord Chancellors
department, for county courts, and to Coopers &amp; Lybrand, accountants.
Now Richardson Barberry is seeking planning permission for a new and
adjacent office building of 200,000 sq ft, roughly the same size as Temple
Court. But the only speculative office building of more than 50,000 sq ft
under construction in or near the city centre is One Brindleyplace.
Brindleyplace, across a canal from the new International Convention Centre,
is, at 17 acres, one of the largest city-centre property developments
presently under construction in the UK. Apart from the speculative Number
One, a building of 150,000 sq ft has been pre-let to British Telecom, the
largest pre-let in the Midlands for five years. Brindleyplace is talking to
possible future tenants such as Central TV, Eversheds, solicitors, and
Mercury, the telecommunications company.
The list of possible tenants for Brindleyplace points to what Mr Julian
Shellard of Richard Ellis said was 'a level of unsatisfied occupational
demand' building up. That, he suggested, would result over the next 12-18
months in an increasing supply of top-quality office buildings.
Such an awakening of activity is not confined, however, to the offices
sector. Along the M6 and M42 motorways there has been increasing demand for
design-and-build units by local industrialists anxious to increase the
efficiency of their distribution, while contract distribution companies have
been in the market for warehousing, frequently on short or medium term
leases.
Grimley JR Eve, chartered surveyors, noted that 'in the industrial market
there have been numerous transactions, particularly in the owner-occupied
sector where realistically-priced freehold accommodation is in demand.' If,
however, interest rates increase, Grimley expects more activity in the
leasehold sector of the industrial market.
Investment in distribution parks on motorways has been relatively
recession-proof. With the market stimulated by forecasts of greater need,
not least to meet what is assumed will be a growing rail freight traffic to
Europe through the Channel Tunnel, plans for new developments have
proliferated.
Jones Lang Wootton, chartered surveyors, calculated that at 20 motorway
junctions within 25 miles of Birmingham, there is 1,500 acres of land for
which planning permission to build business and distribution parks has been
sought or granted.
Theoretically, this could translate into the provision of up to 25m sq ft of
business space. Who would occupy such space is not clear. But there is the
possibility of a recurrence of the situation which emerged along the M4
where, during the 1980s, optimistic views of demand for offices led to
over-supply in the 1990s.
In the retail sector, concern is of a different order.
The government's newly-expressed determination to promote the viability and
vitality of town centres has rekindled, somewhat belatedly given the
developments of the 1980s, the debate about new shopping centres.
The relationship between Fosse Park, on the edge of Leicester, and the
shopping heart of the city itself, is the subject of local controversy.
In the West Midlands, meanwhile, the proposal of Chelsfield to extend the
Merry Hill shopping centre in Dudley by a further 650,000 sq ft has rung
alarm bells in Birmingham, where proposals to re-develop the Bull Ring have
been shelved in favour of gradual rehabilitation.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (13): 'Steady as she goes' is catchphrase
 -The Channel Tunnel Region / The flood of speculative property developments
some expected has not materialised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE MOIR

<TEXT>
However embarrassing the accident-prone start to the high-speed Eurostar
passenger service, the Channel Tunnel's share of the cross-Channel freight
market has been building satisfactorily since the first lorries caught the
train at the end of July.
By mid-October volumes had already outstripped those handled by the Port of
Dunkirk. Importantly, the tunnel appears to have captured a disproportionate
share of express hauliers and couriers, the time-sensitive sector of the
market essential for the tunnel's premium pricing policy.
Yet if the tunnel is finally operating, that event has not been marked by
the flood of speculative property developments some expected. With the
notable exception of a development consortium keen to create 'Euro City'
around an International Passenger Station (IPS) at Ebbsfleet just east of
Dartford, the catchphrase is 'steady as she goes.'
Chris Bond of John Laing Property Ventures which has ambitious plans for 125
acres around the new IPS under construction at Ashford, believes he knows
why. 'During the Chunnel's early planning stages everyone rushed into Kent.
Now they are waiting for the infrastructure to catch up.'
Andrew Jackson of agents Weatherall Green &amp; Smith agrees that those
developments presently going ahead have been fuelled by the general
attractions of the south-east rather than in direct response to the tunnel.
He even detects some disillusionment with the amount of distribution
business which has already chosen to settle outside Kent or Essex.
Recession has also delayed the take-up of much of the speculative
developments of the late 1980s, making new speculation less urgent. Figures
produced for the Kent Impact Study by the Channel Tunnel Joint Consultative
Committee would not cause a developer to salivate.
Warehousing demand in Kent up to 1996 is estimated at 111,000 sq m. This is
fully matched by buildings either completed and vacant or under
construction. In addition, the planning pipeline contains a further 388,000
sq m to meet an estimated demand of 194,000 sq m between 1996 and 2001.
It comes as no surprise therefore that Laing is not rushing into development
at Ashford despite planning permission for a retail element of 300,000 sq
ft.
'We have been reviewing the whole site for the past three months. Site
inspections will continue until the year-end and a decision will be taken in
early summer whether to protect our existing planning applications or alter
them according to our projections for the rest of the site,' says Mr Bond.
Eurotunnel, which has extensive development land in both Ashford and
Folkestone, is also proceeding with caution.
Its 14-acre Cheriton Parc business park overlooking the tunnel terminal just
two miles east of Folkestone, has just started to pick up speed. Eurotunnel
itself has taken the first building as a 28,000 sq ft customer services
centre.
But Cheriton Parc is just a fraction of the 615 acres on seven sites owned
by Eurotunnel Developments (EDL) along the M20-A20 Channel Tunnel Corridor.
Ashford is the prime location. Orbital Park, a 100-acre light industrial
site, has BP Travel Services as its first tenant in 115,000 sq ft. Nearby
Waterbrook Park, close to Junction 10 of the M20, already boasts 10ha for
lorry parking, servicing and customs clearance.
EDL is now drawing breath while it considers a mix of retail and industrial
warehousing, a new Ashford cattle market and hotel-leisure possibilities on
the rest of the site.
Ebbsfleet is the one big development location which seems to be in a hurry.
Tony Kemp, managing director of Blue Circle Properties, is keen to maintain
the momentum of having beaten Dartford as the site of the intermediate IPS
on the Chunnel route and the main rail link to the Medway towns.
Blue Circle has good reason to be the motive force in the public-private
sector consortium with dreams of a 'Euro City' between Dartmouth and
Gravesend. It owns a former quarry on the edge of the Ebbsfleet station site
and has plans for a 1.7m sq ft shopping centre at Bluewater, another quarry
just one mile away.
Consequently, around Ebbsfleet station itself, the emphasis will be on light
industrial use, possibly in a multi-storey business park. Retail use will be
deliberately limited.
Another element in Euro City with which Blue Circle is closely involved is
the Crossways Business Park at Junction 1A of the M25 close to the Dartford
Tunnel. In the six years that development has been under way, 1m sq ft of
the proposed 3m sq ft at Crossways has already been built. Mr Kemp predicts
parity with West London rents within two years.
A new campus for Greenwich University, a regional hospital and big new
residential and leisure facilities are to be the key public sector
contributions to what used to be called the East Thames Corridor but now
describes itself as Thames Gateway.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (12): The wind has been stirring again -
Manchester and the North-West / Probably the best that can be said about the
north-west is that things are no longer static and trends are certainly not
going down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
As Graeme Wood, a partner in the Manchester office of property consultants
King Sturge, puts it: 'The economic pendulum never swings as wildly in the
north-west as it does in the south-east.'
Nothing bubbled in north-west England in the late 1980s so nothing burst in
the recession. Even the largest concentration of newly-built offices - in
Manchester's former docklands at Salford Quays and Trafford Park - left a
relatively minor but manageable oversupply problem when compared with
London.
The north-west found itself not so much in a deepening trough as in the
doldrums. This year, the wind has been stirring again as the regional
economy has picked up. Indeed, as DTZ Debenham Thorpe's Manchester office
points out, the region's gross domestic product grew by 2.7 per cent last
year compared with the UK's 2 per cent - a faster pick-up than any other UK
region. Demand in property markets, which always lags, was bound to show
itself this year.
Although there is an underlying pent-up demand, however, take-up is patchy.
Partly this is because industry and commerce is still unsure about recovery,
limiting companies' confidence to move, but it is also the result of a
shortage of good, modern space to move into.
North-west England has a surfeit of old space in commercial, retail, and
industrial markets, much of it unlettable.
Alan Murch, managing director of Richard Ellis's regional practice, says
205,000 sq ft of office space came on the market in central Manchester in
the first half of this year and take-ups or purchases totalled 157,000 sq
ft.
But this is in a local market that started 1994 with 1.3m sq ft of office
space available. The figures suggest a reasonably quick take-up of good,
air-conditioned space, but a continuing struggle to let a large rump of old
offices.
So, while there is optimism that the shortage of good space will drive a
steady trickle of new developments, what to do about the old space is going
to remain a problem, particularly when incentives to persuade businesses to
relocate were tied to temporary subsidies of rentals in their old premises
while they were being marketed.
Office rentals betray the underlying reality. Although the top headline rent
for the region - in Manchester's professional services core - has been at
Pounds 21 a sq ft for a couple of years, DTZ Debenham Thorpe's research
paints a gloomier picture.
Its 1994 review puts the figure at Pounds 14.50 in 1990, rising through
Pounds 20.50 in 1991 to Pounds 21.50 in 1992, but falling back through
Pounds 18.50 to Pounds 17.50 this year.
In Salford Quays - outside the Manchester core but only 10 minutes away -
the net rate being paid for modern space with air-conditioning is less than
Pounds 8, once incentives and special deals have been stripped out. People
contemplating a move within the Manchester core, but not in such a hurry
they cannot force prices down, say they do not expect to pay more than
Pounds 16 net in the next year.
Salford Quays' prices are proving attractive, especially since Manchester
Ship Canal, now a subsidiary of Peel Holdings and one of the main
developers, decided to break down some of its unlet properties into 50,000
sq ft or smaller packets, instead of waiting for big, single users wanting
120,000 sq ft at a time.
British Nuclear Fuels is taking 50,000 sq ft, relocating some functions from
Warrington and Preston. Halliwell Landau, an expanding Manchester law firm,
has moved some functions out of the Manchester core to 'the Quays'.
Robert Hough, ship canal chairman, says Quay West, the company's flagship
office block, is now 90 per cent let. Of other developments in the old
docklands, there appears now to be about 600,000 sq ft still unlet, but this
compares with 1.5m sq ft less than 18 months ago.
Mr Hough, however, points to an uncomfortable truth. Although low interest
rates should encourage development, higher net rents will be needed to
improve yields enough for anyone to do it. This in turn will require much
more confidence generally throughout industry and commerce to persuade more
people to move and so drive demand.
With DTZ Debenham Thorpe estimating best office rents in Chester and
Warrington at about Pounds 11.50 and at Pounds 11.00 in Liverpool, there
does not appear much basis for optimism until the economy is much stronger.
The industrial scene is even less encouraging. Roger Shufflebottom of
Manchester's The Elliott Partnership says: 'Yields have dropped to
unprecedented levels over the last nine months, with less than 7 per cent
quoted in one case.'
He says that after little activity in 1991 and 1992, there has been a slow
increase in design-and-build industrial and warehousing projects for
specific end-users. There has been hardly any speculative development - and
then only in traditionally 'safe' areas near motorway junctions, such as
Warrington and Trafford Park.
But even these sites proved not as attractive as developers hoped, Mr
Shufflebottom says, although - according to DTZ Debenham Thorpe -
Warrington's average industrial rents have this year climbed back to their
1990 level of Pounds 4 a sq ft. Chester at Pounds 3, Liverpool at Pounds
3.30, Preston at Pounds 3.60 and Manchester at Pounds 3.85 have yet to
recover the pre-recession levels.
Probably the best that can be said about the north-west is that things are
no longer static and trends are certainly not going down. But for the market
to be healthy, there are still too many bargains about for industrial and
commercial tenants who can afford them, and too little certainty of good
long-term profits for developers to chance their arms.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (11): Yorkshire caution curbs speculation
 -Leeds and the North-East / If there is no substantial speculative office
building in the city soon, Leeds will lose the edge it has established over
Birmingham and Manchester
</HEADLINE>

The feel-good factor may still be an elusive one for many companies, but not
so in Leeds. Of all northern cities, Leeds, with about 700,000 residents,
has established itself as a pre-eminent financial and services centre.
Southern-based corporates, along with government departments dispersing into
the regions have been persuaded to move to the city and prosperity seems to
abound. The latest arrival is Direct Line which, much to the astonishment of
local residents, says it chose Leeds because of the 'neutral Leeds accent,'
vital for their telephone operation. The company has taken over 90,000 sq ft
of office space in Headrow House for its direct insurance selling.
There is no doubt Leeds has a dynamic service sector. Last year, more than
300,000 sq ft of office space was either let or sold. The city has
diversified its industrial economy over the years and is now reaping the
reward.
The office market in Leeds has largely remained on track during the
recession and the city's links with specialist, financial and legal services
has actually expanded during the past 12 months. There are also sites ready
for speculative development or pre-commitment from tenants, including the
remainder of the impressive Granary Wharf scheme. This riverside plan is
proving to be a catalyst for the development of a previously untapped area,
south of the city but within walking distance for staff who want to amble
into the city at lunchtime.
When Leeds Development Corporation was set up in 1988, most of the
waterfront area was derelict. Now, all that has changed and the LDC has
invested some Pounds 600,000 in a new footbridge linking the city with the
scheme. This in turn has led to even further development, including a Pounds
6m brewery wharf museum by Tetley's. In all, some Pounds 72m of the Pounds
255m private sector investment has been attracted to the waterfront.
Despite all the encouraging signs in and around the city however, the
Yorkshire caution which perhaps helped it through the deepest parts of the
recession, is still holding everything in check. Potential development plans
are in place but if there is no substantial speculative office building in
the city soon, Leeds will lose the edge it has established over Birmingham
and Manchester. There are rumours that at least one of three leading
developers will be moving into the city early next year.
There has also recently been an upsurge in out-of-town development, led
initially by the growth of retail developments away from the city centre.
Companies are now taking office space adjacent to motorways where rents are,
at least for the moment, significantly cheaper and where staff and customers
have little or no car parking problems.
Business people in Leeds say, with a fair degree of pride, that it is
caution which helped many local firms survive and in some cases prosper,
during the recession and it will not easily cast aside.
Mike Hartley, a senior director with Richard Ellis Regional, based in Leeds,
says: 'The lack of speculative development in the city is surprising when
one considers that Leeds has not suffered a reduction in its rental levels
over the past few years. There is no doubt that rentals are now rising and
Leeds is certainly perceived as a place where funds are available to
invest.'
The city has enjoyed a good rental progression with figures showing a 9.1
per cent increase between 1979 and 1994. Top office rental values in Leeds
now stand at about Pounds 17-Pounds 18 a sq ft which reflects the shortage
of prime accommodation. The rents are more in line with Birmingham and
Manchester although the lack of new development has inevitably reduced the
number of investment transactions which have taken place.
The largest transaction recorded during the first half of the year was the
purchase of 21-22 Park Place by Pearl Assurance for a reported Pounds 5.5m.
Eagle Star, however, recently completed a deal for 50,000 sq ft of office
space, effectively taking the last available prime office building in Leeds.
Mr Hartley says: 'There has been a lack of confidence but the recession did
not bite as deeply in Leeds as elsewhere. Here, everything is in place and
the rents are slowly coming up and there are major development opportunities
with planning permission. 'There is no doubt people are confident and they
have good reason to be here, but they are also extremely cautious. So it is
only a matter of time before speculative schemes do go ahead. That will make
all the difference.'
The upturn in the regional property market is undoubtedly being driven by
the financial and business services sector and this is why Leeds is well
placed.
According to Alistair Russell, a senior partner at Jones Lang Wootton, which
has recently opened new offices in Carlton Tower in Leeds, business
confidence in the area is very high. The demand for office accommodation is,
he says, positive and improving. 'There is a very positive mood about, even
if it is tempered slightly with the traditional caution of the area. We have
expanded here for a very good reason and feel that companies are on the
verge of a significant change for the better.'

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (10): Awash with wrong sort of space -
London and the Western Corridor / The laws of supply and demand imply
significant growth over the next few years - providing the economy maintains
its momentum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The decision by BZW to move a large slice of its back-office operation into
Canary Wharf and Morgan Stanley's commitment to an extra building there
speak volumes about the changing atmosphere of London's office markets.
Another page could be added if the London Futures Exchange takes the same
trip down-river from central London. Two years ago - maybe even at the
beginning of 1994 - these would have been treated as merely the rumours of
tenants squeezed out through shortage of new space in the City and West End.
Now the news that the supposed white elephant of Docklands has filled
another 1m sq ft is greeted with a shrugged: 'I told you so' by many agents.
They have long predicted that when a few big companies sniffed economic
recovery and made much-postponed moves, the rest would realise just how
little space is available for expansion.
That might sound ludicrous when the market is awash with empty buildings in
a broad swathe stretching from Docklands to the Thames Valley.
Total supply seems monumental at 11.8m sq ft in the City and 8.7m sq ft in
the West End, according to Jones Lang Wootton's Third Quarter Review. Knight
Frank &amp; Rutley tops that up with another 10.6m sq ft in its M25 Survey.
But it is the wrong sort of space. Vast numbers of second-hand buildings are
practically unlettable because they are no better - and often worse - that
the space which tenants already occupy. Vacancy rates in new premises are
down to 4 per cent in the City and as low as 1.6 per cent in the West End,
says JLW. Around the M25, some 10 per cent is available, but KFR points out
that less than 3m sq ft is new, and most of the 1m sq ft absorbed in the
three months to September was in recently-built offices.
Some companies enjoying rising corporate profits might feel they can
relocate further afield into the Western Corridor, which has traditionally
acted as a relief valve for London. But Chris Hiatt of JLW points out that
there are only five buildings larger than 100,000 sq ft free in the stretch
from Hammersmith to Bracknell.
Smaller appetites may also find poor pickings. Only 15 new buildings more
than 20,000 sq ft are available in central Berkshire, which covers office
centres such as Bracknell, Reading, Slough and Windsor, says Marcus Henley
at Weatherall Green &amp; Smith. That represents only 2 per cent of total stock.
Inevitably, rents have begun to respond to the changing market balance. City
analysts are sceptical about claims that values are showing first signs of
growth since 1989, but Christopher Jones of Chesterton insists that City
deals are in the pipeline at more than Pounds 35 a sq ft. This compares with
a norm of Pounds 27.50 to Pounds 30 earlier this year.
Admittedly, these headline figures hide letting incentives. Analysts will
become more enthusiastic when rent-free periods disappear, but at least
these are softening to less than two years in the City and 18 months in the
West End. Landlords are also holding out against 10-year break clauses
introduced over the past couple of years, says Kevin Clarke of JLW.
While no-one expects boom-time rents of Pounds 70 a sq ft to return in the
near future, the laws of supply and demand imply significant growth over the
next few years - providing the economy maintains its momentum. One extra
advantage is that business rates will fall in London from 1995, giving
tenants something extra to play with.
Developers refuse to count their chickens after taking a roasting in the
slump, however. Only 700,000 sq ft is being built in the City and just a
little more in the West End, says Mr Clarke.
Things are little different out in the Western Corridor. 'Only three
buildings are due to be finished by the end of next year,' says his
colleague, Chris Hiatt. 'It is difficult to see how this will satisfy
demand. We think rents will bounce back, with Hammersmith hitting Pounds 30
by 1998.'
Developers should get a move on, because any good scheme around the M25 area
will attract strong pre-let interest, says Stephen Mallen of KFR Research.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (9): Popular option for many occupiers -
Business Parks / Whatever the outcome of the town-centre versus out-of-town
argument, we could soon see rising headline rents for the best office space
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The government is taking a tough stance on transport and the environment.
And the debate on the relative merits of city centre versus out-of-town
offices looks set to reopen.
After PPG6 - the planning policy statement regarding out-of-town shopping
development, which appears to have been unswervingly enforced in the light
of recent decisions despite howls of protest from the superstore operators -
it seems that PPG13, aimed at preventing further development in the green
belt, is going to become equally significant to the future growth of
business parks.
The decision by Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, to throw out Lloyd's
Register of Shipping's proposals to build a 350,000 sq ft headquarters at
Bramshott Place at Liphook, Hampshire is being cited as a landmark case.
Lloyd's chose the 50-acre site which already had planning for 100,000 sq ft
 -essentially to replace the previous hospital on part of the land - after
an extensive search which involved considering some 70 other locations
across south-east England.
The register's plans were fully supported by the local planning authorities
and the local community which is set to suffer job losses as a result of
Ministry of Defence closures.
The fact that the amount of buildings proposed by Lloyd's far exceeded the
existing permission was only one element in the secretary of state's reasons
for turning down the application.
With little public transport available locally, the new headquarters would
clearly be heavily orientated towards car-users - with both staff and
visitors driving relatively long distances to reach it.
Despite all the time and effort - not to mention hard cash - that a
disappointed Lloyd's has invested in Bramshott Place, it will not appeal.
Danish developer Danbuild, the owner of the site, is now considering various
options, says its joint agent Roger Saper of surveyor Jones Lang Wootton.
John Batsford of surveyor Chesterton considers that from now on business
park developers and funding institutions will look very carefully not only
at public transport connections to prospective sites but also to the
provision of additional on-site facilities (such as shops and restaurants)
for staff.
But while the longer-term trend - reinforced by government policy - may be
back to the town centre, business park space remains a popular option - with
a whole range of occupiers including banks, insurance companies, accountants
and public sector agencies, all of whom employ significant numbers of
clerical staff which it was traditionally considered were more attracted to
jobs in town centres.
The rate of business park development has slowed during the downturn over
the past couple of years, in line with other commercial property sectors.
Paul Ives at surveyor Erdman Lewis estimates that from a peak of 15m sq ft
of business park space completed in 1990 the volume dropped to less than 2m
sq ft in 1993. Today, construction is unlikely to begin without a pre-let in
place.
Arlington - with some 7.2m sq ft already developed, 8.5m sq ft with planning
and a further 12. 9m sq ft at application stage - is the largest specialist
developer of business parks in the UK. It is one of the few which have
continued to build speculative space over the past year or so.
At the Oxford Business Park - the old Cowley works - Arlington has just
completed an office village of 32,000 sq ft in five units. Already, says
agent Ian Warboys of surveyor Strutt &amp; Parker, solicitors have been
instructed to proceed with letting documentation on behalf of two potential
tenants.
And At Hatfield Business Park, Arlington has just finished two warehouse
buildings totalling 95,000 sq ft.
The Hatfield Park epitomises the evolution of Arlington's philosophy which
has moved from a mixed to an all-office environment and is now shifting back
to a mixed-use park. However, Warboys emphasises that careful planning is
necessary to house both office and industrial users on the same site.
For example, large lorries need specially designed roads, parking and yards.
On the other hand, no image-aware director of, say, a professional business
wants to entertain clients looking out of his windows at warehouses and
heavy vehicles. So different uses at all Arlington's new parks are sited in
separate zones.
Stockley Park at Heathrow, arguably the UK's first true business park, is
still regarded as the flagship. But although there is planning for a further
600,000 sq ft, there is presently no new space available. And it seems that
demand is predominantly for new space. The second-hand buildings at Stockley
are failing to achieve premium rents says Richard Storey of surveyor Richard
Ellis. Top rents at the height of the boom reached as much as Pounds 32 a sq
ft. Rent obtained in the last major letting - to Reebok earlier this year -
was Pounds 26 a sq ft. However, second-hand space on offer is going for
less.
Against this, Arlington reports that rents for second-hand space at its
parks are holding up well - particularly at the successful Birmingham
Business Park. And as for new space, Arlington's pre-let to KPMG Peat
Marwick at Reading Business Park achieved Pounds 23-Pounds 24 a sq ft -
which compares with about Pounds 18.50 a sq ft for high-quality offices in
Reading town centre. In general, headline rents at good business parks
appear to remain static. But there is evidence that landlords are taking a
harder line on short-term break clauses in leases. And rent-free periods are
becoming shorter. Whatever the eventual outcome of the growing
in-town/out-of-town argument - and this one will run and run - we could soon
see rising headline rents for the best office space; wherever it is.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (8): Improvement is patchy and slow -
Industrial Properties / Most regions report steady increases in both sales
and lettings and also 'general confidence'. But industrial rents are still
falling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Reflecting the economy in general, the industrial property market has shown
signs of increased activity this year. However, again as with the economy,
improvement is patchy and slow.
Reports from most regions indicate steady increases in both sales and
lettings and also 'general confidence'. But industrial rents are still
falling. Figures from surveyor Richard Ellis show a monthly decline of 0.4
per cent for October. And capital values have again been knocked back as a
result of the softening investment yields which have affected all property
sectors.
In the south-east, where heavy industry has been declining for the past 15
years, this year has seen greater activity among light industrial companies.
A key feature has been the mopping up of the considerable amount of
second-hand space. Now, in some locations - for example Guildford and
several towns round the M25 - most of this space has been taken up, leaving
only limited choice.
Richard Storey of surveyor Richard Ellis notes that second-hand space has
let well for several reasons. Firstly, occupiers have been able to negotiate
better deals with hard-pressed landlords. In addition, while confidence
remains fragile, industrialists tentatively expanding have been able to
secure shorter, flexible leases, minimising longer-term commitments.
Even where confidence is stronger, companies have often preferred to take
cheaper, second-hand space for 'image' reasons.
Surveyor Healey &amp; Baker confirms the trend to shorter leases. In an analysis
of industrial transactions completed by the firm over the past three months
it found that 43 per cent had been struck on the basis of 10-year terms and
35 per cent on five-year terms. This compares with 11 per cent each for the
more conventional 'institutional' 15- and 25-year leases. As a caveat,
however, Healey &amp; Baker says that landlords are still likely to resist
shorter leases for tenants with poor covenants.
Institutional investors began 1994 in a welter of enthusiasm for industrial
property in view of its comparatively attractive yields compared with those
of gilts - yields on high coupon 15-year gilts had fallen to close to 6.5
per cent - bonds and office and retail property. In a hurry to increase
their holdings, and with few good standing investments on the market, some
decided to create their own through development. Several projects were
undertaken in selected locations on a speculative basis by parties including
Axa Equity &amp; Law, AMP Asset management, Hill Samuel and BZW.
Now, however, with long-term gilts closer to 9 per cent following the
increase in interest rates, industrial property looks less appealing. Most
of the institutions have lost their appetite for speculative funding and
gone away. But not all of them. James Thornton of surveyor Jones Lang
Wootton cites a recent transaction in West Bromwich where a pension fund
client is putting up the cash for a speculative 152,000 sq ft industrial
project by a local developer. Terms reflect a yield of 8.25 per cent on a
rent of Pounds 4 a sq ft with rental cover for three years.
Almost in isolation, one segment of the industrial market flourished
throughout the recession - high bay warehouses: buildings which defined
roughly have a minimum floor area of 100,000 sq ft, eaves height of 30
ft-plus and site cover of 45 per cent or less.
The growth of the development of this type of building is a result of the
revolution in distribution led by, but not confined to, the food retailing
sector. The use of bar-coding and its allied computer-driven stock control
has meant that retailers have been able to switch from supply-led to
demand-led distribution systems - meaning larger warehouses, less storage
and more selling space at retail outlets.
These new methods have enabled retailers to cut costs dramatically. Guy
Frampton of surveyor Hillier Parker estimates that food retailers have
halved their distribution costs to 6 per cent of turnover over the past five
years by operating from these specialist buildings.
Location is another important side to the distribution equation. Development
began in the 'Midlands Triangle' - the area within 30 minutes' lorry drive
of the M1-M6 junction. The most high-profile pioneer was the Gaseley-Church
Commissioners Magna Park in Lutterworth. Now Warrington and Wakefield are
also popular with, according to Hillier Parker, some 11 per cent of the high
bay warehouse stock (by floor space).
Investment yields at Magna Park in April were as low as 5.75 per cent. They
have now eased back and the latest transaction at the park is going through
at around 6.5 per cent.
Clear support for predictions that we shall see rising rents and a new burst
of industrial development in 1995 comes with evidence of rising land prices.
From a peak of Pounds 1m an acre at the height of the boom, prices in the
prime area west of London fell to a low of Pounds 400,000 an acre. Now,
according to Richard Ellis's Storey, deals have been done at Pounds 600,000
 -and there are others in the pipeline in excess of that figure.
Healey &amp; Baker's John Organ puts Heathrow prices even higher at Pounds
750,000 an acre. And, looking at the regions, Organ's current figures for
industrial land in Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle and Leeds are
Pounds 350,000, Pounds 200,000, Pounds 170,000, Pounds 70,000 and Pounds
175,000 an acre respectively - all above the bottom-of-the-market prices in
1992. Owner-occupiers are coming back into the market, adds Organ,
particularly where developers are prepared to sell land and not look for
extra profit from design-and-build work.
It could soon also become feasible to develop inner city traditional
industrial areas again. London's Park Royal, for instance, has been given
Assisted Area status and with improvements to the North Circular Road Park
Royal could feature on developers' and funds' shopping lists again - 'sooner
rather than later' says Storey.
Organ, however, reckons that the government should do more. Most occupiers
operating on the UK's traditional estates, he argues, are small businesses
which depend on supplying and servicing the few larger occupiers and the
wider local business community.
When these larger occupiers move out to more efficient premises on
'green-field' sites with better environments and infrastructure, many of the
remaining small business find it difficult to survive. Not only are jobs
lost but there is the likelihood that the former larger factory site will be
sold to a retail park developer.
In order to regenerate our inner city industrial areas, Organ suggests, the
government should offer 100 per cent building allowances. Such an incentive
would encourage developers, funds and present occupiers to redevelop to
modern acceptable standards. Inner city economies and communities still need
local industry, maintains Organ.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (7): Crocodile tears over new controls -
The Retail Sector / Owners of existing shops are smirking. Even developers
are not exactly distraught
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ask any developer his worst nightmare and he will conjure up images of
planners, conservationists and a government 'committed to protecting the
future'. Ask an investor for utopia and he will conjure up planners,
conservationists. . . etc.
Much of the wailing over strict new controls on shopping centres are
crocodile tears. Restrict supply of any property and the value of existing
buildings rises. The Labour government learned this lesson in the 1960s
after a ban on new London offices. That is why owners of existing shops are
smirking. Even developers are not exactly distraught. Apart from rare cases
such as in Dumplington in Manchester, few had any intention of building more
centres. The country is almost saturated with shopping malls. Even food
stores have nearly reached their peak. Tesco and Sainsbury have chose to
return to town centres rather than be driven in by planners as some
campaigners insist.
What really irritates the industry is the poor reasoning and lack of
research behind the government's moves. The call for fewer car journeys
without investment in public transport is a major bone of contention. A
national policy also cannot cope with local variations, says Richard Wright
of Jones Lang Wootton, president-elect of the British Council for Shopping
Centres and a witness before the Select Committee which backs controls on
shopping centres.
Meanwhile, back on the high street a strange thing is happening: rents have
stopped falling. Retailing leads the property sector in and out of recession
because of the speed with which shoppers respond to tax and interest-rate
changes. So the slow, if steady, revival in spending levels is now impacting
on values.
Richard Ellis highlights the relationship in a simple graph. This shows how
rents, after a time lag, have followed the rise and fall of GDP for the past
20 years.
The present rises are not spectacular; prime rents increased 0.6 per cent in
the year to June, according to Healey &amp; Baker's Prime report. But this is
the first year-on-year increase since 1990, and the recovery will continue
through 1994 and cross over the vital threshold next year by exceeding
inflation, says H&amp;B.
'We expect retailers to start expanding their floor space, which coupled
with a gradual tightening in supply will produce further rent increases,'
says Graham Chase of Erdman Lewis.
He expects a 3-4 per cent national average increase in the year to May 1995.
But like the varying local conditions which should be used to test the case
for each new shopping centre, there are big differences in sectors of the
retail market.
London and the south-east are expected to top the growth league, partly
because they have been hardest hit by recession, says Erdman Lewis. Central
London is the only area in the country where rents remain below 1987 levels
but this is being eroded through an influx of overseas spenders and a lack
of new property.
Paul Griffiths, investment director at Chesterton, picks out prime high
streets where rents have fallen back over the years as a target for
institutional money. It will take another year or 18 months for rent rises
to work their way through to reviews, however.
There is also little to buy at the moment. This scarcity - particularly of
property around 3,500 sq ft - and a lack of new development would help drive
up rents over the next two years even without a surge in demand, adds H&amp;B.
As in other sectors, secondary stock will be a big problem. Until all
available prime space is used up it will languish in an increasingly
polarised market.
One irony in the debate over shopping constraint is that out-of-town
retailing has led the market in performance. In East Anglia and the north,
H&amp;B says rents rose 8.4 per cent and almost 8 per cent respectively compared
with a national sector increase of 5.5 per cent in the first half of 1994.
Retail warehouses can absorb such rises because they are considerably more
profitable than high street stores, despite the fact that costs have risen
43 per cent since 1990 compared with in-town increases averaging 3 per cent,
according to a special study by Chesterton Research.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (6): Prospects for next year 'promising'
 -Offices / 1995 is beginning to look like a good bet for recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recovery in the UK's office markets has been promised almost every year
since the economy collapsed. Cynics might say forecasters are bound to get
it right some time, but 1995 is beginning to look like a good bet.
As the economy creeps back to growth, occupiers are beginning to take extra
space or are switching to better quality buildings because they believe
prices are about to rise. In fact, some regions have already seen rents
increase on well-located new buildings.
The Midlands and south, for example, recorded 3 per cent rises over the past
12 months, says Erdman Lewis. Scotland and Wales are even more buoyant, with
increases of 8 and 10 per cent respectively.
But this has to be put in perspective. Offices are cheaper in real terms
than for the past 30 years, and less than 45 per cent of levels set at the
height of the 1973 boom. They were almost bound to stop falling as company
profits recovered and service employment bounced back.
The huge surplus of space is beginning to dwindle, and some regional centres
are running out of modern buildings. Chesterton calculated a mid-summer
vacancy rate of 11.4 per cent in regional centres compared with 13.8 per
cent 12 months earlier. The number of investment deals also rose by 28 per
cent in the same period.
There is even talk of developers 'poised' to restart speculative building,
but with 86m sq ft on the drawing board and funding hard to winkle out of
banks or institutions, most are likely to wait for pre-lets - or at least an
extended period of rental growth. The longer they wait, however, the more
potential margins are eroded by rising building costs.
The main factor in their favour is that most empty space on the market is
second-hand, a good deal of which will probably never be let. Tenants take
obsolete premises when rents are soaring and space is scarce, but not when
they can force desperate landlords into giving them new offices almost as
cheaply.
This complex picture resolves into a 'promising' prospect for the industry
over the next 12 to 18 months, says property consultant Healey &amp; Baker.
'Oversupply is bound to subdue the recovery in rent levels but for modern
space the balance between supply and demand points clearly to positive real
growth in 1995,' says the consultant in its current Prime Research report.
Secondary space shows little of that promise, however, requiring a massive
increase in demand to restore some kind of balance. It would help if owners
thought more seriously about switching to other uses. Residential
conversions are becoming almost commonplace in London but the value gap
between housing and offices has not yet persuaded owners in the regions to
follow suit.
Fears are rising that lack of new development may damage some regional
centres. Shortages in Leeds have pushed up rents by Pounds 1 a sq ft to
Pounds 18.50 this year and investor interest has hardened prime yields from
6.5 per cent down to 5.75 per cent, says Richard Ellis. But unless some of
the 1.9m sq ft of planned space begins soon, the city could lose tenants to
rivals centres, says Richard Ellis Leeds director Mike Hartley.
Developers appear to have moved more quickly in Birmingham, where more than
1m sq ft could emerge over the next couple of years to meet shortages which
have held headline rents at 20 a sq ft. Four important schemes have also
started in Manchester, where top headline rents are Pounds 21 a sq ft. More
than Pounds 80m also went into 10 investment deals in the first half of the
year, says Richard Ellis, but like most cities, deals are being held back
more by lack of product than desire to invest. Commitment by leading tenants
to take space in centres such as Glasgow and Edinburgh may improve matters
next year, but only by reducing stock even further to around a year's
supply, says Healey &amp; Baker.
Cardiff has seen some of the most marked rent increases in the UK, helping
push Welsh rates up by 3.3 per cent this year because of infrastructure
improvements. They still stand well below Bristol, despite a 25 per cent
drop in rents here since 1991. And the gap could widen again, adds H &amp; B, as
rents take off again in the next 12 months.
Leicester and Nottingham have made the East Midlands the UK's fastest
growing region over the past six months, with rent rises of 4.7 per cent.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (5): Litigation is still clogging up
courts - The Valuation Controversy / It is no surprise that the profession
has spent the past two years engaged in critical self-examination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The reputation of valuers suffered more in the recession than any other
profession. Litigation surrounding negligent valuations is still clogging up
the courts. The widely differing valuations of Queens Moat Houses hotel
portfolio undermined the credibility of traditional open market valuations.
It is, therefore, no surprise that the profession has spent the last two
years engaged in critical self-examination. Since most of the outstanding
litigation is between valuers and banks, valuations made for secured lending
purposes were the first to be overhauled.
In conjunction with the British Bankers Association, the Royal Institution
of Chartered Surveyors issued a guidance note giving detailed advice on how
valuations conducted for banks should be carried out.
This introduced the concept of 'estimated realisation price' (ERP) - the
price that would be achieved if the property was put on the market
immediately, rather than the price that would be achieved if a sale was
agreed today.
The wider response to the painful experience of recession came with the
Mallinson Report, which was published in April and contains 43 detailed
recommendations.
The main message was that the existing rules and techniques for valuation
are broadly satisfactory, but need to be refined.
The institution acted rapidly on one of the report's main recommendations:
that guidance for valuers contained in the Red and White Books should be
consolidated in a single volume and supplemented with additional rules.
The old Red Book was actually very limited in scope, laying down rules for
valuations which would be relied upon by third parties other than the
client. In practice, this covers valuations likely to appear in public
documents such as company accounts and prospectuses.
The new Red Book will be much wider in scope, covering virtually all
valuations apart from advice given to potential sellers in the course of
agency work.
It also introduces the concept of estimated realisation price as an
established basis of valuation. The institution hopes that the contrast
between estimated realisation price and open market valuation will increase
understanding among clients.
Not everyone agrees. Some in the profession think that enshrining an
alternative valuation basis will cause confusion.
How clients react to ERP remains to be seen. But the new Red Book goes to
great lengths to improve mutual understanding between the valuer and the
client.
This was another of the messages from the Mallinson Report. It said, for
example, that valuers should decline instructions where the client was not
prepared to disclose the purpose of the valuation.
The new Red Book also demands that valuers obtain written instructions
before undertaking work. Insurance companies have estimated that 45 per cent
of professional indemnity claims could be avoided avoided if the
instructions to the valuer from the client had been written down.
But the new Red Book is not a definitive response to the Mallinson report.
The report recommended that the 'all-risk yield' method used by valuers
should be refined, and that alternative techniques should be explored to
provide a cross-check for results. The institution has set up working
parties to look at these issues. Some would like to go further, faster. The
British Association of Hotel Accountants has suggested a method of valuing
hotels based on discounted cash flow analysis rather than market evidence
and yields.
This has been rejected by the institution on the grounds that the worth of a
property to its owner - as defined by discounted cash flow techniques - may
have little connection to its value in the open market.
Besides, present accounting rules demand that published accounts should show
open market valuations based on best practice as defined by the Red Book.
However, the lesson of recession is that valuers can not afford simply to
state open market value without explanation if their valuation diverges from
underlying considerations of worth.
Over time, valuers will have to accept the Mallinson Report's insistence
that valuers should be familiar with a range of approaches to valuation and
be prepared to explain their findings to clients.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (4): Popularity soared in past two years
 -Tenders and Auctions / An analysis by JLW reveals that more properties are
being put out for bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Discussion on the merits of differing religions occupies little time in the
life of the average property professional. They are more likely to be deep
in debate about the advantages of buying shops rather than offices.
The buying and selling of such investments, however, often appears to have
all the hallmarkings of a doctrinal division.
Auctions have soared in popularity over the past couple of years, bringing
an air of nervousness to advisers who have never set foot in a sale room.
Public exhibitions of bidding frenzy bring a shiver of discomfort to those
used to playing off unidentified buyers and sellers in quiet offices or on
mobile phones.
But they now face questions from clients about whether auctions are better
than tender or private treaty. Such debates are futile, says Richard
Auterac, auctions specialist for Jones Lang Wootton. 'It is a bit like
comparing religions. None is better than any other.' There is no hard and
objective evidence to make a meaningful comparison.
A sector analysis launched by JLW has certainly helped show that business is
increasing. The Auction Results Analysis System (Aras) brought together
figures for the first time from six top London auctioneers. But such changes
are too often attributed to the method of sale, when they might reflect
general changes in the market, says Mr Auterac.
Explosion of turnover last year and a fall-off in the past six months, for
example, have been matched in the private treaty market. This is not
surprising, as Mr Auterac believes auctions give a more accurate picture of
the property market than the big, glossy deals which attract headlines. They
reflect the tone of the wider market, which involves thousands of private
property companies and individual investors.
Proselytisers insist that selling under the hammer does have advantages
which outlast general market movements, however. 'It provides a quick and
efficient method of sale, avoiding the procrastination often associated with
private treaty,' says Patrick Kerr of Allsop &amp; Co, the largest UK operator
with sales of more than Pounds 200m in the past 12 months.
Auctions can also squeeze out extra value from bidders spurred by the fact
that they can plainly see the 'whites of the competitor's eyes'.
Certain kinds of property are well suited to such open and dramatic
techniques. Unique buildings need an open forum to determine market value,
says Cliff Krieger of Chesterton. Investment property can be hard to price
any other way when demand soars above supply, while banks, receivers and
trustees also need a public stage to show they are fulfilling a duty to
obtain maximum returns. The market has been flooded with this kind of
property over the past two years. Banks, for example, are now willing to
unload vast property holdings at knock-down prices, says veteran auctioneer
Simon Rigall of Conrad Ritblat Sinclair Goldsmith.
Local authorities rushed in during a period of grace when the government
allowed them to keep capital receipts. Conrad Ritblat sold 300 council
properties in this blue patch up to early 1994. Brewers have shed pubs under
orders from the Monopolies Commission while retailers and banks raised cash
through sale and leaseback deals.
The surge appears to be abating, however. The number of lots fell by almost
40 per cent and sales by 50 per cent in the three months to September,
according to Aras. This reflects the end of council property dumping but
also demonstrates Mr Auterac's case that auctions follow the general market,
which is now more uncertain over rental growth and interest rate movements.
John Townsend of Erdman Lewis says yields are suffering because of wider
interest rate moves, but volume should remain stable if sellers are not
over-ambitious. Richard Ellis is so confident of institutional interest in
selling assets this way that the firm is joining the market by setting up a
partnership with Dublin-based auctioneer Gunne.
It may be a tough business to enter. Shortage of quality property could turn
the market into a test of survival of the fittest, says Mr Krieger. Over the
long-term, however, most professionals believe the sector will continue to
grow as bigger dealers taste the advantages of auction selling. And if some
form of objective analysis can be devised to illustrate this difference, it
will expand even more, adds Mr Auterac.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (3): Regions demand transitional relief -
Rating Revaluation Update / Regional occupiers can expect sharply increased
rates bills to hit their doormats on April 1, while London companies will
see a saving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE MOIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most businessmen agree that business rates are fundamentally a good tax  -
cheap to collect and a fair reflection of services provided. But that does
not mean that Chancellor Kenneth Clarke could expect an easy ride after
announcing in the budget what the UBR (Uniform Business Rate) would be set
at.
Multiply local rental values prevailing in April 1993 by UBR and - presto -
that will be the rate payable from April 1 1995. But it is not quite that
simple. Uniform Business Rate was first introduced in 1990, based on 1988
rental values. Between then and 1993 recession gripped London, savaging
rents by as much as 50 per cent. In most of the regions, by contrast, they
continued to rise from a lower base.
The result is that regional occupiers can expect sharply increased rates
bills to hit their doormats on April 1, while London firms will see a
pleasing saving.
But that is not the end of the story. When London rates rocketed in 1990
(because 1988 rental values were riding the crest of the boom) tenants in
the capital demanded - and won - so-called transitional relief. No rates
bill was to leave anyone more than 20 per cent worse off in any year.
The regions have now demanded similar transitional arrangements, with the
added proviso that this round's winners (the City of London 'fat cats' from
a provincial perspective) should also see their windfalls phased in.
That has incensed professionals who remember that UBR was introduced to stop
local authorities either featherbedding or squeezing local industry by
setting a local rate poundage completely out of step with national averages.
In the most notorious case, in 1990, Sheffield businesses found themselves
paying a UBR of only 34.8p in the Pounds 1 instead of the 399p rate poundage
which the local authority had previously set.
John Bloor, Weatherall Green &amp; Smith rating partner, insists that
transitional relief negates the whole concept of a uniform business rate and
introduces a system even more unworkable than the old variable rate
poundages.
It has certainly sheltered some businesses from what were said to be fair
rates for much longer than politicians ever imagined. Selfridges department
store in London's Oxford Street is one high profile establishment still not
paying the full rates implied in the 1990 revaluation.
One further twist to the rating revaluation saga has stuck in businessmen's
craws. From time immemorial, businesses have had six months to appeal
against a rates notice. Government now proposes to halve the appeal time to
three months in England and Wales. In Scotland, the six months rule still
prevails.
This final piece of fine tuning threatens the entire programme. Businessmen
may whinge against the swings-and-roundabouts element in the level of rates
payable but transitional relief will probably be sufficient balm. The
halving of the appeal period, however, they regard as simply vindictive.
There is no evidence, they argue, that the old six-months period made it any
more difficult for the Chancellor to collect the rates. Moreover the old
arrangements continue to work perfectly well in Scotland.
A mutinous groundswell can already be heard with some individuals advocating
a form of revenge: businesses are being invited to slap in protective
appeals against every assessment on the grounds that they will not have had
time to evaluate them in detail.
This would swamp the courts which hear appeals and could force a fundamental
rethink by a government whose back benchers have already given notice that
they will not be slavishly whipped into line.
Opposition is likely to mount rapidly between now and the year-end (by when
the relevant statutory instruments must be in place) or the first week in
January when the government promises to publish the draft rating list (which
will contain both estimated 1993 rental values and the UBR.)
It may even continue beyond then, if the government shows signs of
weakening, honing an edge for Weatheralls conferences in London, Bristol and
Leeds between January 24 and February 1 at which Bloor will call for a
return to controlled rate poundages.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (2): Most owners would welcome reform -
Unfinished Legislation / Officials are keen to amend privity law but the
Queen's speech in November, setting out the government's legislative
programme for this parliament, did not mention it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The commercial property market has been living with the cloud of potential
legislation for so long that many in the industry now dismiss the threat.
It is six years since the the Law Commission recommended abolition of
Privity of Contract, which leaves the original tenant liable for rent under
a lease even if it was assigned several years ago.
The government has said that it will not enact retrospective legislation, so
existing leases would not be affected. But will it find the time in the
parliamentary timetable to introduce a bill ?
Officials are keen to amend current privity law but the Queen's speech in
November, setting out the government's legislative programme for this
parliament, did not mention the issue.
A private member's bill could still be introduced with government blessing.
Conservative MP Mr Peter Thurnham introduced such a bill earlier this year,
only to see its second reading cut short.
Most property owners would welcome reform of the current law.
Mr Richard Lay, commercial property spokesman for the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors, welcomed the Thurnham Bill.
'It is in the industry's interests that the matter is settled sooner rather
than later,' he said.
The British Property Federation, which represents property owners, has also
said that it favours reform of privity, so long as landlords are given the
right to approve assignees. At present, consent cannot be 'reasonably
withheld.'
The threat of legislation on the wider structure of commercial leases also
appears to have receded. In July, the government said that it would not
introduce legislation to curtail upward-only rent reviews.
It asked the industry to agree a code of conduct to encourage more flexible
lease terms.
The voluntary approach has widespread support. Yet it is not clear that
landlords and tenants will be able to agree a code of practice which
satisfies either side or the government.
The BPF has proposed a 'health warning' which reminds tenants that leases
are negotiated in a free market. It argues that anything more prescriptive
would be ignored by big landlords.
Pressure groups representing tenants were hoping for something more. Without
a consensus on this issue, there is an outside chance that the threat of
legislation will return.
Contaminated land is the one issue where the property profession would,
almost unanimously, like to see legislation as soon as possible.
A government policy statement on the issue last month received widespread
support from within the industry and legislation - in the form of the
environment and countryside bill - is expected within weeks.
The policy statement set out the broad principles that legislation will
follow.
The most important is that land only needs to be cleaned to a standard
suitable for its intended use.
This is designed to avoid the vast clean-up costs which have dogged
countries such as the US.
The principle that the polluter should pay remains, although landowners will
be liable where the original polluter is no longer around.
Importantly, banks which lent to polluting companies look likely to escape
liability in all but the most exceptional circumstances.
This pleases many in the banking and property worlds, who feared that banks
could stop lending to 'dirty' industries if they were held to be liable.
Moreover, the policy statement confirmed once and for all that the
government has dropped plans for a register of contaminated land based on
past use.
This proposal, originally contained in section 143 of the 1990 Environmental
Protection Act, caused widespread outcry and was withdrawn last year.
Under the new proposals, local authorities will maintain a record of
significantly contaminated land in their areas, but based on actual rather
than potential pollution.
The authorities will also have to specify what action needs to be taken to
clean up the site.

FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (1): Expectations are down to earth -
Overview / It is now clear that commercial property will, like the wider
economy, pull slowly out of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the worst property downturn for half a century, some over-reaction
during recovery was probably inevitable. Expectations were raised to
unsustainable heights during the early months of the year and have since
been brought back down to earth.
It is now clear that commercial property will, like the wider economy, pull
slowly out of recession.
This is not to deny the scale of the gains so far. Investment returns from
commercial property this year will be substantial, outperforming both bonds
and equities. In the year to the end of October, the Investment Property
Databank (IPD) monthly index showed capital growth of 12.6 per cent and a
total return of 22 per cent.
But the October figures also confirmed that property values were falling in
the office and industrial sectors and no longer rising in retail. If the
trend continues, the total return from property during 1994 is likely to be
about 15 per cent.
While property will still comfortably outperform gilts and equities, that
result would be a disappointing outcome after the euphoria of the first
quarter.
Rising bond yields are the most obvious reason for this change of sentiment.
The yield on long-dated gilts has risen from less than 6.5 per cent in
January to 8.5 per cent. Since fund managers choose between investment
markets, a bear market in bonds was likely to spill over into property. The
overhang of over-rented properties - with tenants paying rents above market
norms - has made the link between bonds and property stronger still.
Bond yields would matter less if rents were rising. But expectations that
rental growth would be well established by the middle of this year proved
wide of the mark. As the sceptics predicted, rental growth prospects did not
justify the low yields at which investment properties were changing hands in
the spring.
According to IPD figures, rents were still falling in the industrial sector
during October, level in offices and barely rising in retail. It now seems
unlikely that rents will rise significantly across the market until the
middle of next year.
Against this background, the immediate outlook for commercial property
values is unexciting. The London Business School forecasting model,
sponsored by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, predicts that
capital values will rise by 9 per cent this year and 2.6 per cent in 1995.
In June, the model was forecasting capital growth of 18 per cent this year
and 7 per cent next.
The stock market proved a useful leading indicator of where property values
were heading. Property shares have underperformed the wider equity market by
15 per cent since last December. The flow of rights issues and flotations
has dried up.
Despite these set-backs and lower expectations, the next stage of the
property market recovery should have firmer foundations than the bond-driven
gains of the past 12 months.
Business confidence - which ultimately drives commercial property rents and
values - is stronger than a year ago. Rents on better-quality properties
have already returned to an upward path. After three years in which
development activity ground to a halt, there is a shortage of good modern
space in many areas.
The London office market is a microcosm of these pressures. Supply of large
modern offices in the West End is already exhausted. In the City of London,
there are only a handful of large spaces still vacant. Rents for prime space
look likely to rise by about 10 per cent this year.
Like other areas of the country, though, London offers a tale of two cities.
While modern space is scarce, there is still a vast overhang of unwanted
offices. In a slow-growth, low-inflation environment it is doubtful whether
many of these buildings will ever be filled. Owners must face the difficult
choice of either converting properties for alternative uses or sending in
the bulldozers and redeveloping sites.
Landlords are also faced with the continued threat of government
intervention over the structure of commercial leases. The threat of
legislation to curb upwards-only rent reviews and confidentiality clauses
appeared to fade in July, when the government said it would not legislate in
this area.
But it asked landlords and tenants to come up with a voluntary code of
practice to make sure that market forces were operating efficiently. Unless
all parties can agree a code of practice which leads to more flexible
leases, the legislative threat could return.
Still, legislation to clarify liabilities relating to contaminated land now
looks likely to please many in the property industry. This is a far cry from
the furore over the government's 1990 proposals to create public registers
of contaminated land, which could have blighted industrialised regions.
The interventionist approach to planning policy favoured by Mr John Gummer,
the environment secretary, has caused some upsets over the past 12 months.
The big food retailers in particular have had to adapt business plans to
take account of the government's desire to promote town-centre development.
Others see the new direction of planning policy as an opportunity.
Institutional investors have been snapping up regional shopping centres on
the grounds that development curbs will add to the scarcity value of
existing malls.
For many pension funds and life insurance companies, though, the question is
whether to invest in commercial property at all. The average pensions fund
now holds only about 6 per cent of its assets in property, compared with
about 20 per cent at the start of the 1980s.
Life insurance companies have also reduced their exposure during this
period.
If property is going to survive as an institutional asset class, certain
things will have to change, whatever the economic cycle brings.
Poor liquidity and high transaction costs are the areas of greatest concern.
Changes to the legal mechanics of property transactions and the development
of new financial instruments could provide the solutions.
The technical and cultural barriers to change are enormous. But without the
support of mainstream institutional investors, property will be pushed to
the margins and the property market will be poorer as a result.

FT  09 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: BSkyB debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Initial dealing in BSkyB shares saw turnover of some 45m in the last two
hours of trading in London. The stock, which was only priced yesterday
morning, opened at an 11p premium to its 256p striking price and held steady
to end the day at 268 1/2 p.
The shares began trading simultaneously in London and New York. They will
enter the UK Stock Exchange's official list next Thursday and BSkyB is
expected to be an early candidate for the FT-SE 100 Index. The offer price
translates to a capitalisation of Pounds 4.4bn, which at current levels
would render it one of the 35 most highly capitalised UK companies.
BT added 4 up at 380p as the market buzzed with talk of an immiment disposal
of the group's 35.9m share stake in AT&amp;T following the US telecom group's
filing of a registration statement. The disposal could bring in some Dollars
1.7bn at current prices. Turnover in BT was 8.7m shares.
Retailer Great Universal Stores surprised the market with a special 30p
dividend with its interim profits. The shares closed at 496p xd after active
trading of 4.3m.
The move followed weeks of market speculation suggesting the company would
use part of its cash mountain of around Pounds 1.5bn to launch a share
buy-back scheme.
The one-off special payment made yesterday will cost around Pounds 300m,
still leaving the group with some Pounds 1.2bn and prompted speculation that
GUS may soon make another or even go for the much predicted share buy-back
option.
Half-time profits at Pounds 225m, against Pounds 213.2m a year earlier, came
in below market forecasts. BZW downgraded full-year expectations by 3 per
cent to Pounds 555m, saying its move reflected 'the weakness in the clothing
market and recalculation of the interest charge'. UBS cut its full-year
prediction by Pounds 10m to Pounds 575m.
Takeover enthusiasm fuelled the financials area as analysts and investors
looked towards a fundamental shakeout. Kleinwort Benson jumped 32 to 522p.
Smith New Court, where profits were above expectations but still down 35 per
cent, improved 23 to 396p - many expect the classic market-maker to attract
a bid.
Schroders moved 40 higher to 1460p and MAM, Warburg's 75 per cent-owned fund
management arm, leapt 39 to 653p.
Technical pressure was behind a retreat of 7 to 426p in British Aerospace,
rather than any rethink on Wednesday's monopolies referral for the bids from
both BAe and GEC for submarine maker VSEL, which dipped 2 to 1336p. GEC was
steady ahead of today's interim results at 275p.
Yesterday's increase in duty on alcohol by the UK chancellor brought a
retreat in several stocks in the sector. Whitbread gave up 6 to 553p and
Guinness a penny to 438p. Bass relinquished a penny to 518p, with sentiment
further hurt by a sell recommendation from NatWest Securities.
Electronics group Racal tumbled 13 to 203p in 4.9m turnover as analysts
found clear signs of margins pressure in the interim statement and promptly
downgraded full-year profits estimates. NatWest Securities came down by
Pounds 5m to Pounds 60m but found the shares attractive at present levels,
against a net asset value of close to 190p.
The reawakening of bid fever, prompted by the Warburg situation, spread like
a virus and marketmakers were soon rounding up the usual suspects. It was
harder to see a stronger rationale for stories that Glaxo was sharpening its
claws for either Wellcome or Zeneca. But all three ended brighter on the
day, Glaxo up 8 to 629p, Wellcome 10 to 675p and Zeneca 11 to 847p.
Carlton Communications fell 10 in early dealing on worries over derivatives
trading. When it was realised that the figure was minimal and Carlton was
suing Bankers Trust rather than the other way round, the stock rebounded to
close 4 ahead on balance at 872p.
An acquisition, rights issue and promise of higher profits and dividends
this year left motor distributor and bus operator Cowie 6 higher at 224p in
1.1m turnover. The rights issue will bring in some Pounds 33m, half of which
will finance the purchase of the group's second London bus operation. News
of the extra equity was sweetened by a forecast 16 per cent increase in
dividends for 1994.
Refractories maker Hewitt soared 60 to 158p as the group unveiled plans for
an injection of new capital and management.
Stores group Kingfisher declined 7 to 427p after BZW downgraded profits
expectations. The investment bank reduced its current year prediction by
Pounds 15m to Pounds 315m to take account of 'trading difficulties at
Woolworths (its high street subsidiary) and a higher than expected interest
charge'.
A recommendation from Kleinwort Benson boosted Ladbroke, 4 firmer at 162p.
Disappointing interim figures from Fine Art Developments, along with a
cautious outlook on the second half, saw the shares slide 44 to 376p.

FT  09 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Warburg bid war starts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The merchant bank sector was set alight with news that SG Warburg and big US
investment bank Morgan Stanley were in merger talks.
Speculation had been smouldering for some time, although it had focused on
US rival JP Morgan. Yesterday it flared up, prompting a Stock Exchange
announcement that share prices shown on dealing screens were merely
indicative.
An hour of intense upside pressure saw Warburg shares up 146p at their best
and forced the UK merchant bank to announce that it was in talks.
'Warburg has just bought itself into play and this one's going through the
roof,' said one dealer. 'It could go to Pounds 12 or Pounds 15.'
Many saw it as the opening of an auction that could include banks such as
Dresdner, of Germany. Credit Lyonnais Laing said: 'It is a once in a decade
event when a leading financial institution in the UK puts its hands up and
effectively says it would be better off as part of a larger group.' The
house would not comment on its valuations but rivals said it was talking of
an ultimate figure as high as Pounds 16.
James Capel believes a US bank such as JP Morgan might enter the fray,
perhaps because it merely wants to see the exit price bid higher but also
because it has previously expressed an interest.
Warburg shares closed 119 up at 791p on turnover of 10m, the second most
active volume recorded in the stock. Morgan Stanley was trading Dollars 1
higher at Dollars 57 7/8 in New York as London closed.
UBS, however, takes a more downbeat view. It believes that any merger will
run into big regulatory problems and a rival bidder is unlikely.

FT  09 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Merger story helps stabilise nervous
equities - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's equity market was given a massive shot in the arm after
confirmation of long-running stories that a bid move against SG Warburg,
perceived to be the UK's flagship merchant bank, could be in the offing.
News that Morgan Stanley, the world-ranked US investment bank, is seeking a
merger with Warburg sent the UK company's shares soaring and deflected some
of the market's worries about the mini-Budget forced on the chancellor by
the defeat of the government's proposed VAT tax on domestic fuel.
News that the chancellor had elected to shift the tax burden from domestic
fuel on to the consumer sector came as no surprise to a market which had
braced itself to expect such moves. Brewers, distillers and, to a lesser
extent, the oil companies, are expected to underperform the market this
morning.
On the other hand, the utilities, hit by worries that the mini-Budget could
have included moves to penalise the hugely profitable electricity
distribution stocks, generators and water companies, staged a good rally
after escaping the latest tax net.
At the close of the session the FT-SE 100 Index was 1.3 higher at 3,013.8,
after having swung in a 20-point arc, while the FT-SE Mid 250 Index settled
a net 2.6 firmer at 3,427.9.
Embellishing a trading session bursting with news and stories was the
unofficial market debut of BSkyB, the satellite television company, which
got off to an encouraging 5 per cent premium to its 256p striking price.
There was frantic trading in BSkyB shares, where turnover of 41m accounted
for a short 8 per cent of business in London's equity market.
There was considerable nervousness in London at the outset of trading, with
fund managers reluctant to trade ahead of the mini-Budget. The FT-SE 100
kicked off around four points lower but quickly stabilised and began to
gather upside momentum as stories of a bid for Warburg began to circulate in
the City's dealing rooms.
Confirmation from Warburg and Morgan Stanley that the two groups are
involved in talks which could lead to a merger saw Warburg shares retreat
sharply before embarking on another upsurge later in the day. Marketmakers
quickly adopted the view that the talks were the start of what could be one
of the biggest takeover battles in the UK financial sector.
'The view in the market is that Warburg is now very much 'in play' and that
a 'serious take-out' price will need to be well in excess of Pounds 12.50 a
share,' said one trader. 'JP Morgan was said to have been in talks with
Warburg two years ago, and has to be seen as a serious contender to launch a
counter to any merger offer from Morgan Stanley,' he added. Dresdner Bank
was also viewed as a likely counter-bidder to any moves.
The Warburg/Morgan Stanley news electrified the rest of the financials area,
where other merchant banks and brokers were chased higher. Smith New Court's
interim figures, although well down from last time, were much better than
some analysts had forecast, and the securities house - long regarded as the
most astute marketmakers in the City - was seen as a prime target for other
international financial services groups.
Transatlantic events, which have tended to dominate European markets in
recent weeks, played a much quieter part, although Wall Street was showing
ominous signs of weakening some two hours after London closed. Dealers in
London continued to point to the worrying events in the US, where Federal
Reserve chairman Mr Alan Greenspan recently spoke of the need to restrain
the US economy. The bankruptcy of Orange County, in California, and the
Magellen Fund's difficulty, were cited as further causes for concern.

FT  09 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures gained ground in thin volumes, with much of the day's
activity generated by the looming expiry of the FT-SE 100 December contract,
writes Jeffrey Brown.
At the close of pit trading the December contract was at 3,016, up 9 points.
The premium to the cash market was 4 points, or 2 points above fair value.
Activity was again minimal. Lots dealt totalled 18,672, but this included
close to 10,000 contracts of spread trading as dealers rolled over into the
March contract.
One point of interest was the widening in the premium at which the March
contract sells above December - from 13 points on Wednesday to 15 at the
outset yesterday, and almost to 18 at the close.
Dealers interpreted this as a clear sign of investor optimism as takeover
fever gripped the City's securities houses following news of SG Warburg's
merger discussions.
Traded option volume fell to 24,586 lots, from 33,407 on Wednesday, with
FT-SE and Euro FT-SE business accounting for 19,000. Retailer Argyll was the
most active stock option, having 761 contracts dealt.
BZW issued a novel Pounds 9bn warrants basket linked to smaller companies,
which the investment bank claimed is the first of its kind. The 50 companies
have an average market capitalisation of Pounds 200m.

FT  09 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Late plunge leaves Dow
sharply lower

Wall Street
US share prices nosedived in the late afternoon yesterday amid uncertainty
about the repercussions of the financial troubles in Orange County,
California, and renewed fears that the Federal Reserve would raise interest
rates in the near term, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 49.79 down at 3,685.73. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 weakened 5.78 to 445.45, the American SE composite slipped 6.38
to 422.81 and the Nasdaq composite fell 15.15 to 719.12. Trading volume was
extremely heavy on the New York SE at 362.8m shares.
The skid started late in the afternoon, with the Dow spiraling down more
than 57 points before bouncing up slightly. The market retained Wednesday's
skittish tone brought about by testimony in which Mr Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve, told a Congressional panel that he remained
concerned about inflationary pressures in the economy.
Mr Greenspan said he believed higher prices in raw materials and
intermediate goods would ultimately spill over to consumer prices, which had
held relatively steady this year.
With little other economic news yesterday, investors focused on the
comments, which many interpreted as a sign that the Fed would raise rates
again by early next year. The Fed has boosted rates six times this year, and
investors fear another increase would choke off corporate earnings by
slowing consumer demand and making borrowing more expensive.
Financial problems in Orange County continued to trouble the market.
Analysts remained uncertain how the bankruptcy would affect banks that had
been lenders to the county, and there was concern that other municipalities
might face similar crises.
Morgan Stanley initially bucked a downward trend among US investment banks
after reporting that it was in merger discussions with SG Warburg, but fell
with the market later in the day. The investment bank ended down Dollars 1
5/8 at Dollars 55 1/4 . Lehman Brothers lost Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 13 7/8
, Salomon Brothers fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 35 1/4 and Merrill Lynch
declined Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 33 1/2 .
Airline shares took a beating after two large carriers announced that they
anticipated weaker than expected results for the fourth quarter. Southwest
Air dropped Dollars 3 to Dollars 16 7/8 and Continental Air plummeted
Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 8 7/8 after both announced that fourth-quarter
results would probably come in below analysts' forecasts.
Apache gained Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 25 1/2 after an analyst from Bear
Stearns made a buy recommendation, saying its decline to Dollars 25 made it
an attractive value. The oil and gas firm's high for the year is Dollars 29
1/4 .
Caesars World rose initially and then receded to end Dollars  1/4 off at
Dollars 41 5/8 , after news that Bally Entertainment had the green light
from federal regulators to acquire a major stake in the casino company.
Bally was unchanged at Dollars 5 5/8 .
Canada
Concern over interest rates continued to depress the Toronto market, which
finished sharply weaker after moderate trading.
The TSE 300 index dropped 33.21 to 4,046.57 and declines outnumbered rises
by 473 to 291 after trading volume of 53.8m shares valued at CDollars 656m.
Only paper and forestry stocks made gains on the day. Brazil
Shares in Sao Paulo rose 3.7 per cent, with the biggest gains occurring in
blue chips, as investors bet on prospects for future growth. The Bovespa
index ended 1,715 up at 47,686.
A broker noted that buyers were building their portfolios for February
through the futures market. 'It is a financial operation,' he said, 'with
investors betting that share prices would be higher in February than at
present levels.'
The broker added that investors are confident that the economy will fare
strongly under the leadership of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who takes over
as president on January 1. Also, there are hopes for a great deal of
privatisation next year, he noted, and for this reason the market is
expected to rise strongly.
Investors were also encouraged by data from the Geography and Statistics
Institute that the country's GDP had risen by 6 per cent in the third
quarter of 1994 after the introduction of the new real currency on July 1.

FT  09 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses moved by individual
corporate news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate news was the main influence on bourses yesterday, writes Our
Markets Staff. Madrid and Milan were closed for a religious holiday.
FRANKFURT's fall in floor trading, the Dax index coming out 13.39 lower at
2,042.21, mostly incorporated the losses on Wednesday afternoon when the key
index closed at 2,044.4 in Ibis trading. Turnover fell from DM5.1bn to
DM4.2bn.
The session produced one big reaction, Bilfinger &amp; Berger falling DM44 or
5.4 per cent to DM775 after a further 20 per cent drop yesterday in the
share price of the construction group's Hong Kong offshoot B+B Asia. This
followed the unit's reported loss of HKDollars 80.6m from a major civil
engineering project linked to the colony's new airport.
The fall seemed belated, and perhaps arguable. B+B shares had fallen 12 per
cent in Hong Kong on Tuesday, and 11 per cent on Wednesday for precisely the
same reason. Furthermore, said Mr Karl Debenham, German market analyst at
Williams de Broe, Bilfinger had provided amply for such contingencies with
provisions of DM1.5bn against capital of DM1bn at the last balance sheet
date.
After hours, the Ibis-indicated Dax eased a fraction to 2,041.85.
In chemicals, Henkel recovered more of its recent losses, up DM6.40 at
DM539, but other selling targets like Deutsche Babcock and MAN in
engineering continued downwards, losing DM5.50 at DM193.50 and DM6 at DM397
respectively; Babcock disappointed with its recent progress report and MAN,
on an average rating, deserved to be there, said Mr Urs Emminger at CS
Investment Research in Zurich.
PARIS, having moved for most of the day in a range between 1,970 and 1,960,
fell away as Wall Street opened lower, and the CAC-40 index lost 15.75 at
1,954.09 in turnover of below FFr3bn.
Total, off FFr10.50 or 3 per cent at FFr319.80, was reported to have been
downgraded by a domestic broker, but no details were forthcoming. This
recommendation came a few days after a US broker raised its opinion on the
stock.
The automotive sector was generally weaker, with the exception of Valeo
which staged a partial recovery from Wednesday's 4 per cent fall, gaining
FFr6.70 or 2.6 per cent at FFr262.
Mr Keith Ashworth-Lord, head of research at Daiwa Europe, said he believed
the recent fall in Valeo's shares had been overdone. One of the reasons for
its weakness, he said, was due to a perception that the company had not been
able to pass on price rises in raw materials supplies, such as zinc and
copper. However, he added, the company had hedged itself against volat-ility
in commodities until the middle of next year, and was also showing a
significant improvement in winning market share from competitors.
AMSTERDAM fell back from opening levels, leaving the AEX index off 0.80 on
the day at 409.29.
VNU, the publishing and media group, which holds a 38 per cent stake in RTL,
a commercial broadcaster, was lifted by news that it had opened talks on
possible co-operation with a rival Dutch television production company.
VNU's shares gained Fl 2.50 or 1.5 per cent at Fl 171.50, and analysts
believed that a partnership agreement would limit further fragmentation of
the industry. Talks on partnership between RTL and another broadcasting
group foundered last month.
ZURICH edged higher in very quiet dealings, with many investors absent for a
religious holiday in parts of the country. The SMI index finished 5.0 ahead
at 2,589.3.
The continued firmness of the dollar attracted steady demand for industrials
with large exposure to the US currency. Nestle rose SFr7 to SFr1,252, Ciba
by SFr4 to SFr770 and Roche certificates by SFr40 to SFr5,850.
Banks, however, remained under pressure from further switches into the
insurance sector. CS Holding fell SFr8 to SFr528 ahead of news that it
planned to unify its share structure in a single class of registered shares,
while Swiss Re added SFr6 at SFr790.
A SFr25 fall to SFr610 in SMH was attributed to concern over the
watchmaker's Swatch sales. Interdiscount, the electronics retailer, fell
another SFr140 to SFr1,500 in further response to a bank's bearish note.
STOCKHOLM corrected recent falls, and the Affarsvarlden general index
rallied 4.6 to 1,476.4.
Ericsson staged a SKr4 or 1 per cent rebound to SKr405.5, supported by a
higher opening for telecommunications issues on Wall Street. However, this
did not fully erase Wednesday's 1.8 per cent dive, which was triggered by
rumours that Fidelity's Magellan Fund was selling its large stake.
HELSINKI's Hex index fell 11.8 to 1,867.7, but the country's second largest
forestry group, Kymmene, rose FM5 to FM125 after calling off a global equity
funding plan. Traders said that investors who had sold the shares to
subscribe to the issue bought them back on the news.
WARSAW fell 5.9 per cent, extending Wednesday's 4.3 per cent slide, with
selling pressure so strong that the bourse scaled down many sell orders and
cancelled trading in six issues. The Wig index lost 455.1 at 7,247.4 in
further reaction to plans for a 0.2 per cent stock transaction tax from
January.
Turnover picked up by 10 per cent to 610bn zlotys which, dealers said,
suggested that some bigger investors were buying stocks and that this might
help to cushion further falls today.

<TEXT>
Johannesburg struggled for direction as an initial gold share rally quickly
ran out of steam. Most stocks ended weaker in thin volume. Dealers said
Wednesday's large gold share gains had been overdone and that a soft bullion
price had slowed opening enthusiasm.
Industrials remained lacklustre, reflecting uncertainty about Wall Street
direction, a mixed performance from London and a lack of fresh factors
locally. The overall index lost 15.5 at 5,758.5, industrials fell 19.5 to
6,903.7 and golds slipped 21.1 to 1,950.8.
De Beers and Anglos each gave up 50 cents to R92.75 and R228.50
respectively. Gold Fields was R2 down at R120 but Gencor picked up 5 cents
to R13.80. Absa extended its recent strong run, adding 15 cents at R12.15,
but the rest of the banking sector was quiet.

low on fears of US rate rise

<TEXT>
On a day of little real movement the Nikkei 225 average finished slightly
higher but first section stocks as a whole eased a shade, most investors
staying on the sidelines in the absence of market-moving news, writes Robert
Patton in Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed 5.81 firmer at 19,180.04 after a day of quiet trading.
There was little activity other than arbitrage buying, but some brokers
pointed to the recovery of the US dollar above Y100 as an encouraging sign.
Throughout the day the index traded in a narrow range from a high of
19,288.36 to a low of 19,135.33.
Volume dipped to an estimated 210m shares from Wednesday's 222.17m. The
Topix index of all first-section stocks ended 4.29 off at 1,521.06, while
declining issues outscored advances by 586 to 358, with 227 stocks
unchanged. The capital-weighted Nikkei 300 slipped 0.95 to 280.50. In London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 4.52 at 1,263.59.
Steel shares lost ground on news that three Japanese carmakers will shift
some steel purchasing from Japan to South Korea, where prices are about 20
per cent lower.
Nippon Steel, which has agreed to reduce prices to carmakers by next spring,
fell Y6 to Y368 in the day's highest volume of 5.2m shares. NKK was off Y9
at Y269 and Kobe Steel shed Y5 to Y311, both in active trading. Sumitomo
Metal Industries slipped Y3 to Y320, but Kawasaki Steel ticked up Y1 to
Y410.
Most privatised issues lost ground. Japan Tobacco fell Y6,000 to Y950,000, a
new low following its October 27 listing. East Japan Railway receded Y4,000
to Y469,000, but NTT recovered Y5,000 to finish at Y469,000.
High-technology groups and integrated electricals declined across the board.
Toshiba lost Y13 at Y713, Matsushita Electric Industrial Y10 at Y1,580, Sony
Y50 at Y5280, NEC Y10 at Y1,140 and Sharp Y10 at Y1,710.
Game makers advanced. Sega Enterprises moved up for the ninth consecutive
day, climbing Y160 to Y5,710. Nintendo added Y100 at Y5,900.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 31.40 to 21,182.10 in volume of 58.3m
shares.
Roundup
US interest rate fears again cast a shadow over the region yesterday, with a
number of markets showing sharp downward swings.
The Pacific Basin region, excluding Japan, has delivered a disappointing
performance this year, and after staging a modest bounce between August and
October, has returned to levels seen at the start of July.
HONG KONG closed at a 14-month low as the spectre of rising US interest
rates continued to undermine sentiment. The Hang Seng index ended 200.19 or
2.4 per cent down at 8,068.31, taking its decline from January's peak to 36
per cent.
The December index futures contract heralded further market falls, dropping
to a discount to the physical market at 7,980, down 285 in heavy volume. In
subsequent London trading, prices steadied and the indicative index eased
another 27 to 8,042.
Brokers expressed concern that local stocks would fall further if Wall
Street continued to slide on fears of rising rates, and if funds migrated to
US bond markets from Asian equities. Reports this week of sinking demand for
residential properties also weighed on the market.
The property sub-index fell 467.76 or 3.3 per cent to 13,653.80. Cheung Kong
dipped 80 cents to HKDollars 30.80 and Sung Hung Kai Properties retreated
HKDollars 1.10 to HKDollars 47.90.
KUALA LUMPUR saw further heavy falls in Telekom Malaysia and Tenaga Nasional
which dragged the composite index down 26.34 or 2.8 per cent to 925.34, its
lowest close of the year.
The declines in Telekom and Tenaga were attributed to redemption of funds
and hedge-selling by foreign institutions, particularly in the US.
Tenaga Nasional finished 30 cents down at MDollars 9.80, falling below the
MDollars 10 level for the first time since mid-1993. Telekom relinquished 70
cents at MDollars 16.40.
SINGAPORE declined 1.9 per cent on continued selling by foreign investors in
anticipation of redemption of funds and on the withdrawal of retail
investors.
Brokers said overall sentiment was weak, hit by the Dow's overnight fall,
inflation warnings from the US Federal Reserve chairman Mr Alan Greenspan
and redemption-led selling in Malaysia.
The Straits Times Industrial index fell 40.70 to 2,139.68, while the UOB OTC
index, tracking Malaysian stocks, shed 17.67 to 1,066.11.
SEOUL encountered further institutional selling of blue chips, amid worries
about the market's direction, but demand remained strong for shares with
good earnings prospects. The composite index lost 15.23 or 1.4 per cent at
1,053.70.
Institutional investors were also worried that the central bank would
tighten its money supply policies after the bank penalised a commercial bank
with a large amount of one-day penalty funds for failing to meet its Won
reserve oblig-ations.
Most blue chips fell by their daily limits, Samsung Electronics and Posco
dipping Won3,000 and Won2,000 to Won112,500 and Won66,100 respectively.
BOMBAY extended its slide in sluggish trade on the last day of the current
account period, the BSE 30-share index weakening 52.66 or 1.3 per cent to
3,925.73, off 158.50 since Tuesday and 15.2 per cent down from its all-time
peak of 4,628.75 set on September 12.
SYDNEY was led higher by gains among non-resource issues, with light bargain
hunting following recent declines. The All Ordinaries index improved 5.8 to
1,875.0. Turnover was estimated at ADollars 361m.
An increase in November unemployment to 9.3 per cent, from 9.1 per cent a
month before, was said to have had little effect on sentiment, even though
it was at the top end of expectations.
Among the main movers, BHP rose 16 cents to ADollars 19.02, News Corp 14
cents to ADollars 5.06, and Fairfax a cent to ADollars 2.64.
In the banking sector, NAB firmed 6 cents to ADollars 10.70 and ANZ put on 3
cents at ADollars 3.98.
TAIPEI did not build on Wednesday's gains as some investors decided to take
profits. The weighted index eased 2.3 to 6,775.38 in turnover of TDollars
82.06bn.
Textile shares, which had been benefiting recently from price rises in the
sector, reversed early gains on profit-taking. Shinkong Synthetic Fibres
lost 20 cents at TDollars 35.40.
Cements outperformed the weak industrial sector, with Taiwan Cement adding
TDollars 1.20 or 2.4 per cent at TDollars 50.50.
MANILA also succumbed to profit-taking, following gains over the last three
sessions. The composite index surrendered 6.81 at 2,656.36.
Among sector indices, the commercial and industrial index retreated 8.24 to
3,922.14, while mines rose 16.50 to 4,543.68. Turnover was thin at just
968.7m pesos, against Wednesday's 1.42bn pesos.

FT  09 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Uncertainty about outlook for UK interest
rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling traded steadily yesterday, unaffected by the supplementary budget
statement presented by the chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke, writes Philip
Gawith.
The new revenue measures announced were in line with expectations, and there
was little market response.
Sterling closed one pfennig firmer in London at DM2.4674, from DM2.4576.
This upward move reflected Wednesday's 50 basis point rise in UK interest
rates, and came before Mr Clarke's budgetary remarks.
More interesting for the market was the appearance before the Treasury
select committee of Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England.
His comments left the market confused about the outlook for interest rates.
The dollar had a stronger day, moving from a morning low in Europe, of
DM1.5677 to a high later of DM1.5793. It finished slightly firmer against
the yen, at Y100.465, from Y100.15.
In Germany the Bundesbank council, as expected, left all its main interest
rates unchanged. The Swedish central bank also left rates unchanged, despite
expectations of a monetary tightening following recent strong data.
Mr George caused some confusion when he said he hoped that British interest
rates would plateau 'fairly soon'.
This appeared to contradict other parts of his testimony, which were seen as
pointing towards a further rate rise in the first quarter. Mr Richard
Phillips, analyst at brokers GNI, said: 'People are very confused about what
the peak is going to be in the interest rate cycle.'
Mr Mike Gallagher, director of IDEA, the financial analysis service, said Mr
George's comments 'held out that the top of the UK interest rate cycle was
nearer than in previous situations.' While this was good for short sterling,
'it tends to sap the upside potential of sterling.'
Mr George's comments were taken as a buy signal by short sterling traders,
and the March contract finished up at 92.59 from 92.56.
Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, said that with expectations of
another rise in US rates having hardened, following recent comments from Mr
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, there was now little to choose between
US and UK rates.
The March eurodollars contract is discounting an interest rate of 7.25 per
cent, compared to 7.41 for the equivalent short sterling contract.
Mr Turner said the danger for sterling was that by the end of the month the
market might be discounting higher interest rates in the US than in the UK.
It was possible, therefore, that a by-product of pre-emptive interest rate
rises in the UK might be a weaker pound, if this meant UK rates peaking at a
lower level than in the past.
Mr Robert Thomas, currency strategist at NatWest Markets, said the
preparedness of the chancellor to go along with the Bank cast a very
different complexion on UK monetary policy from in the past. In the short
term, he said, this would be good for sterling.
More immediately, he said, the outlook for sterling 'depends to what extent
it pays attention to economic fundamentals, or to political chaos.'
Although the dollar rose, the Orange County debacle in the US appears to be
acting as a brake. Mr Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency
Economics in New York, commented: 'There can only be one basis for linking
the dollar to the county: People now believe, quite correctly, that the Fed
is most unlikely to be tightening into this situation, on the grounds that
other hard-pressed entities - both public and private - could get pushed
over the edge after Orange.'
Mr Gallagher said the dollar's failure to move higher was a disappointment.
'The impetus that drove the dollar higher seems to have petered out,' he
said. He predicted a trading range, for the rest of the year, of DM1.5460 to
DM1.595.
He said there were definite signs of market activity slowing down, a little
earlier than was normal.
The Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds 740m in its daily
operations, after forecasting a Pounds 1.35bn shortage. It also provided
Pounds 615m at the new, higher established rate of 6 1/8 per cent. Three
month LIBOR firmed slightly to 6 15/32 per cent from 6 7/16 per cent.
