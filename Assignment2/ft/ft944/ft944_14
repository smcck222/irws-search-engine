<TEXT>
Darling Rachel,
Well, even if you weren't going to see Fascinating Aida, you'll sooner or
later find yourself quoting them anyway; so you'd better go sooner. Not that
I'm saying that you yet have any cause, while you're still only 20, to quote
a song like 'Fell in Love with a Man in Love with Another Man' . . .
But the pc song is bound to come in handy. 'We're politically correct,
politically correct, All phallocentric language we reject. It's no use
agreeing, We hate you just for being'. Try it some time over Christmas at
your father?
The great thing about Fascinating Aida, though, is not that you find
yourself quoting their words. Kit and the Widow are quoteworthy too, for
instance, but their music? The joke with those boys is that you've heard
just about all the music before.
With these three women - Adele Anderson, Issy van Randwick, and, most
delectably, Dillie Keane - it's the music that lodges the words under your
skin; the music, and their musicality in singing it. More particularly, the
contrast between what they're saying (mainly breathtakingly tough) and how
they're singing (mainly very sweet) develops an astonishing irony - like a
sugar-coated pill.
The way their swingle-jazz item, 'My Favourite Tool', also becomes a rap
number too is, I think, musically brilliant, and it has the audience
laughing long before they take in the words.
But about half their songs are quiet waltzes, and it's typical of them that
to the most tenderly Victorian of these they address, dolcissimo, 'Dear
little two-headed baby . . . the very last word in genetic mutation . . .
What joy to give birth at a hundred at eight . . .' As I quote the mere
words, their cynicism sounds all too horrid; but when you hear the music,
the honeyed lullaby-like hush of it adds the most bewildering charm to it.
Still, their lyrics are a marvel of polish. Triple rhymes abound. (On being
back with an old boyfriend: 'I'm deranged/ To think that you have changed/
I'd like to see your features rearranged.')
Camilla Park-and-Ride is there, and Mrs Major, and Naomi Campbell, and
Portillos. There's already a little song about the cancellation of extra VAT
on fuel. Especially in the second half, I guffawed at a number of unquotable
lines. But maybe their most wonderful feat is in putting together a whole
clutch of soft blues numbers in Part One - numbers that cause a ripple of
sympathy or approbation but scarcely one laugh. The mood darkens, and the
tender plight of modern women is expressed in several different facets.
'Fell in Love with a Man in Love with Another Man' is actually the most
beautifully haunting song of the evening.
I sound like a groupie, but no. After years of hearing about them, and
hearing cassettes of them, this is the first time I've actually been to see
them. Which is worth it from the first moment Dilly Keane appears, with her
dolorous face, big, hooded eyes, and the sagging corners of her dejected
mouth. Adele Anderson looks like a suave society lady from the 1950s; and
Issy van Randwick like what used to be called a calculating little minx. All
of which heightens the comedy; and turns the knife in the wound.
Come and stay if you're passing through London. Otherwise I'll see you at
Christmas.
Much love from your wicked uncle,
Garrick Theatre, WC1 until January 21

FT  08 DEC 94 / Arts: The Boat Plays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH HEMMING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As a mischievous antidote to Christmas jollification, the Gate has come up
with The Boat Plays, a trio of stern morality plays by the 16th century
Portuguese playwright Gil Vicente. Set just the other side of death, these
three short pieces - Boat to Hell, Boat to Purgatory and Boat to Heaven -
introduce a procession of the recently deceased, which arrives on the
foreshore where the boats are berthed, to be assigned seats in the
appropriate vessel by two ferrymen, Lucifer and God's Angel.
Needless to say, it is the Boat to Hell that is soonest booked up: in
Vicente's scolding satirical portrait of the afterlife even the Pope has to
fight for a place on the barque to heaven. The Queen of Portugal also finds
she has no ticket to paradise: this is daring writing from a man clearly
appalled at the ethical behaviour of his country, intent on warning the
Court that gold fever might lead to spiritual bankruptcy. The pieces are
driven by sardonic humour and the possibility of drawing on the terror of
fire everlasting.
It is hard to convey this state of mind to a contemporary audience, but
David Farr's vivid, imaginative production goes a long way. For a start, it
literally takes you into the world of the plays: Angela Davies' astonishing,
beautiful set transforms the entire auditorium into a Portuguese harbour.
The walls are clad in dark, stained wood, the floor, too, is a rickety deck
of planks, and the whole is lit to match the mood of each play - cold and
cheerless for the prospect of Purgatory, warm and flickering for the hope of
heaven. The audience is seated, judiciously, in the Boat to Purgatory,
allowing leeway for reform during the course of the evening - an outcome
made more likely by the pew-like hardness of the wooden benches.
The set, the visually witty direction and David Johnston's spitfire
translation lends life and atmosphere to what could remain a rather distant
ritual. The plays are not as dynamic or interesting as our mystery plays:
rather, they work as a theological debate and an expose of the shabby
conduct of Portuguese society - we see lackadaisical workers (who go to
Purgatory), corrupt pillars of society (who go to Hell) and thoroughly
rotten heads of church and state (who are given a chance to reform). As such
the pieces work their way through a queue of souls, and the only dramatic
conflict lies in what happens to each.
Farr's production works hard: he gives each piece a different mood and he
emphasises the play's pageant-like qualities by using puppets, masks and
clever visual composition. The cast revels in the funny, outsize
characterisation of each boat passenger and the production is whipped along
by two blazing performances from Tony Curran and Phil McKee, both red-haired
Scots, as the fearsome ferrymen.
Like many a sermon, the trilogy goes on after it has made its point: the
last piece, in particular, drags. But it offers an intriguing glimpse into
the belief of that world - rather like stepping into a church and seeing its
carved figures come to life - and Vicente's warning to get your spiritual
life ship-shape calls clearly across nearly 500 years.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Arts: Three pianists of note - Music in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last weekend we listened to two fast-rising pianists in their mid-20s
playing keyboard warhorses, and between them the vaguely ageless Melvyn Tan
gathering 19th-century rosebuds for his 1839 fortepiano. Heard in sequence,
they invited provocative (and invidious) comparisons. With young Lars Vogt -
second prizewinner at the 1990 Leeds Competition: I would have placed him
first - came the bonus of an enterprising London Symphony programme; Richard
Hickox conducted Malcolm Arnold's Fifth Symphony and a forgotten early Elgar
cantata, The Black Knight.
Glancing at Boris Berezovsky's Wigmore programme for Saturday, one's spirits
sank a little. It is four years since he won the Tchaikovsky Competition,
and thereupon began an international career, but here he was offering the
standard Russian-virtuoso menu: Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition and
Ravel's Gaspard de la nuit and La Valse. It was enlarged by the latter's
gentler Valses nobles et sentimentales, and a raw, literal transcription of
Rimsky's version of the former's Night on Bare Mountain.
In fact Berezovsky excelled in that, translating the unpianistic writing
into vividly plausible 'orchestral' colours and drama. His Pictures,
however, were chiefly remarkable for their lack of any interesting ideas at
all - unless you count taking the seminal Promenade so fast as to suggest
that instead of promenading around the exhibition the composer was striding
straight through it, looking neither to right nor left. All the other
character-pieces were conventionally read, without an individual spark,
though delivered with athletic efficiency and much noise.
In Ravel's Gaspard, 'Ondine' had an indeterminate right hand, swollen
dynamics and a perfunctory solo lament for the mermaid. Berezovsky seems to
lack the knack for sustaining expectation and suspense: 'Le Gibet' and
'Scarbo' sagged limply in their hushed middles. The refined Valses needed
more distinctive stamps, like the Pictures, and far more sensitive
appreciation of Ravel's classical pudeur. La Valse was very loud from the
start and increasingly inaccurate. This rather dashing pianist can surely do
better.
At the Barbican the next afternoon, Melvyn Tan gave us one of his inimitable
exhibitions of pure (if slightly precious) character on a period instrument.
He is shameless about his graces - here a suspension of breath, there an
exquisitely drawn-out phrase - but he rollicks wholeheartedly in his music.
Reduced to their original salon-scale, Mendelssohn's op. 67 Songs without
Words and the four great Schubert Impromptus of D935 still sounded charming
and vital. Tan revelled in bright effects that could not be reproduced on a
20th-century grand piano - and his artful innocence is always a tonic. Both
Schubert's A major Sonata, D664, and Schumann's no. 2 in G minor contained
similar illuminations, but one pined nevertheless for the sustaining power
of the modern instrument.
With the LSO that evening, Vogt gave the freshest, most searching and most
brilliantly accomplished account of Rakhmaninov's 'Paganini' Rhapsody that I
have heard in a long while. Sulphurous in all the right places (and cleanly
articulate), positively elevated in the almost-kitsch 18th variation,
pausing for pregnant thought between others: how many 24-year-old pianists
combine such mature authority with the elan of youth?
There, the LSO were not always spot-on. Probably their rehearsal-time went
to Arnold and the unknown Elgar. Hickox conducted Arnold's Seventh
immaculately, I thought; its wild juxtapositions of formal and popular,
ingratiating and surly by turns, got full-blooded realisations and
ultra-smooth gear-shifts. There is a kind of towering fury behind this
strange symphony and we were made to feel it.
Young Elgar's 1893 Black Knight, with the London Symphony Chorus, proved
comparatively tame, though worth a one-off revival. It was not a precocious
score, for he was already 36. A few pungently characteristic ideas; too much
routinely heavy-duty Victorian orchestration, with tuba; a more than usually
dreadful, mawkish Longfellow text (after Uhland), awkwardly set with many
false emphases. One was grateful to have heard it, but felt no pressing need
for deeper acquaintance.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Technology: The new road sense - Telematics promises to
revolutionise transport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government ministers from around the world and about 2,000 expert delegates
met in Paris last week to explore the vast implications of transport
telematics.
Telematics is the pooling of information and telecommunications technology
to provide new systems and services. The message after three days of the
first world congress on transport telematics is that the technology will:
Bring radical change to how cars and trucks are designed and built, with
significant safety advances such as automatic collision avoidance; radically
change the way cars are used - drivers travelling on 'intelligent' highways
may even be denied direct control of the vehicles in which they are
travelling, yielding control to roadside computers giving instructions to
the car by infra-red beams.
Create international networks of these 'intelligent' highways, capable of
guiding drivers across continents, around traffic jams and other
obstructions to any chosen destination. However, they will also have
controversial 'Big Brother' capabilities of continually monitoring the
location and speed of entire vehicle populations.
Save at least Ecu20bn (Pounds 16.6bn) a year on the cost of congestion,
accidents and environmental damage in the European Union alone, according to
European Commission estimates.
Create vast new markets for the manufacturers and servicers of telematics
technology.
US expenditure on transport telematics alone is predicted to be nearly
Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.6bn) by the beginning of the next decade, according
to the Commission's forecasts. In Europe, it estimates the EU market to
equip cars with telematics technology will be worth Ecu6bn over the next 10
years.
'Intelligent' highways do not necessarily mean more highways. The technology
is aimed primarily at adapting existing highway networks and greatly
increasing the 'intelligence' of cars to take the best advantage of them.
Vehicles will be able to 'talk' to each other and with 'intelligent' highway
control and monitoring systems. There will be on-board computers,
micro-sensors, satellite positioning, synthetic voice transmission, digital
road maps, radio telephones, infra-red and hyper-frequency beacons and
detectors.
Cars of the next century, for example, should be involved in far fewer
accidents, making a big contribution to transport efficiency. Cars will be
equipped with ultra-violet or infra-red headlamps for improved night vision.
They will have a radar and infra-red based intelligent cruise control
system, automatically maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle ahead,
and use video image processing systems to stop straying between lanes.
Should this fail and the car crashes, on-board sensors will automatically
report the car's position to traffic controllers via the route guidance
system in the dashboard which is in constant communication with a
geo-positioning satellite.
The car will exchange transmissions with roadside beacons, also using mainly
infra-red, receiving information on traffic congestion, with suggested
alternative routes for the route guidance system. It will transmit, via the
roadside beacons, information about its intended destination to regional
control centres.
Most of this technology has already been developed under the just-concluded,
eight-year Ecu900m-Prometheus collaborative research programme among
Europe's car, truck and electronic systems makers.
Cost remains a problem - only volume production can reduce the current cost
of several thousand dollars of some of the more complex systems. But some
others, such as ultra-violet night vision, could be introduced now for
Dollars 500 or less. There are other benefits. Not least, while
environmentalists may shudder at Commission estimates that transport demand
in the EU will double by 2010, they may take comfort in the fact that the
more efficient use of highway space promised by the telematics revolution
should mean less land will be taken for new highways.
With the technology at hand, the question for the world's transport
authorities is how best to exploit it.
Among examples of what is possible, Philips Electronique of France
demonstrated in Paris the latest developments in its satellite-based Carin
in-car navigation system, capable of guiding a vehicle across France,
through digital maps on a dashboard display. UK-based Racal Messenger showed
Talon, a video-based system for automatic reading of vehicle registration
plates - a potential boon for police use.
Trafficmaster, also from the UK, displayed its portable route guidance and
traffic information system. The Pounds 200 unit - plus Pounds 19.50 a month
airtime subscription - uses infra-red sensors and a radio unit mounted on
motorway bridges and gantries. When sensors detect congestion, the
information is radioed back to Trafficmaster's control centre at Milton
Keynes and relayed 24 hours a day, to the map and information screens of
subscriber units. The system covers all UK motorways.
It is the only system in the world operating in 'real time' on such a scale,
and adds substance to the contention of the European Commission that the
heavy investments in transport telematics research made by European industry
and research teams has provided a short-term technical advantage over
competitors in North America and Japan. However, the Commission has just
finished drafting an action plan for implementing transport telematics in
the EU, to be presented shortly to the European Parliament, which warns the
advantage is at risk unless the EU as a whole and member states co-ordinate
better in key areas.
European manufacturers of vehicles and vehicle telematics systems believe
that projects such as Prometheus have given the region a technological lead
in many key areas. Prometheus, the biggest collaborative motor industry
research programme undertaken anywhere in the world, had a spectacular
finale in Paris in October, when more than 90 prototype vehicles
demonstrated the complete array of telematics technology.
But developments are also moving rapidly in North America and Japan. The US
Department of Transportation has just announced a 'national automated
highway' research programme - a Dollars 200m, seven-year venture with a
GM-led consortium to build a demonstration 'intelligent' highway capable of
'convoying' vehicles: roadside sensors would place the vehicle under the
control of computers linked to regional control centres. Vehicles would be
bunched much more closely together than in normal driving, with the computer
system operating brakes and accelerator by remote signal.
Such a system would use road space more efficiently. But many at the
congress fear such a project may be overambitious. They point to the safety
implications and the question of liability in case of accident. It is the
belief that such systems lie further into the 21st century that has led
Europe to concentrate more on autonomous systems for use in the car which
help or warn drivers, rather than wrest control of the car from them.
In Japan, drivers are already using route guidance and in-car telematics
aids. As Shoichiro Toyoda, Toyota's chairman, pointed out at the congress,
some 700,000 Japanese motorists have already purchased such systems, 350,000
in the past year.
Thus while Europe might have a technological edge and North America the
political will to lead, in manufacturing terms, the basis for a new industry
once again appears to be emerging first in Japan.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nicholas Sheehan, who is joining the board of Pillar Property, is no
stranger to Raymond Mould and Patrick Vaughan, chairman and chief executive.
As a director of London &amp; Edinburgh Trust, Sheehan rode the 1980s property
boom alongside Mould and Vaughan, who ran Arlington Securities before its
acquisition by British Aerospace in 1990.
LET was floated in 1983 with a market capitalisation of Pounds 24m and was
acquired near the peak of the market, for Pounds 490m, by Swedish insurance
group SPP. When SPP stepped in, Sheehan took over as chief executive and
stayed through the depths of recession - including LET's Pounds 448m loss in
1992 - before resigning in March this year.
'We used to look over the fence to see what they were up to at Arlington,'
says Sheehan. 'The corporate styles of the two companies were always similar
 -a small team with lots of ambition. I am looking forward to getting back
into that environment.'
While Sheehan's role at Pillar has not been closely defined, he will be seen
as a replacement for Robert Maxted, who resigned as property director in
October having been with the company since its formation in 1991.

<TEXT>
The government has announced the appointment of a new chairman of the
Forestry Commission to succeed Sir Raymond Johnstone, who has retired. Sir
Peter Hutchison, chairman of Hutchison and Craft insurance brokers, takes on
the top post at the Forestry Commission at a crucial time for the industry.
He will preside over the transformation of Forest Enterprise, the commercial
arm of the Commission, into a Next Steps agency to be run in a more
business-like fashion. This follows the government review of forestry which
decided against privatisation in August.
The Forestry Commission is still a government department, and Forest
Enterprise will be run in a more commercial way, but will still be
answerable to the commission. The government's plans for Forest Enterprise
have been criticised by environmental groups as a way of privatising by the
back door. As part of a government working party Sir Peter recently advised
the government on the development potential of the Loch Lomond and Trossachs
areas of Scotland.

FT  08 DEC 94 / People: Waldegrave's thinking CAPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, plans to turn the government's
long-term antipathy towards the Common Agricultural Policy into clear
proposals for reform by next year. He has just announced the appointment of
a new group - chaired by him - which will discuss ideas on all aspects of UK
policy on the CAP.
Waldegrave believes the CAP will have to be reformed extensively before it
can accommodate enlargement to eastern European countries. He has charged
his new group of 11 strong-minded individuals from all sectors of the
farming and food industry with suggesting imaginative and practical ways to
develop government thinking on the subject.
The members of the CAP committee include Bridget Bloom, who was the FT's
agriculture correspondent from 1987 to 1992 and now sits on the Meat and
Livestock Commission and the Forestry Commission, and Fiona Reynolds,
director of the Council for the Protection of Rural England.
Many of the members have farming interests: Chris Haskins, chairman of dairy
group, Northern Foods, lives on a farm in east Yorkshire and Ewen Cameron
farms in Somerset and is vice chairman of the Country Landowners'
Association. Poul Christensen farms in Oxfordshire and Dorset and is soon to
join the board of Milk Marque, the farmers' dairy co-operative.
Helen Browning is an organic farmer and chairman of the British Organic
Farmers. Lord Plumb is a member of the European Parliament as well as a
farmer and former president of the National Farmers' Union.
In addition, Waldegrave has included four academics: Professor Allan
Buckwell from Wye College, University of London, Graham McConnell, principal
of Harper Adams Agriculture College in Shropshire who worked as an
agricultural adviser in New Zealand, David Pearce, professor of
environmental economics at University College, London, and Sean Rickard,
lecturer in business economics at the Cranfield School of Management, who
was until recently chief economist at the NFU.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Technology: Worth taking the trouble - Roland Adburgham on
technical advice for small companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most difficult thing we face,' said John Emanuel, managing director of
the consultancy Pax Technology Transfer, 'is mind-set: 'I've got my car, my
holidays - I don't want the trouble'.'
He was telling a seminar about the common response of directors to the idea
of using technology to expand their businesses. His view was echoed by other
specialists who feel that many UK companies, especially small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), are too wary of technology transfer.
'There is a strong disinclination to change in this country,' said Ian
Harvey, chief executive of British Technology Group.
The seminar was at TransTech International, a fair organised in Cardiff last
week by the Welsh Development Agency and partly funded by the European
Commission's Stride programme, which aims to strengthen the innovation
capabilities of SMEs in assisted areas. The fair sought to encourage
companies to benefit from technology transfer.
'Innovation, or particularly technology transfer, is vital to long-term
industrial health and growth,' said Harvey, stressing it was as important
for service companies as for manufacturers. 'Technology transfer is not a
zero-sum game. It is an international game of mutual benefit to the
players.'
He had a caveat. 'Technology is often the key to innovation, but it is only
part of the total mix.'
Two basic approaches were outlined. A business could license out its own
technology, earning fees or royalties. Alternatively, it could license in,
or buy the rights to, technology from academic institutions or companies and
organisations. 'Companies need to scour the world for the technology they
require - often it need not and should not be developed in-house,' Harvey
said.
While Harvey added that larger companies needed their own research and
development base, Anne Powell, of the Academic Industry Links Organisation,
observed: 'R&amp;D costs for SMEs often look extraordinarily high.' She stressed
the value of collaborative research. 'Universities are still a very much
under-used resource as far as UK companies are concerned.'
Donal O'Connor, of the Licensing Executives Society in Britain and Ireland,
agreed R&amp;D had many uncertainties. 'For small-to-medium companies, often the
buying-in of technology and expertise is better than doing one's own
research.' Paying a royalty of 5 to 10 per cent of a product's sale price
might seem high, but it could be minimal compared with the cost of an R&amp;D
department.
He said technology transfer 'is used much more often by large companies than
small, but in my view is more useful for small companies.' He outlined the
basic steps of technology acquisition as: identification of need; sourcing
and assessment of technology; negotiation of the licence; and financing the
deal.
In the search for suitable technology, O'Connor advised, much could be done
in-house: through contact with government and support agencies, trade
literature, patent searches, trade associations, innovation centres and
venture capital firms. SMEs, despite constraints on management time, should
initially do much of their own technology sourcing to enable them to
understand the process.
But Emanuel felt companies always needed help in seeking ideas and strategic
partners, with help from consultants. A searcher might need to identify a
couple of hundred projects before shortlisting 10 to 15 for board
discussion. Typically, the time taken to reach a licensing agreement is six
to 18 months.
Roland Whaite, of the UK Patent Office, said much duplication of research
could be saved by looking at patent disclosures - Hitachi, he mentioned,
employed about 150 staff to search patents continuously. If people did not
examine patents, they ran the risk of missing much information which was not
published in any other form.

FT  08 DEC 94 / People: Green adviser for Jupiter Tyndall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stanley Johnson, the ebullient environmentalist who recently penned what
many deem to be one of the leading tomes on the Rio earth summit, is joining
the 'Green' advisory committee at investment managers Jupiter Tyndall.
Johnson will join a team advising the City of London's longest-established
environmental investment company. Jupiter Tyndall has two 'Green' funds; the
International Green Investment Trust and The Jupiter Ecology Fund.
Reflecting the still embryonic status of ethical funds, the two account for
just Pounds 50m of the Pounds 4.2bn Jupiter Tyndall has under management.
The Jupiter advisory committee comprises three familiar environmentalists
who help to shape the research, methods and priorities of the research
department. Johnson, who is also an adviser on environmental matters to
Coopers and Lybrand, should help to sharpen the committee's teeth in
deciding in which companies the funds should be invested.
Apart from serving in a variety of environmentally-sensitive positions at
the European Commission, he sat as a member of the European Parliament from
1979-84.
Johnson's arrival represents a shot in the arm for Jupiter Tyndall after the
departure earlier this year of Tessa Tennant, the high-profile campaigner on
ethical investment issues, together with other members of the ethical
investment team to National Provident Institution.
Tennant's move was followed by the resignation of the entire Advisory
Committee, which is now gradually being replaced. NPI, which has had
relatively limited exposure to environmental funds, wants to beef up its
standing in ethical investments for pension fund clients.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Ripples on the
Danube - Advertisers in Hungary are putting their own campaign together
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These days neon lights pierce the Budapest skyline and slick posters on
trams and at bus stops brighten up the city's once grey boulevards. Local
pop stars advertise state-of-the-art western televisions, luxury cars and
mobile telephones from billboards.
The campaign preoccupying Hungarian advertisers at the moment, however, is
one aimed at promoting themselves.
'This is a relatively new and growing industry in Hungary, but one which is
not well understood,' says Ildiko Takacs, a former head of Young and
Rubicam's local operation and president of the Hungarian chapter of the
International Advertising Association (IAA). Her hope is that the IAA's
lobbying will persuade the government and a sometimes sceptical public that
the industry's old-fashioned regulatory framework needs to be liberalised.
Advertising is a flourishing sector in an economy which has shrunk by 20 per
cent in the last five years. 'Growth in the industry has been spectacular,'
says Peter Nagy, secretary general of the Hungarian Advertising Association.
'Five years ago there were no billboards. Now we have 14,000. In newspapers
and magazines you never used to see a full-page ad.'
Nagy says spending on advertising jumped from Ft7bn (Pounds 40m) in 1989 to
Ft33bn in 1993 and is likely to reach up to Ft42bn this year - even given
average annual inflation of around 25 per cent.
It is also a sector in which western influence and dominance has been
greatest. The severe recession has caused the country's traditional
advertisers, big state enterprises and retail chains, to cut back. Western
consumer goods and service companies, fighting for a share in newly opened
eastern European markets, have filled the gap.
Western companies or foreign-owned joint ventures account for 75-85 per cent
of advertising spending, according to HAA estimates. New local advertisers,
notably banks and financial service companies eager to woo Hungary's growing
middle classes, have quickly caught on to slick, western advertising
techniques.
Western agencies have followed their international clients. 'A decade ago
the market was shared by a handful of companies. Now we have several hundred
mainly small private companies and 18 multi-nationals with local offices or
joint ventures,' says Nagy.
Local agencies have lost business to the multinationals, which control more
than two-thirds of the market, but are beginning to fight back. 'The
multinationals have greatly raised the quality of advertising. This has had
a spill-over effect on local companies which have been forced to improve to
survive,' says Nagy. As the economy recovers, local companies will be
well-positioned to attract business from the emerging private sector, he
says.
But Hungarian advertisers complain that regulation has lagged behind the
changes in the sector. The main aim behind their campaign is to press the
country's new government to provide the industry with legislation in line
with western European norms. The few regulations which exist date mainly
from the 1970s.
'The main difficulty is that we're working in a 'grey area'. At the moment
there are no definitions of advertising and therefore no framework for
regulation,' says Michael Parsons, spokesman for Philip Morris's central and
eastern European division.
The previous conservative government produced several draft advertising
bills but could never agree on a final version. Hungarians are divided over
advertising, with many ambivalent towards the industry, says Nagy. 'Many
feel we have too much advertising. They are overwhelmed.'
Another problem is western advertisements with little sensitivity to the
local market. Judit Fekete, editor-in-chief of Propaganda Reklam, a leading
local trade magazine, says: 'Most of the big campaigns are global and are
aired here with few changes. But many western advertisements don't fit into
our way of living - for example, soap powder or detergent commercials filmed
in huge, luxurious kitchens. Hungarians are shocked at the opulence. Few
people in this country have kitchens like that.'
She says campaigns made by western agencies for eastern markets are often
not much better: 'One car company showed Mr Kovacs - Mr Smith - choosing his
first new car in 26 years. This type of ad is extremely patronising.'
But the most contentious issue is a 1978 ban on advertising alcohol, tobacco
and pharmaceutical products. 'One of the worst aspects of this ban is that
it is ambiguously worded,' says Nagy. 'The law forbids advertising which
'encourages the consumption' of alcohol and tobacco. We are constantly being
asked whether this means a total ban or not.'
Companies have found many ways to get around the ban. One is to simply
ignore it, says Fekete. 'The press is full of ads for banned products. The
cost of fines is simply built in to the cost of the ad.'
Sponsorship is the most popular legal way for alcohol and tobacco companies
to promote their brands. Companies give their name to a sporting event or a
music festival, which they advertise heavily.
Other ploys include distributing ashtrays, table-cloths, pens, coasters and
other gimmicks emblazoned with brand logos. Cigarette companies have
launched clothing and footwear lines and advertised these to spread their
brand names.
Tobacco and alcohol companies argue that advertising merely influences
consumers' choice of brand. But industry analysts say financial arguments
are the most likely to convince the public and the government to accept more
advertising and a limited lifting of the bans. Some estimate that adopting
UK or German-style regulations - which allow tobacco and alcohol advertising
in the press, posters at the point of sale - would inject as much as Dollars
100m (Pounds 67m) into the economy.
Takacs says: 'One of the messages we need to get across in the campaign is
that without advertising, the press is more expensive and less profitable.
That isn't good for the public or for the government's tax revenues.'

FT  08 DEC 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Ringing the tills -
Retailers should focus on the phone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electronic home shopping may be the coming thing, but many UK retailers do
not yet seem to have got to grips with the plain old telephone.
One in five customers phoning shops to find out about, for example, opening
hours or availability of products fails to get through at the first attempt,
and may decide to go elsewhere. The finding comes from research conducted by
the Henley Centre, the forecasting group, for the British Retail Consortium
and British Telecommunications.*
Henley describes the telephone as a 'low-tech bridge to the high-tech
future'. The most sophisticated consumers, who are also often those with the
highest disposable incomes, show the most interest in phone-based buying.
'The first retailers to offer a credible telephone service could well gain
real strategic advantage. Those retailers who cannot compete could soon lose
position,' the group warns.
Henley's findings on the state of retailers' telephone systems comes from a
large 'mystery shopping' exercise, using researchers posing as consumers,
conducted in September. More than 800 outlets, including clothes, DIY and
grocery stores, as well as travel agents, cinemas and restaurants, were
phoned for Henley by specialist group MSS.
Of the unsuccessful calls, two-thirds were due to engaged lines, while the
remaining third just carried on ringing. Of those that were successful,
nearly 20 per cent took more than five rings to answer and a similar
proportion were handed on to a second person to deal with.
These transfers took an average of 30 seconds - a long time to be left in
what was generally a silent limbo, says Henley. Two-thirds told callers why
they were being transferred, but only half were given the name of the person
to whom they were being connected. Once passed on to a second department,
almost all callers were asked to repeat their previous questions.
When the right person was found, staff had to leave the phone to track down
information in a quarter of cases, with an average wait of 48 seconds,
although almost a third had to wait up to three minutes. Shop staff seldom
have all the information they need at their fingertips, despite the advanced
technology being used for stock control, says Henley.
The 'mystery' shoppers rated the manner of staff highly: 'In most cases,
staff sounded friendly, professional and happy to answer the query.'
Interestingly, the more complex the inquiries, the more motivated staff
appeared to be to answer them. 'With difficult questions, staff sounded
happier, more friendly and more knowledgeable,' observes Henley.
Clearly, retailers need to balance the needs of customers visiting the store
with the demands of consumers on the telephone. One recommendation from the
study is that retailers should consider installing automatic call answering
systems to handle routine questions, such as opening hours and locations,
while diverting more complicated queries to specially-trained staff.
Overall, Henley estimates that 78m calls a year are currently made to
retailers in the UK - a figure which is forecast to grow to nearly 400m by
the end of the decade as consumers increasingly expect to operate in a
'teleculture'.
A separate consumer study conducted for the report showed that, in spite of
patchy performance, shoppers are reasonably happy with the telephone service
they currently receive. But this cannot continue, Henley concludes.
'Customers' expectations are rising. They are becoming more confident about
complaining. And if they do not complain, they vote with their feet.
Innovative operators in other sectors, such as First Direct, Next Directory
and Direct Line all offer effective telephone services. Why not retailers?'

FT  08 DEC 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Outlook bright for
ads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Worldwide advertising expenditure during 1994 looks as if it will have grown
6.4 per cent in current prices over the year, up from a July forecast of 5.5
per cent, reports Zenith Media Worldwide, the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi-owned
media-buying group*.
Zenith now says that the four-year outlook to 1997 looks the brightest since
1988, with 'vigorous growth in prospect, even in mature advertising
markets'.
In the US, spending is set to rise 4.7 per cent in 1995 and 5.4 per cent the
following year, stimulated by the presidential election and Atlanta
Olympics. The spending recovery in Europe is 'gaining consistency and
momentum,' says Zenith, and heading for 11 per cent growth by 1997.
The Japanese market will see modest annual growth of 2-3 per cent between
1995 and 1997, after a recovery of 0.3 per cent this year. In the rest of
the Asia Pacific region, spending growth continues to accelerate and will
reach 16.4 per cent by 1997, according to the forecasts.
Compound growth between 1994 and 1997 in the region, excluding Japan, should
reach 26.5 per cent. Overall, advertising expenditure worldwide is set to
grow 8.1 per cent in 1995, 9.8 per cent the following year, and 11.7 per
cent in 1997, all at current prices.
Separately, Lintas Worldwide, the Interpublic-owned agency network, warns
this week that the recession may be over economically in Europe 'but
psychologically it's not'. There remains great caution among consumers and
subsequently among advertisers.
Says Terry Rosenquist, head of Lintas Europe: 'The recession has led to
fierce competition, with the retail trade sector putting immense pressure on
FMCG manufacturers. These in turn have cut ad spending.'

FT  08 DEC 94 / Accountancy: Hard times give way to great expectations - Jim
Kelly on why proposals in the Audit Agenda may restore the profession's
credibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Audit Agenda, published yesterday by the Auditing Practices Board,
provides a framework for reform which promises, in the eyes of the authors
at least, to restore the reputation of auditors after the bruising corporate
failures of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Something of the expectations it will excite can be judged by the report's
own definition of audit. The authors note that the word comes from the Latin
for 'hear': the auditor they envisage is the shareholder's sentry. 'Audit is
about governance,' says the report: 'It is about upholding integrity of
financial reporting and business conduct, it is about seeking the truth.'
This image of the auditor was wounded by company collapses which followed
swiftly on from the signing of unqualified accounts. In response, the
Auditing Practices Board was founded in 1991, and in 1992 the McFarlane
Report was published - the 'green paper' to yesterday's 'white paper'.
Other factors than perceived failure have crowded round the auditor in the
last decade. Aggressive competition since the mid 1980s and the introduction
of advertising have pressed down on fees and threatened quality. Firms have
grown beyond the limits of the old threshold of 20 partners. The threat of
facing legal actions for damages has led to caution and a reliance on the
rule book to support audit opinion.
The Audit Agenda seeks to restore the role of personal judgment to the
auditor and to alter corporate governance to support the auditor's
objectivity. 'Audit is about judgment which in the final analysis is
personal: an expert view with personal accountability,' says the report.
Many of the proposals in the Audit Agenda take up the ideas in the Cadbury
Report on corporate governance. Indeed one of its authors has described it
as an early instalment of Cadbury II - the promised development of the
original report which is due to get under way next year.
It is worth looking briefly at the main proposals.
Audits at listed companies would be more extensive than those at
owner-managed companies. The scope of the statutory audit would stay the
same, but these extended duties will be backed up by standards which have
the power of law.
The extended audit duties would be covered by contracts limiting liability.
Auditors would have to make sure that the text sections of accounts, such as
the chairman's report, match the accounts they have audited.
The audit would be signed by a partner. At present the accounts carry only
the name of the firm from which the auditor comes. The authors of the report
think this will emphasise personal responsibility.
The audit partner should not have overall control of non-audit services for
the company.
Audit committees would have responsibility for appointing the auditors and
setting their fees.
The chairman of the audit committee would report on the auditor to the AGM -
possibly in writing and orally.
Separate reports would be made to the board and the audit committee by the
auditor on standards of governance - and to the shareholders on whether the
so-called Cadbury Code is being followed properly.
Auditors would comment on internal audit controls.
The board would order periodic forensic audits in which teams of specialists
look for fraud.
The penalties for deceiving auditors would be toughened up and staff would
face penalties as well. At present, they cannot be punished for misleading
an auditor.
The professional bodies would teach auditors about fraud.
APB and the Accounting Standards Board would work on how to assure secondary
and tertiary stakeholders in the company. While the primary duty is to the
shareholders, as confirmed by the Caparo test case, other stakeholders
should be able to rely on assurances given by auditors. The authors suggest
that some groups, such as employees, should be able to contract the auditors
to provide assurance.
These proposals contain several fundamental ideas. Principally, the report
identifies the role of the auditor as being different in quality to other
services offered to a company. It is often forgotten 'that the audit service
is different in that the auditor's opinion is of benefit to the users of
financial information and confidence in the capital markets, as well as for
the benefit of the company itself'.
Proposals in the report to ensure the audit partner is not in control of
trying to market other services to the company he audits will help dispel
the widespread mistrust of the practice of selling management consultancy
services, or information technology advice, to audit customers. The report
makes it clear that the auditor must be seen not to face a conflict of
interest.
The proposal to limit liability for the extended audit on listed companies
will excite those looking for a way forward in the current morass over
litigation. UK auditors face increasing claims against them and the Big Six
firms are still lobbying the government to change the law and allow them to
limit their liability in such cases.
The campaign on limiting liability has run into the sand in the short term.
The report's suggestion holds the promise of allowing audit services beyond
those on the statute book to be limited in liability through contract. If
this is successful, and becomes an established practice, would not the
campaign to limit liability completely be that much more attractive to the
government?
The Audit Agenda also recognises for the first time in the UK the different
audit needs of large listed companies and smaller owner-managed ones. The
APB is to work on special guidance for smaller companies on audit. This work
will mirror the current debate on how Generally Accepted Accounting
Standards (GAAP) should differ between large and small companies. Whatever
the outcome, the owners of non-listed businesses will be looking for a
decrease in the burdens of compliance.
The training of auditors forms a strong thread throughout the report. The
authors are keen for the profession to be seen to discuss fraud openly - no
longer protected by the curious argument that examining fraudulent methods
in public provides criminals with the means to commit new crimes.
Behavioural and forensic training is seen as vital along with regular
seminars on how to spot fraud and fraudsters. One of the authors even sees
the chance of producing a list of tell-tale signs of fraud to help the less
experienced.
The role of the audit committee is pivotal in the proposals. The authors see
its members as the direct representatives of the shareholders who are, after
all, the ones to whom the auditor has a responsibility to report. The
enhanced role envisaged for the audit committee adds to the power of the
non-executive directors who sit on it and who must, in future, take
responsibility for monitoring the auditor.
The APB may well have come of age with the publication of the Audit Agenda.
It has prepared the ground well before publication and it has left behind
the contentious ideas thrown up by the earlier McFarlane Report. The
proposals look practical and the strong emphasis on the public interest may
well serve the profession well in the battles ahead on self-regulation.

FT  08 DEC 94 / After The VAT Vote: Wealth of tax options to make up Budget
shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor has probably received as much advice as to the contents of
his so-called mini-budget to be delivered today as for the main event
delivered to the House of Commons only nine days ago.
Newspapers, economic analysts, and even his political opponents have all
offered their chosen tax options - but Mr Clarke has a well-earned
reputation for being able to produce political surprises.
His announced intention is to plug the gap left in the Budget by the
decision to drop the proposed increase on value added tax on fuel. The size
of this gap is the first area of dispute, for while the gross cost of the
measure was Pounds 1.5bn, that included measures to offset its impact on the
elderly.
Mr Chris Giles, a researcher at the Institute of Fiscal Studies, said
yesterday that withdrawal of all or part of the planned safety net for those
hit by the increase in VAT would result in 'clawback' of between Pounds 100m
and Pounds 400m.
'In fact he doesn't have to do anything at all,' said Mr Giles. 'This is a
drop in the ocean compared with the forecast for the PSBR for 1995-96 of
Pounds 21.5bn. The forecast error on the PSBR is around Pounds 6bn wrong
every year.'
The chancellor may be enticed by the idea of putting together a package of
smaller measures. That way he will avoid hitting one group of taxpayers.
One option fast becoming a favourite yesterday was putting a penny on a
litre of all road fuels: leaded, non-leaded, and diesel. This would bring in
Pounds 500m and serve to replace one measure portrayed as environmentally
friendly - increasing VAT on fuel - with another 'green' tax. A rise of 2p
would achieve the chancellor's aims in one move.
Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, favours the
petrol option as it would add only 0.2 per cent to the Retail Price Index
compared with the 0.4 per cent which would have resulted from the rise in
VAT on fuel.
Until yesterday morning, when the chancellor decided to put up interest
rates by a half point, another favoured option was a reduction in mortgage
interest relief to 10 per cent. This would bring in the required Pounds 1bn
revenue but would be politically troublesome after an interest rate rise.
'He has a whole variety of options,' said Mr Neil McKinnon, chief economist
at Citibank. 'Clearly the revenue-raising option is more politically
contentious . . . but he may decide to raise revenue through the back door.'
One suggestion was cutting the married couple's allowance by 10 per cent -
another measure which could bring in Pounds 1bn.
Most analysts ruled out an increase in direct taxation as too politically
risky for a government which has staked so much on the long-term reduction
of income tax.
A 0.5p rise in the basic rate of income tax, however, would bring in the
required Pounds 1bn as would a  1/2 percentage point rise in VAT.
Mr McKinnon judged that the VAT option 'would be adding fuel to the fire'
after Tuesday night's defeat at the hands of opposition parties and rebel
Conservative MPs. 'I think what he might do is either lift a freeze on
(some) excise duties or dip into the contingency reserve.'
However, Mr Adam Cole, economist at James Capel, was one of several analysts
who believed that it was important for the chancellor to strike a tough
fiscal stance in the mini-budget and that raiding the contingency reserve -
the government's emergency fund - would displease the markets.

FT  08 DEC 94 / After The VAT Vote: Labour 'finds Pounds 1bn' from Grid sale
to plug finances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour last night claimed that today's mini-budget is unnecessary after it
emerged that the government has made no specific allowance for up to Pounds
1bn in tax receipts due from the planned flotation of the National Grid.
Labour believes that the disclosure will embarrass Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, who will announce a tax and spending package to plug the hole in
the Budget caused by Tuesday's Commons defeat on value added tax.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said: 'Instead of penalising middle and
lower income Britain, these figures show that the government is able to
raise the resources it needs by tackling the excesses its own polices have
created.'
Labour's claims were queried by the Treasury, which said that the regional
electricity companies had not yet finalised proposals for the flotation of
the Grid. It added: 'We do not know the tax consequences.'
However, City estimates suggest that the government will receive between
Pounds 750m and Pounds 1bn in capital gains tax on the Pounds 4bn flotation
of the grid. The regional companies are planning to float the grid in May or
June.
The tax bill arises because the companies were given the grid when they were
floated four years ago. At that time it was valued in the the companies'
balance sheets at just over Pounds 1bn.
The Treasury said capital gains tax receipts from flotations would normally
be included in corporation tax estimates in the red book, the Budget
statement published last week for public finances next year. The red book
shows that estimates for corporation tax will rise from Pounds 20.1bn this
year to Pounds 26.4bn next year. It says that the rise reflects increasing
company profitability but makes no reference to the grid sale.
The disclosure will give a further boost to the morale of Labour
backbenchers, many of whom have waited 15 years for a victory over the
government on an important issue. Much of the credit will go to Mr Brown,
who masterminded the parliamentary manoeuvring involved, and campaigned
against the VAT changes in the constituencies of potential Tory rebels.
Officials said that Mr Brown and his shadow treasury colleagues wrote more
than 900 letters to local newspapers in target constituencies in the last
week in a deliberate attempt to increase the pressure on the rebels. The
whips' office, recently reinvigorated by an infusion of young MPs, also
achieved a maximum turnout of Labour members.
However, aides of Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, were warning strongly
against complacency, urging MPs to remember that Labour lost the 1992
election after expecting an easy victory.
Party strategists are keenly aware that there will be few opportunities in
the coming session to foment a further Tory revolt on this week's scale,
increasing the pressure on Labour to put more flesh on its own policies.
Nevertheless, Labour MPs showed little sign of easing the celebrations. Mrs
Margaret Hodge (Barking) said: 'Some of us are going round smiling like
Cheshire cats.'
Older hands were less optimistic, greeting the vote as a morale booster, but
urging colleagues not to raise their hopes of a rapid government collapse.
Mr David Winnick (Wallsall North) said: 'We are under no illusions. We
recognise that as long as they maintain a majority in the Commons they can
drag on somehow until 1997.'

FT  08 DEC 94 / After The VAT Vote: Teresa's troops are right behind their
rebel MP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tea rooms and Tudor pubs of Billericay seem an unlikely hotbed of
Conservative rebellion.
At the very heart of Tory Essex, the prosperous commuter town returned Mrs
Teresa Gorman to parliament with a 22,000 majority at the last election. But
yesterday Billericay Tories were ready to show as much defiance towards
government policies as their outspoken MP, who abstained in the crucial
Commons vote on valued added tax.
Mr Frederick Clewer, a member of Billericay Constitutional Club, said: 'I
admire her actions. I think she has come alive recently, and most of the
club members I have spoken to would support her on VAT.
'I do not believe that anyone should vote according to what the party says
on a continuous basis. They should vote on how they feel.'
Club members were unimpressed by reports last month that Conservative
Central Office would disband the entire constituency party if they refused
to deselect Mrs Gorman as the local candidate.
Mrs Gorman was one of eight backbench MPs who lost the party whip after she
abstained in the EU finance bill vote last week.
Mr Peter Johns, a retired civil engineer, said: 'She came into the club on
the Saturday after the European vote and I think she was largely supported.
In economic terms, if you look at the quantity of VAT money out of an
overall budget of Pounds 300bn, it is a very small amount.
'There are possibly other ways of raising the money without being
unpopular.'
Mrs Gorman seems to have improved her image among pensioners, whom the
opposition claimed would be hardest hit by VAT on domestic fuel.
In spite of an earlier pledge to support the government on the VAT vote, Mrs
Gorman's rebellion is seen as a sign of her political integrity in
Billericay. Mr Graham Johnson, a retired sales negotiator, said: 'People
will stick by her because she has got the courage of her convictions. She
has not got her sights set on promotion and is prepared to vote her own way.
You have to respect that.'
However, Conservative voters seem likely to return to the party whether or
not Mrs Gorman survives the threat of deselection.
Mr Richard Ward, a shipping sales executive, said: 'People vote for the
party, not the person. The government is in a lot of trouble which it has to
sort out - but there is plenty of time for that.'
Mrs Gorman's rebellion won the backing of her local butcher, Mr David
Bendall. 'I voted Conservative and she will get my support again. VAT on
fuel is bad for the elderly and families with young children,' he said.
'Mrs Gorman . . . stands up for what she believes.'

FT  08 DEC 94 / After The VAT Vote: Rightwingers want whip move reversed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rightwing Conservative MPs yesterday demanded the restoration of the party
whip to nine Tory Euro-rebels to contain the political damage after
Tuesday's defeat over value added tax on fuel.
As cabinet ministers and backbenchers assessed the political implications of
scrapping the second VAT increase a group of Tory MPs blamed the
government's defeat on the recent expulsion of rebels who voted against the
European finance bill.
The rightwingers noted that eight of the nine MPs - including Mrs Teresa
Gorman, Mr Richard Shepherd and Mr Nicholas Winterton - had failed to
support the government on Tuesday. And they expressed fears that the group
could rebel again.
One MP said: 'I would like a clear sign that these people will be reinstated
at the start of next year at the earliest.' He said the government would
suffer if a group of populist MPs was allowed to fester as 'a party within a
party'.
Another complained that the expulsions demonstrated that a cabinet
'dominated by centre-left politicians' was keen to mete out punishment to
MPs on the right.
He said: 'We have recently seen people like Hugh Dykes manoeuvring to bring
down the Post Office bill, which would have been one of the key items of
legislation this year. But they have suffered nothing.'
There was far less agreement in the party over the other main key issue now
facing Mr John Major's government: how to plug the Pounds 1bn fiscal gap
created by the climbdown on raising VAT to 17 1/2 per cent.
Rightwing MPs called for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to announce more
spending cuts in his 'mini-budget' today.
But others hoped the chancellor would raise more revenue - possibly on wine
or tobacco - amid signs that little more could be squeezed from a spending
round that has already been tough.
An MP who closely monitors economic strategy said: 'He has to replace a tax
measure with a tax measure.' The chancellor would want to avoid altering the
structure of fiscal planning in the Red Book.
There were signs, though, that Mr Clarke might risk a new rebellion on tax
if he were to introduce a half-percentage point increase in the general rate
of VAT to 18 per cent.
One mainstream MP said: 'He cannot guarantee getting the whole-hearted
support of colleagues.' He said that the party had to move away from its
tax-raising image.
Another said the chancellor would need to resist taking his revenge on the
party by introducing punitive taxation. 'He needs to avoid the temptation of
saying 'I told you so' to the rebels,' the MP said.
Above all, there was debate about the extent to which Tuesday night's vote
had damaged the political future for Mr Major and Mr Clarke.
Mr Major's prime ministership was widely seen as safe because the closing
date for applications to the party's annual leadership contest closed last
week. 'He is very lucky the VAT issue did not come up earlier than it did,'
said one MP, claiming that this week's controversy would have been forgotten
in 12 months.
But some privately admitted that Mr Clarke's determination to take on the
rebels and go through with the VAT increase in his Budget had damaged his
chances of becoming leader.
One MP said that Mr Clarke had had a faultless spell as chancellor, but that
he had resisted repeated calls for VAT to be scrapped. 'It will be difficult
for him to get over that mistake,' he said.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, the chief secretary to the Treasury, was one of a number
of cabinet ministers who expressed confidence that the party could restore
its fortunes in the new year.
But there were private concerns, too, that the government was so weak that
it could soon face a new crisis.

FT  08 DEC 94 / After The VAT Vote: Tories seethe over breaking of ranks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government business managers have been left shaken and angry over the way
most of the Conservative rebels suspended from the parliamentary party last
week helped defeat the government in Tuesday night's vote on value added tax
on domestic fuel.
Eight of the nine who had the whip withdrawn in the wake of last week's
confidence vote on Europe, either abstained or voted against the government
in its eight-vote defeat on VAT.
The decision by so many of them to line up against the government again so
soon after their last act of defiance is raising the question at Westminster
of whether a party within a party is forming.
If it is - and if the rebels feel justified in thumbing their noses at the
government at will - then Mr John Major, the prime minister, really will
find himself at the head of a minority administration.
Certainly, there appeared to be a degree of co-ordination in how the rebels
chose to vote on Tuesday, since eight of them held a secret meeting to
discuss the position within hours of the frantic denouement in a packed
Commons chamber.
But the fact that not all voted the same way, with three voting against the
government, one with and five abstaining, suggests that the rebels are too
independent-minded to want to set up their own informal whipping operation.
At the very least, the VAT on domestic fuel episode indicates that most of
the rebels feel losing the whip has left them free to judge issues on their
merits rather than voting consistently with the government in a bid to have
the whip restored.
As Mr Tony Marlow, the rebel MP for Northampton North, said: 'Supposing the
Conservative party as a whole had not been subject to the whip, they may
have come to the same conclusion as I did.'
But Mr Marlow, in common with other rebels, denies emphatically that a party
within a party is being formed.
'We are a group of people who share an objective with regard to Europe,' he
said. 'We believe the party cannot be re-elected unless and until we have a
policy on Europe with which people can feel at ease.'
Whatever the true position, it seems the government will have to soldier on
with a technical minority for some time to come, in spite of strong calls
for reconciliation from the right of the party. The decision to remove the
whip from the rebels was enough - in technical terms - to wipe out the
government's paper majority of 14.
The Tory whips accuse the rebels of vindictiveness, claiming that some sent
out 'very clear signals' that they would support the government, then
changed their minds. According to one business manager, one of the MPs who
rebelled wrote a letter to Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, within the past
week indicating that he would support the government.
One rebel who said privately before the vote that he would side with the
government but ultimately did not, explained why yesterday. He had changed
his mind partly as a result of the eleventh-hour compensation package for
pensioners that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, 'plucked out the air' to
try to save the day.
He argued that the package showed that the government had enough in hand not
to need to raise the VAT rate on domestic fuel to 17.5 per cent.
The bad blood created by Tuesday's rebellion and the charges of underhand
tactics seemed yesterday to augur badly for the sort of two-way
'bridge-building' referred to by Mr Jonathan Aitken, the rightwing chief
Treasury secretary.
Mr Aitken said he was hoping for a period when 'tempers and fevers will
cool' and the Conservatives got back to being 'a united party'.
He said: 'You can't have a situation when people can go walkabout out of
pique, or revenge, or feelings of high temper or whatever it was that was
sending some of them into the rebel lobbies last night.'
The view from the whip's office was that, after Tuesday, 'if you just
slapped them on the wrist, there would be anarchy'.
'They could have started bridge-building last night,' said one business
manager.

FT  08 DEC 94 / After The VAT Vote: Labour 'finds Pounds 1bn' from Grid sale
to plug finances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party will argue today that there is no need for ministers to
replace the Pounds 1bn gap in the Budget finances caused by the VAT defeat
because the government has made no specific allowance for tax receipts due
from the forthcoming flotation of the National Grid.
Labour believes that the disclosure will embarrass Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, when he rises in the Commons this afternoon to announce a tax
and spending package to plug a Pounds 1bn hole in the Budget caused by the
defeat.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said: 'Instead of penalising middle and
lower income Britain, these figures show that the government is able to
raise the resources it needs by tackling the excesses its own policies have
created.'
The move will give a further boost to the morale of Labour backbenchers,
some of whom were forecasting amid the euphoria on Tuesday night that the
government was on its last legs.
Labour's claims about the Grid sell-off were queried by the Treasury, which
said the regional electricity companies had not yet finalised flotation
plans. 'We do not know the tax consequences,' it said.
The City estimates, however, that the government will receive between Pounds
750m and Pounds 1bn from the Pounds 4bn flotation of the Grid through
capital gains tax. The regional companies plan to float the Grid in May or
June.
The tax bill arises because the regional companies were given the Grid by
the government when they were floated four years ago. At that time the Grid
was valued in the companies' balance sheets at just over Pounds 1bn.
Last week Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, announced that the government would
be appointing a financial adviser on the Grid. Although the regional
companies are in the private sector, the government owns shares both in them
and the Grid.
The Treasury said that capital gains tax receipts from the flotation would
be included in corporation tax estimates in its Red Book - the government's
Budget statement published last week of public finances next year.
The Red Book shows that estimates for corporation tax rise from Pounds
20.1bn this year to Pounds 26.4bn next year. It says this reflects
increasing company profitability but makes no reference to the Grid sale.
Labour MPs were still celebrating the VAT defeat yesterday but the
government's plight looked less hopeless as MPs began a more considered
assessment of the damage inflicted by it.
Many saw the VAT vote as the herald of a period of rapid Conservative
decline which would probably end by ushering in a Labour government.
Mrs Margaret Hodge, elected MP for Barking in a by-election earlier this
year, said: 'Some of us are going round smiling like Cheshire cats.'
Those with long memories drew a parallel between the Conservatives'
difficulties and Labour's years of strife in the early 1980s, when the party
appeared ungovernable and unelectable. Older hands were less optimistic,
greeting the vote as a morale booster, but urging colleagues not to raise
their hopes of a rapid government collapse.
Mr David Winnick, the leftwing MP for Wallsall North, said: 'This will go
down tremendously well in the country and we will take the credit for it.
But we are under no illusions. We recognise that as long as they maintain a
majority in the Commons they can drag on somehow until 1997.'

FT  08 DEC 94 / After The VAT Vote: Major ebullient despite reverse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAMBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a prime minister who only a few hours earlier had lost such an important
vote in the Commons, Mr John Major was on remarkably ebullient form.
Fulfilling a longstanding engagement to breakfast yesterday with a group of
businessmen at a London hotel he looked tired but spoke from notes with
passion and some humour.
Mr Major talked optimistically about the recovery, defended his decision to
suspend from the Tory party eight Eurosceptic MPs who had voted against the
government on a confidence motion, and called for a more rational debate on
Europe.
He said the previous night's rejection by MPs of the second stage of value
added tax on domestic fuel had been a mistake. He did not know of any tax
measure that had been so misrepresented.
The great beneficiaries of the vote to hold valued added tax on domestic
fuel at 8 per cent would not be the old and the sick, but the reasonably
well-off middle class - people in the room.
The chancellor would be taking the necessary steps to repair the financial
damage. 'There should be no shred of doubt about this - we are going to take
no risks with the economy.' Time and again since the 1950s the economy had
been driven off course by inflation and he was 'sick and tired' of it.
This time it would be different. 'That is the bedrock on which our economic
policy is built, a bedrock of low inflation. I hope no one doubts the
determination of this government to pursue an anti-inflation strategy.'
Recent growth rates were unsustainable but there was an unprecedented
opportunity for sustained long-term growth. He said: 'We will take no risks
with the recovery.' He was determined to pursue policies that would lead to
lower unemployment and less regulation.
Mr Major said British industry - British Steel and the motor manufacturers
were examples - had been transformed in recent years. 'Is this just a normal
cyclical recovery? I don't think so.' Everyone had told him that by now
there would be a balance of payments crisis, an inflationary spiral, wage
inflation. None of this had come about.
He then moved on to Europe, remarking how frustrated he was that the
argument was only being heard from the extreme positions on either side.
Britain's interests lay in the heart of Europe, and it was about time that
industry stood up and supported that view.

FT  08 DEC 94 / After The VAT Vote: Pre-paid cash to be returned
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas customers who pre-paid bills to avoid the planned rise in value
added tax will have their money returned in the next few days, the company
said last night.
Eastern Group, the biggest regional power company, also said it would be
making immediate repayments.
British Gas said it did not know how many of its 18m customers had paid in
advance. Eastern Group said yesterday that about 100 of its customers were
affected. 'We know who they are and we are putting a cheque in the post
today,' it said.
East Midlands Electricity and Southern Electric said they would refund
customers who wrote to them.

FT  08 DEC 94 / After The VAT Vote: Major ebullient despite reverse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAMBERT and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a prime minister who only a few hours earlier had lost such an important
vote in the House of Commons Mr John Major was on remarkably ebullient form.
Fulfilling a longstanding engagement to breakfast yesterday with a group of
businessmen at a London hotel he looked tired but spoke from notes with
passion and some humour.
Mr Major talked optimistically about the recovery, defended his decision to
suspend from the Tory party eight Eurosceptic MPs who had voted against the
government on a confidence motion, and called for a more rational debate on
Europe.
He said the previous night's rejection by the House of Commons of the second
stage of value added tax on domestic fuel had been a mistake. He did not
know of any tax measure that had been so misrepresented. The Opposition's
comments had been travesties.
The great beneficiaries of the vote to hold valued added tax on domestic
fuel at 8 per cent would not be the old and the sick, but the reasonably
well-off middle class - people in the room.
The chancellor would be taking the necessary steps to repair the financial
damage. 'There should be no shred of doubt about this - we are going to take
no risks with the economy.' Time and time again since the 1950s the economy
had been driven off course by inflation and he was 'sick and tired' of it.
This time it would be different, he said. 'That is the bedrock on which our
economic policy is built, a bedrock of low inflation. I hope no one doubts
the determination of this government to pursue an anti-inflation strategy.'
Recent growth rates were unsustainable but there was an unprecedented
opportunity for sustained long-term growth. He said: 'We will take no risks
with the recovery.' He was determined to pursue policies that would lead to
lower unemployment and less regulation.
He said: 'We may be on the way to crushing the inflationary psychology . . .
the opportunity is there to be taken (but) it can be blown away.'
Mr Major said British industry - British Steel and the motor manufacturers
were examples - had been transformed in recent years. 'Is this just a normal
cyclical recovery? I don't think so.' Everyone had told him that by now
there would be a balance of payments crisis, an inflationary spiral, wage
inflation. None of this had come about.
He then moved on to Europe, remarking how frustrated he was that the
argument was only being heard from the extreme positions on either side.
Britain's interests lay in the heart of Europe, and it was about time that
industry stood up and supported that view.
He warmed to a recent, less-than-federalist newspaper article delivered by
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister and presidential candidate:
'Mr Balladur's grand new gesture sounds remarkably like my Leyden speech a
few months ago.'
A European single currency would remain impractical for 'many, many years to
come'.
The energy-saving industry reacted with anger and disappointment to Tuesday
night's VAT vote, David Lascelles writes.
Mr Andrew Warren of the Association for the Conservation of Energy said that
energy would now be taxed at 8 per cent while energy-saving equipment would
carry VAT of 17.5 per cent. This meant consumers had an incentive to
pollute, he said.

FT  08 DEC 94 / After The VAT Vote: Business leaders fear loss of consumer
confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Industrial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industry and commerce yesterday criticised Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, for raising interest rates because of the government's political
crisis and warned that confidence among consumers could be damaged.
Retailers voiced concern about the timing of the rise in the crucial
shopping weeks leading up to Christmas.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, director-general of the Institute of Directors, said:
'The impression has been given that the chancellor has rushed into a
political decision rather than a decision based on sound economic judgment.'
The half-point rise in interest rates would make investment more expensive,
he said. 'It would have been more sensible to delay it until the dust had
settled after the government defeat on VAT and the chancellor had announced
the measures to recover the lost VAT revenue.'
The Confederation of British Industry agreed that the timing of the rise was
dictated more by political than by economic considerations.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general, said: 'We did not want to see another
interest rate move this year. Inflationary pressures remain weak, especially
in the retail sector.'
He added that the recovery would continue in spite of the increase, but said
the chancellor had to act decisively to restore confidence in the
government's fiscal strategy.
Mr Graham Mackenzie, director-general of the Engineering Employers
Federation, said the rise was a further blow to business confidence.
Mr John Parsons, chairman of the CBI's Smaller Companies Council, said the
rise was unfortunate but 'not disastrous.'
Representatives of the smallest companies were less sanguine. Mr Bernard
Juby, chairman of financial affairs for the Federation of Small Businesses,
said: 'A rise in base rates will wipe out any small business measures
announced in last week's Budget speech.'
Mr Stan Mendham, chief executive of the Forum of Private Business, said that
the most damaging impact of the rise would be its effect on consumer
confidence. He said the forum was largely concerned at a decrease in the
number of small companies that were growing faster than the pace of
inflation.
The motor trade and industry, already alarmed by statistics released on
Tuesday showing a fall in new car sales to private buyers, warned that the
rate increase would further depress sales.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said: 'The November sales
figures demonstrated how fragile consumer confidence remains. This increase
will do nothing to help.' It said that there was now 'no prospect' of sales
this year reaching the 2m level which the industry needed for profitability.
The British Retail Consortium, which represents 90 per cent of the UK retail
trade, was worried about the impact of the rate rise on consumer confidence.
Mr Hugh Clark, trading policy director, said: 'It will inevitably make
people more cautious about spending.'
The rise was 'exceedingly ill-timed and unwelcome', coming in the middle of
the crucial Christmas trading period. He could see 'little evidence of
justification' for the move, and added: 'Demand levels have very much kept
the lid on inflation. Retail sales have grown by value and volume but there
is no indication that retail sales are running away with themselves.'

FT  08 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Lenders delay response to base rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks and building societies kept their heads down yesterday as they
postponed a response to the half percentage point increase in base rates.
Although none increased its mortgage or savings rates, most believed rates
would have to rise.
Halifax building society, the biggest mortgage lender, said: 'The base rate
rise will inevitably put upward pressure on both savers' and borrowers'
rates and they are likely to rise in due course.' The society was 'very
disappointed' at the base rate rise because it would damage the fragile
housing market recovery.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society said the base rate rise was
disappointing for homeowners, especially after moves to restrict mortgage
income support in last week's Budget. It added: 'It must create pressure for
a mortgage rate increase at some time.'
Bradford and Bingley agreed that it was likely mortgage rates would have to
go up. Mr John Wriglesworth, strategy and marketing manager, said the rate
rise made it more important that the government did not deal another blow to
the housing market by cutting mortgage interest relief to make up for defeat
on VAT.
Mr Rob Thomas, housing market analyst at UBS, said lenders were being held
back by the likelihood of another base rate rise.
He said: 'If they thought it would be within the next three months, they
would wait and move then. But if they thought it would not be for, say,
another six months, they may decide to put up rates within a month.'
Abbey National, the second biggest mortgage lender, said it hoped to
maintain its mortgage rates until early next year. Similarly Nationwide, the
second biggest building society, said that as the housing market remained
subdued it saw no immediate need to raise the cost of home loans.
Mr Peter Robinson, managing director of Woolwich, pointed to its concern
about savings rates. He said: 'There is no need to raise mortgage rates at
present as the market is seasonally inactive and customer sentiment would
not be helped by such a move'.

FT  08 DEC 94 / After The VAT Vote: Clarke acts 'to check inflation' -
Decision to increase rate was based on economic factors, say officials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's half percentage point increase in bank base rates came after
high political drama the night before.
But, if officials are to be believed, the minutes of the early morning
meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the
Bank of England governor, should show, when published in six weeks' time,
that the decision was based on economic factors.
Before the two men met at 8.45am - rather than 9.30 as originally scheduled
 -officials from the Bank and the Treasury had concluded that the economy
was growing so fast that base rates should be raised to keep inflationary
pressures under control.
It is understood that Mr Clarke himself had all but decided to raise rates
this month before Tuesday night's vote on value added tax on domestic fuel.
The time of the meeting was only changed after the government's defeat,
however.
Yesterday Mr Clarke said that he and the governor 'were in total agreement
on the move'. As the chancellor did the rounds of the television and radio
studios at lunchtime yesterday to explain the rates increase to 6.25 per
cent from 5.75 per cent he did not give the appearance of a man pressed into
unwelcome action by political misfortune.
Mr George's announcement of the increase immediately after the meeting at
about 9.40am took some observers by surprise but was determined by market
factors. The chancellor said that there were no reasons for delay and the
governor 'wanted to avoid market uncertainties'.
The Bank wanted the news in the public domain before final bids were due for
an auction of Pounds 2bn of 10-year gilt-edged government stock at 10am. It
also wanted clarity over official rates because it was arranging new
two-week and one-month securities repurchase and secured loan facilities for
its money market operations yesterday morning.
The decisive factor that persuaded the Bank and Treasury to push for the
first December base rate rise since the 1970s was last month's sharp upward
revision of the third-quarter growth of gross domestic product. Although the
UK is enjoying an unusually favourable pattern of growth the news that GDP
was rising by 4.2 per cent compared with the third quarter of last year set
alarm bells ringing in Whitehall and Threadneedle Street.
Experience suggests that the UK's long-term trend rate of non-inflationary
growth is about 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Although this may have risen
because of supply side reforms in 1980s, it was clear to Treasury and Bank
economists that the economy was using up the spare capacity created by the
recession at a faster rate than thought.
According to Mr Alan Budd, the government's chief economic adviser, the
'output gap' - the difference between the actual level of GDP and the level
that would exist if it had grown at its long-term trend rate in recent years
 -has probably fallen to between 1 per cent and 4 per cent.
The Treasury said there was further evidence of growth in its statement
explaining the rise, and also in its monthly monetary report prepared for
yesterday's meeting. It pointed to recent business surveys which suggested
that growth would remain strong, as well as rising orders, particularly in
the export sector. Unemployment in October fell 46,000, continuing its
downward trend. Although retailers are complaining about tough competitive
conditions, sales volumes - up 3.3 per cent in the year to October - have
continued the upward trend of the past two years.
Yesterday's news that manufacturing output was a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per
cent higher in October than in September, and 5.5 per cent higher than in
the previous October, confirmed the strength of the recovery.
Altogether, these factors argued for immediate action, rather than leaving
the rate increase until January or relying on higher taxes due in April to
brake the economy.
Nonetheless, Mr Clarke is aware that parts of the economy are subdued. Last
week he said the housing market was 'extremely flat'. Yesterday's Treasury
report painted a picture of falling prices, weak sales activity and
declining housing starts. It was no accident that mortgage lenders were in
no rush yesterday to follow the Bank of England and clearing banks in
pushing up their lending rates.
As Mr Clarke pointed out, inflation is also very low. Underlying inflation,
which excludes mortgage interest payments, was 2 per cent and at a 27-year
low for the second month running in October.
But inflation pressures are growing and these tipped the judgment in favour
of a rate increase. Commodity prices have started to rise again after
falling back in recent months. Input prices for UK manufacturers were 7.1
per cent higher in October than a year before.
Producer output prices rose 3.5 per cent at an annual rate in the three
months to October and recent Confederation of British Industry surveys point
to growing numbers of industrialists wanting to raise prices.
Yesterday's base rate rise puts a shot across their bows ahead of the new
year, when list prices are normally increased sharply. It is also a warning
to wage bargainers that Mr Clarke will not brook inflationary settlements.
As in September, when base rates were raised by half a percentage point from
5.25 per cent, the chancellor is keeping ahead of the curve, acting
pre-emptively to nip inflationary pressures in the bud. His goal is still to
have underlying inflation in the lower part of the government's 1 per cent
to 4 per cent target range by the end of this parliament.
Yesterday Mr Clarke showed that he was not afraid to be cast as Scrooge
ahead of Christmas. He insisted that the higher rates would ensure that the
recovery would be sustained, leading to higher living standards and more
employment. In a week when political horizons may have shortened, he was
still talking the language of a medium-term economic strategy.

FT  08 DEC 94 / After The VAT Vote: City gloomy on fallout from political
turmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, CONNER MIDDELMANN and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The City reacted positively to yesterday's base rate rise, with most
analysts agreeing that there were good reasons for the increase on economic,
rather than political, grounds.
Yet many traders took a gloomy view of the turmoil engulfing the government,
fearing that continued political uncertainty could command a higher risk
premium on UK assets.
Most economists had been predicting an imminent rate increase, but they were
divided on whether it would occur in December or January.
Mr Bill Martin, chief economist at UBS, said: 'The chancellor's decision to
raise base rates immediately following the government's Commons defeat is
wholly justified by economic conditions.'
Mr Adam Cole, UK economist at James Capel, said: 'The economic case for a
rise in rates is compelling. The economy is growing at well above its
sustainable rate, and inflationary pressures are increasing.'
Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International (Europe), said:
'I don't think anyone can quibble with the basic view that a base rate rise
was justified.'
But Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, said that,
in the approach to Christmas, 'the impact on consumer confidence of a base
rate rise may be quite severe. If you really do think the retail sector is
weak, this could deal it a pretty serious blow'.
While the base rate news was welcome, and helped the pound and gilts to
rally, the government's Commons defeat over value added tax had a more
sobering effect.
A City professional said: 'The headlines this will generate internationally
will emphasise the degree of political risk surrounding UK assets and
probably deter some overseas investors from investing in them. In recent
months the markets have become highly sensitised to political risk - for
instance in countries like Italy, Sweden or France - and in terms of risk
candidates, the last 24 hours have pushed the UK up the league table.'
One dealer said he had received a string of phone calls in recent weeks from
US investors worried about the political outlook in the UK. He said: 'They
see politics as a real risk.'
Another said that in coming months UK financial markets would be caught
between two opposing forces, Britain's healthy economic fundamentals and the
fragile political situation.
He said: 'Politics will be a negative influence on the markets for the
remainder of this government's life. In the battle between politics and
economics, the latter will probably win - but the pendulum will swing back
and forth between the two, leaving the markets vulnerable.'
Another dealer said: 'The markets are quite content with how the government
is managing the economy in the short term. Of more concern is the longer
term and how long the government can go on like this, stumbling from one
crisis to another.'
He added: 'The erosion of power that has been seen over the last few months
may mean that the government will become so weak that it will begin to make
concessions to different interest groups. This may mean greater spending and
wage inflation.'
A pessimistic UK equity dealer said: 'I don't think this government will
even make it to April 1997. As it is, the Conservatives have a very small
majority, and if they lose another few by-elections that majority could get
squeezed further.'
But, he said, after 15 years of Tory rule, most market participants could
not overcome the psychological barrier of contemplating a Labour government.
He added: 'The majority of the market still believes the Conservatives can't
lose the next election, but I think there's a good chance they might.'

FT  08 DEC 94 / After The VAT Vote: Kenneth Clarke's comments on interest
rates rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, commenting on the rise in interest rates,
said:
'After my monthly discussion with the governor (of the Bank of England), I
have decided to increase interest rates by half per cent, in order to
sustain economic recovery with low inflation. This decision is in line with
my clear policy of taking no risks with inflation. The governor decided to
implement the change immediately because there were no reasons for delay and
he wanted to avoid market uncertainties.
'Underlying inflation is currently 2.0 per cent, the lowest level for 27
years and well below the European average. We need to ensure that inflation
remains low, so that the recovery is sustained, and leads to higher living
standards and secure jobs. The only way to make sure inflation stays low is
to act in good time.
'I raised interest rates by half per cent in September in order to take no
risks with inflation. This further rise today is the right response to
continuing indications in the last few months of inflationary pressures as
growth has strengthened. I intend to deliver the plans I announced in the
Budget to return the PSBR to balance and to make the economy perform better.
Together with these plans, this move in interest rates will help to underpin
a healthy and sustained recovery.'

FT  08 DEC 94 / Oftel reopens the rule book: Alan Cane says the watchdog
sees a different role for itself allied with fresh regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE

<TEXT>
The UK has the most liberalised telecommunications market in the world.
It also has one of the most complex, with emerging competition encouraged by
a raft of regulation designed to give newcomers room to grow in the shadow
of British Telecommunications.
Yesterday's consultative paper from Oftel, the telecoms regulator, solicits
opinions on questions at the heart of the worldwide debate on how best to
manage the evolution of telecoms from state-owned monopoly to fully
competitive free market.
Few would oppose the need for a measure of regulation after liberalisation.
Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, said yesterday that Britain's
tangle of regulation was no accident.
He said: 'This burst of regulatory effort is inevitable as the emergence of
competition generates new problems and argument for regulators to adjudicate
on.
'If we are to ensure that competition does not wither on the vine,
abandonment of monopolies and reserved rights must be coupled with the
adoption of rules.'
The question addressed by the paper is what kind of rules apply in a market
such as the UK, where competition is still only emerging.
The message from Oftel is that it would like to see itself policing the
market for anti-competitive behaviour rather than continuing in its role as
a calculator of regulated prices. Mr Cruickshank pointed out, however, that
a move towards comprehensive coverage of potential anti-competitive
behaviour would work only if the right enforcement mechanisms were in place.
Sir Iain Vallance, BT chairman, said this week that he wanted freedom from
retail price controls from 1997, when the existing regime will be reviewed,
and an end to preferential support for market newcomers.
The Oftel paper suggests that newcomers have to be protected against BT
through a modification of the access deficit contribution regime. It does,
however, raise the possibility that ADC might vanish.
Oftel speculates that if the line rental cap were lifted, BT would not raise
line rental charges significantly, assuming the existing overall cap on
prices remained in force.
It says: 'With the overall price cap set at RPI minus 7.5 per cent, the
bills of most customers would fall even if BT rebalanced (its line rental
and call charges) quite quickly.'
The paper also questions the high cost to BT of the universal service
obligation, designed to ensure that the isolated and the infirm have
economical access to a basic phone service.
Research published yesterday by Analysys, a European telecoms consultancy,
supports the Oftel conclusions. It says the net cost to BT of its obligation
is between Pounds 50m and Pounds 120m, somewhat less than estimates by
experts which have been as high as Pounds 400m.

FT  08 DEC 94 / What is the access deficit contribution?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BT's prices are capped by a series of formulae which relate its tariffs to
the retail prices index. It receives fees, which are closely monitored by
the regulator, from competitors for accepting and delivering calls in its
role as dominant operator with a network which stretches almost everywhere
in the UK.
As network owner BT is obliged to provide a universal service at reasonable
cost. In practice, it is prevented by Oftel from charging line rental which
would reflect the fully allocated costs of providing and maintaining
customer connections to the network. BT funds this access deficit through
artificially high call charges. When a competitor connects to BT's network
to route a call to its destination, the cost of carriage charge includes the
cost of providing customers' connections. The access deficit contribution is
intended to compensate BT for this loss of revenue.
Most of its competitors have had part of this fee waived as an encouragement
to competition. Interconnection charges to BT can represent between a half
and two-thirds of a competing operator's costs.

FT  08 DEC 94 / BT may gain right to raise line rental fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications could be allowed to raise line rental charges
under one of the controversial options set out in a consultative paper
published yesterday by Oftel, the telecoms regulator.
If BT took full advantage of its potential new freedom home line rentals
might rise by more than Pounds 50 a year - although Oftel says competition
and consumer resistance make it unlikely that BT would raise rental charges
significantly.
The paper is expected to initiate the most far-reaching debate about
telecoms regulation since BT was privatised and Mercury Communications
formed as a direct competitor in 1984.
The consultative document discusses a range of regulatory issues but comes
to few conclusions. A definitive statement is expected next summer after a
consultation period running to the end of March.
The issues discussed include changes in ways of calculating the
interconnection charge paid to BT by its competitors for picking up or
delivering calls made through their networks. The interconnection regime has
been a point of contention with companies such as Mercury, which say it is
unfair and arbitrary.
One proposal is that the access deficit contribution (ADC), a charge to
competitors to recompense BT for its obligation to maintain a comprehensive
network, should be abolished. Currently only Mercury pays ADCs.
Interconnection charges represent a significant proportion of a telecom
operator's costs. Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, makes it clear
that he finds the present ADC situation unsatisfactory and will insist on
changes.
He says BT's present cap on price rises - the retail prices index minus 7
1/2 per cent - will be maintained until 1997, when it is due for review. He
says BT will continue to be required to offer the same prices to customers
throughout the UK.
His underlying message is that it may be time to move to a more openly
competitive environment where BT has greater pricing freedoms and Oftel's
chief task is policing anti-competitive behaviour, backed by tougher
competition laws.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Banks urged to extend code
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Code of Good Banking Practice, revised earlier this year, still fails to
go far enough in setting standards, the banking ombudsman said yesterday.
Presenting his 1993-94 annual report, Mr Laurence Shurman welcomed
improvements in the second edition but was disappointed that the code had
not been extended to small business customers as well as personal customers,
as is the ombudsman's scheme.
He called for a requirement that terms and conditions imposed by banks
should be 'fair in substance' and hoped for more customer safeguards, such
as an end to the acceptance of unlimited personal guarantees.
The code of banking practice is a voluntary scheme, drawn up in 1992 on the
principle that banks should 'act fairly and reasonably in all their dealings
with their customers'.
Complaints against banks fell last year but Mr Shurman found in favour of a
higher proportion of complainants compared with the previous year.
There were 8,027 preliminary complaints, a fall of 16 per cent. The number
accepted for full investigation also fell - by 25 per cent - to 833.
Full investigations completed numbered 1,095, of which 44 per cent were
resolved in favour of the complainant with compensation demanded of the
bank, compared with 36 per cent last year. The average award rose to Pounds
1,464 from Pounds 1,352 last year. Awards ranged from Pounds 5 to Pounds
53,250.
The single biggest category of complaint requiring full investigation was
mortgages and lending, followed by automated teller machines. The complaints
investigated were much more complicated than in the past, especially the 21
per cent involving business accounts.
Mr Shurman said that banks had to take more action against cash machine
fraud, even if the cost of more safeguards outweighed the probable savings.
A code of lending would help to prevent some of the bank complaints and
customer misunderstandings about mortgages.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Regulatory regime provides underlying theme to document
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The theme underlying Oftel's consultative document is the regulatory regime
which will hold sway after 1997 when the price cap mechanism is reviewed.
In introducing about 70 pages of arguments and options Mr Cruickshank says:
'It may well be appropriate to move towards a regulatory framework which
relies less on detailed intervention by the director-general in setting
interconnection charges and rests more on him specifying the framework and
allowing BT certain pricing freedoms within that, subject to a number of
restrictions on anti-competitive behaviour.'
Overtly, however, the paper is concerned with changes which can be made in a
shorter time, to counter a growing tide of criticism since the duopoly
review in 1991.
Complaints: The industry complains that interconnection charges are not
based on appropriate economic principles, that the access deficit
contribution (ADC) is uncertain and complex, and that universal service
issues are not clearly addressed. It also complains that Oftel has neither
the power nor the will to force dominant operators to comply with the
regulatory regime.
BT has the only network covering the whole of the UK and the ADC is designed
to help compensate BT for losses in accepting, routeing or delivering
competitors' calls. It is not identical with the 'universal service
obligation' (USO) which requires BT to guarantee an economic service to the
isolated, old or infirm, although the access deficit includes most of the
costs associated with BT's USO. In practice, only Mercury Communications,
BT's principal competitor in the UK, pays ADCs and then only for part of its
international traffic.
The starting point for Oftel is areas that will not change before 1997.
These include the cap on BT's prices, which is currently calculated as the
retail prices index minus 7 1/2 per cent. Oftel says: 'It is delivering
clear benefits to customers today . . . incentive regulation allows both
BT's customers and its shareholders to benefit from improvements in
efficiency. It would be wrong to undermine this incentive.'
It also intends to retain BT's obligation to charge a geographically
averaged tariff - essentially, the same prices to all customers regardless
of location or market sector. 'This is vital to ensure that as competition
develops in a somewhat fragmentary way, all customers benefit from this
competition and not simply those in certain market sectors or geographic
areas,' it says.
Interconnection and ADCs: Oftel is equally emphatic about what will change -
the ADC element of the interconnection charge. It says: 'The ADC regime will
either change or be abolished as part of this current review.'
The greater part of the paper is taken up with analysis of reform options of
the ADC regime. Most of these would continue a system of close regulatory
control of interconnection charges. 'Such regulation is inevitably very
complex, it tends to be risk averse and intrusive. It is therefore for
serious consideration whether the UK regulatory regime should now start to
move towards a framework more suited to a competitive marketplace.'
Oftel's preferred option involves BT setting its own interconnection
charges. It suggests three variants which depend how competitive the network
and retail markets are:
'The retail market is competitive but network bottlenecks remain. Oftel
polices anti-competitive behaviour using licence conditions dealing with
unfair cross-subsidies, undue discrimination, accounting separation and a
possible new general provision on anti-competitive practices.'
'Were retail competition insufficient for Variant 1, a retail price cap and
a requirement on BT's retail operations to make a reasonable rate of return
could be introduced.'
'A further variant, closer to current market conditions, places a price cap
on BT's network operations with, possibly, a price cap on BT-Retail.'
Oftel asks: 'To what extent is it feasible or appropriate to have a less
interventionist regime as the basis for setting interconnection charges? . .
. Are the variants proposed feasible and within what timescale?'
Policing competition: The prospect of a less interventionist regime raises
questions about policing anti-competitive behaviour. There have been
complaints that the existing regulatory regime has been inadequate in
dealing with offenders and that its limitations will become increasingly
obvious as competition grows.
Oftel says that the principal problem it has experienced to date lies less
in the scope of its powers but in enforcement procedures. It adds: 'A large
number of complaints against licensees are resolved during the process of
investigation or turn out to be unfounded. It is common for operators to
change their behaviour unilaterally during the course of an investigation
rendering the application of enforcement powers redundant.'
It goes on to say, however, that general competition legislation carries
with it a problem of timing. The time taken to complete an investigation
reduces the ability to counter anti-competitive behaviour.
Furthermore, there is no power under UK legislation either for the
regulatory authorities or the affected parties to seek injunctive relief
while an investigation is being carried out. 'In the time it takes to
assemble all the information needed to carry out a Competitive Act
investigation, to negotiate a licence modification, or even make an order or
provisional order against an operator for contravention of a licence
condition, the damage to competitors is done and cannot subsequently be
undone,' Oftel says. It asks whether a new general licence condition
prohibiting anti-competitive behaviour would be effective.
Encouraging competition: The paper asks how to improve competition, pointing
out that BT's market dominance - and particularly its scale and ubiquity -
presents new competitors with substantial obstacles. Much current assistance
to new competitors is provided through a waiver of the ADC which allows
competitors to use BT's access network - connection to homes and businesses
 -at a level of charges less than those allowing BT full recovery of costs.
Oftel therefore discusses ways in which the ADC regime might be reformed to
continue to provide assistance to competitors. It makes plain that it
believes that until competition is more fully developed in the UK market
there should be an explicit scheme of assistance, that it should be focused
on new entrants rather than established businesses and that it should be
available to network operators and to other forms of telecommunications
businesses.
Universal service: Oftel takes a detailed look at the USO, pointing out that
with the development of new technologies, the definition is likely to
change. At present BT is required to meet all reasonable demands for basic
telephone services, including rural areas. But with the growth of multimedia
and the information highway, what constitutes a basic service is arguable.
At the most sophisticated it could involve individual access to a broadband,
multiservice network allowing access to all services with 'band-widths of
the order of 20 megabits per second (a high rate of information
transmission) in both directions. This would enable virtually unlimited
access to information including two-way high-definition video services'.
Oftel says the whole industry should contribute to funding of the USO and
that the mechanism for doing so should be clear and fair.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Oftel aims to police market: Alan Cane says the regulator's
consultative paper points to a fresh role for it and new rules
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The UK has the most liberalised telecommunications market in the world. It
also has one of the most complex, with emerging competition encouraged by a
raft of regulation designed to give newcomers room to grow in the shadow of
British Telecommunications.
Yesterday's consultative paper from Oftel, the telecoms regulator, solicits
opinions on questions at the heart of the worldwide debate on how best to
manage the evolution of telecoms from state-owned monopoly to fully
competitive free market.
It is inviting responses until the end of next March. A definitive set of
proposals is expected to be published in the summer.
Few would oppose the need for a measure of regulation after liberalisation.
Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, said yesterday that Britain's
tangle of regulation was no accident.
He said: 'This burst of regulatory effort is inevitable as the emergence of
competition generates new problems and argument for regulators to adjudicate
on.
'If we are to ensure that competition does not wither on the vine,
abandonment of monopolies and reserved rights must be coupled with the
adoption of rules.'
The question addressed by the paper is what kind of rules apply in a market
such as the UK, where competition is emerging but by no means fully
developed.
The message from Oftel is that it would like to see itself policing the
market for anti-competitive behaviour rather than continuing in its role as
a calculator of regulated prices. Mr Cruickshank pointed out, however, that
a move towards comprehensive coverage of potential anti-competitive
behaviour would work only if the right enforcement mechanisms were in place.
BT's prices are capped by a series of formulae which relate its tariffs to
the retail prices index. It receives fees, which are closely monitored by

reviewed, and an end to preferential support for market newcomers.
The Oftel paper, however, suggests that newcomers have to be protected
against BT through a modification of the ADC regime. It does, however, raise
the possibility that ADC might vanish. The ADC arises out of the
universality of BT's network access. Oftel caps BT's line rental charges at
RPI plus 2 per cent. As a consequence, BT is forced to subsidise access out
of call revenue.
Oftel speculates that if the line rental cap were lifted, BT would not raise
line rental charges significantly, assuming the existing overall cap on
prices remained in force.
It says: 'With the overall price cap set at RPI minus 7.5 per cent, the
bills of most customers would fall even if BT rebalanced (its line rental

The paper also questions the high cost to BT of the universal service

FT  08 DEC 94 / Plans for jobless are 'unsuitable'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government schemes to improve the job prospects of the unemployed are often
unsuitable for the needs of the people who use them, the National
Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux says in a report published today.
The report, based on evidence from 138 bureaux in England and Wales,
criticises assistance programmes for job seekers provided by the Employment
Service and training and work experience schemes delivered mainly by the
training and enterprise councils. It says the aid schemes are particularly
inadequate for unemployed people with special needs, such as the disabled,
because of rigid qualifying conditions.
The report says several schemes are limited to those out of work for six
months or more, and so exclude many people who need help.
The report says many citizens' advice bureau clients were made ineligible
because they took temporary work or attended short training courses.
It says its clients reported that many employers used training or work
experience placements as sources of cheap labour.
The report concludes that Tecs should set national standards on the rights
of trainees while in work experience.

FT  08 DEC 94 / BSkyB to offer Disney Channel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Walt Disney Company said yesterday it had agreed with BSkyB to launch
The Disney Channel as a subscription service next autumn.
The animation and family-based entertainment channel will be available free
to BSkyB subscribers who already take both premium film channels.
The deal came the day before prices are set and shares allocated in the
flotation of BSkyB, a venture in which Pearson, publisher of the Financial
Times, holds a 17.5 per cent stake. The offer is believed to have been five
times oversubscribed.
The launch of the channel in the UK will be the first in Europe under the
Disney name. In January Walt Disney and CLT Multi Media, the
Luxembourg-based international broadcasting company, will launch Super RTL,
a German satellite channel specialising in family entertainment.
Plans for Mr Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television included the Disney channel and
at one stage Mr Murdoch launched a Dollars 1.5bn lawsuit against Disney.
Yesterday Mr Etienne de Villiers, president of Walt Disney Television
International, said Sky represented 'a very viable distribution outlet'.
The channel will be available to more than 2.5m homes by cable and
satellite. In the US the Disney Channel is available to 8m homes.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Westland helicopter given approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The EH101 helicopter, developed jointly by Westland in the UK and Agusta in
Italy at a cost of Pounds 2bn, yesterday received the civil certification
which will allow it to be operated by air transport companies.
The helicopter was simultaneously approved for use by the Civil Aviation
Authority in the UK, the Registro Aeronautico Italiano in Italy and the
Federal Aviation Administration in the US, after a two-year examination.
Mr Alan Jones, chairman of Westland, said: 'This is a very important day for
us. It marks the successful end of the development phase of the EH101 and
the beginning of the marketing and production push.' Mr Jones estimated that
there was a potential worldwide market for 750 EH101s over the next 30
years, which would be worth a total of Pounds 25bn to the Anglo-Italian
partners.
Two versions of the EH101 were approved, a naval passenger variant which is
being marketed to oil rig operators, particularly in the North Sea, and a
tail-ramp variant for bulky cargo. Norwegian, Dutch and British rig aircraft
operators have already expressed interest in the passenger helicopter, which
should be in service by 1996.
The EH101 can carry up to 30 passengers at up to 167 knots (309kmh). It has
made extensive use of new technology to increase safety and reduce operating
costs. Westland says the EH101 offers the lowest cost per per mile of any
helicopter in production. Mr Christopher Chataway, chairman of the CAA, said
yesterday: 'The EH101 should bring higher safety standards, greater
reliability and improved passenger comfort to commercial helicopter
services.'
Currently the Royal Air Force is considering a tail-ramp version of the
EH101 for part of its new fleet of transport helicopters.
Westland is locked in tough negotiations with the Ministry of Defence over
price, and a decision is expected around Christmas. Provided the gap on cost
can be closed, a mixed fleet of 25 EH101s and six US-made Chinooks, or 20
EH101s and 10 Chinooks may be ordered.
The Italian government is likely to order 16 of the naval anti-submarine
warfare version of the helicopter in the month. An order for 44 of this type
has been placed by the Royal Navy. The ASW version may have significant
export prospects, particularly to Gulf states.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Strong growth in factory output: Figures provide more
evidence of faster-than-expected expansion in economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT,
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economics Staff
Manufacturing continued to grow strongly in October, official figures showed
yesterday. With concern about the high rate of economic growth apparently
one factor that triggered the interest rate rise yesterday, the figures
provided further indications that the economy is expanding more quickly than
expected. The Central Statistical Office said manufacturing output was a
seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent higher in October than in September.
Manufacturing output between July and October was 1.2 per cent higher than
in the previous three months, and 5.3 per cent higher than in the same
period a year ago. Manufacturing growth was partly offset in October by a
slowdown in North Sea production. The output of the mining and quarrying
sector fell 2.8 per cent in October, compared with the previous month,
largely because of a statistical discrepancy in the CSO's system of seasonal
adjustment. Although oil production rose by 300,000 tonnes in October, it
rose by less than last October, and consequently the CSO's system of
seasonal adjustment recorded the rise as afall. The CSO said that this
discrepancy reflected the fact that North Sea maintenance work was being
carried out throughout the year, instead of being concentrated in the summer
months.
This apparent fall in North Sea output reduced the overall index of
production by more than 0.2 percentage points. Consequently, the output rose
only 0.1 per cent between September and October.
This rise was lower than the City had expected. Nevertheless, the CSO
pointed out yesterday that the index of production reached a record in
October, while the manufacturing index was only 0.6 per cent below the
previous manufacturing record seen in March 1990.
The strongest manufacturing growth was in the investment goods sector, which
expanded 2.2 per cent in the three months to October, compared with the
previous three months.
With domestic investment remaining weak, analysts said that most of this
growth was probably export-led.
Engineering performed well during this period, growing 2.6 per cent in the
three months to October compared with the previous three months.
The rate of economic growth may slow towards the end of the next year,
according to CSO cyclical indicators published yesterday. The longer leading
indicator, which includes data on housing, business expectations and
financial flows, and indicates turning points about 13 months in advance,
fell in October for the first time for six months.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Business steps up move from central London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of office occupiers moving out of central London has risen
sharply this year and is likely to remain high as companies rationalise
premises, says an annual survey by the surveyors Jones Lang Wootton.
Central London - the City and the West End - has lost about 200,000 office
jobs over 30 years as a direct result of companies decentralising operations
away from the capital. Decentralisation fell in 1992 and 1993 as the cost of
central London office accommodation fell in relation to other regions during
recession.
Nineteen big organisations moved a total of 8,440 jobs out of central London
this year, up from 3,500 last year. While only 11 organisations have firm
plans to move next year and in 1996, the level of prospective moves,
involving 55 organisations, is at a historically high level.
The new wave of relocation away from central London appears to be driven by
wider corporate rationalisation rather than outright concern for occupancy
costs.
More than half of the companies likely to move out of central London were
motivated by the desire to consolidate their number of sites as part of
wider restructuring. As a result, 40 per cent of companies questioned
planned to move to locations where they had existing premises.
Only 37 per cent cited occupancy costs as the main reason for their move. In
the 1980s this percentage was typically more than 50 per cent.
The narrower cost differential between the south-east of England and other
regions means that companies moving out of central London are more likely to
move only short distances.
Favoured destinations for decentralisation are those within the immediate
orbit of central London, such as Hammersmith and Docklands, which offer
proximity to the capital and significant cost savings over the West End or
City.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Councils rapped on shake-up plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Councils are not preparing properly for reorganisation, the Audit Commission
says in a report published today.
It says some councils are failing to talk to their neighbours, planning
prematurely to take over other councils' services, or making financial
commitments which incoming councils would inherit.
Under reorganisation, due to take place in 1996, all-purpose unitary
authorities will replace the existing two-tier structure in Wales and in
several areas of England.
The greatest fear is that councils facing abolition will spend
irresponsibly. At the last reorganisation, in 1974, the number of new
swimming pools tripled.
Mr Bob Chilton, the commission's head of local government studies, said the
chances of another 'swimming pool binge' had been reduced. Several councils
with extensive reserves were, however, planning big capital projects, while
at least one was planning to set a nil council tax in its final year to
highlight the costs of reorganisation. This would burden new authorities
with unnecessary costs.
The commission says councils are refusing to improve their records for use
by incoming authorities, or to prepare for competitive tendering of
white-collar services, which will be compulsory.

FT  08 DEC 94 / CAA attacks use of private finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Civil Aviation Authority has expressed deep scepticism about the
government's determination to use private finance to fund capital investment
programmes for air traffic control services.
It has reluctantly accepted that private finance will be used to create the
new Scottish air traffic control centre at Prestwick in Ayrshire. But it
says that the use of private finance may result in higher charges to
airlines and says it does not believe private funding to be appropriate for
many other air traffic control projects.
The CAA, which has made its views clear to the Department of Transport,
expressed its reservations about the private finance initiative (PFI) in a
submission to the Commons transport committee.
The Prestwick project includes new buildings, computers, software and radar
to replace the existing Scottish centre for the National Air Traffic
Services (NATS) - a joint venture between the CAA and the Ministry of
Defence - which covers the airspace over Scotland and part of the North
Atlantic. Under the private finance initiative, which the government wants
to apply to most capital projects, a private consortium would build and
equip the new centre, whose cost was last year put at Pounds 148m, and lease
it to the CAA.
The CAA says that air traffic control in the UK is a complex integrated
operation from which it would be difficult to separate a single project.
After nearly a year's discussion the Treasury has agreed, however, that NATS
will have a bigger role in managing the Prestwick project than would be the
case in a normal PFI project. It says the PFI method may result in higher
charges being asked of airlines because private finance costs more than
government-borrowed money.
The CAA says that if PFI were used to finance a number of smaller projects
there would be a risk of creating a system with multiple suppliers and
equipment types, which would be expensive to maintain.
The Prestwick project was scheduled for completion in 2000 but has been
delayed by at least a year because of the need to process tenders from
private sector consortia.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Exemplary exporter pips big name to prize
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fast-expanding company making reflective foul weather safety clothing for
the police, emergency services and outdoor workers last night narrowly won
the 1994 national export award sponsored by the FT Exporter, National
Westminster Bank and the Institute of Export.
Edward McBean &amp; Co, which employs 270 people in Cumbernauld, north-east of
Glasgow, squeezed past drugs giant Zeneca Pharma International, which turns
over Pounds 100m, to take victory by half a percentage point in the
eight-company final. Zeneca narrowly lost last year in the award's first
year.
McBean's Pounds 7m turnover includes only Pounds 2.25m of exports but the
judges from NatWest, KPMG Peat Marwick and the institute were swayed by its
being an example that any other business could follow.
Mr Ian Campbell, director-general of the institute, said: 'Zeneca is a very
fine company some thought should have won. But McBean is an excellent role
model for companies of any size - especially smaller ones. Its managers
demonstrated firm understanding of exporting principles, good management of
risk and control at all levels of the company of the whole exporting
process.'
The finalists are winners of regional heats based on paper submissions who
then undergo rigorous on-site audits by independent export experts.
Two other regional winners from 1993 also made the final. Apollo Fire
Detectors of Havant, Hampshire, earned Pounds 11m of its Pounds 20m turnover
selling in 56 countries, a 51 per cent rise in export sales in 12 months.
The other, Valpar Industrial, of Bangor, near Belfast, makes pythons -
snake-like bundles of insulated, refrigerated tubing - and exports 60 per
cent of its Pounds 3m annual sales.
Other finalists included Reyrolle Switchgear, the Rolls-Royce subsidiary
which exports Pounds 36m of heavy electrical equipment from Hebburn, Tyne
and Wear, and IMI Air Conditioning, part of the IMI group, which has sales
of Pounds 16m and exports a quarter of the output from its factory in
Brighouse, West Yorkshire.
Powell Duffryn International Fuel won the Coventry heat and Sherman
Treaters, an adhesion specialist exporting 75 per cent of its Pounds 5.5m
sales. won the Swindon heat.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Budget cuts to hit rail services, BR chief says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Train services will have to be reduced when timetables are revised next May
as a result of the Pounds 300m cut in railway finances announced in the
Budget, Mr John Welsby, British Rail chief executive, said yesterday.
Rail travellers are already faced with fare increases at least twice the
level of inflation from early next year. Mr Welsby told the Central Rail
Users' Consultative Committee, a rail watchdog, that these had been
announced at a time when the punctuality and reliability of the railway had
still to recover from the signalmen's strike.
If British Rail is called on to absorb a large part of the spending cuts,
substantial reductions in services may be necessary. But if Railtrack,
European Passenger Services and the other companies supplying rail services
take a large share, the basic BR timetable can be spared.
Mr Welsby said: 'At the moment I am hopeful we may not have to engage in
major service reductions. There will be some. Of that I have no doubt. But I
hope we can stay clear of major and draconian reductions.'
British Rail had been expecting to receive government funding of Pounds
1.3bn next year but its external financing limit was cut to Pounds 975m in
the Budget, he added. The government had allowed BR an extra Pounds 200m to
take account of the cost of the strike and the delayed start to Eurostar
train services through the Channel tunnel, but that was compensation for
lost revenues and not additional money.
In addition BR expects to lose Pounds 70m to Pounds 80m of revenues next
year as a result of the decline in coal shipments as the power generating
industry has switched to gas.
The move towards the privatisation of the railway network caused
difficulties for rail travellers seeking information, Mr Welsby said. Train
operators were no longer providing information about rival companies'
services in every case.
He said: 'We have got a problem in controlling this. In the new world, train
operators are not willing to tell people what their competitors are doing.
We have to find a private company to give dispassionate information about
the network.'

FT  08 DEC 94 / Mawhinney calls for transport ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, yesterday made an impassioned
plea for a national debate about transport issues and for 'an end to the
shouting and the insults'.
Mr Mawhinney, who became transport secretary just over four months ago,
called for 'a ceasefire in the sterile feuding over transport issues'.
He was speaking a few days after several hundred police officers and
bailiffs had brought an end to an occupation of houses along the route of a
new section of the M11 motorway in east London.
Further protests are brewing over a number of new road schemes including a
by-pass at Newbury in Berkshire and a widening of the A27 in Sussex.
Mr Mawhinney cast doubt on 'the glorious visions' of some people which
included 'millions of cycling school children, with shops on every street
corner and with badgers and butterflies thriving in every neighbourhood'.
Efforts to reduce road traffic would only be successful if acceptable
alternatives could be found, he said.
Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, welcomed Mr
Mawhinney's proposals to put environmental groups and issues at the centre
of the debate.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Delors sets out Ulster aid plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, set out proposals
yesterday for fresh money to support the peace process in Northern Ireland.
He will ask heads of state meeting in Germany at the end of the week to
approve a total of Ecus300m (Pounds 233m) to 'show the EU's solidarity with
the people of Northern Ireland in their search for peace and
reconciliation'.
The aid, expected to meet no resistance from other EU leaders, will be used
on urban and rural regeneration, unemployment, cross-border development and
cross-community co-operation.
Mr Delors has taken a close, personal interest in Northern Ireland's peace
negotiations, frequently describing them as one of the most important things
going on in the union.
He said yesterday: 'We should seize the new opportunities for action in
Northern Ireland and address the additional needs arising out of the peace
process. This must be done now, to convince those on the ground that the
peace process can yield real dividends to their lives.'
The Ecu300m comes on top of an existing Ecu 1.23bn of aid for Northern
Ireland in 1994-99 under the structural funds programme, and Ecu20m a year
to the multinational International Fund for Ireland. The new aid, to be paid
over three years starting next year, will go primarily to Northern Ireland
but also to six bordering counties of the Irish Republic.
The programme attached to the aid is based on the findings of a commission
task force established by Mr Delors after the announcement of a ceasefire
between the provisional IRA and the loyalists.
The task force said interest rates on loans from the European Investment
Bank should continue to be subsidised.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Cross-party MPs urge code of workers' rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER, Employment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government should publish a new code of workers' rights which should be
included in employment contracts, a cross-party committee of MPs said
yesterday.
In a report on the future of trade unions the Commons employment committee
split on party lines. But Labour and Tory members agreed that workers did
not fully understand their rights and obligations.
The committee said the government should reduce uncertainty by introducing a
code of individual rights of workers and incorporating it into employment
contracts.
The report said: 'In simplifying the web of rights it would also be possible
to extend rights of consultation from recognised trade unions to individual
workers on a collective basis where these workers are not unionised.'
The Conservative-dominated committee said unions faced a 'serious challenge'
after a sharp fall in membership, and called on them to make more effort to
attract members from the private sector or face becoming public sector-only
bodies.
The report said unions faced a challenge over how much they could still
exercise their traditional core function of collective bargaining, but the
committee was 'pleased to note the efforts of the Trades Union Congress and
some of its member unions to reassess and extend the services which they
provide and so retain and increase their membership. There is a clear need
for trade unions to launch more recruitment campaigns explaining the
benefits on offer in a modern context.'
The committee urged the government to consult the TUC about matters 'within
its province', and said unions should be asked to help shape the new modern
apprenticeship schemes.
Four Labour MPs who refused to sign the final document, said of the majority
report: 'There is in fact much we can agree with, and we welcome the
recognition that trade unions have an important role to play. This shows a
distinct change from some years ago.'
Mr John Monks, general secretary of the TUC, said: 'Today's report is a
welcome break from the anti-union prejudices of the 1980s.'
The committee spilt over whether employees should have a legal right to
representation by a union, as they do elsewhere in Europe. Labour MPs said
this was essential, but Tories said such matters should be left to voluntary
agreement between management and employees.
Another split was over Europe. The committee acknowledged that the future of
Britain's unions might be strongly linked to developments in European public
and social policy. However, the report merely said: 'The UK's attitude to
such legislation will be crucial.'
The Labour document said: 'We believe it is only a matter of time before
Britain reverses its opt-out of European social policy. It is therefore
inevitable that the pattern of British industrial relations - including its
legal framework - will move increasingly towards a common European model.'

FT  08 DEC 94 / Halifax risks court over free shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Halifax Building Society's plans to give free shares to members when it
converts to a public limited company and becomes a bank after merging with
Leeds Permanent Building Society are likely to be challenged in the High
Court early next year.
Unless Halifax, the UK's biggest society, decides to follow the 'flat rate'
formula used by Abbey National, which became a bank in 1989, there is a
strong prospect that its proposals will not fall clearly within the 1986
legislation regulating societies.
The Building Societies Commission, the sector's regulator, has to be
satisfied that the plans are squarely within the law for them to go ahead.
If it has any doubts then the issue must go to the High Court.
Abbey gave 100 free shares to each borrower and each investor, but Halifax
has signalled that it wants to look at other options. These include treating
borrowers and investors differently, and relating the number of free shares
to the length of relationship with the society or the money in an investor's
account.
The commission is likely to insist that Halifax outlines its intended
approach before the two societies' 10m members vote on the merger, which is
the first stage of the process.
The special meetings of the two societies, when members will vote, are
expected to take place in the spring. They could be delayed by a court
hearing.
The 1986 act says that if members are given priority in acquiring shares
these rights are restricted to investors of more than two years' standing.
Earlier this year a court ruling on a similar restriction forced Cheltenham
&amp; Gloucester Building Society to change its plans for sharing among its
1m-plus members the Pounds 1.8bn cash bid for the society by Lloyds Bank.
C&amp;G's new arrangement excludes borrowers and recent investors from the cash,
although they can still vote on whether to accept the offer. This has
focused the dissatisfaction of a small proportion of members.
Halifax and Leeds both stopped accepting new investing members when they
announced their plans last month, but the most likely timescale for the deal
could create a further complication.
If the two societies merge next summer and the flotation is in early 1997,
former Leeds members will not have been Halifax members for two years.
Guidance from the commission says that when societies merge members of the
one taken over must be treated as members of the surviving society. It does
not inevitably follow, however, that this would apply to share distribution.
Mr Rob Thomas, societies analyst at stockbrokers UBS, said plans for Halifax
to offer a full range of personal financial services would make it harder
for the organisation to keep its edge in mortgage lending.

A survey for the company by Research Services in October - before the

contacted were taking advantage of August's change in the law permitting
Sunday opening in England and Wales. Retailers opening on Sunday reported an

<TEXT>
One of the finest 17th-century Dutch landscapes, painted in 1665 by Meindert
Hobbema, sold for Pounds 3.74m at Sotheby's in London yesterday, Antony
Thorncroft writes.
It was one of 17 old master paintings sent to the auction by the British
Rail Pension Fund. Fourteen found buyers for a total of Pounds 6.7m. The
Hobbema was bought by the Netherlands government for the Mauritshuis gallery
in The Hague.
The pension fund started buying art as an alternative investment in the late
1970s.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Stock Exchange steps up insider dealing rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Stock Exchange is pressing ahead with proposals to halt trading in
individual companies' shares if there is evidence that price-sensitive
information has leaked.
According to senior Stock Exchange officials the new rules may be tougher
than originally planned, and are likely to involve the immediate suspension
of trading in a company's shares following anomalous transactions in those
shares, rather than a phased path to a trading halt as originally planned.
Following a two month consultation period the proposals - the aim of which
is to minimise the effects of insider trading on investors' confidence in
the market - are expected to be turned into formal policies in the coming
few weeks.
Under the original proposal, the process of halting trading in a company's
shares would have been staggered in two phases. The first phase, known as
making a security 'indicative', would have involved a temporary removal of
the obligation on market makers to deal at prices quoted on the Seaq
electronic trading screens.
When the shares had been given this indicative status the exchange would
have contacted the relevant company and asked it to put out a statement - if
it was in takeover talks or was in possession of other forms of undisclosed
price sensitive information.
Pending the publication of such a statement the exchange would have called a
complete halt to trading in the shares.
Participants in the stock market have told the exchange that they are
concerned that the volatility of trading would be increased sharply during
the period when the shares were indicative, leading to a heightened risk
that unwary investors would deal at a price that they would later deem to be
too high or too low, depending on the contents of any corporate
announcement.
As a result the exchange is likely to call a halt to trading in a company's
shares the moment that the Integrated Monitoring and Surveillance System
(IMAS) detects an unusually strong surge in trading volumes, or movement in
the share price, without making the shares indicative first.
On Tuesday, however, the exchange ran a partial pilot test of the original
proposals. It made shares in the banknote paper-maker Portals indicative at
12.41pm, 50 minutes after IMAS detected a strong surge in dealing volumes.
At 12.10pm, the exchange asked Portals' stockbroker, Warburg Securities,
whether the company was involved in any transaction which could explain the
share surge. If so, it wanted Portals to put out a statement.
At just after 1.00pm Portals put out a statement that it was in talks with
De La Rue, the banknote printer, about increasing commercial links between
the two companies.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Retention of fraud conspiracy law is defended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The controversial offence of conspiracy to defraud should be retained
pending the outcome of a wider review of the law of dishonesty, the Law
Commission said yesterday.
The commission, which has been examining the offence since 1989, said its
abolition at this stage would leave 'major gaps in the criminal law'. The
law reform body does, however, call for an immediate change in the law to
make it possible to convict people obtaining loans, such as mortgages, by
deception.
Mr Stephen Silber QC, the law commissioner, said this would aid the fight
against mortgage fraud.
Conspiracy to defraud, which is a common law offence, has had a chequered
history. Between a House of Lords decision in 1984 and the 1987 Criminal
Justice Act a person could not be charged with it unless what was alleged
did not amount to a conspiracy to commit a substantive offence such as
theft.
Prosecutors said that such limitations on the use of the offence hindered
the fight against serious fraud. The Roskill fraud trials committee agreed
with them and the restrictions were removed by the 1987 act.
Prosecutors still say the offence has practical advantages. It reduces the
chances of separate trials being ordered where a number of defendants are
involved. Sometimes it is the only offence that can reasonably be charged.
Critics say over-reliance on the offence by prosecutors is responsible for
many of the problems which have dogged long and complex fraud trials in
recent years. They say that it can apply to agreements between one or more
people to do something which is in itself lawful.
The offence is said to be too wide because it overlaps with statutory
conspiracy and substantive offences such as theft and obtaining by
deception. Its breadth also means it covers conduct which arguably should
not be criminal at all.
Critics say the scope of the offence is vague and uncertain and this
infringes the principle that it should be possible to ascertain in advance
whether any particular conduct is criminal. But the commission says pending
a review of dishonesty, which is under way, it would be wrong to remove it.
It says the offence often paints a more accurate overall picture of a fraud
than a list of specific offences, and if it was removed thieves who stole
confidential information, gaming swindlers and people who dishonestly
delayed payment of debts would go unpunished.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Political Notebook: Europe - the Tories' fatal attraction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is Europe that really counts. Amid the stunned confusions of ministers
and Conservative MPs at Westminster it was possible to find a theory for
each and for all seasons. Most had the government stumbling to defeat at the
next general election. Some included a coup d'etat to replace Mr John Major
with Mr Michael Heseltine or, just maybe, Mr Kenneth Clarke. Others gave the
prime minister another year before his party disintegrated into two or three
warring factions. There was even the odd senior Tory willing to venture that
in the grand sweep of history this was no more than a ripple: the government
might yet recover.
Certainly Mr Major seems to think so. In the early hours of yesterday
morning he stormed from the government whips' office after what observers
took to be a less-than-cheerful inquest into the VAT defeat with Mr Clarke.
Hours later he was addressing a dawn breakfast for captains of industry with
the exuberant demeanour of the victor rather than the vanquished. No one
knows whether he will decide before the election that there are better
things to do in life than be pelted with bricks by members of his own party.
No one can doubt that he is tough.
But, once the speculation and the scheming at Westminster is stripped away,
Europe emerges again and again as the Tories' fatal attraction. Mr Major
made the point himself when he urged his business audience not to let the
extremists - the sceptics or the federalists - dominate the argument.
Britain could remain at the heart of Europe without selling its sovereign
soul.
Tell that to the exiled sceptics on the backbenches whose well-planned
ambush ensured the VAT defeat; or to the small band of Euro-enthusiasts who
mutter these days that Mr Major has been captured by the sceptics. If there
is to be a rational debate about Britain's future in Europe then the
government and the Tory party must demonstrate first that they are capable
of conducting it.
The sceptics hold sway - not just the irreconcilable fanatics but a broader
swathe of rightish Tories whose instincts if not their intellects have
driven them to seek political security in anti-Europeanism. The
pro-Europeans talk about a passing phase but the centre of gravity in the
party has shifted. Mr Peter Lilley can now state confidently that the
government will fight the next election on a Euro-sceptic platform.
The cabinet's Euro enthusiasts have let the argument go by default. Sure, Mr
Clarke will tell anyone who asks him that he still favours a single European
currency. He has been active behind-the-scenes in trying to prevent Mr Major
promising a referendum on monetary union. But there has been no concerted
effort to persuade the doubters that Europe is about more than preventing
the bureaucrats of Brussels from interfering in the lives of Britons.
So when Mr Major and his cabinet colleagues travel to the Essen EU summit
later today their posture will be defensive. Let's hope, one minister
remarked this week, that Chancellor Helmut Kohl does not say anything silly
about a federal Europe and hand fresh ammunition to the sceptics.
Mr Douglas Hurd is preparing a strategy to tilt back the balance - to remind
Conservatives that they have prospered as the party of Europe. His ideas for
a sharper European defence identity have been delayed but not shelved by the
tensions in the Western alliance caused by Bosnia.
He is working up proposals for changes in the shape of the Brussels
Commission and in the role of national parliaments to provide a positive
British agenda for the 1996 intergovernmental conference.
More mundanely, Mr Hurd has sent to every minister a long-overdue balance
sheet putting the advantages alongside the inconveniences of EU membership.
The idea is that they might find time to have the occasional good word to
say about Britain's membership. Tory party activists can expect something
similar in their Christmas mail.
But the opportunity may already have passed to re-establish a common
platform on which the bulk of the Conservative party can stand. Certainly
some of the sceptics will be impossible to win back for any programme other
than progressive disengagement.
It is no good Mr Hurd producing carefully crafted arguments for Britain's
place in Europe if cabinet colleagues are permitted to flirt with the
possibility of eventual withdrawal. Mr Major cannot complain about the
divisions in his party unless he can demonstrate that he leads a united
cabinet. Last night he signalled that he realises time is running out and
opened the door still wider to the possibility of a referendum.
It may be too late. But if that is so, Europe has the capacity to break more
than this prime minister and this government. It might well break
permanently the Conservative party.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Bank deputy in call for stability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exchange rate stability requires micro-economic reforms to improve
productivity, as well as macro-economic measures to control inflation, the
deputy governor of the Bank of England said yesterday.
Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, giving the third Bank of England/London School of
Economics lecture, said that 'to achieve international monetary harmony,
every country should start at home'.
Reviewing the history of exchange rate management Mr Pennant-Rea said: 'It
has become virtually impossible for any central bank or government to
withstand the pressures of a sceptical market.'
Mr Pennant-Rea said that exchange rate targets were targets 'not just for
the authorities but for currency dealers as well, and like all targets, they
invite pot shots'. But he said the low inflation rates of 1993 and most of
1994 had been 'due to policy decisions made while sterling was in the
exchange rate mechanism. Only now is Britain in a position to prove that it
can keep inflation down solely by virtue of its domestic resolve to do so -
and it is far too early to judge how we will fare in the test'.

FT  08 DEC 94 / EU finance bill completes final Commons' hurdle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bill that triggered the political storm engulfing Mr John Major's
government last night completed its Commons stages with a convincing
majority.
The European Union finance bill, increasing Britain's payments to the EU
budget, received its third reading early this morning - a day earlier than
originally planned.
With Labour abstaining, only 23 MPs voted against it, allowing the measure
to pass by an overwhelming majority of 272. No Conservatives voted against
but several did not vote.
This is likely to clear more time in the parliamentary timetable for
debating today's mini-Budget, caused by the enforced scrapping of the second
stage of value added tax on domestic fuel.
The bill's second reading last week led to the withdrawal of the
Conservative whip from eight Tory Eurosceptics after they ignored Mr Major's
decision to make the matter an issue of confidence and abstained.
The bill now passes to the Lords, but peers will be unable to amend it
because it is a finance measure.
Meanwhile, it emerged during earlier exchanges that Mr Major had moved
closer to an understanding with Eurosceptics by backing stronger measures to
prevent EU money being used for fraud in Britain.
Mr Bill Cash, MP for Stafford, revealed Mr Major's role in meeting
Eurosceptic demands to combat fraudsters.
Mr Major agreed that the Commons public accounts committee should be asked
to examine the accounts of non-government agencies which have received EU
funds.
Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, paymaster-general, stressed that ministers could
not direct the committee - but confirmed that Mr Major wanted EU fraud to be
a priority.

   LONDON, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
More than 300 politicians, government officials and businessmen are likely
to attend the International Investment Forum on Northern Ireland to be
hosted by Mr John Major, the prime minister, in Belfast next week.
However, Mr Major may find himself preaching to the converted. Many
delegates will represent companies which have already invested in the
province.
The Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland, which is organising
the conference, has declared itself, 'well pleased' with the response to
invitations. It says that so far more than 260 delegates have agreed to
attend.
By last night fewer than 12 corporate executives from the US had agreed to
attend - although Mr Ron Brown, the US Commerce Secretary, and four
congressmen are to go.
The executives include Mr John Stafford, chairman of American Home Products;
Mr Ronald Evans, president of Best Western International, Mr Patrick Keough,
president of Computronics Distributors, Mr James McCann, president of
800-Flowers; Mr William Flynn, chairman of Mutual of American Life Insurance
Company, Ms Susan Morrice, manager of S. Morrice &amp; Associates, Mr James
Malloy, chairman of Smurfit Packaging Corporation, and Mr George David,
president of United Technologies.
Mr Evans is joining the mission in hopes of getting more affiliate hotels.
The company's enthusiasm for Northern Ireland springs from its experience in
the Irish Republic, where it found 'a wealth of young multilingual talent'
and the best telecommunications infrastructure in Europe, after France.
Mr David is participating 'to support US government efforts to promote peace
through economic development'. UT already employs 1,100 in the province
making wire automotive harnesses.
Only a handful of British companies not already involved in Northern Ireland
are thought to have agreed to attend, although the number may grow.
Overseas investment in Northern Ireland has totalled Pounds 1.6bn since
1986, involving 265 projects. About one-third of the investments are from
the US, with a considerable number from the Far East, notably Korea and
Japan.
After the speeches on Wednesday morning delegates will be offered tours of
factory sites, where they will be told of wages 16 per cent below the UK
average, grants of up to 50 per cent of start-up building costs and a pool
of skilled labour.
One company certain to be visited is US-owned Seagate Technology, in Derry.
It employs 270 people making hard disc drive components. Mr Michael
Caulfield, the managing director said: 'Nowhere else offered us the
combination of grants and incentives, which cut our start-up costs, plus a
dedicated and competitively priced labour force.'

FT  08 DEC 94 / Fear on National Insurance deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Insurance Fund sustained a Pounds 4.9bn deficit in the 1992-93
year because of rising payments for unemployment benefits and tax breaks for
personal pension holders, says the Commons public accounts committee.
As a result the fund, which is financed through National Insurance
contributions, will need a Treasury grant paid out of general tax revenues
of Pounds 7.6bn in 1993-94, in order to maintain an acceptable minimum
working balance.
Part of the deficit consists of Pounds 2.7bn in NIC rebates to personal
pension holders, up from Pounds 2.5bn in the 1991-92 fiscal year. From 1997,
the Department of Social Security has proposed a system of age-related
rebates which will greatly reduce the generous tax breaks offered to young
people to induce them to take out personal pensions.
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog,
intends to investigate whether some portion of the large number of personal
pensions consisting only of NIC rebates may have been sold to people for
whom they were inappropriate.
According to the PAC, the fund is likely to require subsidies from general
tax receipts for 'a number of years' while receipts and payments are brought
back into balance.
The PAC noted that the Department of Social Security believes the fund is
'naturally buoyant' and that, depending on a number of assumptions, should
no longer require additional tax subsidy by the end of this century.

System, which 'clustered' around core currencies such as the dollar or the
D-Mark, did not last forever.
Mr Pennant-Rea said that exchange rate targets were targets 'not just for
the authorities but for currency dealers as well; and like all targets, they
invite pot shots'.
However, he said that the low inflation rates of 1993 and most of 1994 had
been 'due to policy decisions made while sterling was in the exchange rate
mechanism. Only now is Britain in a position to prove that it can keep
inflation down solely by virtue of its domestic resolve to do so - and it is
far too early to judge how we will fare in the test.'
Apart from the difficulties caused to macro-economic management by free
international capital markets, Mr Pennant-Rea also addressed the problems
posed to prudential supervision.
He stressed the importance of real-time settlement which, he said, 'would
significantly reduce the risks in global finance, bringing benefits to
everybody'.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Post-VAT vote of confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government, still reeling from its defeat over value added tax on
domestic fuel, survived a confidence vote in the Commons yesterday.
A key provision in the European Union finance bill was approved almost
without challenge.
Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, the paymaster general, confirmed it was a
confidence issue, but there was none of the drama which marked the second
reading of the bill, when eight Tory backbenchers were deprived of the
Conservative whip for failing to back the government, reducing it to a
minority adminis-tration.
Mr Dennis Skinner, the leftwing Labour MP for Bolsover, failed to make Tory
backbenchers troop through the government lobby over a vote on the EU's 'own
resources'.
His unusually muted opposition was not heard by Mr Michael Morris, chairman
of the committee, who ruled that the clause had been approved without a
division.
A 52-minute speech by Mr Bill Cash, Tory MP for Stafford and a leading
Eurosceptic, indicated that the committee stage of the bill was unlikely to
be swift.

Retailers face the prospect of a subdued Christmas shopping season if the

level of cheque authorisations for high street stores was running only 4.9
per cent ahead of the comparable weekend last year. But trading last weekend
was busier than the weekend before. The value of cheques that Transax was
asked by high street shops to authorise was 13.7 per cent higher.

FT  08 DEC 94 / World Trade News: China's WTO talks go to brink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concern is being voiced in western capitals that unless a basis for
agreement can be reached early next year in China's negotiations to join the
new World Trade Organisation, the talks may be headed for irretrievable
breakdown.
Western diplomats have long stressed that many obstacles stand in the way of
agreement. But they now concede that, without a breakthrough, outright
failure is a possibility.
Their gloomy prognoses appear in part to signal a sharp escalation of
brinkmanship by the protagonists in the eight-year-long negotiations, as
they enter what is widely acknowledged to be a crucial phase.
Last week, Mr Long Yong-tu, Beijing's chief negotiator, raised the stakes by
seeking to set a year-end deadline for agreement. He said his government
would offer no further substantive concessions and seek no more talks with
Gatt members after that date.
Mr Long's statement was designed to add impetus to an eleventh-hour
negotiating push by Beijing. But though he said he was ready to continue
bargaining in Geneva until the end of the year, if necessary, there have
been few signs yet of progress. Though Mr Long did not to rule out an
extension of talks into next year, his statement appeared to rebuff
suggestions by the US and the EU and they would be ready to confer WTO
founder member status on China if it joined the organisation next summer.
Mr Long has suggested that the US, which China regards as the biggest
obstacle to its WTO entry, might use the extension to spin out the
membership talks indefinitely. However, some western diplomats say they are
worried that if no substantive agreement has been reached by early summer -
and more probably by Easter - the opportunity for political manoeuvre needed
to achieve agreement will have vanished.
As one put it bluntly yesterday: 'If the gap in negotiating positions has
not been closed by then, the talks will probably be dead in the water.'
Such anxieties are greatest in Brussels, where EU officials argue that a
successful outcome will require high-level political decisions in Washington
as well as in Beijing to override the positions of hard-liners in the two
capitals.
'The tone of recent Chinese statements suggests we are now in a very tense
end-game,' a senior EU official said. 'If they don't come off their
positions and there are no western concessions soon, agreement will be hard
to achieve.'
It is feared that little time remains for President Bill Clinton to impose a
change in the US approach before the new, Republican-dominated Congress
takes office next year.
Congress does not have a decisive say in China's WTO negotiations. But any
big concessions by President Clinton could expose him to accusations of
weakness by political opponents and by US business, which sees the WTO
negotiations as the best hope of opening up China's markets.
In Beijing, meanwhile, room for manoeuvre may be limited by the reluctance
of economic reformers to press the case for flexibility at a time when
positions are being staked out over the eventual succession to Deng
Xiaoping.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
If China's negotiations to join the World Trade Organisation became
seriously bogged down, it would raise questions about the fate of Taiwan's
application to join the organisation. At present there is an informal
understanding that China, on its own insistence, will enter first. However,
western trade experts say Taiwan has gone much farther to meet the demands
of members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
'Taiwan has worked very hard and put together a good package,' said a
spokesman at the US's de facto embassy in Taiwan. He said bilateral trade
talks in mid-November were 'very successful' although several areas had not
yet been finalised. Trade experts say it would be up to Taipei to propose
any change in arrangements to allow it to enter the WTO before China. Such a
move would risk the wrath of Beijing and would have to be approved by Gatt
members.
'Our view has always been that Taiwan and the People's Republic of China
must put together good accession packages,' the US spokesman said. 'But the
decision is up to all member governments.'
Taiwan has made or is negotiating the finer points of concessions on imports
for a range of agricultural and industrial products. Taiwanese trade
officials say the government is considering imposing non-tariff barriers in
place of duties to protect local industries following admission to Gatt.
Taipei has largely conceded to US demands to open its market to rice
imports, a politically sensitive issue. It is likely to adopt Japan's
approach, which allows for a six-year adjustment period. It has also agreed
to dismantle its alcohol and tobacco monopoly.

FT  08 DEC 94 / World Trade News: France toes line on shipyard aid
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France has dropped its long-standing opposition to a new international ban
on direct aid to shipbuilding. This follows preliminary agreement with
Brussels enabling Paris to continue to give its shipyards roughly the same
aid in the form of indirect subsidies. Mr Jose Rossi, the French industry
minister, confirmed yesterday that France was ready to join its EU partners
in ratifying the direct subsidy ban, negotiated with key non-European
shipbuilding countries in the forum of Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) last summer.
Mr Rossi said France's approval still depended on modifications within the
OECD accord. But government officials said these modifications had already
been negotiated with Commission officials, and were contained in a letter
sent by Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, to the EU executive.
This letter sets out France's intent to use the OECD accord's loopholes
allowing indirect aid to help French yards with research, development and
training to the tune of FFr2.6bn (Dollars 480m) in 1996-98. The letter also
reserves France's right to come up with other aid proposals. This enabled
one senior government official to claim yesterday that the aid would in fact
amount to FFr1bn a year for the three-year period. The Commission is due to
examine the French aid plan next Tuesday.

FT  08 DEC 94 / World Trade News: White House urged to reduce use of
antidumping measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The White House is being urged to rein in the use of dumping measures
because of their detrimental effect on liberalised trade regimes.
Two economists with the American Enterprise Institute - Mr Claude Barfield
and Mr Mark Falcoff - argue in a new paper that much of the 'abuse' of the
US dumping laws could be curbed without passage of new legislation. 'An
essential first step would be a clear statement from the political
operatives in the White House that in the future the US would aim for a more
even-handed administration of existing law,' the authors say.
As the world has moved towards freer trade, 40 countries have established
anti-dumping laws, alleged to protect domestic industries from predatory
price cutting. Since 1980, governments have allowed more than 2,000
anti-dumping actions to proceed. The US has initiated 99 cases in Latin
America alone.
'Antidumping laws have moved far from their original goal,' say the
economists. 'Uniformly throughout the trading world, national regulators,
using spurious unfair trade claims as a pretext, have manipulated the
dumping laws to favour domestic producers and decrease pressure from foreign
competition.'
The report from the Washington-based think tank singles out two antidumping
cases which, it says, were used 'to cripple' Latin American exports to the
US: actions against Siderca, an Argentine steel company, and Colombia'scut
flower industry.
Siderca ran into trouble in 1984 when it refused to enter a 'voluntary'
restraint agreement with the US. At great expense Siderca successfully
fought the antidumping cases. This year it has had to contend with a further
two. One US company brought an action against Siderca although, according to
the authors, the plaintiff does not even produce the same steel pipe as the
imports.
In the second example, the US cut flower industry first tried to keep out
the Colombian imports without having to prove an unfair trade practice. When
the US government refused, the industry launched more than 50 suits under
sections of US trade laws.
After that approach failed, the US Commerce Department began to allow
multiple complaints against single types of flower. In 1987 it levied
dumping duties on carnations and recently found against imported roses from
Colombia and Ecuador.
The authors call for US and foreign companies to be treated under the same
competition rules.
'Ultimately this will mean the repeal of antidumping laws - which establish
separate rules and criteria for 'fairness' - and their replacement with
rigorously enforced antitrust laws that discipline predatory price
behaviour,' the authors say. Latin American leaders should also agree to
bring their own 'unfair' trade laws into line with strict antitrust
enforcement.

FT  08 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Japan advised to buy US aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Japanese defence panel has recommended that the government buy nine
US-made aircraft, costing Y30bn (Dollars 300m), despite objections from
French and Canadian competitors.
If the government follows the panel's advice, this will fuel foreign
allegations that Japan's tradition of buying most of its military hardware
from the US reflects a desire to reduce trade tensions rather than open its
defence market to the best bid.
The multipurpose aircraft are for transporting senior air force staff and
supporting military exercises.
Ministers had planned to choose this week, but remain divided, for both
political and technical reasons, over the merits of the rival aircraft - the
US Gulfstream, the French Dassault Falcon 900 and Canada's Challenger 601.
The previous coalition government had decided to buy the Gulfstream, but the
Liberal Democratic party demanded a review after taking power in June.
A letter from Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, urging Japan
to consider the Falcon 900, gave the new government another reason to review
the decision. Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, minister for international trade and
industry, who takes a tough line on US trade relations, is one influence in
the review. Another is Mr Yohei Kono, foreign minister, who suggests the
order be split between the US and French suppliers.
The panel of three private sector military experts was set up in an attempt
to defuse foreign criticisms of procurement decisions.
The panel's report said the Gulfstream performed better and was cheaper to
maintain while the purchase prices of the Gulfstream and Falcon were
similar. It said the Canadian Challenger did not satisfy technical
requirements for take-off, but Mr Donald Campbell, Canadian ambassador to
Japan, disputed this.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Republicans agree to procedural changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Republican members of the House of Representatives agreed yesterday to plans
for a change in the House's procedural rules that would make it much more
difficult to raise taxes, George Graham writes.
The members agreed to require a three-fifths majority for any measure that
would raise personal or corporate income tax rates, though not for increases
in other taxes.
An even broader change, demanding a three-fifths majority in both the House
and the Senate for any tax increase, is included in the Republicans' draft
of a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget.
But while the constitutional amendment itself would require a two-thirds
majority in both chambers of Congress, as well as ratification by three-
quarters of the states, the change to House rules will require only a simple
majority and should pass easily.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Commission views options for US spending cuts
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
As the incoming Republican Congress prepares to debate a constitutional
amendment requiring a balanced budget while simultaneously proposing tax
cuts, a bipartisan commission is working on ways to keep the US's long-term
federal budget problems under control.
The commission, chaired by Democratic Senator Bob Kerrey and retiring
Republican Senator John Danforth, will meet tomorrow to discuss options for
reducing tax giveaways and cutting spending on programmes such as Social
Security and Medicare, which provide pension and healthcare benefits to the
elderly.
The 32-strong panel will vote next week on a package of cuts to be presented
to President Bill Clinton and the new Congress. Documents prepared by the
commission's staff show that by phasing in changes to entitlement
programmes, it is possible to balance the government's promises with the
money available to pay for them, and to bring social security and Medicare
back to long-term financial solvency, without either reducing current
benefits or raising current taxes.
But the staff report also outlines a list of options, many of them
politically unpalatable, and warns that without action, entitlement spending
and interest on the national debt will eat up all federal revenues by 2012,
leaving nothing at all for discretionary spending.
The report outlines three sample reform packages, each of which would bring
entitlement spending and government revenues into balance by the year 2030.
The first staff plan involves no tax increases, but would gradually increase
the social security retirement age and the Medicare eligibility age to 70.
It would also reduce federal subsidies to Medicare recipients and reduce
payments under Medicare to doctors and hospitals.
The most sweeping measures, however, would apply a means test to all
entitlements, reducing benefits to anyone with an income above Dollars
40,000, (Pounds 24,400) and cut all entitlements except health and
retirement programmes by 25 per cent. Further savings would be achieved by
revising the consumer price index, which would lower cost of living
adjustments to benefits.
The second option would make the same adjustment to the CPI, and would also
increase Medicare and social security taxes and limit income tax deductions.
Instead of raising the retirement age to 70 it would only speed up the
already scheduled increase to 67. And instead of means-testing, it would
make all entitlement benefits taxable.
A third plan blends the two approaches, increasing payroll taxes for
Medicare but not for social security while lifting the retirement age to 68.
Entitlements other than social security would become taxable, but social
security payments to middle- and upper-income families would be reduced. All
three plans make it clear how difficult it will be to deal with entitlement
spending without touching social security.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Counting cost of bankruptcy: Taxpayers will be angry at the
officials who got the county into trouble and at the firms which profited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bankruptcy on Tuesday of California's Orange County is without parallel
in the history of American local government. One of the wealthiest counties
in the US, with a population of 2.6m and an annual budget of Dollars 1.5bn
(Pounds 961m), has been forced into default through a game of double or
quits in the financial markets.
In time, the outraged taxpayers of Orange County will want their revenge. It
may extend not merely to the officials who lost Dollars 1.5bn of their
money, but to the Wall Street firms which profited by helping them.
The immediate effects on life in Orange County may be minor. Under the
provisions of Chapter 9 - the type of bankruptcy applying to municipalities
 -the county cannot pay outstanding bills to suppliers or back wages to its
employees, at least until a reorganisation plan has been worked out over
coming months. In the meantime, though, it can pay wages or other bills
incurred since the bankruptcy.
The longer-term effects are another matter. While in bankruptcy, the county
cannot pay income on its bonds. Its credit in the bond markets is thus badly
damaged. Even when it can re-enter the markets, it will have to pay more for
its money.
A hint of what this might mean came yesterday from the county's
transportation authority, which has Dollars 1.1bn invested in the
loss-making central fund. It has assembled a team of specialists 'to address
debt service, payroll and other obligations'.
Its planned mass transit programme, the authority said, should still be able
to go ahead: 'However, it may not be on the same timetable.'
The treasurer of the town of Huntington Beach, which has Dollars 69m
invested in the fund, said yesterday that while the city should be able to
maintain its police and fire services, it would put all non-essential
spending on hold.
Meanwhile, the financial markets are desperately grappling with the event's
complexities. One central point is at issue: whether the banks that hold
securities against Orange County's debts are constrained by its bankruptcy
from selling them.
The whole point of the bankruptcy was to stop holders of the county's
reverse repurchase agreements from liquidating their positions. Yesterday
some banks started selling anyway. If order can be restored, the Dollars
1.5bn loss so far reported on Orange County's Dollars 7.5bn fund may remain
at least partly on paper. If all the banks join the stampede, the losses
will be crystallised and very possibly increased.
In that case, Orange County will be seen to have made a disastrous
miscalculation. Bankruptcy was an extreme measure, which will greatly damage
the county's financial reputation.
If it did not even succeed in its object, it will have been worse than
useless.
Either way, Wall Street will not look good in the public eye. It is already
being pointed out that the broker Merrill Lynch, in particular, was
instrumental in helping county treasurer Mr Robert Citron play the markets.
The company rebutted this vigorously yesterday. Chairman Daniel Tully said:
'We do not believe that we have any legal liability whatsoever, and we would
vigorously contest any such action.'
The firm could doubtless also argue that it is not its job to warn a client,
merely to transact on his behalf. Whether that will carry weight in the
heated aftermath of the Orange County fiasco remains to be seen.

FT  08 DEC 94 / OECD warns on Canada recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON and ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada is enjoying a robust, low-inflation recovery, reinforced by a marked
improvement in international competitiveness, the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development says in its annual country survey.
However, the OECD cautions that high federal and provincial budget deficits
and concerns about Quebec secession make the economy vulnerable to swings in
financial markets. 'Even if temporary, such pressures could affect
confidence and hold back activity in interest-sensitive sectors of the
economy,' the survey says.
Gross domestic product is expected to grow 4 per cent this year and 4.1 per
cent in 1995, with exports and business investment leading the way.
Inflation, measured by the GDP price deflator, will be less than 1 per cent
this year, but will accelerate to 2.1 per cent in 1995. Unemployment will
drop to 9.9 from 10.6 per cent.
A highlight of recent economic performance has been the replacement of
relatively expensive labour by machinery and equipment. According to the
OECD, the capital-to-labour ratio rose by about 20 per cent between 1989 and
1993, 'lending credence to the view that the Canadian economy has gone
through one of the most important periods of input restructuring since the
war'.
The other side of the coin however, is what the OECD calls a 'jobless
recovery'. About four-fifths of output growth has come from more efficient
use of labour, and only 20 per cent from the creation of jobs. Declining
unit-labour costs have, in turn, contributed to the unusually low inflation
rate.
The survey concludes that 'the significant improvement in Canada's
competitive position should allow a gradual unwinding of the large external
deficit'. The current account balance is forecast to decline from an
annualised CDollars 22bn (Pounds 9.8bn) in the first half of 1994 to
CDollars 19.9bn in June-December 1995.
Mr Jacques Parizeau, Quebec's premier and head of the separatist Parti
Quebecois, said he would ask voters in next year's referendum to vote yes or
no to Quebec becoming a sovereign state in economic association with Canada,
Robert Gibbens writes.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
New York City took a big step yesterday towards enacting one of the
country's toughest smoking bans, despite protests by the tobacco industry
and restaurant owners, when the city council's health committee voted to
approve the measures, Reuter reports from New York. Under the ban, smoking
would be limited to the bar area in restaurants seating more than 35 people
and nearly eliminated in office buildings.
The measures, which the full city council is expected to approve on December
21, would also prohibit smoking at open-air sports arenas and zoos. Outdoor
cafes would have to provide no-smoking areas. While other cities had
stricter smoking curbs on restaurants and offices, it was the provisions on
smoking outdoors that made the New York proposal so tough, the Tobacco
Institute said.
Philip Morris, the tobacco group, has hinted it would leave New York, where
it has its headquarters, and cut its funding to the arts if the ban passed
as originally drafted.
Restaurateurs said the ban would cut their revenues and cited a survey
showing the average restaurant expected an 8.1 per cent sales shortfall,
representing a loss of 11,000 jobs and Dollars 27m in tax revenues.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Orange County hit by Wall St selling
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The affairs of Orange County, the California region which filed for
bankruptcy on Tuesday, appeared in chaos yesterday as Wall Street firms
started selling investments held on the county's behalf.
The move, which the bankruptcy was designed to prevent, risks pushing Orange
County's losses above the Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 961m) disclosed last week.
Several companies, among them the Japanese bank Nomura, were reported to
have liquidated up to Dollars 500m of reverse repurchase positions. These
are deals whereby Orange County had borrowed up to Dollars 12bn from Wall
Street firms to buy securities, which were then left with the firms as
collateral. On Tuesday some firms, led by CS First Boston, liquidated over
Dollars 1bn of these positions, precipitating Orange County's bankruptcy
later that day.
Orange County said yesterday morning it believed the bankruptcy 'stayed and
enjoined' all creditors from further liquidation of securities held under
reverse repo transactions. However, the Wall Street broker Smith Barney,
which holds Dollars 800m worth of reverse repos, said: 'We dispute the stay.
It doesn't mean we can't liquidate.'
The county filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 9, which applies only to
municipalities. Since there is no precedent for a Chapter 9 case of this
size or complexity, there has been wide confusion over the legal position.
One expert, Mr James Spiotto of Chapman and Cutler, said yesterday that
recent amendments to the municipal bankruptcy statute allowed liquidation of
reverse repos.
The broker Merrill Lynch, which was the county's chief source of finance and
holds Dollars 2bn worth of its repos, said: 'We have not liquidated
collateral or withdrawn any credit extended to the county.' Merrill defended
its role in the collapse, saying it had worked with Orange County for 20
years and had operated in line with its client's published strategies. 'The
client has managed a large portfolio in a sophisticated and public manner,
with above-average returns, for many years.' It denied it had any legal
liability for the bankruptcy.
Last week it emerged that Orange County, under its treasurer Mr Robert
Citron, had incurred paper losses of Dollars 1.5bn on its Dollars 7.5bn fund
as a result of aggressively leveraged investment strategies. Mr Citron
resigned on Monday.
It is not certain that Orange County will be allowed to go bankrupt. In
1991, Bridgeport, Connecticut, sought Chapter 9 protection but a judge
denied it on the grounds that the city was solvent.

Mr Jacques Parizeau, Quebec's premier and head of the separatist Parti

no to Quebec becoming a sovereign state in economic association with Canada,
Robert Gibbens writes from Montreal.
Mr Parizeau's government on Tuesday introduced a draft bill in the National
Assembly in Quebec City outlining the deal it says it will negotiate with
the federal government.
The bill says Quebec is a sovereign country and it intends to remain in
economic association with Canada, keeping the same boundaries as now and
retaining the Canadian dollar.
It would fully accept all international obligations and its legal and public
pension systems would remain mainly unchanged, the bill said. The laws of
Canada would continue to apply until well after the referendum and
negotiations with Ottawa are under way.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Dollars 2bn Argentine housing scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) financing scheme to build 60,000 houses and
create 130,000 construction industry jobs was launched yesterday by the
Argentine government, which is facing growing public concern over high
unemployment.
Leaked reports, denied by President Carlos Menem, that unemployment has
crept above 13 per cent have fuelled public debate over the ability of
Argentina's restructured, open economy to create jobs. Most economic
analysts agree that the joblessness rate, which has risen steeply since the
implementation of economic stabilisation in 1991, is likely to climb further
before it recedes.
The housing scheme, designed to bolster a construction sector that has been
an important economic motor in recent years, is being presented as one
government initiative to tackle the problem. 'Next year we will reduce
unemployment by 3 or 4 points,' Mr Menem said yesterday, promising a
substantial public works programme to 'absorb many of the jobless'.
In addition to its job-creating function, the plan is intended to bring
home-ownership within reach of many families denied access to mortgage
finance since the ravages of hyperinflation in the late 1980s.
The scheme, to be administered by the state Banco Hipotecario Nacional, will
provide 15-year mortgages at an annual interest rate of 13.5 per cent. It is
likely to be a vote-catcher in its own right.
Mr Menem, aware that unemployment could become a political irritant in the
run-up to next May's presidential elections, has taken to giving impassioned
speeches about the need to balance technological innovation with the
creation of jobs. Foreign investors, in particular, have been asked not to
put 'robots' above the welfare of the Argentine workforce.

The bankruptcy of California's Orange County, announced on Tuesday evening,
is without parallel in the history of American local government. One of the
wealthiest counties in the US, with a population of 2.6m and an annual
budget of Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 915m), has been forced into default in a
game of double or quits in the financial markets.
In time, the outraged taxpayers of Orange County will want their revenge. It
may extend not merely to the officials who lost Dollars 1.5bn of their

The immediate effects on life in Orange County may be minor. Under the

coming months. In the meantime, though, it can pay wages or other bills
incurred since the bankruptcy.
The longer-term effects are another matter. While in bankruptcy, the county
cannot pay income on its bonds. Its credit in the bond markets is thus badly
damaged. Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, said yesterday it was
downgrading Orange County bonds to speculative status. Even when it can
re-enter the markets, the county will have to pay more for its money.
A hint of what this might mean came yesterday from the county's
transportation authority, which has Dollars 1.1bn invested in the
loss-making central fund. It has assembled a team of bankers and lawyers and
accountants 'to address debt service, payroll and other obligations'. Its
planned mass transit programme, the authority said, should still be able to
go ahead: 'However, it may not be on the same timetable.'
Meanwhile, the financial markets are trying to come to grips with not just
the scale of the event, but its complexities. One central point is unclear:
whether the banks which hold securities against the county's debts are
constrained by its bankruptcy from selling them.
To finance its speculations, the county took on a rumoured Dollars 12bn in
so-called reverse repurchase agreements. These were used to buy securities
which the banks then held as collateral. On Tuesday several Wall Street
houses, led by CS First Boston, cancelled over Dollars 1bn worth of those
agreements and sold the securities. Orange County was obliged to file for
Chapter 9 in an attempt to stop others doing the same.
Whether this will work is uncertain. The county said yesterday it believed
all creditors were 'stayed and enjoined from. . . liquidating the securities
that are the subject of. . . repurchase, reverse repurchase or similar
transactions'.
Wall Street firms seemed less sure. Yesterday, they were reported to be
sending their lawyers scurrying through the fine print of their agreements.
Merrill Lynch, which holds Dollars 2bn of the reverse repos, said tersely
that the bankruptcy did not affect the integrity of its collateral.
If Orange County is right, the Dollars 1.5bn loss so far reported on its
Dollars 7.5bn fund may remain largely on paper. If the banks are right, at
least that amount of loss will be crystallised, and perhaps more besides.
Either way, Wall Street will not look too good in the public's estimation.
It is already being pointed out that the broker Merrill Lynch, in
particular, was instrumental in helping the county treasurer, Mr Robert
Citron, in playing the markets.
The company is not commenting at present, but could doubtless argue that it
is not its job to warn a client, merely to transact on his behalf.

FT  08 DEC 94 / US presses Israel on Palestinian poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday backed Palestinian demands for Israel to move quickly
towards permitting long-delayed Palestinian elections, and said Israel was
not seeking to modify the peace accords.
'We recognise the importance of holding elections at an early date,' Mr
Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said after meeting Mr Yassir
Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, in Gaza.
Mr Christopher's remarks came as the Israeli cabinet debated whether Israel
can honour the next phase of the peace process (troop redeployment from West
Bank population centres ahead of elections) without changing the peace
agreement.
The cabinet is split on how to reconcile redeployment of Israeli troops with
security for the 120,000 Jews living in 150 West Bank settlements. Some
ministers favour regrouping settlements into blocks; one or two favour
halting the peace process until the PLO meets Israel's security demands for
clamping down on Islamic extremists.
The debate was sparked by warnings from senior army officials about the
difficulty of guaranteeing security to Jewish settlers after redeployment,
and a statement by Premier Yitzhak Rabin that the government should consider
whether Israeli troops would remain in town centres during elections.
The Palestinians have said they will not vote under the barrels of Israeli
guns and warned any attempt to alter the peace agreement unilaterally would
seriously violate the process. Observers said Mr Christopher's remarks were
meant as a signal to Israel, before it concludes cabinet talks today, that
Washington backs implementing the agreement as it stands.
After a second cabinet session yesterday, several ministers said that the
possibility of uprooting a few settlements virtually impossible to protect
after redeployment had been much discussed. Mr Rabin has so far ruled out
uprooting settlements and said he would stick to the agreement which
postpones the settlement issue until later negotiations.
Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, said that despite differences, cabinet
endorsement of the peace agreement's framework was overwhelming. Mr Peres is
to meet Mr Arafat today to discuss the cabinet debate and seek to remove
obstacles to implementing the agreement.
Mr Christopher, who earlier met Mr Rabin, sought to assure Mr Arafat that
Palestinian fears of Israel unilaterally changing the agreement were
unfounded. 'When I was with Prime Minister Rabin he said they intend to
carry out the (agreement). As far as I am concerned, there is not an issue
about modification.'
Mr Christopher stressed to Mr Arafat that Israel had legitimate security
concerns as it faced redeployment in the West Bank and urged him to keep up
pressure on Islamic extremists opposed to the peace accord.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Turks find way round sanctions on Baghdad: Trade is
benefiting the Kurds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the Habur Bridge border point between Iraq and Turkey, it hardly looks as
if Iraq is still under sanctions. Thousands of trucks parked two abreast are
lined up for two miles on either side of the bridge, waiting their turn to
cross the frontier.
The trucks, all of them Turkish, carry sacks of flour, sugar, cement and
other building supplies into Iraq and bring diesel on the way back. Drivers
can make a small fortune by selling the fuel at three times the price in
Turkey.
Roads on either side of Habur Bridge are streaked black with fuel which has
leaked from tanks filled to overflowing. The air reeks of diesel around the
Iraqi border town of Zakho, where trucks load up at improvised filling
stations.
Turkey claims it is still enforcing UN sanctions on Iraq, imposed in 1990
after President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. But it has never hidden its
dismay at the embargo's cost and is pushing to have it lifted.
Officials claim sanctions have cost Turkey Dollars 20bn (Pounds 12.5bn) over
the past four years. Iraq was once Turkey's biggest trading partner and
business with Iraq helped sustain its south-east region, one of the most
backward in Turkey.
In September, Turkey decided to relax sanctions which had barred nearly all
border trade with Iraq. Turkey says it now allows only food into Iraq and
lets each truck import just 1,500 litres of fuel. Only 600 trucks are
allowed across Habur Bridge each day. Diplomats say the government timed its
decision to win votes in elections scheduled for December 4 but since
postponed.
The border trade, worth several million dollars a day, is revitalising a
region weakened by years of blockade. The local chamber of commerce says
400,000-500,000 people in south-eastern Turkey are benefiting from the
resumed trade. Freight agents say rates have increased by half and some
days, no trucks are available.
Conditions in northern Iraq, controlled by western-supported Kurdish rebels,
are gradually improving. Money is entering the economy, creating jobs in a
region suffering over 60 per cent unemployment. Welding, for instance, is a
growth industry in Zakho. Men weld huge steel tanks for loading onto the
backs of trucks for filling with diesel.
This is because, to comply with sanctions, Turkey forbids the export of
steel tanks to Iraq. But it allows exports of sheet steel, welded into tanks
and later discarded in Turkey. Most trucks, though, head to the oil town of
Mosul, still controlled by Saddam's Baghdad government. There they barter
flour and sugar for diesel. One tonne of flour is worth 6,000 litres of
diesel.
The trade raises awkward questions for UN sanctions. Western diplomats say
they are prepared to turn a blind eye for the time being, since Turkey's
support is needed on other matters, such as renewing the mandate for
Operation Provide Comfort. The joint British, French, US and Turkish support
operation for the Iraqi Kurds is based at Turkey's Incirlik airbase;
parliament is to approve its next six-monthly mandate by the end of the
year.
Sanctions also cover the Kurdish-occupied region where Saddam's writ no
longer runs. The UN does not want to undermine Iraq's territorial integrity
by lifting sanctions in the north and give de facto recognition to a
separate Kurdish state.
The border trade is bringing a dash of prosperity for the Kurds, but their
leaders admit it also helping Saddam. Mr Jalal Talabani, one of the Kurds'
two political leaders, says: 'Turkey is violating sanctions. (Trade) is more
helpful to Iraq than Kurdistan'.
At the moment, Mosul is getting Dollars 500,000 in cash and kind every day
from its exports to Turkey. Resumed trade is highlighting the Kurds' own
difficulties in forming an autonomous government. The factions led by Mr
Talabani and his rival, Mr Massoud Barzani, have only recently agreed to
support a new coalition government after spending most of the summer
fighting each other in battles that cost 8,000 lives.
Mr Barzani's men control the Habur Bridge customs office, and its revenues
of about Dollars 100,000 a day. The government claims it is not receiving
the money, saying trade only benefits the area under Mr Barzani's control.
Criminal gangs on both sides of the frontier and corrupt Turkish officials
are beneficiaries of the Habur Bridge traffic. Drivers say they must pay
bribes equivalent to 8-9 per cent of their load to Turkish customs officers.
Felemez Buran, a truck driver, says: 'If you don't pay, they don't let us
through. Everyone takes money. If you pay good money you can bring 30,000 or
40,000 litres of diesel. If you don't pay, you cannot even bring 500
litres.'
Drivers have to contend with Kurdish guerrillas, now the only armed presence
in northern Iraq, and crime syndicates in Turkey. They all demand their
share in protection money. Anyone unwise enough to refuse paying risks
having their trucks incinerated.
Last week, gangsters set fire to two trucks. The fire did not spread to the
thousands of others parked nose to tail - luckily for everyone there -
drivers, Kurds, customs officers.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Samsung wins permission to make cars: South Korea alters
policy to let chaebol into new industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The South Korea government yesterday approved a plan by Samsung to expand
into the passenger car industry, in a decision which will reduce
administrative efforts to curb the growth of the country's big industrial
groups, or chaebol.
State approval of the Samsung project was part of a new policy to remove
restrictions preventing the chaebol from entering new industries, said Mr
Kim Chul-su, trade and industry minister.
The new chaebol policy reflects the government's efforts to promote
deregulation in an economy which has been heavily influenced by state
intervention. The government abandoned its policy of allotting industries to
designated companies in the late 1980s. But it has since used other measures
to keep the chaebol from growing too large and increasing their dominance of
the national economy.
One favoured means of control has been the requirement that the government
must grant approval for the import of foreign technology. The government has
used this rule to keep the chaebol from establishing new industries,
including initially the Samsung car project, which involves the import of
automotive technology from Nissan of Japan.
But Mr Kim said yesterday the state would no longer exploit the requirement
for this purpose.  'There will be no more restrictions applied on new market
entries by means of disapproving an enterprise's plans for introducing
foreign technology.'
Mr Kim's statement represents a victory for the chaebol, which have been
campaigning for reduced state controls on their activity. They have
criticised the government's attempts to limit their growth as short-sighted
since it forced them to concentrate on established industries and prevented
them from entering new sectors that would ensure their future
competitiveness.
The government's industrial policy would shift its focus to technology,
environmental protection and promoting balanced regional development, while
allowing the chaebol to make investment decisions based on market forces and
free competition, Mr Kim said.
Analysts believe that the government's current policy of forcing the chaebol
to specialise in several core industries is likely to be abandoned. But
doubts remain about the government's commitment to the new chaebol policy.
The administration, for example, still wants to stop Hyundai from entering
the steel sector by building a large integrated steel mill.
The government objected to the Hyundai project because its proposed steel
production technology was outdated and would contribute to pollution, Mr Kim
explained. Hyundai believes that government opposition reflects worries that
the new steel mill would reduce profits for state-controlled Pohang Iron and
Steel, which dominates the domestic steel market.
There are also suggestions that political favouritism is involved since
Samsung is considered a corporate supporter of South Korean President Kim
Young-sam, while Hyundai is regarded as an opponent after Mr Chung Ju-yung,
its founder, stood against Mr Kim in the 1992 presidential election.
But in an apparent attempt to mollify Hyundai, the government decided
yesterday to allow it to import technology for the Chariot minivan from
Mitsubishi of Japan. It had threatened earlier to block the technology
transfer as part of an effort to promote technological independence for the
Korean car industry.
The chaebol have benefited from previous government intervention because it
tended to reduce the number of competitors in specific industries.
Korea's four carmakers have lobbied intensively the government to reject
Samsung's car project because it could threaten the survival of existing
companies. The carmakers fear that the Samsung project will lead to
overcapacity and reduce their domestic market share.
Trade unions associated with the Hyundai, Kia, Daewoo and Ssangyong car
companies are threatening to go on strike today to protest against the
decision on Samsung.

Maj Gen Paul Kagame, Rwanda's vice-president, yesterday accused the
international community of giving aid to 'the criminals who committed the
genocide' in his country, in preference to the 'needy people' both inside
Rwanda and in the refugee frontier camps. In a speech in London Gen Kagame
said that whereas foreign troops had not come to protect people from
genocide, there had been a massive flow of aid to refugee camps after
several hundred thousand people fled across the frontiers into Tanzania,
Zaire and Burundi. He said there was more need of this aid inside the
country.

Garuda to restructure its operations and reduce dependency on
government-sponsored commercial loans to fund its business. President
Suharto has approved the plan but the government has not yet set out a
schedule for Garuda's privatisation, or decided how large a stake to sell

Mr Suthep Thuaksuban, Thailand's deputy agriculture minister, has resigned
after claims he helped to assign land on the resort island of Phuket to 10
rich families under a scheme designed to help landless farmers. The
resignation should help Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's chances of being the
first Thai premier to lead a government to its full four-year term.
The opposition parties - delighted to have some dirt to dish onto the
Democrat party's squeaky clean reputation - have warned that a censure
debate scheduled for December 14 will go ahead as planned. Most government
critics, however, may be satisfied with one or two resignations and the
promise of a full inquiry.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Inflation spectre stalks Australia recovery: An interest
rate rise or unpopular tax increase seems unavoidable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With Australia's growth rate running at around 6.4 per cent - and as much as
7.3 per cent if the drought-stricken farm sector is excluded - the Labor
government of Mr Paul Keating faces a dilemma.
Most of the growth has come from higher domestic demand. Gross national
expenditure in the September quarter rose by 8.3 per cent, year-on-year, a
rate not seen since the late-1980s. No one, from private sector economists
to federal ministers, thinks that this can continue without the economy
reaching capacity constraints that would feed through to higher prices.
At the same time, however, ) the figures released at the end of last month
showed a big rise in business investment, up by 22.2 per cent on the
September quarter level last year. But, while upgraded factories and
expanded production lines may ease the pressure somewhat, a sharp rise in
capital expenditure also threatens to cause different problems.
Australia's new plant and equipment tends to be imported. As a result, a
sudden surge in business investment adds to the trade deficit - a trend
which has been evident recently. Since the country's current account deficit
already stands at about 4 per cent of GDP, any deterioration would be
serious. Already, private sector forecasts suggest a current account deficit
of ADollars 20bn-ADollars 22bn (Pounds 9.9bn-Pounds 10.9bn) for 1994/95,
compared with the government's ADollars 18bn prediction.
'The key figure in the national income data was the 8.3 per cent expenditure
increase,' says Mr Don Stammer, chief economist at stockbroker Bain &amp; Co.
'That was a pretty big swing, especially with Japan slow to come out of
recession and the balance of payments situation. Australia can't afford it.'
The consensus is that annual growth needs to be reined back to 4-5 per cent.
A rate of 3-4 per cent has traditionally been thought appropriate, but the
higher rate is considered justified by the economy's greater ability to tap
fast-growing Asian export markets. The question is how to achieve the
reduction.
Further monetary tightening is a virtual certainty. Short-term interest
rates have already been increased twice since August, by 1.75 percentage
points overall. A further rise of perhaps 1 percentage point is expected
soon.
Contrary to widespread market expectations, the Reserve Bank of Australia
did not move yesterday, the obvious window after its board meeting on
Tuesday. Nevertheless, many pundits think that an increase could still come
before Christmas, and will certainly not be delayed far into the new year.
Mr Bill Shields, economist at Macquarie Bank, says a rise of 1 percentage
point would be about half the 'appropriate' monetary response for the next
six months.
However, interest rate action is no longer regarded as enough, and many
economists are urging additional action on the fiscal front to rein in the
budget deficit and further damp down demand. For a start, some economists
fear that the severity of the rate rises needed if this is the only policy
tool could choke off the investment recovery.
Large rate rises could also be used by unions and employees to justify pay
claims - and there are worryingly large wage demands in the system already.
Only this week, the transport workers' union agreed to take industrial
action against the sector's big trucking companies in pursuit of a 15 per
cent wage rise over two years.
The government's difficulty is that tax increases, always politically
difficult, are particularly problematic now. First, minor parties - the
left-leaning Australian Democrats and the Green party - hold the balance of
power in the Senate, parliament's upper house, through which any tax changes
must pass. For ideological reasons they are likely to oppose anything of a
'regressive' nature - taxes which impose a higher proportional burden on the
poorer sections of the community - whether on the income or consumption tax
front. Ministers have not forgotten the painful two-month period last year
when the 1993/94 federal budget was stalled by political bickering - and
both the government's ratings in the opinion polls and the Australian dollar
plunged.
One possibility would be for the government to bring forward the one
percentage point increase in wholesale sales tax rates which is scheduled to
take effect on July 1 1995, plus some tobacco excise increases which are
also 'in the system' for next year, to January 1.
Other possibilities are a temporary surcharge on the highest marginal income
tax rates and a 'progressive' rise in the Medicare levy - Australia's
national health surcharge - with higher income earners paying relatively
larger increases.
Then there is the question of elections. On the federal front, these do not
have to be called until early 1996, although the government recently opened
the option of an early poll by claiming that the Senate's failure to support
its Aboriginal land fund legislation was grounds for a 'double dissolution'
 -that is of both houses.
But state elections are due to take place early next year in New South
Wales, where the opposition has held a very slender majority.
Such considerations leave commentators divided over whether the government
will implement unpopular tax changes now, hoping that these fade from the
electorate's mind by the time a late federal election takes place, or
whether it will attempt to go to the polls early, seeking a new mandate.
The former is deemed more likely, but Mr Keating has been giving nothing
away. While he acknowledged yesterday that growth was too fast, he also told
parliament that the government was focusing on the May budget to monitor
fiscal policy.
But, he added teasingly, 'that would not preclude any measures which the
treasurer or government thought necessary'.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Former prime ministers compete to lead Japan's new alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two former Japanese prime ministers, Mr Toshiki Kaifu and Mr Tsutomu Hata,
will today compete to be the first leader of Japan's new opposition
alliance.
The struggle for the top job at the New Frontier party, the result of a
merger of nine small opposition groups and the only serious challenge to the
ruling Liberal Democratic party, will be decided by a poll of party members
tonight.
The vote paves the way for the NFP's official inauguration on Saturday. This
will bring a resolution, even if temporary, to the political fragmentation
caused by the wave of defections from the LDP, which recently returned to
power in coalition after spending a year in opposition for the first time in
nearly four decades.
The realignment restores some clarity to Japan's formerly fragmented and
confusing political structure, to the relief of bemused foreign investors.
The NFP's policies are almost the same as those of the conservative LDP,
though it wants less government intervention in the economy.
The open method of choosing a leader, advocated by Mr Hata, marks a break
with secretive traditions such as the LDP's habit of sharing jobs among its
top factions.
The most powerful members of the NFP, including the two leadership
candidates, are former members of the LDP who have left their old party over
the past 18 months in protest at its reluctance to accept political reforms.
Mr Kaifu is widely tipped to win the vote by a small margin because he has
broader support than Mr Hata, whose followers are mostly concentrated in his
own group, the Japan Renewal party, the core of the two previous coalition
governments. A third candidate, Mr Takashi Yonezawa, head of a trade
union-backed group, is an outsider.
The job of NFP secretary-general, second in command, is likely to go to Mr
Ichiro Ozawa, a powerful backroom strategist from the same group as Mr Hata.
Mr Ozawa left the LDP last year and has since been instrumental in bringing
together two coalition governments and this new party. He is the only
candidate for the job.
Mr Kaifu launched plans for reforming the electoral and political system, in
an attempt to regain the public's waning trust of politicians, while he was
LDP prime minister from 1989 to 1991.
Party elders withdrew support for Mr Kaifu when he started pushing reform
too hard for their liking. He finally left the LDP in June, in what turned
out to be an abortive bid to become opposition prime minister. New political
and electoral rules, to take effect on December 25, echo Mr Kaifu's 1991
proposals.
Mr Hata, shortest-serving Japanese prime minister since the second world
war, was in office for two months until the present government, a
three-party coalition of the LDP, socialists and a small centre-left group,
took power in June. He has also held the finance, foreign affairs and
agricultural portfolios.

Switzerland's banks appear to have won a landmark dispute with the federal
prosecutor over disclosing account information of foreign clients suspected
of criminal activities. The prosecutor has agreed not to transmit any
information to a foreign authority unless there has been a formal request
for legal assistance following a proper criminal investigation. The dispute
arose last September when Mrs Carla del Ponte, the federal prosecutor, sent
a list of names of 60 people belonging to the Sicilian Mafia to leading
Swiss banks. Mrs del Ponte suggested to the banks that they make use of a
new clause in the Swiss penal code giving them the right to denounce clients
if criminal activity is suspected. Under the agreement, the federal
prosecutor is free to suggest to a bank that it provides information on
clients it can seek mediation through the Swiss Bankers' Association. If
that fails, the final decision rests with the bank. However, a bank that
knowingly harbours a client when there is strong evidence of law breaking
violates Federal Banking Commission guidelines.

The European Commission has extended the deadline for projects that seek to
use the tax and other incentives for setting up in the International
Financial Services Centre tax haven in Dublin. The original cut-off date of
the end of 1994 has been extended to the end of the century following
representations from the Irish government. Dublin argued that it needed more
time in order to attract enough projects for it to become self-sustaining.
Offshore financial services companies that set up in Dublin by December 31
2000 will have a 10 per cent corporation tax rate until 2005 compared with
the standard 40 per cent. More than 300 banks and financial services
organisations have set up in Dublin since the establishment of the centre in
1987. The main areas are offshore fund management and specialised insurance.

Further talks are to take place today between Ireland's Fine Gael party, the

paedophile priest extradition case which precipitated the fall of Mr Albert
Reynolds' Fianna-Fail-Labour coalition. If there is no agreement on a fresh
coalition in the next few days, Mr Reynolds, as acting prime minister, will
have no choice but to seek an early election.
Talks on a four-party coalition depend on improving the relationship between
Fine Gael's leader, Mr John Bruton, and Labour's Mr Dick Spring, and
reconciling differences between the two smaller parties - the right-wing
Progressive Democrats and the Democratic Left.

Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive tycoon, yesterday agreed to transfer his Sunzest
fruit packaging concern to the north Cyprus government as part payment for
his unpaid debts to the breakaway state, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash said. Bayrak, the north's state broadcasting authority, said Mr
Denktash called Mr Nadir to a cabinet meeting to discuss his debt. Turkey's
Anatolian news agency reported earlier that Mr Nadir had submitted a plan
which would cut his unpaid debts to the state, which amount to Dollars 10m
(Pounds 6.4m). Mr Nadir, a Turkish Cypriot, jumped bail in Britain in 1993
and fled to northern Cyprus rather than face fraud charges stemming from his
running of Polly Peck International.

The Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, yesterday signalled he was
ready to rejoin international talks to end the war in Bosnia. Mr Karadzic
'welcomed the new interpretation' of the five-nation contact group plan,
whereby further work on the map is possible. In another placatory gesture
Bosnian Serb leaders yesterday gave the go-ahead for the despatch of an
emergency relief convoy to desperate Moslems in Bihac, the UN safe area, for
the first time in two months. The UN yesterday was putting the finishing
touches on a plan to evacuate up to one-third of the 1,200 UN soldiers
billeted in the north-western Moslem enclave. Meanwhile, the German
government yesterday postponed making any decision on providing Nato with
Tornado fighter bombers for use over Bosnia because the western alliance had
not formally requested the aircraft, Mr Friedrich Bohl, a chancellery
minister said. However, western diplomats said Bonn declined to make any
decision because the circumstances, scope, and objectives of providing the
Tornados was unclear.

<TEXT>
Mr Michael Portillo, the UK's employment secretary, was yesterday accused of
deception by the senior civil servant at the German ministry of labour over
his decision to veto the European Union draft directive on part-time
workers.
Mr Horst Gunther, a German state secretary, told a European trade union
conference on working time that the other 11 EU member states at the EU's
social affairs council meeting on Tuesday had been 'tricked' by Britain into
believing that it was prepared to compromise. As a result, the draft measure
was watered down to try to meet British objections but at the last moment Mr
Portillo astonished and angered his employment minister colleagues by
refusing to accept it. Mr Gunther made it clear that Germany intended to
mobilise support among the other EU member states for a further development
of the EU's social dimension  - through the creation of minimum labour
standards without undermining competitiveness. The German government
believes this will not require a comprehensive legislative programme but
will emerge through agreement on specific fields of action.
Bonn is insisting that this will involve an enhanced role for European trade
unions in reaching consensus deals with European employers through social
dialogue.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Delors ducks the Ecu64,000 question: The Brussels press
corps failed to get a 'Oui' or a 'Non' on his Elysee ambitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Delors knew his audience was hanging on every word yesterday. But
at the end of a masterly performance ahead of tomorrow's European summit in
Essen, the outgoing president of the European Commission avoided revealing
the answer to the Ecu64,000 question: does he want to succeed President
Francois Mitterrand in the Elysee?
Speculation about Mr Delors's intentions rose to fever pitch last Tuesday in
Budapest on the fringes of the CSCE conference. First, he revealed that he
had, at last, made up his mind on whether to stand in next year's elections;
but then he refused to reveal whether the answer was Oui or Non. Yesterday,
at his 28th and last pre-European Union summit briefing to the Brussels
press corps, he added that he felt 'better' now he had made his decision.
The dilemma for Delors-watchers is whether the mixture of philosophical
musings and emotional outbursts at yesterday's briefing amounted to a
swansong after 10 years in Brussels as the architect of European
integration; or whether what we were witnessing was a dress-rehearsal for a
presidential campaign whose goal would be to kick-start the Franco-German
motor and push ahead for a political and economic union in Europe.
Mr Delors, 69, revealed that he remains a man of many contradictions. At
times, he bemoaned Europe's fate, riven by the Bosnian civil war in its own
backyard and shaken by the forces of fragmentation let loose by the end of
the cold war. He lashed governments for 'taking hostages' in order to get
their own way inside the Union, claiming these blocking tactics had reached
unprecedented levels.
Yet in the same breath, he suggested that Europe was on the mend. The
economic recovery was under way; the European exchange rate system had
survived the currency crises of 1992-3; and there was the promise of peace
in Northern Ireland, to be sweetened this week with a Dollars 360m (Pounds
220m) aid package which he has personally promoted.
'At some funerals, people say 'No flowers or wreaths. You do not have to
send me flowers and it is not time yet for wreaths. Europe is still solid.'
In schoolmasterly fashion, Mr Delors proceeded to tick off the list of
reading material which he intends to present to European leaders in Essen:
economic competitiveness; the labour market; a case study in job creation,
and the new information society - all part of what one senior EU diplomat in
Brussels describes as Mr Delors's obsession with Europe's competitive
weakness in relation to the US and Asia.
If there were hints of a hidden agenda, it came when Mr Delors launched an
outspoken attack on the US for pressing the case for early expansion of the
Nato alliance to encompass the former Soviet Union's satellites in central
and eastern Europe.
His criticism of the Clinton administration's tactics is shared widely in
European capitals, including London; but it would do him no harm among
French voters, many of whom remain reflexively anti-American.
Second, his cri de coeur about an economic recovery which has failed to
create jobs anticipates one of the chief topics on the Essen summit agenda;
but it also matches the mood in France where the economy is pulling out of
recession more slowly than its neighbours.
Third, Mr Delors dropped several hints that he is deeply dissatisfied with
the operation of the Maastricht treaty, particularly the 'pillar system'
which mixes supranational powers in areas such as agriculture and
competition policy with loose inter-governmentalism in foreign policy,
security, and judicial affairs.
Mr Delors has already spelled out his preference for a European federation,
built around what would amount to a Franco-German political union, in a
stream of interviews with the French, and latterly, the German press over
the past few months. To Mr Delors, this could be the makings of a strategic
bargain between France and the more powerful unified Germany; but in his
native France it has led to charges that he is coming dangerously close to
being a German 'collaborator'.
During his news conference yesterday, Mr Delors, who remains notoriously
sensitive, let slip that he felt that some of the criticism in France was
way below the belt. 'Every human activity is imperfect,' he protested.
Such sensitivity is not conducive to a presidential campaign; but on the
other hand Mr Delors can see an opposition divided, his own Socialist party
in turmoil, and a country in search of direction as Europe seeks to bring
together east and west.

<TEXT>
Denmark's Economic Council, a panel of independent academic advisers to the
government, yesterday estimated that consumer prices will rise 2.7 per cent
in 1995 and 3.0 per cent in 1996, from 1.8 per cent this year. It also
forecast a rise in GDP of 3.5 per cent in 1995 and 3.2 per cent in 1996. It
expected private consumption to rise by 7.7 per cent this year, 5.5 per cent
in 1995, and 4.6 per cent in 1996. The 'wisemen's council' said that rises
in wage costs would be the main source of inflationary pressures on the
economy in 1995 and 1996. The council's growth and inflation forecasts are
at the upper end of economists' estimates. The council warned that 'if wage
costs rise more sharply than expected it will be necessary to implement
fiscal policy tightening in order to maintain competitiveness and interest
rate levels'. The council said that even if growth were lower than expected,
the government should tighten fiscal policy by 1996 in order to sustain the
recovery.

The European Commission has extended the deadline for projects that seek to
use the tax and other incentives for setting up in the International
Financial Services Centre tax haven in Dublin. The original cut-off date of
the end of 1994 has been extended to the end of the century following
representations from the Irish government. Dublin argued that it needed more
time in order to attract enough projects for it to become self-sustaining.
Offshore financial services companies that set up in Dublin by December 31
2000 will have a 10 per cent corporation tax rate until 2005 compared with
the standard 40 per cent. More than 300 banks and financial services
organisations have set up in Dublin since the establishment of the centre in
1987. The main areas are offshore fund management and specialised insurance.
More than 2,000 people are employed and nearly Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6m) in
offshore funds are managed in Dublin. Merrill Lynch and Fidelity announced
earlier this week that they will be setting up there along with more than 30
other new companies. Companies based in the centre are expected to
contribute IPounds 200m (Pounds 196m) in tax to the Irish exchequer this
year, more than 15 per cent of the tax take.

Ireland's main opposition parties were yesterday engaged in a last-ditch
effort to patch together a multi-party coalition to head off an early
general election. Mr John Bruton's Fine Gael party, the parliament's second
largest party, yesterday convened round-table talks with the Labour party -
which abandoned talks with Fianna Fail on continuing the ruling coalition on
Tuesday - and the Progressive Democrats and Democratic Left. If no
government emerges, elections will be unavoidable. Yesterday a cross-party
committee in the Irish parliament was taking evidence on the judicial
appointments scandal which brought down the Fianna Fail-Labour party
government.

Deutsche Telekom, which is to be privatised soon, yesterday began internal
investigations following press reports that thousands of its employees were
suspected of working with criminal gangs to syphon off the charges from
overseas telephone calls. Police seized documents from a company in
Dusseldorf which deals with telephones and computers and another company in
the city was reported to have run up a bill of DM2m (Pounds 800m) after
making calls to the Dutch Antilles. Neither the police nor Deutsche Telekom
could confirm press reports that losses of up to DM500m had been run up in
the scam. However, the investigations are a setback for the company which
just two weeks ago announced a consortium of leading international banks to
handle the first stage of its privatisation in 1996.

Greece's Socialist government is planning to drop charges of illegal
telephone tapping and accepting bribes against Mr Constantine Mitsotakis,
the conservative former prime minister. Mr Mitsotakis is due to be tried by
a special court on January 23 for allegedly ordering phone-taps of political
opponents. In a separate case he is accused of accepting a Dollars 22.5m
(Pounds 13.7m) bribe in the sale of Heracles General Cement to Calcestruzzi
of Italy in 1992. The Socialists appear to be arranging a political
trade-off in which Mr Mitsotakis and other backbenchers in the opposition
New Democracy party would back the government candidate in next spring's
presidential ballot. If the Socialists fail to find the 10 extra votes in
parliament needed to elect a new head of state, they face an early general
election.

FT  08 DEC 94 / EU set to back Eko Stahl aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union ministers are expected today to approve DM910m (Pounds 370m)
in state aid for Eko Stahl, east Germany's biggest steelmaker, after the UK
dropped its objections.
Under pressure from the British steel industry, the UK had argued that the
subsidies were not accompanied by adequate reductions in capacity and
delayed a deal on the lossmaking plant. However, extensive bilateral talks
between the UK and Germany appear to have yielded a solution, with the
Germans offering to reduce the extent of commercial loan guarantees given.
But while officials in Brussels were last night optimistic that the Eko
Stahl deal would be finalised today, there is a chance that Greece will
produce a new stumbling block. At a meeting between representatives from the
member states in Brussels last night, the Greeks attempted to hold an Eko
Stahl deal hostage to subsidy concessions on a Greek shipyard being prepared
for privatisation.
The Greek move follows action by France to link its approval of the steel
aid to a separate dispute over an international pact to cut shipbuilding
subsidies.
Such behaviour - not confined to Greece and France - was fiercely criticised
by Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, who said he had never seen
so many hostages being taken by individual member states.
'It is an indication of the deterioration of the climate in the European
Union,' he said.
Approval of the Eko Stahl aid will open the way for the takeover and
modernisation of the plant by the Belgian steelmaker Cockerill Sambre. It
has agreed to pay DM30m for a 60 per cent stake in the enterprise and
intends to invest a further DM440m in modernising the mill's blast furnace
and building a hot-rolling mill.
Apart from the German state aid, the deal involves privatisation of Eko
Stahl. Capacity cuts will take place at other east German plants.
The UK's objections stemmed from a fear that the aid agreed for the
Cockerill Sambre takeover was worth more than that agreed last year with
Riva of Italy, which eventually withdrew.
It appears that the Germans have agreed to lower the level of guarantees for
commercial loans from the original DM200m. Yesterday a UK official said it
had sought a reduction to under DM100m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Greek parliament was expected late last night to approve a plan to
restructure Olympic Airways, the loss-making state carrier. The legislation
paves the way for a cut of 1,900 jobs, a management overhaul in the next six
months and measures to improve productivity.
The three-year plan, agreed earlier this year with the European Commission,
is designed to return the airline to profit by 1997. The Greek government
will provide a final injection of Dr54bn (Pounds 142m) into Olympic and
write off accumulated debts of Dr491bn.
Among Olympic's unions only the cabin crews have refused to accept the plan,
which is due to take effect on January 10. They object to a two-year freeze
on the pay of all employees and increased working hours. However, a strike
threat was brushed aside by a senior Olympic official. 'We expect the flight
attendants to fall into line in the next few days,' he said. 'They have few
grounds for argument because their productivity is the lowest in the
company.' Cabin crews fly an average of only 30 hours monthly.
The restructuring plan aims to turn last year's Dr135bn losses into a Dr14bn
profit next year. Up to Dollars 378m in government-guaranteed financing is
to be provided for buying new aircraft, the funds to come from a ticket
surcharge originally intended to help finance a new Athens airport.
Under the new legislation, Olympic is to be operated as a private company, a
change that should add flexibility in setting ticket prices and changing
management practices. The airline has already appointed two international
consultants to oversee changes in organisation and management, due to take
effect next spring.
However, Olympic will find it difficult to claw back market share lost to
charter operators that carry two-thirds of the 10m tourists who visit Greece
each summer, and to small Greek private airlines flying on the main domestic
routes.
Olympic's share of air traffic to and from Greece has dropped to 12 per
cent, while its passenger load factor has fallen from 68 to 60 per cent of
seats in the past five years. The state carrier is obliged to fly to remote
Greek islands year-round to keep communications open, although these routes
make heavy losses in winter.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Di Pietro has had enough, perhaps: Robert Graham looks at
the motivations behind this week's decision by Italy's best-known
anti-corruption magistrate to quit his job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Resignations in Italy are usually threats and rarely final. Thus, Mr Antonio
Di Pietro, Italy's best known anti-corruption magistrate, has kept everyone
guessing by stripping off his 'toga' in court on Tuesday and announcing his
resignation. His departure will not become final until January, giving him
plenty of time to heed the chorus urging him to remain a magistrate.
If Mr Di Pietro intended a dramatic demonstration of his frustration with
the increasing political difficulties of investigating corruption in
sensitive areas of Italian life, then he has already achieved his aim.
This policeman who studied at night to become a magistrate, and who has
revolutionised investigative work through computerisation, has elicited a
huge groundswell of public support.
Even President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has urged him to reconsider his
decision.
Milan magistrates have already used the resignation threat successfully
before against Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government. In July, they forced the
justice ministry to withdraw legislation curbing magistrates' powers of
preventive detention by announcing their collective resignations - the
announcement was made by Mr Di Pietro.
This time, however, he has presented himself more as a victim and the
message behind his resignation letter is more ambiguous.
He complained that he could no longer work as he had become a sort of
political football, kicked around by a self-seeking government and
opposition. Clearly there was an element of weariness and personal pique.
But there is sound evidence to back his complaint about the increasingly
politicised atmosphere surrounding his anti-corruption investigations, which
includes Mr Berlusconi as head of his Fininvest empire.
The government has sent justice ministry inspectors to Milan to check claims
that the magistrates have abused their authority. It is unprecedented for a
government to conduct such an investigation into inquiries which are still
in progress; and the action is all the more questionable because those
inquiries concern the prime minister himself.
Mr Di Pietro was also one of those most affected by last month's appeal
court decision to switch a key investigation to nearby Brescia on the
grounds that the rights of the accused were not properly guaranteed. This
investigation was into the widespread practice of businesses bribing the
Guardia di Finanza financial police to ensure benign tax inspections. It
also involved Fininvest - and, as a result, the legal status of Milan's
impending interrogation (it probably have been by Mr Di Pietro) of Mr
Berlusconi in this respect is in doubt.
But if Mr Di Pietro is now crying foul over government attempts to block his
investigations, he can scarcely pretend that his actions have not been
political. He has not protested about the deliberate leaks of information
discrediting an entire political class since he made his first corruption
arrest in February 1992 in what have come to be known as the 'clean hands'
investigations. He has appeared to enjoy his celebrity.
In September, he chose an invitation to the annual businessmen's meeting at
Cernobbio near Milan to launch his ideas about reaching a political solution
to the clean hands corruption inquiries. The ideas fell on deaf ears largely
because politicians in both the government and opposition felt the move
should come from parliament, not the magistrature.
He was said to have been very bitter about the loss of this opportunity to
tackle what remains a huge unresolved problem: How do the justice system and
Italy's institutions come to terms with corruption when it is all pervasive?
Can the investigations be open-ended and therefore never-ending?
This is one of the issues highlighted now. Mr Di Pietro has been
instrumental in proving the existence of corruption. Indeed, his resignation
came after he had asked for prison sentences on 24 businessmen and
politicians, including all five leaders of the parties in the previous
Christian Democrat-led coalitions. But sooner or later the government and
parliament have to decide how long it is feasible for these investigations
go on without risking destabilising the country permanently.
The earlier Amato government nearly fell on this issue because legislation
looked like a pardon for all those found guilty of corruption. The same
happened in July when legislation curbing the magistrates' powers of
preventive detention was seen as a sell-out to corrupt politicians. If Mr Di
Pietro's resignation is also seen as a protest against such a sell-out, it
complicates the finding of a political solution to 'clean hands'.
But even if Mr Di Pietro genuinely leaves his job, he will still have a role
to play. He cannot return to being a simple citizen in his native southern
Italy.
Now, more than ever, he is a national figure with enormous political weight:
a prize to be poached by any party or government. Mr Berlusconi realised
this when he vainly courted him in May for the interior portfolio.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Telecom Italia plea suffers setback

Italy's anti-trust authority has increased pressure on the government to
reject Telecom Italia's demand for tariff concessions to offset increased
competition in mobile telephone services.
In one of his first acts as head of the authority, Mr Giuliano Amato, a
former prime minister, has warned that the authority would almost certainly
have to take action if Telecom Italia won concessions on tariffs and used
its new pricing freedom to hinder the development of the new Omnitel-Pronto
Italia consortium.
That consortium, headed by the Olivetti computer group, won the licence to
build the country's second pan-European digital mobile phone network in
March, and will have the freedom to set prices at any level on that network.
Telecom Italia now wants the same freedom to set prices on the existing
national analogue network, over which it has a monopoly, arguing that,
otherwise, Omnitel will be able to undercut its service, which has more than
2m subscribers. Subscribers to the analogue network can only use their
telephones in Italy whereas digital customers can make and receive calls in
many other European countries. Telecom Italia also wants a reduction in its
annual fee to the government, to compensate for the advent of competition.
In a letter to Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, and other
ministers, Mr Amato warned that if Telecom Italia made 'strategic use' of
its already dominant position, 'it would be difficult for the (anti-trust)
authority not to intervene. . . . to remove the conditions which obstruct
competition'. He also pointed out that a long and messy anti-trust inquiry
would further delay liberalisation of mobile telephone services, a process
which is already running behind that of other European countries.
Yesterday, the committee of ministers which has to decide on Telecom
Italia's demands postponed a discussion until December 15, 'to allow for
further in-depth consideration of the questions raised, and to listen to the
positions expressed by the parties involved'.
Omnitel, which hopes to have a commercial service operating in Italy by the
end of next year, argues that Telecom Italia has a strong lead in the
Italian market for mobile services, even if the state company has not been
allowed until now to develop its own digital network. Telecom Italia,
however, believes it ought to be able to compete directly with Omnitel on
digital and analogue services.
Mr Amato's informal intervention is unusual, and based on only a preliminary
assessment of the situation. But the anti-trust authority wanted to
underline the risks involved in granting further concessions to Telecom
Italia given that 'the opening of digital mobile phone services to
competition represents a fundamental step in the process of liberalising the
entire telecoms sector'.
Further delay could also provoke action from the European Commission, which
has kept a close watch on the gradual liberalisation of the market.
Since last week, neither Telecom Italia nor Omnitel has commented publicly
on the situation, but behind the scenes there has been fierce lobbying of
ministers. Telecom Italia has also deliberately withheld its signature on
the joint convention which will govern the new digital 'GSM' services, even
though it was signed by Omnitel last week.

FT  08 DEC 94 / German coal levy is ruled illegal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's heavily subsidised coal industry was thrown into turmoil yesterday
after the country's constitutional court ruled that a controversial levy
paid by industrial and private electricity consumers to support domestic
coal production was unconstitutional.
The decision was immediately welcomed by Mr Erwin Teufel, prime minister of
Baden-Wurttemberg, who said the Kohlepfennig, the special levy to protect
domestic coal production against imports, was 'unjust and against the
principles of the free market economy'.
But Germany's powerful miners' trade union, IG Bergbau, called the findings
'hugely disappointing'. 'It is now up to the government to act as quickly as
possible to find a way to subsidise our coal after 1995,' said Mr Christoph
Meer, a union spokesman.
The constitutional court's decision comes eight years after the case was
first sent to it by the district court in Moers, near Dusseldorf, acting on
behalf on an individual who refused to pay the Kohlepfennig.
The court said yesterday the government would have to phase out the levy by
the end of next year. That would coincide with the termination of another
coal subsidy, the Jahrhundertvertrag, which obliges German electricity
utilities to buy domestic coal.
'We respect the decision of the court,' said Mr Friedrich Bohl, chancellery
minister, adding that the government 'would scrutinise the ruling
carefully'.
The Kohlepfennig, which amounts to a 7.5 per cent levy on industrial and
consumer electricity prices, was introduced in 1976 as a means of protecting
domestic coal production against cheap coal imports. A tonne of west German
coal costs DM280-DM290 (Pounds 114-Pounds 118) against imports costing an
average DM83-DM90.
At the same time, under the terms of the Jahrhundertvertrag, Germany's
electricity companies are commited to buying about 40m tonnes of domestic
coal a year to protect the industry. In all, through the Kohlepfennig, the
government has been subsidising the coal sector to the tune of about DM8bn a
year.
But German industry, which is saddled with some of the highest electricity
prices in the European Union - tarrifs are 30 per cent more expensive than
neighbouring France - has repeatedly demanded a reform of the subsidies,
claiming they have hindered competitiveness, and competition.
In response, the government decided in November 1993 to extend the entire
system only until the end of 1996, to impose a 4.5 per cent Kohlepfennig on
east Germany even though the region neither produces nor consumes hard coal,
and to reduce subsidies to DM7bn between 1997 and 2000.
No decision has yet been made about how to finance the subsidies after 1996.
Yesterday's court ruling means the matter can no longer be postponed.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Berlusconi loses ruling on TV ownership
</HEADLINE>

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The possession of three commercial television channels by Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest media empire has been ruled unconstitutional.
The ruling, published yesterday by Italy's constitutional court, will force
a big shake-up of Italian television ownership. This already seemed likely
with a referendum pending early next year on the future of the current
television structure.
The decision comes at a time when there is increasing concern about the
conflict of interest between Mr Berlusconi's role as prime minister and his
ownership of Fininvest. Last month he promised to float his television
interests on the stock market to resolve the problem; but the court ruling
makes the valuation of these interests - split among a plethora of companies
 -even more complicated.
Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest, whose three channels control 45 per cent of the
market and account for 85 per cent of commercial television, has until
August 1996 to comply.
Yesterday Mr Fedele Confalonieri, Fininvest chairman, said the group would
fight hard to prevent the potential loss of one and perhaps two channels. In
1993 Fininvest's television interests generated income of L3,877bn (Pounds
1.5bn) and returned profits of L288m.
At present the operations of the three channels are closely integrated,
relying on shared facilities and a common film library valued at about
Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 770m). The group hopes to exploit a part of the
court's decision which recommended that the current limit of 12 channels be
eliminated.
Mr Confalonieri said if the total number of channels was expanded beyond the
current legal ceiling of 12 then the dominant position of one group owning
three channels would be removed. This liberalisation of the market would
help Fininvest to hold on to its three channels. The ceiling can only be
removed by parliament. Another solution he suggested, albeit interim, would
be for Fininvest to lease one of its channels.
The dominant position of Fininvest in commercial television, a unique
situation in a European Union country, was formalised by a law in 1990.
The law was the result of a highly politicised trade-off between Mr
Berlusconi, then closely linked to Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader,
and the political parties. In return for Mr Berlusconi being allowed to
retain three channels and a near monopoly position of commercial television
advertising, the RAI, the state broadcasting organisation, was left free to
be controlled by the leading parties - the main channel by the Christian
Democrats, the second by the Socialists and the third by the then
Communists.
Small television operators led by Telemontecarlo, Videomusic and Elefante TV
challenged the law, ending up in the constitutional court.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Delors attacks Nato plan to expand east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, yesterday strongly
criticised US efforts to expand Nato membership into eastern Europe,
describing it as a 'dangerous mistake'.
'I think it was a premature initiative which was badly timed,' he said in
Brussels, speaking ahead of a two-day summit for EU heads of state in Essen,
Germany, which starts tomorrow.
Earlier this week, western nations endorsed US-inspired plans for a faster
expansion of Nato to include the former Warsaw Pact countries - a move that
was welcomed by the countries concerned, but which infuriated Russian
president Boris Yeltsin.
Mr Delors' attack on the push for early expansion comes amid renewed
transatlantic tension over the situation in Bosnia. Mr Alain Juppe, the
French foreign minister, told parliament his government had asked the UN and
Nato to intensify planning to withdraw peacekeepers from Bosnia because
international mediation efforts there had reached a dead end.
His call came as the UN was completing a plan to evacuate up to a third of
the 1,200 UN Bangladeshi soldiers billeted in the north-western Moslem
enclave of Bihac, which is under Bosnian Serb attack.
Mr Delors' misgivings are shared elsewhere in Europe. The UK, for example,
has private reservations about the decision to press for early enlargement
of Nato. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, told Mr Yeltsin this
week that any expansion of Nato would be gradual and balanced.
'If I had had something to say in the matter, I wouldn't have advised the US
to advocate enlargement of the Atlantic alliance,' Mr Delors said. He is
expected to announce soon whether he will stand for the French presidency,
but yesterday only repeated that he had made up his mind on the matter.
The Nato expansion strategy has split the allies, angered the Russians and
failed to help security in the region, Mr Delors said. It had also
complicated matters for the EU in its efforts to bring the countries of east
and central Europe into the Union.
At the Essen summit, Mr Delors hopes that EU leaders will send a positive
signal to the Union's neighbours, but particularly those on its eastern
flank - Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia
 -whose leaders will meet their EU counterparts on Saturday.
A central issue at the Essen summit will be discussion of eastwards
expansion, focusing particularly on a paper setting out what needs to be
done by the six countries to adjust their economies to those of their
western neighbours.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Rival bids for VSEL to face monopolies inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, yesterday referred
bids from both British Aerospace and GEC for the submarine-maker VSEL to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The decision surprised the City, which
had confidently expected both bids to be cleared. VSEL's share price fell
sharply from Pounds 15.35 to Pounds 13.35.
Such a double referral is highly unusual. The last time a similar event
happened was in 1989 when a joint bid by GEC and Siemens for Plessey, the
electronics company, was passed to the commission. That bid was eventually
cleared.
Mr Heseltine referred GEC's bid on the grounds of competition because GEC
already owns the other large UK warship yard at Yarrow on the Clyde. This
was in line with the recommendation of the Office of Fair Trading's
director-general, Sir Bryan Carsberg. BAe's bid was not referred on
competition but on other public interest grounds, according to the
Department of Trade and Industry.
However, City observers said the government was taking the line of least
resistance. 'Once the OFT had recommended that GEC was referred, then I
think both companies were always going to the MMC,' said one analyst. 'It
was the easiest thing to do.'
Another said he thought a reference was 'a waste of time and money. One of
these companies is going to end up owning VSEL and they might as well have
fought it out in the market. But I do think the government is also sending a
signal that it would not welcome a closer link between BAe and GEC.'
The defence procurement minister, Mr Roger Freeman, is tonight giving a
speech which advocates stronger ties between European defence companies, a
shift away from the traditional policy of national autonomy.
The speech also appears to argue against a link-up between BAe and GEC. Both
bids automatically lapse as a result of the referral. The commission has
been given until March 15 to make recommendations about whether the bids
should be allowed to proceed.
British Aerospace said last night it was disappointed but it would fight its
case through the MMC inquiry, and was confident it could satisfy any
concerns the commission might have.
GEC will decide in the next few days whether to pursue its bid through the
three-month investigation, the company said.
VSEL's chief executive, Mr Noel Davies, said he was disappointed by the
decision because it meant that his workforce and shareholders would be left
with uncertainty.
Behind the scenes, however, several executives close to the bid were
expressing their anger at what they regarded as the government taking the
easy way out.
BAe's shares fell 4p to 433p, GEC's shares rose 2.5p to 275.5p.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Republicans want Fed role on inflation to be boosted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senior Republicans yesterday signalled they would seek a radical revision in
the US Federal Reserve's legislative mandate, obliging it to put more
emphasis on holding down inflation.
The Fed's sole goal should be to keep consumer price inflation below 2 per
cent, said Senator Connie Mack of Florida, chairman-elect of the influential
Joint Economic Committee of Congress. Under existing legislation, the Fed is
required to promote full employment and economic growth, as well as stable
prices.
The Republican proposal followed an oblique warning from Mr Alan Greenspan,
Fed chairman, that US short-term interest rates may have to be raised again.
Mr Greenspan said the economy was growing faster than expected and expressed
concern that financial markets apparently still doubted the Fed's resolve to
fight inflation. Testifying before the committee, Mr Greenspan said the
present level of US bond prices signalled a widespread expectation that
inflation 'will move higher'. He reiterated his determination to prevent
this occurring, a commitment interpreted in financial markets as a strong
hint that monetary policy will be tightened further. Fed policymakers meet
on December 20 to review monetary policy.
Consumer price inflation was 'flat or down somewhat compared with last
year', Mr Greenspan said, but he warned that prices of intermediate goods
were accelerating. Prices of raw commodities had been rising rapidly for
nearly two years. He said there was little evidence that US productivity was
rising rapidly enough to offset the upward pressure on prices that normally
occurs when the economy approaches industrial capacity constraints.
Mr Greenspan has long supported a change in the Fed's mandate to make
control of inflation its sole objective. Such a change would bring US policy
into line with that of many other industrial countries which have set
inflation targets for their central banks.
He welcomed Senator Mack's proposal but cautioned that setting a specific
inflation target might 'create an unnecessary degree of rigidity'. He
favoured a general requirement to achieve price stability.
Mr Greenspan said the economic outlook remained the best in 20 years. There
was little evidence that the pace of economic growth had yet been retarded,
despite six increases in short-term rates this year.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Clarke lifts rates to reassure City: Major resists pressure
to readmit Tory rebels in wake of defeat over VAT on fuel Chancellor seeks
ways to fund Pounds 1bn shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, PETER NORMAN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's government moved swiftly yesterday to retain the confidence
of financial markets in the wake of its latest political crisis by raising
interest rates 0.5 points to 6.25 per cent.
The rise came ahead of an announcement today by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, of a package of spending cuts and possible tax rises to fill the
Pounds 1bn gap left by the enforced scrapping of the second stage of value
added tax on domestic fuel.
In an apparent olive branch to his party's right wing after the recent Tory
infighting over Europe, the prime minister hinted at a possible referendum
on European integration.
Moves towards a single European currency would represent a 'very significant
decision', he said. Speaking on Channel Four news, he insisted that a
referendum could not be used as a tactical device, but added: 'I have not
ruled out a referendum but it is a long way away.'
Amid undisguised jubilation in the opposition parties at the government's
humiliation on Tuesday night, Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, said the
Commons defeat marked 'a decisive turn in the political tide'. Mr Paddy
Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the government's position was now
irrecoverable.
Mr Major shrugged off suggestions that his government had lost its authority
and dismissed speculation that his leadership was under threat. However, he
implicitly acknowledged that the government might not be able to see out its
full parliamentary term to mid-1997.
But as the government struggled to contain the political fall-out from its
most significant Commons defeat during 15 years in office, there were new
divisions in the Tory party and signs of recriminations in the cabinet.
Mr Major faced strong pressure from the Tory right to readmit to the
parliamentary party the nine Eurosceptic MPs who played a crucial part in
forcing the government to abandon its proposed increase in VAT on fuel from
8 per cent to 17.5 per cent.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Treasury chief secretary, said he hoped soon to see
some 'bridge-building', a view shared by other rightwing members of the
cabinet.
In talks with party managers yesterday, Mr Major rejected the idea that the
suspended MPs should be readmitted quickly. However, in a further concession
to Eurosceptic demands, the government avoided further embarrassment on the
European Union finance bill, which triggered the present political storm, by
agreeing to strong measures to curb EU fraud. The government comfortably won
a confidence vote on the third reading of the bill.
There were signs yesterday of disagreement in the cabinet over the events of
the past two weeks. Rightwing MPs said they had been told that Mr Major had
misjudged the mood of the party. In separate criticisms of Mr Clarke's
handling of the VAT issue, there were strong reports, denied by Downing
Street, that the prime minister had been among a handful of ministers who
wanted the chancellor to drop the proposed VAT increase.
Meanwhile, Mr Major's long-standing enemies on the right of the party were
joined by less controversial senior MPs in suggesting that his leadership
now depends on his ability to restore a semblance of unity to the party.
Mr Major himself appeared outwardly unruffled by the latest setback.
Speaking at a breakfast for businessmen, he insisted that the government
would stick firmly to a strategy of low inflation and strong growth.
The base rate increase, which pleased the City but caused dismay among
industry groups and retailers, was decided in the morning by Mr Clarke at
his monthly monetary meeting with Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank
of England, and announced immediately afterwards.
Ministers later made clear that the defeat in the Commons had turned an
expected rise in rates into what one termed an 'unavoidable certainty'.
Mr Clarke gave a robust defence of his action in television and radio
interviews. The rate increase, he said, was needed 'to sustain economic
recovery with low inflation', leading to higher living standards and more
jobs. Like his first half-point rate increase in September, it was 'the
right response' to signs of inflationary pressures.
Official figures provided further evidence of the UK economy's fast growth.
The Central Statistical Office said manufacturing output grew a seasonally
adjusted 0.5 per cent in October from September, and was 5.5 per cent up on
October last year.
The City reacted positively to the rate increase but it drew criticism from
industry and commerce. The main mortgage lenders held back from immediate
rate increases.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, director-general of the Institute of Directors, said
investment would be dearer. Mr Hugh Clark, trading policy director of the
British Retail Consortium, said the rise was 'exceedingly ill-timed'. j
The rate rise underpinned sterling, lifting the pound by  3/4 pfennig to
DM2.4576. It also boosted bonds, with 10-year gilts adding  1/4 point.
However, the FT-SE 100 index closed at 3,012.5, down 3.6.

FT  08 DEC 94 / Spending cuts loom as rates rise: Capital plans face axe to
meet Pounds 1bn shortfall - Chancellor acts to retain confidence of
financial markets with half point increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, PETER NORMAN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's government moved swiftly yesterday to hold the confidence of
financial markets in the wake of its latest political crisis by pushing up
interest rates 0.5 points to 6.25 per cent.
The rise came ahead of an announcement today by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, of a package of possible tax rises and spending cuts to fill the
Pounds 1bn gap left by the enforced scrapping of the second stage of
value-added tax on domestic fuel. Ministers expect most if not all of the
shortfall to be made up in spending cuts, with capital programmes a likely
target.
In an apparent olive branch to his party's right wing after the recent Tory

Moves towards a single European currency would represent a 'very significant

But the idea that the suspended MPs should be readmitted quickly was flatly
rejected by the prime minister in talks with Tory party managers. He refused
to give any timetable for the rebels' possible re-entry to the parliamentary
party.
Downing Street also slapped down suggestions that Mr Richard Ryder's
position as chief whip might be in doubt in the wake of the VAT-on-fuel
defeat.
There were signs, however, of separate disagreements in the cabinet over the
events of the past two weeks. Rightwing MPs said they had been told that Mr

investment would be dearer. Mr Hugh Clark, trading policy director of the
British Retail Consortium, which represents 90 per cent of the UK retail
trade, said the rise was 'exceedingly ill-timed and unwelcome', coming in
the middle of the crucial Christmas trading period.
The rate increase underpinned sterling, lifting the pound by  3/4 pfennig to
DM2.4576. It also boosted bonds, with 10-year gilts adding 1/4 point.
However, equities reversed early gains in line with Wall Street, with the
FTSE-100 index closing at 3,012.5, down 3.6.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Survey of Zimbabwe (10): How country is held back -
Industrial production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manufacturing, targeted in the original Economic Structural Adjuestment
Programme document as the flagship of structural adjustment, is struggling
to come to terms with the new global and regional order as well as policy
reform at home.
Far from growing at 5.8 per cent a year since 1990 as projected, industrial
production is currently running at pre-reform (1989) levels, 9 per cent
below its pre-drought peak reached in 1991, and on current trends will break
new ground only towards the end of 1995.
Even that four-year standstill assessment is regarded as unduly optimistic
by some manufacturers. August's Business Tendency Survey by the Central
Statistical Office found that 82 per cent of manufacturing firms were
operating below capacity, order books had shortened with weak demand both in
domestic and export markets, and investment intentions and employment had
fallen.
Manufacturers, especially those in clothing and textiles, warn that the
country is being deindustrialised because of excessively high interest
rates, the abolition of the 9 per cent export incentive at the end of 1993
and trade liberalisation leading to 'dumping' by Asian and South African
suppliers.
The World Bank is more optimistic, arguing that if 10 per cent annual export
growth could be achieved, manufacturing would resume the lead role it played
during the sanctions period, expanding at 6 to 7 per cent annually. There
are two main snags in this scenario: a quarter of a century of
self-sufficiency led to Zimbabwe being ranked as the second most
industrialised low-income country in the world, after China, with
manufacturing accounting for 27 per cent of GDP. Whether there is scope to
push this ratio to 30 per cent and beyond in a Dollars 5bn market and with
some manufacturing activities already being relocated in South Africa, with
its Dollars 120bn market, is questionable.
The second potential pitfall is the Bank's view of modern manufacturing. It
argues that comparative advantage is driven by resource endowment (low cost
labour) and price, while quality, design, style, and delivery play little
part. The roles of scope and scale economies, experience effects, the
cross-border vertical integration of manufacturing activities and, above
all, the regional factor, are underplayed. Yet increasingly, these will
determine whether 10 per cent growth in manufactured exports is on the
cards.
If semi-processed goods - ferrochrome and cotton lint - are excluded,
manufactured exports have a volatile track record, contracting in the first
half of the 1980s, before surging 70 per cent in the next three years. In
1989, on the eve of ESAP, manufactures accounted for a quarter of
merchandise exports, with clothing and textiles the largest group worth
Dollars 68m. Since 1989 only clothing and textiles have performed,
increasing 80 per cent to Dollars 122m last year, with the remainder static
at Dollars 340m.
The rapid export growth necessary to revive industry's fortunes depends not
just on changes to the tax and protection regimes, on which topic Zimbabwe
is receiving lots of good advice from the Bank, the United Nations
Development Programme and other consultants, but also on a revolution in
industry's managerial and corporate cultures. A UNDP study finds that while
effective protection rates in manufacturing are not high in relation to some
countries, levels of more than 50 per cent are too high.
Highly protected activities cited include rates of 137 to 248 per cent for
electric motors, over 90 per cent in electronics (TV, stereos, tape
recorders), 78 to 81 per cent for domestic and commercial refrigerators,
between 60 and 97 per cent for furniture, and 72 per cent for garments.
Industries hit hardest by trade liberalisation include electronics, food
processing and clothing, where most competing imports were excluded through
the operation of the negative list.
Companies in these sectors, especially clothing, have since suffered a
triple blow: loss of protection, a more compressed duty structure with
tariffs on finished goods reduced relative to those on imported inputs, and
a sharp decline in domestic demand caused by drought and falling real wages.
Even so, import substitution continues to be protected whereas the best
exporters can hope for is zero protection, and even that assumes that the
duty drawback system works efficiently, which it does not.
According to the UNDP, low local value-added exporters are suffering,
because tariffs and duties on inputs to protect upstream activities
(textiles) hurt downstream players (clothing).
Two other drawbacks are implicit in the existing system of protection: it
encourages greater vertical integration and militates against smaller
indigenous firms, and it protects capital-intensive activities more than
labour-intensive ones. The proposed switch to VAT and the reduced reliance
on import duties should enhance the competitiveness of industrial exporters.
Government officials are optimistic that the Export Processing Zone
legislation will shift the incentive structure in favour of labour-intensive
value-added activities, though many feel Zimbabwe has missed this particular
bus. The UNDP report argues that if a duty exemption system for exporters,
along the lines of the Inward Processing Rebate scheme, could be
implemented, then the chief advantage from EPZ investment would be the
five-year tax holiday.
One lesson from African structural adjustment programmes should not be
forgotten. It is always easier to level the playing field and create the
enabling environment than to get the supply response. This is where the
neglected issues of institutional capacity, software, corporate culture and,
in Zimbabwe's case, regionalism come into play. The necessary culture change
involves getting management to see exports as the main source of growth
rather than as the residual addition that they have been in the past.
As it is, scarcely a week goes by without a captain of industry, convinced
that industrialists deserve to be 'rewarded' for exporting, calling for new
export incentives.
That transformation, in turn, depends on the accumulation of new and
different core competencies, a focus on quality, acceptance of cross-border
integrated manufacturing, as distinct from stand-alone operations in
Zimbabwe and a radical change in official attitudes to the immigration of
skilled personnel and access to intellectual property.

Schneider, the French electrical equipment and engineering group, has sold
its Simel unit to AMP of the US for an undisclosed sum, AP-DJ reports from
Paris.
Schneider said the sale was part of its programme to shed non-strategic
assets and reduce debt.
Simel produces equipment for transmission and electrical distribution
networks, and operates in more than 60 countries. The company, which posted
1993 sales of FFr440m (Dollars 81.5m), employs 490 people. AMP, meanwhile,
posted 1993 sales of FFr3.5bn and has 29,000 employees.
Schneider said the sale of Simel not only strengthened the US company's
international and domestic positions, but also provided Simel with technical
support from AMP.

would 'substantially' reduce its losses this year and hoped to be back in
profit by the end of 1995.
However, turnover in 1994 is likely to slip below the DM18.6bn (Dollars
11.8bn) recorded last year because of growing competition.
The group said the company was still hoping for last-minute orders from the
German defence and research ministries, which have yet to exhaust their
budgets for the current year.
Speaking ahead of final profit figures, expected in April, Mr Manfred
Bischoff, the designated chief executive, warned that the company's results
continued to depend heavily on an unsteady dollar exchange rate.
The company lost DM694m in 1993, but Mr Bischoff refused to give any further
details about the extent to which these losses had been trimmed this year.
Dasa, Europe's largest aerospace company, earns its money in dollars, the
currency used to price aerospace products, but spends it in D-Marks, a
policy which makes it particularly susceptible to exchange rate movements.
The dollar is worth about DM1.57; if it continues towards DM1.70 Dasa will
report 'fantastic' results, it said.
The company is still pressing the government for more money to meet what it
says is stiff competition from US competitors.

A slowdown in inflation in November and high third quarter economic growth
boosts the Philippines' case for a relaxation of its monetary policy agreed
with the International Monetary Fund, economists said. The government's
National Statistics Office reported on Monday that the Philippine consumer
price index grew at an annual 7.5 per cent in November against 7.8 in
October and 8.6 in September. This follows last week's announcement that
third quarter gross national product grew by 5.9 per cent against 2.15 per
cent in the same period last year.

China's electric power production is expected to rise by 10 per cent from
1993 to exceed 910bn kilowatt hours this year. But this will not be enough
to prevent power shortages in the winter months, the Xinhua news agency
said. In the first three quarters of the year power output was 664.9bn
kilowatt hours, the Ministry of Power Production said. It forecast a sharp
rise In demand from businesses over the coming months because of rapid
economic growth and said power cuts were inevitable toward the end of the
year.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Vietnamese strike at Korean-owned plant: Higher wages demand
and alleged attack on worker prompt discord

More than 300 workers at a South Korean-owned textile mill in Vietnam struck
yesterday in a dispute over wages and an alleged attack by a South Korean
employee on a Vietnamese worker, AP reports from Hanoi.
The strike began on Saturday at the Pang Rim Vietnam Company in Viet Tri
City, about 40km north west of Hanoi, and highlights the tension between
managers and workers at some foreign ventures. The country has become a
favoured investment home for companies seeking a low-wage production site.
Pang Rim Vietnam is wholly owned by Pang Rim, South Korea's third-largest
textile maker. Mr IC Kim, head of the factory's import-export division, said
by telephone that the two sides had agreed to a wage increase and that the
strikers were expected to report for work tomorrow. He said the strike did
not entirely shut down operations, as 1,300 other workers remained on the
job.
The strike reflects growing assertiveness among Vietnamese workers,
especially since a labour law was passed last summer explicitly protecting
the right to strike. The official newspaper Lao Dong said last month that 32
strikes had occurred in the country from January through October.
The strike also reflects tensions between foreign bosses and Vietnamese
workers accustomed to very different work styles. Workers at another South
Korean company walked out last year after a similar allegation was made that
a South Korean supervisor had struck a Vietnamese worker.
Mr Pham Dinh Chien, president of the textile mill's trade union, said the
Pang Rim strike was triggered when a foreman beat a worker he thought had
left work early. Mr Kim denied that any beating took place. A Vietnamese
worker who answered the telephone at a factory office described the incident
as a fight between a worker and a South Korean technician who had demanded
to see the worker's pass.
Vietnamese government officials rushed to the plant on Monday to mediate in
the conflict. The two sides agreed the same day on a settlement including
wage increases of 5 to 10 per cent, but the strikers failed to show up for
work yesterday.

FT  07 DEC 94 / IMF criticises Russian budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Stanley Fischer, first deputy managing director of the International
Monetary Fund, yesterday criticised the assumptions of next year's Russian
budget and urged the government to adopt a tougher line if it wanted
international financial assistance. Mr Fischer said IMF calculations
suggested the deficit would be closer to 10 per cent than the 8 per cent
included in the draft. The revenue forecasts also looked over-optimistic, he
said, given that 1994's revenues were as low as half those forecast. He also
questioned whether the the bond market would be sufficiently strong to meet
the government's financing needs. An IMF mission is currently in talks with
the Russian government about providing its biggest ever stand-by facility of
up to Dollars 6bn, with a further Dollars 6bn available as part of a
currency stabilisation fund. Mr Fischer hinted at the IMF's negotiating
stance by suggesting that a budget deficit of between 6-7 per cent appeared
financeable at a low rate of inflation. He also said tax revenues as a
proportion of gross national product should be 3-4 percentage points higher
than the 11 per cent forecast. The IMF also expected the Russian government
to stick to its promise of lifting its oil export quotas.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Russia rejects Chechnya invasion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia and the the break-away republic of Chechnya have agreed to settle
their differences without force following last-ditch peace talks held
yesterday in the neighbouring region of Ingushetia.
The deal appears to be expedient for both sides to save face without
resorting to what promised to be a fierce and bloody conflict.
Both President Dzhokhar Dudayev of Chechnya, and General Pavel Grachev,
Russia's defence minister, emerged from more than an hour of talks to
declare: 'There will not be a military solution to the question.'
The terms of the agreement were not immediately known, although the
priorities of both sides had been well-aired beforehand. Before the meeting,
Gen Grachev said the Russian government had not exhausted all avenues for
peace but made it clear he would treat Mr Dudayev as a representative of one
the Russian Federation's constituent republics rather than as the head of a
foreign state.
Russian military sources suggested that Gen Grachev would insist on three
conditions being met: an early meeting between Mr Dudayev and the opposition
forces; the disarming of illegal military units in Chechnya; and the
immediate release of all Russian servicemen captured in the recent fighting.
Chechen officials had originally claimed to have captured 70 Russian
servicemen but it now appears that 21 Russians have been held captive.
According to the Interfax news agency, Mr Dudayev's intentions in the talks
were to ensure that Russia would stop supporting Chechen opposition attacks
and would withdraw its regular armed forces, which have been ominously
massing on the republic's border. Mr Grachev had earlier met Chechen
opposition leaders and promised them he would insist on free parliamentary
elections being held.
The Russian government appeared torn between wanting to re-establish its
authority in a rebellious part of the federation and fearing the
consequences of being drawn into a long guerrilla war. The Chechen
government had made dire threats against Russia if it sent in its troops,
promising 'a second Afghanistan'. The Russian parliament - and public
opinion - also appeared sharply divided.
While some leading politicians in Moscow urged stern measures to end the
rebellion, others such as Mr Yegor Gaidar, head of the Democratic Choice
party, warned that a military solution would lead 'to nothing but bloodshed
and the establishment of a military regime in the country'.
Chechnya, which declared its independence from Moscow three years ago, has
been a festering sore in Russia's body politic ever since.
The Russian government has provided financial support and moral
encouragement to the Chechen opposition, which created a provisional council
to oust Mr Dudayev.

FT  07 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: De La Rue suffers bid talk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banknote printer De La Rue fell sharply as the City began to receive
whispers that it was ready once again to pay possibly more than Pounds 600m
for Portals, the security and specialist paper maker. The speculation was
strong enough to force a joint announcement by the two companies to the
effect that although De La Rue was keen there was nothing under discussion.
Several analysts and traders suggested that the rumours have been emanating
from those at Portals keen to maintain its independence. In addition, the
close relationship between the two companies means it is unlikely that De La
Rue will launch a hostile bid.
The conclusion is that De La Rue will have to pay a premium price to achieve
a mutually agreeable offer. The worries over how deeply it will have to dig
saw its shares fall 38 to 963p. Meanwhile, speculation that it might pay
around 900p a share saw Portal shares leap 66 to 771p.
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo put on a strong performance as the market gave
its interpretation to a negative report about Astra, its Swedish rival.
US investment bank Merrill Lynch told clients that Astra had run into
problems with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over its anti-asthma
inhaler. The FDA has apparently suspended a review of the inhaler until
Astra produces more satisfactory data.
Any removal or deferral of competition is bound to be good news for Glaxo,
which is the world's leading supplier of asthma products and which generates
about 10 per cent of its total sales through US asthma treatments.
Glaxo shares bounced 3 to 619p with 7.8m traded. Mr James Culverwell of
Merrill Lynch said: 'We have made no comments on Glaxo, but the market has
drawn its own conclusions.'
Recently floated TeleWest Communications caused a flurry of telecoms
activity, with the shares falling back to their issue price of 182p at one
point during the day. The stock finished 2 down at 182 1/2p following 7.9m
turnover.
The stabilisation period for the issue has 15 days to run but Kleinwort
Benson, joint broker to the float, claimed not to be supporting yesterday.
The merchant bank also quashed speculation that TeleWest had been hit by
flow-back from the Wall Street tranche of the issue in the wake of a rough
patch for US telecoms shares.
Further reflection on the big reorganisation at its Mercury unit - which
supplies 16 per cent of group operating profits - left Cable and Wireless 10
off at 368p in 5.1m turnover.
Reports that the government was likely to lose the vote on the second stage
of the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel continued to cast a
shadow over the regional electricity companies' shares, causing a retreat in
several stocks in the sector. Seeboard gave up 9 to 412p and PowerGen
receded 4 to 538p, while Norweb tumbled 16 to 780p.
Those worries were combined with disappointment at the dividend increase
from Midlands Electricity, whose shares fell 15 to 765p. The group raised
the dividend payment by 22 per cent to 9.3 per cent, but that was below
market expectations of around a 24 to 25 per cent increase. A further slide
in the shares was prevented by a 14.4 per cent rise in headline profits to
Pounds 102.4m, well ahead of market expectations.
Such was the sentiment that not even the news that Yorkshire was to receive
Pounds 17m compensation from Stockholm City Council for a terminated
contract could lift the stock out of the gloom. The shares weakened 13 to
715p.
SmithKline Beecham closed a penny firmer at 429p after US house Smith Barney
upgraded the stock, along with Merck and Eli Lilly.
Fisons retreated 3 to 114p on talk of a James Capel downgrade. The house
declined to comment.
Yorkshire Chemicals held its ground at 346p as Hoare Govett recommended it
in its weekly sector review. Allied Colloids dropped 13 to 117p on
disappointment over the group's interim figures.
A number of diversified industrial groups had an active day, notably BTR,
which rose 7 1/2 to 284 1/2 p in surging trading volume as bargain hunters
reversed the recent downtrend. The shares have underperformed the market by
7 per cent over the past month and 24 per cent since September.
Charter unveiled strong interim results, lifting the shares 25 to 780p and
prompting leading analysts to upgrade full-year profits forecasts. Nomura
Securities went up by Pounds 10m to Pounds 71.5m.
The black spot in the sector was Powell Duffryn, which tumbled 25 to 517p
following an unexpected Pounds 71m rights issue.
Slower than expected profits growth and an absence of top management news
sent freight specialist NFC tumbling. The shares closed 15 lower at 147p
after 7.8m traded. UBS trimmed its full-year profits estimate by Pounds 10m
to Pounds 115m, although the securities house saw some comfort in the solid
dividend and the promise of a statement before Christmas on NFC's chief
executive vacancy.
Engineering group Siebe eased 5 to 548p as interim profits failed to exceed
expectations. Hoare Govett shaded its estimate for the full year payout to
just above 12p.
Hazlewood shed 6 to 104p after disappointing interim figures. Profits fell
Pounds 12.6m to Pounds 10.7m - below the market's worst fears. Analysts were
also disappointed by the lack of further news on current trading.
The improvement in interim profits at Taunton Cider was below market
forecasts and the shares responded by sliding 11 to 143p.
Retailing stocks remained in the doldrums as nervousness about Christmas
trading continued. Great Universal Stores dipped 5 to 530p, while Kingfisher
surrendered 7 at 441p. Marks and Spencer eased 3 to 389p as Panmure Gordon
reiterated its sell recommendation.
Dixons was one of the few bright features. The shares improved 6 1/2 to 187
1/2 p on a view that an Office of Fair Trading report into warranties, due
shortly, will be more lenient than originally thought.
J. Sainsbury, traditionally a defensive stock, rose 4 to 402p.
Merchant bank Kleinwort Benson firmed a penny to 486p, with Credit Lyonnais
Laing recommending the shares.
Rival SG Warburg slipped 6 to 671p, although talk of a takeover bid by one
of the US financial heavyweights returned late in the day.
Exploration and production company British Borneo moved ahead 5 to 213p
after announcing a 'potentially commercial oil discovery'.

FT  07 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures had a roller-coaster session, sliding steeply during the
morning but clawing back steadily towards the end of the day's trading,
writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was at 3,022 at the close of pit trading,
down 19 points. The premium to the cash market was eight points, or more
than six points over fair value.
Sentiment was weak at the close but it had been far blacker during the
morning session when heavy selling pushed the December contract down to a
low for the day of 2,988 in good volume, with some 9,000 contracts dealt by
mid-morning.
There was an eerie lull around midsession but by 2.30pm, when Wall Street
came into the picture, buyers were beginning to emerge.
Traders said the final hour of trading produced a significant squeeze,
hoisting the December contract back above 3,000. In late screen-based
trading the December contract moved up to 3,027. At the official close,
volume totalled 15,800 lots - against 12,683 on Monday - but 2,500 of this
was spread trading into the March contract.
Traded option activity showed a clear bounce, rising to 43,188 lots from
30,168 on Monday. Puts outnumbered calls by more than two-to-one. FT-SE and
Euro FT-SE lots totalled 30,500.

FT  07 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bid stories help offset early slide
in equities - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Talk of an imminent takeover bid, involving one of the FT-SE 350 stocks,
helped the rehabilitation process of a UK equity market which plunged back
through the 3,000 mark on the FT-SE 100 Index shortly after the outset of
trading yesterday.
There were no really 'hot' stories circulating, but dealers insisted some
sort of takeover or strategic stakebuilding move was afoot. One suggestion
was that JP Morgan, the US investment bank was at last about to instigate a
much-rumoured plan to merge its market activities with those of SG Warburg,
the leading UK investment bank. Stories of such a move have been circulating
in London for many months.
Earlier, markets across Europe, but especially London, had come under heavy
downside pressure following news that one of the world's biggest mutual
funds, Fidelity's Magellen is not paying a year-end dividend, having
sustained heavy losses in derivative market during the year.
This news, coming so soon after Wall Street's recent downside break and
persistent talk that US interest rates are set to move up again, only weeks
after the 75 basis points rise, caused serious worries in the London market.
It also spent much of the session fretting about the possibility of the
Conservative government sustaining an extremely damaging defeat in the House
of Commons over the second stage of the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel.
Adding to the UK market's discomfort were comments by Mr Eddie George,
Governor of the Bank of England, that the UK economy was growing at an
unsustainable rate, a view interpreted by the markets that an increase in UK
interest rates could occur much sooner than the markets had previously
expected. A rise in January has been widely predicted.
At the close of a frantic trading session the FT-SE 100 index was 17.4 lower
at 3,016.1. The FT-SE Mid Cap 250, which, unlike the 100-index failed to
move up on Monday, plunged 28.1 to 3,430.2.
Despite the high anxiety encompassing the markets, there was precious little
real customer activity in London. Turnover in equities was a pitiful 432.3m
shares, the lowest for many weeks, with non FT-SE stocks accounting for over
60 per cent of that total. Customer business on Monday just topped Pounds
1bn level to reach Pounds 1.19bn.
The Footsie began the session weakly with dealers citing the Fidelity news.
Within two hours of the opening the 100 index was down over 40 points and in
disarray with marketmakers predicting a bloodbath on Wall Street.
Sentiment began to improve thereafter, and the 100 index picked up strongly
as Wall Street confounded the market, opening is resilient form, considering
the Fidelity news, and slipping 20 Dow Jones points before embarking on a
strong rally which took the index into positive territory shortly after
London closed. Two hours after the UK market finished the Dow was three
points easier.
With events in the US calmer than expected it was domestic events which
dominated in London as the session drew to a close. Talk in the market was
that the VAT vote was going against the government, with only five hours
before the division bell. A leading marketmaker said a defeat over the VAT
Bill, with all the implications for raising further taxes, would be a severe
setback for the government. And there was a story that the chancellor had
already prepared a contingency plan in the event of a defeat of the VAT
bill.
Around a quarter of the constituents of the 100 index ended on positive
ground, with BTR leading the pack in a reaction to the recent big slide in
the stock. Glaxo was given a strong boost by negative stories concerning
Astra, one of the group's big rivals.

FT  07 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow little changed after
volatile day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices closed nearly flat after a volatile day that saw stocks
buffeted by negative news and first cheered, then depressed, by climbing
bond prices, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.03 at 3,745.95.
Secondary indices fell modestly. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.21 to
453.11, the American SE composite was off 1.24 at 431.01 and the Nasdaq
composite dipped 4.48 to 741.23. NYSE volume amounted to 300m shares.
The Dow dropped by nearly 20 points in early trading before heading into
positive territory near midday. Analysts speculated that the drop might have
been due to the announcement late on Monday by Fidelity Investments - the
largest mutual fund company in the US - that its Magellan Fund would not
make a previously announced year-end distribution.
Analysts worried that individual investors, who had flocked to mutual funds
in recent years, might shift their investments to fixed income instruments,
where yields were becoming increasingly attractive.
Rising bond prices, however, initially pulled the stock market up, before
exerting some pull on assets, thereby pushing shares to the session's lows
late in the afternoon. The Dow fell more than 25 points before program
trading kicked in and brought the average up just above Monday's close at
the end of the day.
The late-morning resignation of Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen went all
but unnoticed by the market because the move had been widely anticipated by
investors.
Among individual shares, BankAmerica lost Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 40 3/8
after an analyst at Paine-Webber downgraded the shares to 'neutral' from
'buy' on the basis of slower than expected loan growth. Mr Lawrence Cohn
also cut his 1994 earnings estimate by 15 cents to Dollars 5.35 per share.
Other banking stocks were mixed. Chase Manhattan Bank edged up Dollars 1/8
to Dollars 35 5/8 and Citicorp firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 41 5/8 , while
Bank of New York was Dollars  1/8 softer at Dollars 27 3/4 and First Chicago
slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 46 3/8 .
Borden shed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 13 3/8 after the group rejected
overtures from Mr Paul Kazarian, a would-be suitor for the beleaguered
company.
High-technology shares were mixed. IBM gained Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 71 5/8
, Compaq Computer rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 41 5/8 , Apple Computer put
on Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 37 1/2 and Dell Computer hardened Dollars  1/8 to
Dollars 42 3/4 . Hewlett-Packard lost Dollars 1/4 at Dollars 97 1/2 ,
Digital Equipment fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 32 3/4 and Unisys eased
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 9 1/8 .
Canada
Fears of rising interest rates drove Toronto stocks down but the market
ended well above the day's worst after moderate trading. Year-end tax-loss
selling was also contributing to weakness in the market.
The TSE 300 composite index, down nearly 40 points at one stage, finished
17.12 off at 4,079.44. Declines outpaced rises by 488 to 284 after volume of
59m shares.
Eleven of the 14 sub-indices were down, led by conglomerate, oil, industrial
products and financial stocks. Gold, transportation and real estate shares
posted gains.

FT  07 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil recedes 1.2%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Sao Paulo market receded 1.2 per cent in see-saw trade on continued
speculation ahead of the futures index and options markets settlements on
December 14 and 19. The Bovespa index ended 584 down at 45,730. Turnover
totalled RDollars 292.4m.
Analysts said stocks would remain fickle while players gear up for the
settlements. The market, they added, was also digesting a central bank
decision on Monday to create new reserve requirement rules for some credit
operations.
Reports that the central bank had intervened in the money market,
repurchasing securities in a forward operation at 5.20 per cent for December
9, down from the current rate of 5.45 per cent, failed to excite much
interest.
The move was interpreted as a signal that the government would lower nominal
interest rates on expectations of falling inflation data for December.
Venezuela
Caracas finished little changed in light dealings, the Merinvest composite
index slipping 0.96 to 120.53. Electricidad de Caracas closed 4 bolivars
down at 215 bolivars.

FT  07 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: FT-Actuaries World Indices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT-Actuaries World Index Policy Committee has reviewed the issues raised
by the prospective delisting from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange of Dairy Farm
International Holdings, Hongkong Land Holdings, Mandarin Oriental
International, Jardine Matheson Holdings and Jardine Strategic Holdings. The
committee decided that under Section II (a) of the FT-AWI Construction and
Maintenance Rules, the five should remain in the Hong Kong Index of FT-AWI.
Section II (a) states: 'In most instances stocks are included in that
country where the company is legally registered and recognised for taxation
purposes including regulation of its financial affairs. Exceptions are made
where the international market's recognition, the company's area of business
or its market listings clearly suggest a different allocation.'

FT  07 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average firmer as
Seoul continues to improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PATTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Nikkei 225 average saw an early loss erased and then added narrowly to
Monday's gain shortly before the close. Activity was limited, as most
investors remained absent, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo.
The 225 average, after trading down for most of the day, edged up slightly
at the finish to gain 34.81 at 19,340.47.
Profit-taking, anticipated because of Monday's substantial move, never
materialised. In early trading, block sales through Nikko Securities
collided with index-linked buying, causing the market to slide to the day's
low of 19,242.85 in the first 40 minutes of the morning. Within an hour the
market rallied to a high of 19,342.85 but failed to follow through.
The Topix index of all first section stocks inched up 3.63 to 1,535.49 and
the capital weighted Nikkei 300 crept forward 0.83 to 283.35.
First section volume, up from Monday's 206m shares, was an estimated 234m.
Gainers maintained a slight lead over losers by 512 to 465, with 206 issues
unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index slipped 5.69 to 1,269.91.
Most consumer electronics companies extended Monday's gains. JVC rose Y70 to
Y1,430, Pioneer Y40 to Y2,830 and Matsushita Electric Industrial Y10 to
Y5,810, but Sony dipped Y10 to Y5,510.
Sega Enterprises climbed for the eighth consecutive session, closing at
Y5,570, up Y60. Nintendo also added to Monday's gain, firming Y10 to Y5,810.
In Osaka the OSE average advanced 45.28 to 21,320.58 in volume of 38.2m
shares.
Roundup
The Pacific Rim markets turned in a set of mixed per-formances.
Asia Equity, however, offered evidence that the region's equity markets
could put in a good year-end showing. According to precedent, claimed the
broker, December and January had consistently produced the best monthly
performances in a given year.
One of the drags on the region this year, the number of rights issues and
IPOs issued in Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, was now expected to
tail off, said Asia Equity, with far fewer cash calls likely, probably until
the end of the first quarter of 1995.
SEOUL extended its uptrend to a third straight session, on renewed demand
for blue chips after their recent falls, and the composite index moved 9.98
higher to 1,075.01 in spite of Won15bn worth of sell orders by the stock
market stabilisation fund.
Samsung Electronics went the day's limit up, appreciating Won3,000 to
Won118,500, while Kepco moved ahead Won800 to Won29,800.
HONG KONG finished modestly firmer in thin trade, with sharp early losses
reversed on the strength of rebounding index futures.
The Hang Seng index put on 30.12 at 8,332.65, having fallen by 132 points at
one stage. Turnover dipped to HKDollars 2.6bn from Monday's HKDollars
2.75bn.
TAIPEI was unable to sustain Monday's gain as investors decided to take
profits. The weighted index was down 40.75 at 6,709.47 but after a 6,674.50
low. Turnover was heavy at TDollars 87.7bn.
Profit-taking was mainly in financials, which had risen for the three
previous sessions - Farmers Bank lost TDollars 3.50 at TDollars 58 and Chang
Hwa Bank TDollars 6 at TDollars 194.
MANILA strengthened as blue chips were actively sought, and the composite
index posted a rise of 32.92 at 2,655.63.
Brokers commented that buying was stimulated by the release of good economic
indicators in recent days. The commercial-industrial sector index saw the
session's biggest gain with a rise of 48.3 to 3,919.3.
KUALA LUMPUR was lower for the fourth trading day in a row amid foreign
selling, particularly from Hong Kong, of Tenaga Nasional and Telekom
Malaysia. The composite index ended 10.20 or 1.1 per cent down at 953.68.
Telekom declined 40 cents to MDollars 17.20, still affected by rumours of a
share placement, and Tenaga finished 30 cents cheaper at MDollars 10.20.
SINGAPORE made little progress, with early gains pared on lack of trading
interest, and the Straits Times Industrial index closed 1.50 up at 2,187.07,
after reaching an intraday high of 2,196.31.
SYDNEY retreated as worries resurfaced regarding the direction of commodity
prices and interest rates. The All Ordinaries index shed 6.3 to 1,891.2 in
volume estimated at 206.5m shares.
KARACHI eased slightly amid thin volume on the first day of the new account.
The KSE 100 index lost 12.81 at 2,127.44. Declining issues led advances by
200 to 109.
BOMBAY was 1 per cent lower after selling by domestic and foreign mutual
funds, anxious to book profits, which took the BSE-30 index 43.86 down to
4,040.37.
Brokers noted that prices had fallen throughout the session, a day after the
government announced the minimum bidding price of 42m shares in six
state-owned companies.
COLOMBO fell for the second day running, the All Share index slipping 14.05
to 1,056.93 on retail selling, with local and foreign institutions on the
sidelines due to political and economic uncertainties.
JAKARTA was marked down at the close, the official index dropping 4.19 to
466.39, amid worries over forthcoming new issues after the sharp fall of
Indal Aluminium on its debut on Monday.

FT  07 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa steady after rally
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Softer London equities and continued gold price weakness eroded early steady
sentiment to leave Johannesburg little changed, and with minimal clarity on
short term direction. A weaker financial rand, however, provided some
support for shares.
The overall index finished 3.2 ahead at 5,722.5, off an early high of
5,741.6. Industrials ended 4.0 better at 6,916.5 and golds gained a slight
0.7 at 1,881.8.
De Beers picked up 50 cents to R90.50 following news that a price fixing
case against General Electric, in which De Beers was implicated, had been
dropped in the US. Anglos lost R1.50 at R226.50.

FT  07 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Transatlantic influences trip
bourses into decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Transatlantic news was not good for Continental equities yesterday, writes
Our Markets Staff. Fidelity Investments' nil payout for its Magellan Fund
hit shares around the world; and European bond markets, in consolidation,
heard the Salomon Brothers chief economist predict that the Fed will boost
short-term interest rates by 100 to 150 basis points by the middle of next
year.
Turning to Europe, Salomon saw growth there exceeding expectations,
prompting Germany's Bundesbank to tighten in the first half of 1995.
FRANKFURT started comfortably, but Fidelity rumours, poorer than expected
results from Dresdner Bank and options-oriented selling in Siemens combined
to leave the Dax index down 24.99 to 2,046.33; there was little recovery
after hours.
Turnover rose from DM5bn to DM5.3bn. Dresdner's problems in derivatives,
reflected in its own-account trading losses against a profit last year, left
the shares down DM7.50 to DM408.50 in the Ibis and soured Commerzbank, down
DM7.60 to DM320, and Deutsche Bank, DM12.10 off at DM735.90 ahead of its own
10-month figures today.
Siemens recovered from a session close of DM598.50, down DM12.50, to DM601,
off DM8, after hours, stilling fears of a further drop after breaking down
through the DM600 technical support level. The other main losses were in
automotive stocks and engineers: Conti lost DM5.50 at DM213 after some
selling recommendations, and MAM DM14 at DM398; Deutsche Babcock, after a
disappointing look at 1995 last week, retreated DM5.50 to DM201.50, Linde
DM20 to DM888 and Mannesmann DM8.40 to DM402.80.
MILAN fell 2.3 per cent as the market became embroiled in the fraught run-up
to the resignation of Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the graft busting magistrate who
became a national hero for his sustained assault on corruption in high
places.
The Comit index shed 14.44 to 615.36 amid worries of further political
uncertainty if Mr Di Pietro blamed pressure from Rome for his departure.
In the event, shares picked up from their lows after his resignation letter
was viewed as even-handed, criticising political pressure from all sides.
Some analysts also drew comfort from news that Mr Di Pietro had requested a
prison sentence in a corruption case for Mr Umberto Bossi, the leader of the
Northern League and a coalition partner: they suggested that the development
might persuade Mr Bossi to temper future criticism of Mr Silvio Berlusconi,
the prime minister.
Against the lower trend, Montedison was unchanged at L1,138 after the
European Court rejected an appeal by Union Carbide against the proposed
joint venture with Shell.
PARIS worsened in the morning as the Fidelity news upset sentiment, but
recovered its composure later. The CAC-40 index finished with a loss of 4.70
at 1,968.95, off a session low of 1,952 and just off a high of 1,970.
Smith Barney, of the US, initiated coverage of the two major oil stocks, Elf
Aquitaine, off FFr1.00 at FFr386.40, and Total, down FFr3.90 to FFr328.
The broker said that it was recommending a neutral position in the former,
but put out a buy note on Total, based on its depth of management expertise,
strong balance sheet and exposure to growth markets in the Far East.
ZURICH picked up from the day's lows, which were a response to concerns
about higher money market rates, after a better than expected early
performance from Wall Street in the aftermath of the Magellan Fund news.
The SMI index finished 21.9 down at 2,589.1, after a low of 2,581.7 although
trading volumes remained thin.
Financials were mixed, with CS Holding losing SFr10 to SFr541 and UBS
bearers SFr16 lower at SFr1,134, amid suggestions that investors were
switching to the insurance sector. Swiss Re led the insurers higher, picking
up SFr14 to SFr787 as some dealers said that the company was buying back its
own shares.
AMSTERDAM followed the downward trend and the Aex index gave up 2.17 to
411.18.
Kleinwort Benson yesterday upgraded the Netherlands from neutral to
overweight, based on an expected revival of consumer confidence in 1995 and
given the market's strong exposure to international consumer stocks. In
contrast the broker reduced its exposure to the Dutch chemicals sector based
on general worries regarding long-term valuations and concern that 'the
present boom in basic chemicals could be reversed in the first half of next
year'.
Ahold gave up 20 cents to Fl 61.20 following an impressive rise on Monday
after third quarter figures, and, among the internationals, Royal Dutch
slipped Fl 1.90 to Fl 186.90.
STOCKHOLM fell sharply, declines in Ericsson and Astra leading as the
Affarsvarlden general index lost 17.90 or 1.2 per cent to 1,483.10 in
turnover of SKr2.6bn.
The two heavyweight stocks were affected by separate downgrades. Ericsson,
down SKr12.50 to SKr409 in the B shares, attracted a number of sell notes.
Astra, off SKr5 to SKr193, was affected by a note from Merrill Lynch. Ms
Janet Dyson, Merrill's pharmaceuticals analyst, changed her opinion from
'buy' to 'take profits in the short term' on news that the US FDA was to
suspend a review of the company's Asthma drug, Pulmicort Turbuhaler, pending
further information. This suspension was likely to lead to a delay in the
drug's approval of at least three months, with the consequent knock on
effect on earnings by 1996, she added.
COPENHAGEN was depressed additionally by reports of financial problems at
the Danish shipping and shipbuilding group, B &amp; W, and the failure of a
rescue plan. B &amp; W B shares dropped DKr10 to DKr45, down from a year's high
of DKr533 in February, as the KFX index declined 1.16 to 93.34.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Political uncertainties overshadow markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the absence of significant new economic data, political concerns
dominated the currency markets yesterday, writes Gillian Tett.
Uncertainty over the UK parliamentary vote on VAT and the timing of the next
interest rate rise shaped market sentiment towards sterling. News that
Antonio Di Pietro, the Italian government magistrate, might resign
undermined the lira. Political uncertainties also weakened the punt, after
new Irish elections appeared more likely. Meanwhile, the resignation of Mr
Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, helped to firm the dollar
fractionally.
Trading in sterling was relatively quiet ahead of the crucial vote last
night on the passage of the bill introducing the VAT increase on fuel.
During the day the pound firmed moderately, ending at Dollars 1.5631, up
from the previous close of Dollars 1.5591. Against the D-Mark it improved to
DM2.4579 from Monday's DM2.4542 finish.
Analysts said the British currency appeared to be caught between two
conflicting pressures. On the one hand, the political uncertainty that had
accompanied the UK vote was weakening investors' confidence in the currency.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, said: 'What international
investors have seen for the second week in a row is a picture of a
government surviving by one or two votes. It does not smack of strong
government - it looks quite Italian, in fact.'
But on the other hand, sterling has been supported by growing market
expectations that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, and Mr Eddie George,
Governor of the Bank of England, will raise interest rates when they meet
today. Indeed, widespread fears that interest rates would be lifted faster
if the vote on VAT were lost fuelled expectations yest-erday of an imminent
interest rate increase.
If the UK monetary authorities do not, in fact, raise interest rates this
week, this could significantly weaken sterling in the days ahead, analysts
warned.
Mr Rob Hayward, economic adviser at Bank of America, said: 'Speculation has
been growing in the last 24 hours of a rate rise. If there is not a rise
this week, we will probably see a negative reaction from the markets.'
These growing expectations of a rate increase triggered a significant fall
in sterling futures for the second day in a row. The March contract dropped
some 18 basis points to close around 92.50. At this level traders are
assuming that interest rates will be 7.5 per cent by next spring.
Political uncertainty yesterday weakened the lira and led to a slide in
Italian futures after Mr Di Pietro, the symbol of Italy's anti-corruption
drive, submitted his resignation. The lira finished at L1,033 against the
D-Mark, compared with L1,028 the previous day.
Meanwhile, the Irish markets were overshadowed by speculation that new
elections were imminent after talks on an alliance between the Labour and
Fianna Fail parties collapsed. The Irish punt ended at DM2.405, against
DM2.415 at Monday's close.
The news that Mr Lloyd Bentsen was resigning as US Treasury secretary, and
being replaced by Mr Robert Rubin, was received relatively well on the
markets. Although the dollar had weakened during early European trading, it
rallied slightly after the news of the appointment. It finally closed at
Y100.3, compared with Y100.4 the previous day. Against the D-Mark it
finished at DM1.573, compared with Monday's DM1.574 close.
The dollar ended the New York trading session at Y100.1 and DM1.5723.
Traders pointed out that Mr Bentsen's departure was seen as being favourable
for the dollar, because of his tendency to talk down the dollar against the
yen in previous months.
In the longer term Mr MacKinnon now believes that the fundamentals bode well
for the US currency, and is predict-ing that the dollar could strengthen
significantly in the coming months.
Mr Steve Hannah, international economist at IBJ, remains doubtful. 'The
markets are speculating that the Fed will tighten in December or January,
and if it does not there is a risk that the Fed will lose credibility,' he
said.
The Bank of England yesterday forecast a shortage of Pounds 900m in the UK
money markets, and removed almost all of this at established rates.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Inco cautious on 'abnormal'
nickel market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The unusual factors that have recently thrown the nickel market into turmoil
are reason to be cautious on the outlook for nickel prices, according to
Inco, the western world's biggest producer.
In a presentation to analysts at the company's head office in Toronto, Inco
executives pointed mainly to a surge in stainless-steel production and the
uncertainty of Russian supplies. 'It's an abnormal situation,' said Mr
Michael Sopko, chief executive.
The LME cash nickel price has more than doubled in the past year to around
USDollars 4 a pound. The latest spurt mainly reflects uncertainty about
supplies from Norilsk of Russia, the world's biggest producer. The three
months delivery position at the London Metal Exchange surged by Dollars
1,200 last week and leapt another Dollars 637.50 to a 4 1/4 -year high of
Dollars 9,600 a tonne at one stage on Monday. A reaction then set in,
however, and by yesterday's close the price was back to Dollars 8,775 a
tonne.
Inco forecast that Russian production would decline to 152,000 tonnes this
year from 182,000 in 1993, with a further significant drop possible in 1995.
Mr Ivor Kirman, marketing director for Inco Europe, emphasised that accurate
information on Norilsk was hard to come by. He said however, that a
'significant' portion of Russian exports over the past two years appeared to
have come from stockpiles.
Inco forecast that world stainless steel production, which accounts for 63
per cent of nickel consumption, will climb to 13.4m tonnes in 1995, from
12.6m this year. The recovery has been especially strong in Japan, where
stainless-steel output has been running at record levels in recent months.
The Canadian group, which supplies about a third of the western world's
nickel, plans to lift its own output to 430m lb in 1995 from an estimated
345m this year. Production has been dented this year by market-related
shutdowns, as well as a series of mishaps at Inco's mines in Ontario and
Manitoba.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Windwards wary of US banana
producer's offer of assistance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES

<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON, JAMAICA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chiquita Brands International, a US producer of Latin American fruit, has
offered to help exporters in the Windward Islands with the shipping and
marketing of their bananas. The move is seen as an effort to reduce rising
tensions over access to the European banana market.
In a statement issued in Barbados, Chiquita said that with the Windward
islands planning to go beyond production of the fruit and to market
increasing quantities: 'Chiquita hopes it will have the opportunity to
re-establish a relationship, this time directly with the Windward Islands
banana industry, to provide the highest possible returns to growers.'
The offer of assistance follows an investigation launched by the US trade
representative into the European Union's banana import regime, which favours
traditional producers in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group,
with which the EU has a trade treaty. Latin American producers, backed by
the US, say the regime discriminates against other producers, mainly those
in Latin America.
The investigation was prompted by attacks on the EU regime by Chiquita and
the Hawaiian Banana Industry Association. The charges have been dismissed by
the Caribbean producers.
Chiquita's statement offering to help the Windwards, signed by Mr Nelson
Lees, vice president of the company, said it could increase the efficiency
with which the islands' bananas were produced, shipped, marketed and sold in
Europe. The company said it also wanted to provide technical assistance to
the Windwards industry.
Between 1986 and 1991 Chiquita had shipped Windward Islands bananas to Italy
through an arrangement with Geest Industries, which markets the island
group's bananas, the statement said.
Initial reaction from the Windward Islands has been sceptical. 'The
consistency and vehemence of the Latin American attacks on the Windward
Islands banana industry, and the recent attempt by this very company to get
the US trade representative to destroy the industry and the islands'
economies, does not provide a basis for taking this offer seriously,' said
one official in St Lucia.
Chiquita claims that Caribbean and other ACP producers has misunderstood its
complaint to the US government, which resulted in the investigation launched
by the US trade representative.
'That filing is not intended to destroy the banana industry of the Windward
Islands or any of the EU or ACP producing countries,' the statement said.
'In fact, Chiquita has invested millions of dollars in capital and
technology in ACP and EU countries, and would like to more fully participate
in these markets.'

FT  07 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lure of gold outweighs
political risks of Tajikistan - A look at a joint venture using foreign
capital in the central Asian republic that is expected to be producing to
ten tonnes a year by 1998
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tajikistan's first gold joint venture using foreign capital hopes to be
producing ten tonnes (321.540 troy ounces) a year by 1998, against the
country's previous peak gold output of 2.5 tonnes.
Like many other mining projects in the former Soviet Union, this venture
involves a small western company - British &amp; Commonwealth Minerals. It has
49 per cent and operating control of the joint venture that has won the
rights to an area in the Central Asian nation's Zeravshan Valley containing
two mines, both fully-developed, a treatment plant and proven and probable
gold reserves estimated at 16m ounces (497 tonnes).
The Tajikistan government, which owns the rest of the joint venture, is
contributing the exploration rights and about Dollars 500m worth of
infrastructure and mining equipment, much of it new, remaining after the
former Soviet Union collapsed three years ago.
European and Canadian investors last month provided USDollars 40m towards
the venture. This was raised by London broker T. Hoare for Nelson Trade &amp;
Finance, a Toronto-quoted company that once financed the controversial
Hollywood movie, 9 1/2 Weeks. This financing scheme resulted in Nelson,
which previously owned 25 per cent of CBM, taking full control. Mr Richard
Northcott, chairman of Nelson, said that after costs and payments to the
estate of Mr Cameron Glover, who set up CBM and died recently in an air
accident in Argentina, about Dollars 30m was available for the Tajik
venture.
Mr Northcott said that, when more equity funding was needed, Nelson would
consider applying for a London stock exchange quotation.
In the meantime, both the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank
offshoot, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development had been
approached to provide debt capital.
The joint venture seems likely to be followed by a spate of other mineral
deals involving western companies in Central Asia, whose five republics are
estimated to contain well over half the former Soviet Union's minerals
wealth. Tajikistan itself not only offers gold but has large deposits of
silver, antimony and boron.
Mineral specialists ask a number of questions about working in Central Asia,
issues faced by a multitude of western energy groups that have established
local offices.
The main issue will probably be political risk - will cash-poor nations like
Tajikistan ultimately allow their mineral wealth to be exported, and, if
they don't, will they have the money to develop it themselves?
A second question is whether Russia, which has been blocking the region from
exporting its natural gas and oil, will allow Central Asia to develop its
natural wealth independently.
Western officials in Tajikistan's capital, Dushanbe, tend to give the Tajik
government the benefit of the doubt, but stress that it is too early to be
sure. 'You can cut a deal with this government. Whether they honour it is
another question,' said one western analyst. 'They haven't really been put
to the test yet.'
Russia's reaction to all the new activity hasn't been gauged. Yet the deals
are piling up, both in Tajikistan and the rest of the region.
Only this week, the UK company Gold &amp; Minerals Excavation signed a gold
exploration deal for Tajikistan's southern Darwaz region. Canada's Gulf
Minerals is looking into a tailings project in the same area, according to
Mr Giorgi Kashlakov, a senior economic adviser to the prime minister.
Lonrho, the international mining and trading group, meanwhile, after losing
out on the Zeravshan mining project, is considering a large antimony-gold
deposit in central Tajikistan near Iskanderkul Lake, Mr Kashlakov said.
Outside Tajikistan, CBM itself is negotiating to develop gold deposits in
the neighbouring Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan. These are in addition to
previous gold deals announced by Canada's Cameco in the Kyrgyz Republic,
Newmont of the US in Uzbekistan, and a venture involving London Stock
Exchange-listed Bakyrchik Gold in Kazakhstan.
CBM's success in Tajikistan so far appears attributable to long-cultivated
contacts in Tajikistan's extremely complex political sphere. CBM has had an
advantage because Mr Richard Wilkins, commercial director of the joint
venture company, Zeravshan Gold, has been developing close relationships
with both sides in Tajikistan's civil war since 1991.
Mr Wilkins is confident that the political risk for CBM is low, and that the
company will be able either to ship its gold to market, or sell it to the
Tajikistan government for dollars at world prices.
'My job is to keep up contacts with the government,' Mr Wilkins says. 'Even
if they overturned the whole leadership and brought in the opposition, it
wouldn't worry me.'
CBM expects the joint venture to produce its first gold from the Jilau open
pit mine where mining and processing is taking place only ten days a month
because of lack of funds. By targetting some high grade ore, Jilau could be
producing at an annual rate of 80,000 to 100,000 ounces by the end of 1995,
suggests Mr Roger Turner, chairman of the joint venture company.
More work would be needed at the Taror underground mining complex before
production could begin in earnest in 1998, particularly on how the ore,
which contains substantial quantities of arsenic, should be treated.
Mr Turner pointed out that environmental clean-up was not a problem as the
mines and plant were new. However, the joint venture would have to ensure
that the mining town of 2,000 people - with its infrastructure of roads,
power plant, water and sewage plants as well as a school and hospital - was
kept supplied. At present there were shortages of some essentials, such as
fuel for central heating.
Meanwhile, Tajik Geology has been contracted by CBM to do Dollars 2m of
exploration work a year in the Zeravshan Valley.

FT  07 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Nervousness remains at LME -
Market Report
</HEADLINE>

   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Base metal trading was quieter at the London Metal Exchange yesterday
afternoon but traders were still nervous of the possibility of further sharp
downward corrections.
The recent big mover, NICKEL, had its wings clipped by Norilsk, the big
Russian producer, saying power problems were not as bad as western traders
claimed.
Meanwhile ALUMINIUM traders were disturbed by the possibility of Monday's
news that Coca Cola was switching to steel can sheet in some areas might
herald similar substitution moves by other consumers.
COPPER's fundamental tightness made it more resistant to the downward
pressure.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Survey of Zimbabwe (12): Balance is back in the black - A
look at the recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Drought and trade liberalisation pushed Zimbabwe's balance of payments deep
into the red in 1991-92, since when there has been a strong recovery. In
part, this reflects sluggish growth and depressed imports, but this year
exports should recoup most of their 1992 losses caused by drought and
depressed commodity prices.
Strong primary export growth in 1994-95 could push the current account into
surplus if import demand remains weak, exacerbating the upward pressure on
the exchange rate arising from aid and capital inflows, mainly portfolio and
hot money rather than foreign direct investment (FDI).
Foreigners disinvested during the 1980s, and although there has been a small
net inflow (Dollars 35m) since 1990, the country's stock of foreign
investment has tumbled from Dollars 7bn in 1980 to Dollars 2.6bn in 1992.
Zimbabwe is sub-Saharan Africa's third largest host country for FDI after
South Africa and Nigeria. The Zimbabwe dollar, devalued by 17 per cent at
the end of 1993 as part of an exchange control liberalisation package,
regained 5.5 per cent of its value in the first half of the year, but has
since resumed its slide, taking its depreciation to 19 per cent so far this
year, including the 17 per cent official devaluation.
Given a 12 to 15 per cent inflation differential with Zimbabwe's main
trading partners since January, the real exchange rate has been
appreciating, thereby compounding manufacturing industry's export woes.
Commodity exporters, however, seem happy with the rate for the time being,
although a further downward adjustment is expected in 1995, with the rate
falling from ZDollars 8.4 to the US dollar to around ZDollars 10 in a year's
time.
In 1991 tobacco, gold and ferrochrome accounted for just over half of
exports. Tobacco has since lost ground but is recovering, as also is
ferrochrome and nickel. Gold earnings will increase substantially this year
and next and new mineral exports will come on stream with diamonds and
platinum making Zimbabwe an increasingly minerals-dependent exporter in the
second half of the decade, while there are high hopes that horticulture will
recoup some of the ground lost by tobacco.
Since the launch of ESAP, Zimbabwe's foreign debt has increased 44 per cent
to Dollars 3.8bn at the end of 1993 (from 39 per cent to 69 per cent of
GDP). Last year, debt service payments absorbed 30 per cent of exports, but
this ratio will fall as exports recover, though it will remain uncomfortably
high for the next few years.

'Africa's paradise', says Zimbabwe's marketing slogan.
Allowing for the hyperbole of the tourist business, most visitors tend to
agree that there is indeed something special about a country which offers
everything from some of Africa's best game parks to trout fishing in the
eastern highlands, and makes up for the absence of a coastline by an inland
sea called Lake Kariba.
And as word has got round, the number of visitors has soared. At current
rates of growth, by the end of the decade 1m people a year will discover
that Zimbabwe is one of the continent's most attractive destinations.
Yet it is still relatively uncrowded and comparatively cheap, and as
tourist-friendly as anywhere in Africa and beyond.
Last year, some 880,000 visitors came to Zimbabwe - more than three times
the 1989 figure - and growth is running at around 10 per cent a year. With
receipts in 1993 put at some Dollars 95m, and employing around 60,000
workers, tourism is easily the fastest developing sector of the economy.
Operators speak confidently of 1m visitors annually by the end of the
decade.
It is a perfectly feasible target. Zimbabwe is set to benefit from the
tourism boom under way in post-apartheid South Africa, and from the fact
that for the first time in 30 years, the region as a whole is at peace -
provided, that is, the Angola ceasefire holds.
There is little doubt, either, that the country can cope. It is already
renowned for its expertise in game conservation and management, as well as
innovative schemes which ensure that local communities participate in, and
benefit from, wildlife conservation.
The Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (Campfire),
introduced in 1984, encourages rural communities to exploit and sustain the
local wildlife through tourism, rather than deplete it through poaching.
But for anyone who knew Zimbabwe in the 1960s and 1970s, the idea of sharing
the country with 1m other visitors is most disagreeable. During those
decades, the guerrilla war against white minority rule and economic
sanctions imposed in the wake of the unilateral declaration of independence
in 1965 reduced tourists to a low of 75,000 a year in the late 1970s.
The only answer, however, is to get to Zimbabwe before even more visitors
discover the delights of one of the best value destinations in Africa.
Whether you are a backpacker staying at one of the cheap hostels that have
sprung up across the country, or in the luxury lodges developed over the
past few years in private game parks, prices and quality rival anything
regional competitors such as South Africa or Kenya have to offer.
Admittedly, some of the top hotels and lodges, comfortable as they usually
are, can be overpriced.
Many operate a two- or even three-tier pricing system - one for Zimbabwean
residents, a second for visitors from neighbouring countries, and the third
for the rest of the world. Thus what is usually termed 'overseas' customers
can find themselves paying as much as three times the local rate.
Some hotels, however, are adopting a single tariff policy, and this may
become the norm.
Even at the highest rate, there is some compensation from the fact that
prices other than accommodation are extraordinarily cheap by international
standards. It costs around Dollars 75 to fly the return journey from Harare
to Victoria Falls, one of the natural wonders of the world.
Most visitors make their base in Harare, 'one of the safest urban centres in
the world, almost devoid of the theft  .. which mars other holiday
destinations,' according to a government tourist handbook.
This hyperbole is positively misleading. Pickpockets are an increasing
menace. A common ploy is to wave a form seeking sponsorship for a bogus
charity event, and lift the wallet while the target is distracted.
For the business visitor, Meikles Hotel (795655 fax - 707754) remains the
best in town, and is centrally located. Old hands say it has never been the
same since the original Meikles, with its open verandah and balconies was
knocked down in the 1960s. Only the stone lions that guarded the entrance
remain, together with some long-serving members of staff who maintain old
traditions of hospitality and personal service.
The Sheraton (14-729771) is inconveniently situated, far enough from the
city centre to require a taxi - but the ride costs only a couple of US
dollars.
Some of the smaller city hotels such as the Bronte (796631) with its
pleasant garden, are excellent value, and not far from the town centre.
Even the most pressed business visitor should find time for a day trip to
the spectacular Victoria Falls; and if Air Zimbabwe's (737011) daily flight
is inconvenient, it is worth considering sharing a charter from one of the
several companies that operate from Harare.
If there is not time to fit in Hwange Game Reserve, one of Africa's finest,
at least get some of the flavour of the wild from a night at Pamuzinda
Safari Lodge, an hour's drive from Harare (11 lodges, 796541), or stay at
Imire Game Park, (Wedza 2257).
If you have to stay in Harare over the weekend, find time for a Saturday
afternoon at Borrowdale for the races, or an excursion to the game park at
Lake Chivero (it's advisable to take malaria precautions); and at some stage
find time to stroll round the National Gallery where the world-famous Shona
sculptures are on display.
Several private galleries also stock Zimbabwean work, and will arrange
delivery abroad.
If on holiday rather than on business, consider making the southern city of
Bulawayo your base. It is quieter, friendlier and closer to the Victoria
Falls and Hwange, and a 20-minute drive from the magnificent granite hills
of the Matobo national park, where the man who gave his name to Rhodesia -
Cecil John Rhodes - is buried.
Stay at Nesbitt Castle (19-42726), a turn-of-the-century crenellated folly
where 40-odd staff attend to the needs of guests, accommodated in eight
bedrooms, surrounded by a leafy garden with a swimming pool. Alternatively,
stay in one of the private game parks that have sprung up - Matobo Hills
(19-74589) is on the edge of the Matobo Park.
Bulawayo is also the starting point for what is by far the best way to
arrive at the Falls: by rail. Best of all is the luxurious service operated
by Rail Safaris (19-75575) - but book early.
Zimbabwe's absence of a coast is made up for by its inland sea at Lake
Kariba, where you can rent a houseboat - but beware bilharzia, the
water-borne parasite. If that is too leisurely a way to spend your time, go
white water rafting or canoeing on Zambesi River.
And if the summer heat is too much, head for the eastern highlands, where
even in the hottest months you will need a jersey in the evening. The
mountains offer hiking, riding, troutfishing - all on your doorstep if you
stay at Troutbeck Inn (129-8-305); or you could rent a cottage through the
Manicpal and Publicity Association in Mutare (120-64711).
African curios abound, but make a point of visiting African Trackwoods
(Harare 885652, UK agent 44-628-481086). The company turns old wooden
railway sleepers made from local teak and other hard woods into magnificent
tables and desks, and an associated company, Danjo Wood Products, turns the
offcuts into everything from briefcases to cigar boxes and picture frames.
The supply of sleepers is limited, and the company reckons it could run out
of them in a couple of years. Be prepared for a six-to-eight-month delivery
date.
If you are going on safari, then the Bulawayo-based Courtney Boot Company
makes hand-made hiking boots 'inspired by the legend of Frederick Courtney
Selous', the last of the big game hunters. Each pair has its own serial
number and wooden box, which for an extra USDollars 10 will bear the
purchaser's name on an engraved brass plaque.
Finally, a reading list might include the Globetrotter Guide to Zimbabwe, by
Paul Tingay, while for an insight into the war which cost some 30,000 lives
read Muzukuru: a guerrilla's story by Paul Hotz (Ravan Press, Johannesburg)
or Angus Shaw's Kandaya: Another Time, Another Place (Baobab Books, Harare).

FT  07 DEC 94 / Survey of Zimbabwe (9): New lease of life for mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a decade in the doldrums, mining is set to play a substantially
greater role in export and output growth than in the past 25 years, writes
Tony Hawkins.
Output volumes have barely changed since 1980. Chrome ore production has
halved, copper volumes are down 70 per cent, asbestos down 38 per cent, tin
down 30 per cent and nickel down 20 per cent. Only coal, up 68 per cent, and
gold, up 62 per cent, have bucked the trend to the point where gold now
accounts for some 45 per cent of total value. With ferrochrome output rising
as world demand recovers and the impact of Russian exports is digested, and
with gold production maintaining its uptrend, production volumes should
regain their peak levels of the mid-1970s by 1996.
Significant new capacity will come on stream in 1996-97 with the Dollars
225m Hartley Platinum mine being developed by BHP and Delta Gold of
Australia, the development of a number of small and medium-scale diamond
properties, a new copper mine and, very likely, a second major platinum
producer, the Mimosa, currently being investigated by the new owners of
Zimasco, one of the country's two large-scale ferrochrome manufacturers.
Further down the line are two major methane gas projects and the possible
expansion of nickel production. All of this sustains the view that resource-
intensive, primary sector development is more likely to spearhead export
growth in the late 1990s than labour- intensive manufactures.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Survey of Zimbabwe (7): Grassroots are bare - How drought
hit a village
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the economy of Zimbabwe, the drought of 1992, the worst in living
memory, was a disaster.
Gross domestic product fell by about 8 per cent as agricultural production
was cut by a quarter. Forty per cent of the population required food aid
when production of maize, the staple crop, plunged to a quarter of its usual
level. Higher imports and lower export earnings pushed the current account
deficit up sharply and sent inflation spiralling to a peak of 48 per cent.
For the villagers of Chichevo, in the parched south-eastern district of
Chibi, the drought was a catastrophe from which they have yet to recover.
They watched as their crops wilted and their oxen died, leaving them with
nothing but their bare hands to hoe the unyielding soil.
Reviving Chichevo, and thousands of other smallholdings in the poorest areas
of Zimbabwe - Natural Regions 4 and 5 - where 70 per cent of the population
lives, will be crucial to the recovery of the whole economy. Agriculture,
though accounting for only 14 per cent of GDP, employs nearly three-quarters
of the population and contributes up to 45 per cent of exports.
For donor countries, getting aid to smallholders in these vulnerable areas,
and making it work effectively, will be one of the biggest challenges they
have yet faced.
Chibi district, in the province of Masvingo, is one of the driest areas of
the country. Average rainfall is between 30cm and 50cm a year. Smallholders
farm just one hectare of land on average, and 53 per cent of the 157,000
farmers are women, the men having sought work in the towns. The drought of
1992 wiped out 70 per cent of the cattle in Chibi, leaving people with
nothing to sell to pay school fees and no animals for ploughing.
The village of Chichevo lies about 4km from the main road along a rough
track through dry bush. Mrs Pauline Chaumba, 45, suffered a fate typical of
the villagers during the drought - all 20 of her cattle died. But because
her husband works as a plumber in the town of Mashava, 120km away, she was
not entitled to food aid.
Mrs Chaumba tries to produce enough food for her mother, herself and her
seven children from three hectares. Last year, as usual, she did not have
any surplus maize to sell, and her only outside income was ZDollars 120 for
four tins of peanut butter which she ground from the nuts she grew.
After the drought, Mrs Chaumba burned the cattle shelters for firewood,
since she had no further use for them. Yet the village has not given up
hope. Under the expert guidance of Mrs Loveness Chari, their local
agricultural officer, the 68-strong group of farmers built a 1.5km dam by
hand to irrigate their maize and to grow vegetables to supplement their
basic diet. They have laid pipes to carry the water and stocked the lake
with fish, with the help of the government agricultural service. All they
need is an engine to pump the water to the crops. But it costs too much.
Whether they, and thousands of other smallholders, realise their hopes
depends on the government and donor agencies. Such grassroots initiatives
are exactly what the United Nations International Fund for Agricultural
Development (Ifad) is anxious to encourage and finance in two new projects
covering the dry, low-lying southern regions of Zimbabwe. The fund's mandate
is to help the poorest rural smallholders become self-sufficient by
supporting projects they have chosen.
But donor agencies face many obstacles. The dry areas have become a
government priority only since the drought. The emphasis on economic growth
in the 1980s put resources into the more profitable agricultural sectors,
and research and training was geared to areas with higher rainfall.
The structural adjustment programme, which coincided painfully with the
drought, has cut civil service jobs, and there is only one agricultural
extension officer for every 700-800 smallholders. About 70 per cent of the
extension service's budget goes on wages, rather than direct help for
farmers.
Officially, the government strongly backs Ifad's objectives. 'Grassroots
involvement is the starting point,' says Mr Kumbirai Kangai, the agriculture
minister. 'You let people tell you how you can assist them.'
In practice, encouraged by some donor nations, the government has
concentrated on high-profile, large-scale dams which are often costly to
maintain and fail to serve smallholders' needs. Mr David Hasluck, director
of the mainly white Commercial Farmers' Union, is sceptical about the
success of efforts to devolve power. 'Don't believe the government thinks
the people know what's good for them. The government knows what's good for
them. It believed that in 1980, and it hasn't changed.'
Whether aid gets through can depend heavily on political connections. The
government's free distribution of seed and fertiliser, a vote-catcher in the
run-up to next year's elections, threatens to conflict with donor attempts
to generate self-sufficiency.
Given such constraints, it might seem optimistic for the UN fund to predict
that its south-east dry areas project, due to be approved by its board early
next year, will generate increases in maize yields of 50-133 per cent. Mr
Edward Heinemann, project controller, admits there are many uncertainties.
'But 20 years of experience with these sorts of projects has shown that only
by being flexible and involving communities at every step is there any
chance of sustainability,' he says.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Survey of Zimbabwe (8): High-quality leaves - Tobacco
production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After two disastrous seasons in which tobacco prices on the Harare auction
floors plunged more than 60 per cent to US124 cents a kilogram, 1994 was a
much better year for the industry than anyone predicted.
In the early 1990s, production took off in response to a shortlived global
shortage, with volume jumping 68 per cent between 1989 (130m kg) and 1993
(218m kg). Initially, this was accompanied by rising prices, up from US176
cents a kg in 1989 to a record 325 cents in the boom year of 1991 when the
crop was worth Dollars 572m, with exports of Dollars 532m contributing 30
per cent of total foreign earnings.
Farmers raised their plantings but the severe 1992 drought and the
subsequent collapse of world tobacco prices in 1992-93 reversed this
process. The 1994 crop of 169m kg was 22 per cent lower than last year and
the smallest since 1990. Firmer world demand and global production cutbacks
boosted prices on the Harare floors which rose 40 per cent to 173 cents a
kg, little different from 1989 levels.
Exports fell by a third in 1992-93 but have recovered modestly to an
estimated USDollars 400m in 1994.
Tobacco is the country's largest export, accounting for an estimated 22 per
cent of the total.
While the 1991 euphoria has disappeared, the industry is mildly optimistic
about future prospects. The world tobacco market is divided into two - with
the low-value, low-quality segment dominated by Asian producers, especially
China, while the US, Brazil and Zimbabwe are the lead players in the
flavour, high-quality leaf sector. Here demand and supply are in rough
balance, subject to planned sell-off of the US stabilisation stockpile
currently being negotiated.
Zimbabwe producers are optimistic about modest growth - 5 per cent annually
 -in the second half of the decade, targeting planned increases in cigarette
production in Eastern Europe and possibly also China. The Zimbabwe Tobacco
Association, which represents some 1,650 large-scale growers producing over
95 per cent of the crop, has recommended a maximum 7.5 per cent increase in
planting this season.
Given the poor and late start to the rains, growers say crop could exceed
190m kg this year - dry seasons result in larger, though lower quality,
production. Expansion, culminating in lower prices, during the 1990-93
period was a reminder that Zimbabwe's future lies in niche production.
Industry experts urge growers to focus on quality rather than volume, since
Zimbabwe cannot outcompete low-cost producers in Brazil and Asia, especially
China.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Survey of Zimbabwe (4): Privatisation snags - Stock exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the 18 months since the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange was opened up to foreign
portfolio investment, market capitalis- ation has quadrupled in local
currency terms to ZDollars 16.8bn, more than trebling to USDollars 2bn in
hard currency value.
Foreign buyers, with net purchases of ZDollars 546m since July 1993, have
played only a minor role, with the main impetus coming from the return of
domestic investors as the economy recovers from the 1992 drought. After
peaking at 2,732 in September 1991, the industrials share price index
collapsed to a low of 870 in January 1993. By the time exchange control was
liberal- ised to allow foreign portfolio investors to buy up to 25 per cent
of any listed company, with no single investor holding over 5 per cent, the
index was hovering at the 1,000 mark.
The market surged 55 per cent in the third quarter last year and another 65
per cent in the final three months to reach 2,562. Strong foreign buying
took the market to a new high of 3,832 in March, since when it has settled
around the 3,550 level.
The conventional wisdom among market analysts is that with the average
price/earnings ratio on Industrials down to 11.8 in early Novem- ber from a
March peak of nearly 17, the market is set to break through the 4,000
barrier once interest rates come off the top and the flood of new and rights
offers has been digested.
In the closing months of 1994, one small new issue (Dollars 3.2m) and rights
calls of another ZDollars 366m (Dollars 44m) have eaten into the
institutional demand which accounts for some 80 per cent, by volume, of
turnover.
The limits on foreign participation relate only to post-June 1993 purchases,
since well over half the 63 listed companies are foreign- controlled. Today,
'new' port- folio investors, as distinct from long-standing holders with
management control, account for just 4 per cent of the shareholdings.
After two years of minimal primary market activity, more than ZDollars 700m
will have been raised this year, including two new listings by Chloride and
Eastern Highlands Plantations.
Many in business and the financial sector believe the stock market should be
used in the privatisation process and also to contribute towards solving the
indigenisation crisis. But advocates of indigenisation have little time for
the exchange - 'a white man's casino' is how one dis- misses it - demanding
direct discrimination along Malay- sian lines whereby companies were forced
to sell shares to Bumiputra individuals and businesses.
With Ashanti Goldfields stars in their eyes, emerging market fund managers
see privatisation as an opportunity for enhanced participation in Zimbabwe.
But there are snags: first, with the indigen- isation lobby and the official
media on its back, the govern- ment will find it difficult to sell
substantial chunks of 'the family silver' to foreigners, especially 'hit and
run' foreign funds, as one dealer calls them.
Perhaps an even greater obstacle is the state of the parastatal sector
balance sheet. In the past eight years, the main parastatals have run up
losses of over ZDollars 5bn and as of March were in debt to the tune of
ZDollars 12bn, with annual interest charges of ZDollars 3.5bn. Only a
handful of the parastatals are in fit state to be sold, and of these, some
obvious candid- ates, such as the telecommun- ications utility, have been
ruled out of contention on 'strategic' grounds though this may well change
as World Bank and IMF pressures inten- sify after next year's elections.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Survey of Zimbabwe (3): Welcome mat for foreign investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zimbabwe's attitude to foreign investment has changed markedly since the
1980s, when it was ambivalent at best and often plain hostile, writes
Michael Holman.
But trade liberalisation, the abolition of most foreign exchange controls,
the end of all but a handful of price controls, and other reforms have
changed the picture. Together with the fact that President Robert Mugabe
himself laid out the welcome mat for foreign investors at a London
conference earlier this year, the business environment has been transformed.
At its offices in the centre of Harare, officials of the Zimbabwe Investment
Centre promise to provide a speedy, and if possible, one-stop service to
investors.
Established in 1989 as a department within the ministry of finance, since
1992 the centre has been an autonomous institution, advising on the
incentives on offer, ranging from tax breaks to industrial sites on a
concessional basis.
Its officials paint a picture of Zimbabwe at the heart of regional groupings
which represent a potential market of over 250m people with a combined GDP
of some Dollars 155bn. Labour costs are as much as third below South
Africa's, without the powerful trade unions which are so influential there.
The centre promises that projects up to Dollars 10m will get its approval
within a week, provided there is no potential health or environmental
hazard, and its staff will assist the investor to obtain the licences or
permits that may be necessary.
Bigger investments will take longer to clear, but the days of red tape and
implicit disapproval are over, the centre insists.
Unfortunately, Mr Mugabe has not always made their task easy. Recent
comments which have disquieted the investment community include his apparent
reaffirmation of faith in socialism, made at the mid-year congress of the
ruling party, though party officials maintain that he is committed to the
economic reform programme.
No less disconcerting to some observers was Mr Mugabe's distinction between
'indigenous' businessmen - ie white - and 'indigenous indigenous'
businessmen - ie black - made in the course of a discussion on the need to
'indigenise' the economy.
What the president has so far failed to spell out is how the government
proposes to redress past inequities which have left the minority community
in a dominant economic role, while maintaining the confidence of this vital
group and not frightening away foreign investment.
Most investors are adopting a wait-and-see attitude, not necessarily because
they doubt Mr Mugabe, but because they want to find out how post-apartheid
South Africa will settle down.
Since the London conference in May, and until August this year, UK
investment flows have totalled a modest ZDollars 101m (around Pounds 6m),
according to the centre.
The biggest foreign investment, however, is the ZDollars 1.8bn platinum
mining project 80km south west of Harare, financed by Delta Gold and BHP
Minerals of Australia.
This boost notwithstanding, net foreign investment since independence in
1980 has not reached three figures.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Survey of Zimbabwe (6): Fingers point in all directions - A
look look at the banking scene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Money and banking in Zimbabwe today are all about finger-pointing. The
process starts with the World Bank, pointing a finger at the IMF for
insisting on a tight monetary stance resulting in double-digit real interest
rates. For its part the Fund blames the banks for excessive spreads between
deposit and lending rates, estimated at around 10 per cent.
The banks, in turn, blame the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe for using ZDollars
2bn in special bills and, in October, ZDollars 1bn in Treasury Bills to mop
up excess liquidity. The central bank points its finger at the government's
fiscal indiscipline, wage inflation and foreign currency inflows following
exchange control liberalisation.
Whoever the real culprit, the result is lending rates of 32 to 37 per cent
in a year in which inflation is likely to average 24 per cent. Small wonder,
then, that the supply response to economic reform is sluggish, especially in
manufacturing; that the real exchange rate appreciated for much of 1994,
that the air is thick with warnings of de-industrialisation, while black
business complains that the banks are biased against the indigenous business
community.
The RBZ justifies its tight money stance by pointing to the 46 per cent rate
of money supply growth so far this year. That, after 15 months of monetary
growth in excess of 40 per cent, inflation is not 10 points higher is
something of a surprise. Given the liquidity overhang, the authorities'
reluctance to take risks with inflation is understandable.
Indeed, the abolition of import controls and of the official exchange rate
at a time when the public sector borrowing requirement exceeds 10 per cent
of GDP has transformed policy-makers into single club golfers.
With the authorities unwilling (or unable) to bite the fiscal bullet and
exchange rate policy no longer an option, monetary policy is the last chance
saloon. Predictably, this is highly unpopular with business still struggling
to throw off the hangover of the 1992 drought. Loosen monetary policy and
cut interest rates, says business, optimistic that this will boost import
demand, reverse the foreign currency inflows of the past year and revive
consumer spending and a sluggish industrial sector.
But such are the constraints in the economy, especially savings skills,
infrastructure and real, as distinct from nominal, industrial capacity, that
an expansionist strategy could all too easily end in tears.
This is not the way the script was written; in 1993 inflation more than
halved from over 45 to 18.7 per cent, reflecting a 20 per cent fall in the
real money supply in 1992 and a further 10 per cent decline in the first
half of last year. But then it started to go wrong, with M2 rising 41 per
cent in the second half of the year, accelerating to 57 per cent by the
third quarter of 1994.
Previously, the blame for rapid monetary growth could be laid at
government's door, but the new villain of the piece is currency inflows. In
mid-1993, M3 of ZDollars 8.4bn was made up of domestic credit of some
ZDollars 12bn, partially offset by negative net foreign assets of ZDollars
3.5bn. By September this year, net domestic credit had risen a mere 12 per
cent, declining in real terms, but partial exchange control liberalisation
attracted substantial currency inflows, resulting in a build-up of foreign
reserves.
Put simply, of total M3 growth of ZDollars 5.1bn, the country's much
healthier external position, contributed ZDollars 3.6bn, or 70 per cent.
Government accounted for Dollars 1bn (71 per cent) of the increase in
domestic credit, with real private sector borrowing down some 25 per cent,
underscoring the fragile nature of the recovery and the impact of high real
interest rates.
Finger-pointing aside, no-one seems too sure what to do. One partial
solution would be to release blocked funds, estimated at Dollars 200m
(including so-called divestment bonds), while simultaneously liberalising
dividend payments - most pre-1993 foreign investors may not remit more than
half their after-tax earnings - and easing up on personal remittances.
Taken together, these three moves might slow net inflows, but the real
challenge is to get investment and imports growing more rapidly rather than
build up foreign reserves that must be sterilised with high interest rates
which encourage even greater inflows.
Late last month, in an effort to counter the growing pressure for lower
rates, the Reserve Bank trimmed its rediscount rate by 0.5 per cent to 29.5
per cent and cut its overnight accommodation rate by three points to 35 per
cent, citing slower monetary growth and a slowdown in inflation. At the same
time, it instructed banks to provide offshore borrowing facilities to
exporters of manufactures for 70 per cent of their working capital
requirements, arguing that this would reduce their borrowing costs.
Everyone, including the banks themselves, accepts the inevitability of
greater competition in financial services: the new financial services bill
will level and deregulate the playing field.
Although Zimbabwe has far fewer banks than Kenya or even Zambia - five
commercial banks, four merchant banks, five finance houses and three
building societies - its capital and money markets are more active than any
other in sub-Saharan Africa, except South Africa. There is an active money
market dominated by three discount houses, with a fourth due to open its
doors and, by African standards, a robust secondary market in financial
instruments, including government paper.
While much is made of the advantages of a sophisticated capital market
infrastructure, the cynical view is that the well-developed institutional
market, dominated by the South African-based Old Mutual group, has simply
made it easier for the government to overspend, overborrow and crowd out
private sector investment, the more so since life insurance and pension
funds are forced to put 55 per cent of their asset portfolios into
government or semi-government paper.
The government's enthusiasm for competition in the financial services sector
does not yet extend to paying market rates for long-term money. Its drive to
open up the market to more competitive banking is increasingly constrained
by demands that black investors have a major stake in new financial
institutions.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Survey of Zimbabwe (2): Sense of drift in economy - A look
at the disappointing impact of structural adjustment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Zimbabwe's first five-year structural adjustment programme nears its end,
it is impossible to escape the sense of drift and vacuum in economic
policymaking.
In part, this is a function of the political cycle, with elections scheduled
for March next year, and also of the prolonged illness of Mr Bernard
Chidzero, the long-standing finance minister, who did so much to launch the
programme.
Political change in South Africa is leaving its mark as major multinationals
ponder restructuring their African operations. There could be far-reaching
consequences for Pretoria's neighbours, especially Zimbabwe, which is
particularly vulnerable to marginalisation.
Nor will it be easy in the run-up to the elections for the politicians to
sell a second instalment of a politically unpopular programme, though
another five years, followed almost certainly by a third phase of ESAP
(Economic Structural Adjustment Programme) will be needed to finish the job.
Above all, structural adjustment in Zimbabwe is being re-examined as
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and politicians criticise the
programme's failure to alleviate poverty.
Indeed, just about any index shows that poverty has deepened since the
programme took off four years ago. Real incomes are lower now than at
independence 14 years ago, unemployment has quadrupled and now exceeds 30
per cent, and non-farm real wages are at their lowest level for a quarter of
century.
While much of this can be blamed on the 1992 drought, and on a sluggish
global economy, many in the NGO constituency, in academia, the trade unions
and on the political left, blame ESAP. The programme is flawed: the
assumption that manufacturing industry would 'lead' economic growth in the
1990s has turned into an angry debate over deindustrialisation. The
preoccupation with short-term goals, laying off 25,000 civil servants,
ignores the software side of the structural adjustment equation and the
country's deteriorating institutional capacity, especially in the public
sector.
The neglect of regional issues has now been cruelly exposed by South
Africa's return to respectability, as well as by Zimbabwe's optimistic
projections of macroeconomic targets for exports, growth, inflation and
public sector deficit reduction, none of which has been met. The flaws have
been compounded by sluggish implementation, especially in the public sector,
while institutional reforms are behind schedule.
Deregulation and liberalisation are on, or ahead of, target in respect of
prices, labour relations, investment, the exchange rate and some foreign
trade reforms, with quantitative import controls having been abolished and
most current account payments freed, though dividend remittances for
pre-1993 companies are still restricted to 50 per cent of after-tax
earnings.
In both the public sector and, especially, manufacturing industry,
structural change has been minimal. Scarcely a week goes by without fresh
calls from industrialists for new export incentives and a cut in interest
rates, while the politicians proffer repeated excuses for their failure to
bite the bullet of fiscal reform.
Privatisation, the central plank of ESAP II, has got no further than the
drawing board. The recent decision to shift surplus funds from Noczim, the
state monopoly fuel procurement company, to the financially-strapped
state-owned cargo airline, Affretair, illustrates the lack both of coherence
and transparency in public sector finances.
Under ESAP, the budget deficit should have been reduced to 5 per cent of GDP
by mid-1995 and although this remains the target, it assumes that ZDollars
1bn of state assets will be sold off by next June, and, more importantly,
ignores some ZDollars 2bn of parastatal losses. If these are taken into
account, the deficit would rise to over 10 per cent of GDP.
The key to fiscal reform is reduced state spending, rather than increased
revenue. Although personal and corporate tax rates have been cut since 1991,
high inflation and fiscal drag have ensured that the tax burden continues to
deter initiative and investment. Modest progress has been achieved on
spending, which is down to 40.8 per cent of GDP from 45 per cent at the
start of the programme. But the government's reluctance to slash military
spending - the third largest item in the budget (3.5 per cent of GDP) and
restructure the parastatal sector to eliminate losses, has plunged Zimbabwe
into a classic debt-trap situation.
Public sector debt now exceeds GDP, while interest charges are estimated at
14 per cent of GDP; central government interest payments absorb 18 per cent
of the budget, second only to education. Without debt reduction and
parastatal reform, there is little room for manoeuvre on the fiscal front,
other than the cuts in military spending promised by Mr Mugabe last May, but
unlikely to see the light of day until after the elections, if then.
The promised sale of state assets, presumably some of government's shares in
such companies as Delta Corporation (beverages, retailing and tourism),
Astra Corp (former Zimbabwe subsidiary of the South African Barlow group)
and Zimbabwe Financial Holdings (one of the top three commercial banks), to
fund recurrent spending rather than reduce debt underlines the precarious
fiscal balance.
The government claims to have cut subsidies but only by leaving some
ZDollars 2bn of parastatal losses off the balance sheet while classifying
numerous other payments to parastatals as loans and investments.
If all these are taken to account, the subsidy bill exceeds ZDollars 3bn or
6.5 per cent of GDP. Clearly there are major savings opportunities here, but
only when parastatal reform goes beyond the cosmetics of setting up 100 per
cent state-owned companies.
The two major lossmakers are the Grain Marketing Board, partly because it is
required to stockpile 945,000 tonnes of maize as a food security reserve,
and the state-owned steel company, Zisco. Official attitudes towards
privatising Zisco are seen in a recent parliamentary select committee report
which, after lambasting political interference and mismanagement, calls for
a 'limited' sale of equity in Zisco and the flotation of the company on the
Zimbabwe Stock Exchange.
But Zisco, with over ZDollars 2bn in debt and negative net worth is in no
shape for flotation, especially if control is to remain in state hands.
Meanwhile privatisation and the sale of state shares in public companies are
becoming entangled in the increasingly acrimonious debate over
indigenisation. Nearly 15 years after independence, black business claims
that 90 per cent of the economy is still in white and foreign hands. The
numbers are spurious given that the state accounts for a third of GDP, but
though blacks are increasingly in charge managerially, they have little
direct ownership control.
Given the challenges facing Zimbabwe for the rest of the century and beyond,
it is a depressingly sterile debate, with vociferous black organisations -
the Indigenous Business Development Centre and the Affirmative Action Group
 -preoccupied with shuffling ownership of existing assets rather than the
creation of new wealth, output, exports and, above all, jobs.
The government, while happy to champion indigenisation, a surefire
votewinner, is doing little to help. When (rather than if) it comes to
privatise, it will face intense pressure to sell to black investors and
entrepreneurs, most of whom will not have the funds.
Some type of investment trust linked to a more vigorous venture capital
industry is needed to satisfy the business community's aspirations, but here
too there are few signs of vision or leadership. Monetary growth (46 per
cent so far this year) fuelled by offshore borrowings, capital inflows and
the fiscal deficit, is being sterilised by ZDollars 3bn in central bank
issues of special and treasury bills. The net result is real interest rates
of about 10 per cent and a fall in real private sector borrowing.
It is hardly surprising that investment, outside mining and tourism, is
flagging and that, once again, GDP growth will fall behind target. Exports
should surge next year, mainly in mining and agriculture, resulting in a
further improvement in the balance of payments on current account.
Part of the explanation is limp import demand, itself a consequence of flat
investment, especially in manufacturing. Official forecasts predict growth
of 4 per cent since GDP will not regain its 1991 levels until 1996, while
per capita incomes will return to pre-ESAP levels only in 2000.
Growth should exceed 5 per cent in 1995 on the strength of the commodity
price rebound, expansion in gold mining, firmer tobacco prices and continued
recovery in manufacturing. But unless the authorities get to grips with
excessive monetary growth, interest rates and inflation - projected to
average 24 per cent this year against an ESAP target of 10 per cent - the
investment response will remain weak.
A sound infrastructure, considerable potential in mining, agriculture and
tourism, and a vibrant private sector give Zimbabwe a better chance than
most sub-Saharan countries to make a success of structural adjustment. But
the 1990s strategies needed to penetrate global markets, especially in
manufacturing, and the commitment and leadership necessary to tackle public
sector reform are missing.
In the absence of new blood and a more market-driven culture, reform will be
hamstrung by the combination of inertia and the ideological baggage of past
commitments to 'socialist transformation'.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Survey of Zimbabwe (1): Time for Mugabe to show vision - The
future for southern Africa has never looked brighter. But whether the
country makes the most of the new era depends on the prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fifteen years after independence, and four years down the road of economic
reform, Zimbabwe is poised to take advantage of the dawn of the new southern
Africa.
Democracy in South Africa, multi-party elections in Mozambique, and the
recent Angola agreement have changed the face of a region battered by war
since the early 1960s. If Angola's ceasefire holds, southern Africa will be
at peace for the first time in 30 years.
Never has the future looked brighter for a region whose resources include
oil in Angola, the wealth of the Rand, natural gas in Mozambique, plentiful
arable land, and long-established stock markets in Johannesburg and Harare.
Whether Zimbabwe makes the most of the new era, however, largely depends on
one man - the country's enigmatic leader, Mr Robert Mugabe.
Increasingly aloof, frequently intemperate in response to criticism, and
autocratic by nature, he dominates the political scene as never before.
The structural adjustment programme he reluctantly adopted has gone a long
way to change Zimbabwe's economic environment. Trade has been liberalised,
most foreign exchange controls have been lifted, and foreign investment
opportunities have markedly improved.
erratic, with several issues prompting donor concern, including the budget
deficit and the slow pace of privatisation.
Whatever the long-term benefits, cutting state spending and putting
state-owned enterprises onto a commercial footing are always painful
exercises.
Few observers, therefore, expect Mr Mugabe to tackle these vital issues
before the elections, due early next year. Should he fail to act swiftly
after the poll, however, donors will begin seriously to doubt the depth of
his commitment to market-driven reforms.
Given what seems to be his abiding attachment to socialism, judging by his
remarks at the September congress of the ruling Zanu party, it is remarkable
that the government has gone as far as it has.
Measured against what should have been done, however, performance has been
modest. But government minds may be concentrated by the vision of the new
southern Africa in which a more efficient, competitive Zimbabwe could
flourish.
In many respects, the country is well-equipped to meet the challenge. Its
infrastructure is sound and its industrial and mining sector second only to
South Africa, while labour is considerably cheaper than in its southern
neighbour.
Zimbabwe's commercial farming sector has flourished since independence in
1980, and its political stability seems assured.
What is more, Zimbabwe is at the geographical heart of a region which, if
its membership of the Preferential Trade Agreement is taken into account,
embraces some 250m people, and a total GDP of Dollars 155bn.
The problem for Mr Mugabe is that economic reform to date has not been a
vote-winner. Most Zimbabweans' experience has been of considerable pain and
little gain.
Although the greatest impact on standards of living has been the 1992
drought, the worst in living memory, structural adjustment tends to get the
blame for some grim statistics. Poverty has deepened, infant and maternal
mortality are rising, real incomes are lower than at independence, and per
capita incomes are not expected to return to pre-structural adjustment
levels until the year 2000.
Formal sector employment has risen only by 250,000 since 1979 to 1.24m, yet
each year some 250,000 school leavers come on the market. Some find work in
the informal sector, others on family smallholdings.
But for the majority of Zimbabwe's young people - more than a fifth of the
11m population are between 16 and 25 - life is tough.
If Mr Mugabe led a vibrant and effective party, prospects for sustained
reform would be brighter. As it is, Zanu is corrupt and complacent. Mr
Mugabe has surrounded himself with a cabinet that verges on the sycophantic.
Much to the dismay of donors and the business community, two key portfolios
 -finance, and trade and industry - have stand-in ministers, as a result of
the illness of Mr Bernard Chidzero, the key figure behind the programme, and
the death in a car accident last January of Mr Chris Ushewokunze.
On the face of it, any opposition party worth its salt would be confident of
success in the forthcoming poll. It might have to accept the parameters of
the structural adjustment programme; but if it stood on a platform of clean,
efficient government it should in theory be able to give Mr Mugabe a run for
his money.
A succession of scandals over the years has undermined the integrity of the
party and government. The exposure of the so-called Willowgate affair in
1989, in which government ministers used their positions to get preferential
terms for the purchase of motor vehicles, seems to have little effect on
government morality.
The most recent example of abuse of power involved the allocation to
ministers and leading party supporters of farms compulsorily purchased by
the state, ostensibly for the resettlement of peasant farmers. Although the
allocations were eventually rescinded by Mr Mugabe, the affair has done
lasting damage to the government's reputation.
At the same time, the opposition could point to the government's increase in
military spending at a time when regional tensions have been reducing, while
health spending has fallen.
These and other commonly voiced criticisms now overshadow the government's
considerable achievements in the early years of independence - notably in
the fields of education and health.
Meanwhile, what should be pressing concerns - such as the rapid
deterioration of the environment and the impact of Aids - seem to take
second place in the ruling party to the Byzantine rivalries within and
between the two leading clans of the majority Shona tribe - the Zezuru, of
which Mr Mugabe is a member, and the Karanga.
Zanu's political ally, the now defunct Zapu party, once its main rival,
seems content to play a minor role.
Yet if it is hard to find anyone enthusiastic about the government, it is
even harder to find anyone who is prepared to back the fractious opposition,
led mainly by discredited figures from the past.
Some of the strongest critics of the government, both outside the party and
within its ranks, have taken a tactical decision not to join the opposition.
They argue that the Zanu party machinery - subsidised by the state to the
tune of ZDollars 30m a year, and backed by the predominantly
state-controlled media - is too powerful to oppose.
The answer, they say, is to reform from within. Proponents of this approach
are hard-pressed to find any examples of an African government which,
without pressure from an opposition party, has voluntarily changed its ways.
The net result is a frustrated, disillusioned and cynical electorate, which
displays a marked lack of enthusiasm for the election.
Barely 50 per cent of eligible voters are thought to have registered, and
local observers say it would be surprising if more than half of those voted.
Meanwhile, as the election looms, there is a danger that complex issues
which require cool heads and carefully worked-out policies - such as the
compulsory purchase of white-owned commercial farmland for redistribution to
peasant farmers, or the continued white dominance of the economy - will be
subject to populist treatment by government politicians.
The latter issue is currently rarely out of the papers, disquieting both the
local white business community and potential foreign investors alike.
Some senior businessmen have sought to cool emotions. 'Indigenisation is not
a plot to deprive established businesses of their assets,' says Mr Ariston
Chambati, chief executive of TA Holdings, one of Zimbabwe's largest
companies and widely tipped for membership of the post-election cabinet. 'It
is a policy aimed at widening and broadening the economic base through a
process of levelling the playing field.'
According to Mr Chambati, 'economic empowerment of blacks can be justified
on moral and socio-economic grounds. It is an important and urgent issue
that cannot be left to an evolutionary process that is completely governed
by market forces.'
However, the government has yet to spell out what form such intervention
might take. As with the reform programme, Zimbabwe waits on word from the
president.
He could well surprise his critics. No one in Zimbabwe forgets the role Mr
Mugabe played in the past, and his capacity to buck conventional wisdom.
To the astonishment - and heartfelt relief - of white Rhodesians the man
many of them had vilified as a 'communist terrorist' emerged from his
success in the 1980 independence election as a compassionate pragmatist,
marking his victory with an appeal for reconciliation between the races.
If at this critical stage in the country's development, Mr Mugabe can
display the same statesmanship and vision, he may once again make an
indelible mark on Zimbabwe.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Sentiment in US sector increasingly
bullish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

US Treasury prices rose sharply across the maturity spectrum yesterday
spurred on by short-covering, a strong dollar and speculation about asset
reallocation.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 31/32 at
96 1/8 yielding 7.831 per cent and the two-year note up  9/32 at 99 21/32 ,
yielding 7.421 per cent.
Sentiment seemed increasingly bullish as bonds reacted more strongly to good
news than bad. Early in the day prices followed the dollar as it reached
session highs against the D-Mark and the Japanese yen, but did not fall back
as the currency pushed down below its late Monday levels. Late in the
afternoon the dollar was at Y100.05 and DM1.5718 down from Y100.48 and
DM1.5726 late on Monday.
The market also got a boost as traders who had anticipated price decreases
bought bonds to cover short positions. The moves indicate that traders now
believe prices will continue to rise, which would make the cost of covering
short positions increasingly expensive.
Talk of asset reallocation also helped push up bond prices. Early in the
day, analysts speculated that there might be some flight of investment from
stocks to bonds after Fidelity Investments announced that it would not make
a year-end distribution to shareholders in its Magellan Fund - the largest
mutual fund in the US - for the first time since 1988.
European government bonds weakened again yesterday, with the biggest losses
posted among short maturities as European interest-rate futures followed
their US counterparts sharply lower.
The March short sterling future on Liffe fell 0.16 to 92.50; German March
euromarks shed 0.08 to 94.49, and the French March Pibor contract on Matif
fell 0.18 to 93.92.
While dealers cited no strong reasons for the fall in the French and German
interest rate contracts, the drop in short sterling futures reflected
mounting fears of an imminent rise in UK interest rates.
The fears were fuelled by political worries ahead of the parliamentary vote,
due late yesterday, on the controversial VAT on fuel bill; many traders
feared that a government defeat could prompt a base rate increase -
especially with Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie
George, the governor of the Bank of England holding their monthly monetary
meeting today.
Futures selling ahead of today's auction of Pounds 2bn of 8.5 per cent gilts
due 2005 also weighed on prices. However, while dealers did not report much
domestic demand for the paper, they expected some interest in next year's
10-year benchmark from overseas.
Irish gilts reversed their recent out-performance of the UK market, dropping
by about  3/4 points on the collapse of talks between the Fianna Fail party
and its former Labour coalition partner to form a new government.
The prospect of new elections or a 'rainbow coalition' comprising several
parties unsettled the market, but dealers said either outcome would be
palatable, so long as it was announced soon.
'The most important thing for the bond market is that this issue is resolved
as quickly as possible to remove uncertainty,' said Mr Oliver Mangan,
economist at Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin.
The government's 6 1/4 per cent bonds due 2004 fell by 0.80 on the day to
84.00, where they yield 8.55 per cent.
The recent improvement in Italian bond market sentiment was reversed as
bonds tumbled amid political turmoil following the resignation of a leading
anti-corruption magistrate.
Before announcing his departure, he rattled the market by recommending a
10-month jail sentence for Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the Northern League,
in connection with unreported funds his party received from an Italian
industrial group.
'Events like this are convincing people that it's safest to stay on the
sidelines,' said Mr Graham McDevitt, bond strategist at Paribas Capital
Markets.

N. M. Rothschild of the UK has established an investment banking associate
company in Prague to reinforce its presence in eastern Europe.
Rothschild is taking a 40 per cent stake in Consilium, a joint venture with
Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, the Czech foreign trade bank.
The collaboration with Obchodni gives Rothschild an advantage in seeking the
mandate to advise on the Czech bank's privatisation.
Its management is to make a recommendation to Obchodni's board on an adviser
later this month and an international equity issue is planned for late 1995
or early 1996.
Rothschild's new Czech offshoot broadens a presence which already includes a
30 per cent stake in Access, a joint venture in Warsaw, and a fully-fledged
office in Moscow.
It has translated privatisation experience gained in the UK into a strong
franchise in eastern Europe, where it regularly figures among the winners of
privatisation mandates.
With a physical presence in the Czech Republic, Rothschild intends to shift
its emphasis from privatisations to domestic mergers and acquisitions,
restructurings and equity offerings.

FT  07 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Deutsche Bank and Morgan
Grenfell in syndicated loan link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank and Morgan Grenfell have joined forces in the syndicated loans
market and their first co-arranged loan is a Pounds 200m revolving credit
facility for the Co-operative Insurance Society, the UK insurer.
A syndicate of 14 banks has been formed for the five-year loan, the first by
the society for four years. It was priced at 22.5 basis points over London
interbank offered rate (Libor) and was signed yesterday.
Deutsche Bank, which is AAA rated and has assets of more than DM570bn,
recently signalled greater co-operation with its merchant banking subsidiary
Morgan Grenfell, which it bought five years ago for Pounds 950m.
Mr Rick Abbott of Morgan Grenfell said yesterday: 'This is the first of what
we hope will be a series of joint syndication activities. The approach we
have taken in this case has proved to be effective.'
Both Morgan Grenfell and Deutsche already had a relationship with the Co-op,
and a banker close to the deal said: 'It is the first time that the two
houses in London have co-operated together. The combination of Deutsche and
Morgan Grenfell coming together was seen as a strength, and brought value to
the transaction.'
ABN Amro and UBS have arranged a Dollars 700m standby loan for Akzo Nobel,
the Dutch-Swedish chemicals group formed this year through the merger of
Sweden's Nobel Industries and Akzo of the Netherlands. There are 15 banks in
the syndicate, all of which already had a relationship with the company.
The seven-year loan is priced at 22.5 basis points over Libor. On the
undrawn part of the loan, banks receive a commitment fee of 12 basis points.

FT  07 DEC 94 / International Bonds: Borrowers launch short-dated deals in
variety of currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Activity in the eurobond market stepped up dramatically yesterday as
borrowers launched a large number of short-dated deals in a variety of
currencies targeted at strong demand from retail investors.
However, the market's main focus of attention remained South Africa's
Dollars 500m five-year global bond offering, which is expected to be
launched imminently at a spread of around 200 basis points over US Treasury
bonds.
South Africa's worldwide 'roadshow' officially ended yesterday with final
meetings with investors. 'We are now going through a book-building exercise,
focusing investors' attention on a spread in the area of 200 basis points,'
said a syndicate official at Swiss Bank Corporation, joint lead manager with
Goldman Sachs.
Pricing will be crucial to the success of the deal and will set a precedent
for the borrowing costs South Africa as a sovereign borrower and South
African public and private companies pay in future, dealers said.
However, 'people are finding it difficult to make direct comparisons (on
pricing) with other countries' debt,' said one trader. The strongest demand
is expected to come from the US, although South Africa's sub-investment
NAIC3 rating there means demand from US insurance companies will be weak,
dealers said.
The pick-up in activity yesterday was particularly marked in the Luxembourg
franc sector, with deals totalling just under LFr10bn. Dealers said this was
due to attractive arbitrage opportunities.
BNG, the Dutch bank, launched a Dollars 200m four-year offering priced to
yield 12 basis points over US government bonds. The issue met firm demand
from retail investors in Belgium and Switzerland and some institutional
investors in the Far East, lead manager Daiwa said.
The proceeds were swapped into floating-rate dollars and then into
floating-rate guilders, market sources said.
GECC, the financing arm of General Electric, launched a Dollars 200m
three-year deal priced to yield around 13 basis points over US Treasuries
led by UBS.
GECC was active in other sectors, with a HKDollars 500m five-year issue and
a ADollars 100m two-year deal.
Argentaria Global Finance launched Y40bn of six-year bonds. The deal was
prompted by the successful auction of six-year Japanese government bonds on
Monday which set the tone for a strong JGB market yesterday, lead manager
Nikko said.

FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Iscor and state link in R3.6bn
steel mill venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Iscor, the South African iron and steel manufacturer, has announced plans to
develop a R3.6bn (Dollars 1bn) steel mini-mill at Saldanha Bay on the
country's west coast in partnership with the state-run Industrial
Development Corporation.
The project has been under investigation for several months, with both Iscor
and the IDC undertaking comprehensive feasibility studies. The decision to
go ahead is regarded by local analysts as a positive move that should
substantially help Iscor's long-term profitability.
The proposed mill will comprise a 650,000-tonne-a-year Corex plant, an
800,000-tonne-a-year shaft furnace to manufacture sponge iron, a DC arc
furnace, a continuous thin slab caster, a soaking furnace and a hot strip
mill. It will produce 1.25m tonnes of hot-rolled coil aimed primarily at the
export market.
Mr Hans Smith, Iscor managing director, said the project should generate
substantial foreign exchange earnings.
He said it signalled the commitment of both Iscor and the government to
promoting the treatment of raw materials before export.
'This is one of the biggest industrial projects of recent years and is
directed at beneficiating local raw materials for export,' Mr Smith said.
'It also has significant potential for future expansion and for development
of new, steel-related industries in the Saldanha area.'
The new mill, which will be constructed under what the company describes as
'stringent environmental standards', will support about 600 permanent jobs
and 4,000 temporary places during the construction phase. Production is
expected to begin within 36 months of the start of construction.
The announcement follows shortly after Iscor's decision last week to convert
its carbon steel-producing Pretoria Works into a stainless steel plant, at a
cost of R100m. That project is also expected to boost foreign exchange
earnings through the sale of new rolled products. Mr Smith estimates sales
of some R2bn a year by the end of the decade.
He said the combination of the Pretoria conversion with the Saldanha Bay
project would not alter the company's total volume of carbon steel
production.

FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Bank Tiara seeks to double share
capital through issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank Tiara Asia, the rapidly-growing Indonesian bank, is launching a Rp200bn
(Dollars 91.8m) share issue that will double its share capital. About one
third of the issue will be placed internationally later this month under the
leadership of Baring Brothers.
The extra funds will give the bank a total capital ratio, under the Bank for
International Settlements formula, of more than 30 per cent compared with
14.2 per cent at present.
Mr Tojokro Hartono, director responsible for corporate planning, said the
extra capital presented 'a tremendous opportunity' for growth in lending to
the medium-sized corporate market, in which Bank Tiara specialises.
With gross lending growth approaching 80 per cent, albeit from a small base,
Bank Tiara has enjoyed a rising share of the total Indonesian loan market
without sacrificing interest margins. These stand at a relatively high 6 per
cent.
The bank, which was founded in 1989, says it is careful to avoid excessive
exposure to its principal shareholder, Ometraco, the trading and real estate
group. Loans to Ometraco amount to less than 1.2 per cent of total lending
and 5.4 per cent of shareholders' funds.
Ometraco's stake in the bank will be reduced to about 44 per cent from about
66 per cent following the share issue. This should enhance the liquidity of
the other outstanding shares, most of which are held by international
investors.
Mr Hartono said with its strategy of focusing on the middle market, the bank
risked restricting growth in fee income, which is mainly generated by large
corporations. Also, it had to be careful to ensure that it could attract
sufficient deposits to fund its lending growth.
A plan to establish a finance company in Hong Kong next year would help
attract offshore deposits from Indonesian clients, and finance their trade
with China. The bank also believed its ability to develop new products for
depositors would be enhanced by a planned expansion into insurance.

FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Milestone for Australian
investors - The country's first publicly-funded infrastructure project is
about to start trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If all goes smoothly, the Australian stock market could pass a milestone
during the next few weeks when shares in Hills Motorway, the country's first
publicly-listed infrastructure project, start trading.
A public market for infrastructure-related securities is nothing new to
investors in the US, who have invested in development projects for decades.
In the UK, the concept is also familiar: Eurotunnel, for example, floated
seven years ago. In Australia, however, the notion of private infrastructure
funding is relatively new, and the launch of the Hills Motorway Trust will
be a closely-watched event.
At the centre of this new-found interest is the M2 Motorway, a tranche of
four-lane expressway with a two-lane busway and combined bicycle and
breakdown lane, to be built on Sydney's North Shore. It will operate as a
toll-road and run for about 20 kilometres. If planners' dreams come to
fruition, the M2 will ultimately form part of an orbital ring road around
the congested metropolitan area.
The Hills Motorway Trust, which is responsible for financing the project,
and the associated Hills Motorway Limited, which will supervise the
construction and ongoing operation of the road, were set up by Macquarie
Bank, the Sydney-based investment bank. Its consortium won the right to
handle the project from the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) earlier this
year.
The project itself is fairly straightforward. Construction of the road, due
to be completed in late-1997, will be handled by Abigroup, a local
publicly-listed construction group, and Japan's Obayashi Corporation.
Subsequent operation and maintenance of the toll-road for the next 35 to 45
years will be parcelled out to Abigroup and Transroute, the European
motorway operator.
What makes the M2 noteworthy is the structure of the funding. Out of a total
project cost of around ADollars 650m (USDollars 500.7m), the Hills
consortium is finding approximately ADollars 500m. In casting around for
these funds, bankers say they canvassed local institutional investors, and
encountered a number of requests, including one for a yield from day one,
and a request that there be a public market for the securities.
Partly to meet these requests, the funding was spilt into three parts:
ADollars 111m of term debt; ADollars 200m of inflation-linked, or 'CPI',
bonds; and ADollars 155m of equity, with sponsors contributing a further
ADollars 30m.
The use of CPI bonds was fairly obvious, since increases in the tolls and
the main operating costs will also be inflation-linked. More unusually, by
using an internal infrastructure loan which takes advantage of tax
concessions introduced by the federal government to encourage capital
investments, the project will pay tax-free dividends on the equity units
during the three-year construction phase. The yield, at the application
price, will be 10 per cent. (Once the motorway is built, revenue from the
tolls will provide the income stream.)
Potential takers for the equity were found earlier this year, and the CPI
bonds are underwritten. Now private investors are being offered the
opportunity to subscribe for a small portion of the equity.
The whole process has been not without controversy. On the one hand,
environmentalists have objected to another big road cutting through Sydney.
Part of the land on which the motorway will be built has also been subject
to a native title claim. If this is successful, the RTA could be obliged to
pay compensation to the Aboriginal people involved, although the motorway
itself should not be affected directly.
On the financial front, Macquarie admits some institutions were reluctant to
commit funds. It blamed this partly on scepticism about the traffic
projections and partly, perhaps, on unfamiliarity with this type of project.
Some of the large life insurance companies were particularly hesitant, it
says.
More recently, there has also been dispute with the Australian Stock
Exchange over what shares could be made available to the public as part of
the listing process. The original plan was for about a quarter of the
institutions' holding to be sold on to the public at a premium to the
original application price.
However, this would have meant that the remaining shares were subsequently
'escrowed' and untradable for a quite a while. In the end, Macquarie gave up
1.326m securities which it would have taken on to its own books. These will
be sold to the public at the same ADollars 1 application price which
institutions were offered.
An even bigger question is whether this launch heralds a meaningful
'infrastructure' sector on the ASX. This seems a strong possibility. Changes
to Australia's pension arrangements mean that institutionally-managed
superannuation funds are booming. Having come from virtually nothing to
ADollars 190bn over the past decade, they are forecast to reach around
ADollars 400bn by the year 2000.
Some of the larger fund management groups, moreover, have already earmarked
infrastructure investments as an area for attention. Lend Lease, for
example, has formed a joint venture with GE Capital to invest is such
projects, while the AMP, the big life group, has formalised an
infrastructure group within its investment division.
On the other side, state governments, worried about budget deficits, are
fairly keen to tap private-sector funds. Indeed, next off the block could be
a much larger tollway project - the southern/western bypass around
Melbourne.

FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Profit soars at Malaysian
Airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Malaysian Airlines (MAS) has announced sharply increased pre-tax profits of
MDollars 101m (USDollars 40m) for the six months ended September 30. This
compares with MDollars 6.4m in the year-ago period.
Turnover rose 15 per cent to MDollars 2.3bn, with the inclusion of an
unexplained 33 per cent rise in other income. Analysts attributed some of
the improvement in profits to the more effective use of capacity,
particularly on international routes.
The airline has also made staff reductions which have improved overall
productivity.
Mr Tajudin Ramli, a Malaysian entrepreneur with interests including
telecommunications and transport, gained control of MAS earlier this year
through a controversial, highly-leveraged MDollars 1.79bn deal. Mr Tajudin's
listed Malaysian Helicopter Services company now has a controlling 32 per
cent stake in MAS.
MAS said overall capacity for the period under review had expanded by 15.7
per cent, and the overall load factor had risen to 64.4 per cent.
'We believe that positive measures taken by the management and staff have to
a large extent contributed to the improved half-year results,' he said.
'These include aircraft optimisation and efficient redeployment of the
company's human resources.'
In spite of the improved results, analysts were cautious in their assessment
of the performance of MAS. Some said the results were not comprehensive, and
there were still doubts about the overall financial health of the airline.
An ambitious expansion programme involving the purchase of 72 aircraft,
valued at MDollars 10.6bn, over six years has severely strained financial
resources.
There are also doubts about the profitability of some of MAS's
recently-inaugurated routes, particularly to Latin America. MAS said it
would not be paying any interim dividend.

FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: George Weston under pressure

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
George Weston, the Sydney-based subsidiary of Associated British Foods but
quoted separately on the Australian Stock Exchange, yesterday warned that
profits would be 'at best, relatively flat' in the current financial year.
Mr John Pascoe, chief executive, claimed that pressure on margins remained
intense, especially in the core bakeries business, and that the severe
drought along the eastern seaboard was compounding problems. However, the
company hoped that rising grain costs might eventually lead to greater price
stability in the bread market.
Weston saw net profits unchanged last year at around ADollars 52.3m
(USDollars 40.3m), on sales of ADollars 1.05bn.
The company also came under attack yesterday from small shareholders over
its dividend policy, with representatives of the Australian Shareholders'
Association claiming that minority shareholders were being squeezed and
franking credits were going unused.
Mr Ray Wagner, from the ASA, described last year's 16.5-cents-a-share payout
as 'paltry' when retained profits stood at 14 times the dividend cost. The
company, he noted, was in a healthy cash situation and could support a more
liberal payout policy.

record result

   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lion Nathan, the biggest brewer in Australia and New Zealand, has forecast
continued profits growth of between 8 and 10 per cent a year.
Mr Douglas Myers, chief executive, yesterday told the annual meeting the
company had started the 1994-95 financial year strongly, with profitability
in the first quarter substantially above last year. Pre-tax earnings in the
financial year to next August 31 would be a record. However, net earnings
were expected to be below the NZDollars 204m (USDollars 129.1m) posted in
1993-94.
He said the economic upswing in Australia had meant a significant
strengthening in beer consumption over the past six months. The company's
market share had stabilised at 44 per cent.
Mr Myers said that Lion Nathan had caused the most dynamic improvements in
Australian brewing in 200 years, in part by forcing new industrial
practices. 'Once Australian breweries were inefficient and rigid: now they
are highly efficient. Our breweries are the most productive in the world,
and so flexible that most can today brew all our main regional brands.'
He found it encouraging that in New Zealand there had been a 1.1 per cent
growth in the overall beer market, and volumes had risen by 1.6 per cent.
Lion Nathan was making good progress with its plans to build breweries in
the main coastal regions of China.

FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Approach from suitor dismissed
by Borden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The possibility of a bid battle for Borden, the troubled US food group,
yesterday appeared to have evaporated following the company's decision to
dismiss an approach from Mr Paul Kazarian, a would-be suitor.
Borden, which has already agreed to a Dollars 2bn takeover by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street investment firm, said Mr Kazarian's plans
were neither realistic nor credible, and accused him of publicity-seeking.
It cancelled an invitation to Mr Kazarian to meet representatives of the
company at its Manhattan offices and said it had no intention of attending a
meeting that Mr Kazarian planned to stage in New York's Grand Hyatt Hotel
late yesterday afternoon.
The company's rejection of Mr Kazarian's overture increases the likelihood
that shareholders will accept KKR's tender offer, which expires on December
20.
The offer is worth Dollars 14.25 a share, payable in RJR Nabisco stock.
Mr Kazarian, a former chairman and chief executive of the Sunbeam-Oster
consumer products group, had proposed a complex restructuring of Borden
under which he would invest Dollars 430m in the company in return for 20 per
cent of its stock.
At the meeting in the Grand Hyatt Hotel he increased his offer to Dollars
560m.

FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: A&amp;P slashes payout, takes
Dollars 165m charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea, the troubled US supermarket group better known
as A&amp;P, yesterday slashed its quarterly dividend from 20 cents to 5 cents
and announced that it would take an after-tax charge of Dollars 165m in its
third quarter to December because of continuing problems with its Canadian
operations.
It also warned that these actions would make it necessary to seek a
renegotiation of its covenants with bank lenders, but said it believed fresh
agreements would be achieved on satisfactory terms. The shares closed
Dollars 1 down at Dollars 22.
A&amp;P, which is 52 per cent owned by Tengelmann, the German food retailer,
made net profits of just Dollars 379,000 on sales of Dollars 2.3bn in last
year's third quarter. One reason for the poor result was a 14-week strike in
its Canadian operations that ended in February this year.
Yesterday, the company said its US operating results had shown a strong
improvement, but the Canadian operations were still showing substantial
losses. As a result, it was taking a third-quarter charge of about Dollars
160m to include the write-off of goodwill, previously recognised tax
benefits and certain long-lived assets of its Canadian subsidiary.
A&amp;P said it was strengthening its efforts to turn round the Canadian
operations.

<TEXT>
Deere and Company, one of the world's largest farm equipment producers,
reported record profits for the fourth quarter and the year, saying growing
confidence among farmers in North America and in Europe has contributed to
strong sales.
Mr Hans Becherer, Deere chairman, said near-record net farm cash income in
the US this year 'should provide a solid base for 1995 farm expenditures,'
and that the implementation of Nafta and growing incomes in developing
countries such as China and India should promote better export markets for
US grains and oilseeds.
As a result, Deere said it would expand its North American production
tonnage schedules by 4 per cent in 1995, with the largest boost planned for
the first quarter of next year. At the same time, as part of a continuing
restructuring in Europe, overseas production tonnage will decline by about 6
per cent.
For the fourth quarter, Deere reported net income of Dollars 169.6m, or
Dollars 1.97 a share, compared with income of Dollars 93.1m, or Dollars
1.20, before special accounting and restructuring charges, in last year's
fourth quarter.
Sales in the quarter rose 16 per cent to Dollars 2.5bn, from Dollars 2.2bn.
Of that, Dollars 515m was outside North America. For the year, Deere posted
net income of Dollars 603.6m, Dollars 7.01 a share, up from Dollars 248m, or
Dollars 3.21, before special charges.

group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
International refuse hauler and environmental services company WMX has
further specialised its toxic waste clean-up operations by acquiring a
controlling interest in an Ohio-based group called OHM Corporation. The
deal, an exchange of assets for shares, is valued at about Dollars 75m.
WMX subsidiary Rust International has agreed to swap its hazardous and
nuclear waste remediation services business units, including about 900
employees and specialised hazardous waste treatment equipment, to OHM in
exchange for 10.4m shares, or about 40 per cent, of OHM stock. The
transaction is subject to the approval of shareholders in both companies.
The deal will allow Rust International to focus on its core environmental
services businesses, while giving OHM a dominant position among the small
group of US companies that specialises in cleaning up big hazardous waste
sites under the government-directed Superfund programme.
As part of the transaction, WMX has agreed to provide OHM with low-cost
financing for the next five years. OHM last year had net income of Dollars
4.4m on sales of Dollars 242m.
Mr James Kirk, OHM chairman, said the deal would 'yield a significant
improvement in our financial position and enhance our ability to fund our
growth with access to lower-cost financing'.
After combining Rust's hazardous waste remediation operations, OHM will have
about 3,100 employees, a client portfolio evenly divided between public and
private sectors, and a contract backlog of about Dollars 2.1bn.

FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Fox accuses NBC of hindering
expansion
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The row between Mr Rupert Murdoch's Fox Television and rival US network NBC
escalated yesterday with Fox accusing NBC of trying to suppress competition.
NBC had claimed Fox contravened US regulations by being foreign owned.
In a submission to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the
regulator, Fox said NBC was trying to preserve the 'old boys' club' of the
established networks and hinder Fox's expansion.
In a letter to FCC chairman Mr Reed Hundt, Mr Murdoch said NBC was wrong in
law in saying foreign ownership in broadcasting companies was flatly limited
to 25 per cent.
'Rather, Congress gave the FCC discretion to limit foreign ownership to 25
per cent if, and only if, it finds on a case-by-case basis that the public
interest would be served,' he said. Instead, the FCC had twice ruled in
Fox's favour.
NBC had claimed that control of Fox has passed from Mr Murdoch, who is a US
citizen, to his company News Corporation, which is Australian.
Fox argued that its immediate parent, Twentieth Century Holdings, is 76 per
cent owned and controlled by Mr Murdoch personally.
News Corporation, which owns the remaining 24 per cent, is de facto
controlled by Mr Murdoch, Fox said, and derives more than 60 per cent of its
sales and profits from the US. In Australia, it is regarded as a US company
for the purpose of holding broadcast licences.

FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Final call for Brazilian airline
sale - Embraer's sell-off has been much delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Embraer, Brazil's aircraft manufacturer, finally comes to the Sao Paulo
stock exchange today after a series of delays and a financial restructuring.
in an auction at Sao Paulo's stock exchange.
The leading manufacturer of regional aircraft, once regarded as one of the
country's best-run government enterprises, has been hit by the depressed
world aircraft industry, falling orders from the Brazilian air force and
government investment restrictions. Over the past four years accumulated
losses have risen to about Dollars 600m.
The government is selling 6.2m shares, 55.4 per cent of the voting stock, at
a reserve price of RDollars 153.7m (USDollars 179.3m). The government holds
87 per cent of the voting capital, which makes up 91 per cent of the total
capital.
So-called privatisation currencies - debt securities of the federal
government and public sector companies - will be accepted in the auction.
Brazilian pension funds, which hold a large number of these securities, are
likely to end up controlling the company, according to Embraer's financial
director Mr Manoel de Oliveira.
Under the terms of the sale, the purchasers will also have to provide
RDollars 30m in cash for a capital increase.
Direct competitors of Embraer in the aerospace industry are prohibited from
buying shares, although some foreign investors may take part in the sale via
local brokers.
Furthermore, the government is to retain a 'golden share', allowing it to
veto decisions it regards as against the national interest, such as the
transfer of military technology abroad.
The government will continue to hold 20 per cent of the voting stock.
Employees and the public will be offered 10 per cent each and the
government-controlled Banco do Brasil holds 4.6 per cent.
The sale has been postponed four times because of the company's financial
problems; its debts stood at about Dollars 1bn at the end of 1993.
A financial restructuring has been achieved following a government capital
injection of about Dollars 350m, combined with debt agreements with Banco do
Brasil and company bondholders, and its September balance sheet showed a
positive net worth - the first time for eight years - of RDollars 411m.
The company, which has 5,600 workers, is based at Sao Jose dos Campos, about
80km outside Sao Paulo.
The main aircraft produced are the 30-seat Brasilia, , of which 230 have
been sold in the US, and the military trainer Tucano, which has 60 per cent
of the market for training aircraft, according to Mr Oliveira.
The Tucano production line is the only one operating at full capacity, due
to an order for 80 aircraft from the French government in 1991.
The company is betting on two projects for future growth: a 50-seat regional
jet known as the Embraer 145 and the Super Tucano, an updated model of its
current training aircraft.
Embraer will be sold jointly with its three subsidiaries: Neiva, which makes
small aircraft for agricultural use, and its two trading and maintenance
companies in the US and France.

Full-year sales, including Deere's financial services businesses, were up 16

Dollars 1.8bn of its revenues this year came from outside North America.

<TEXT>
Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), the country's biggest financial institution, has
underlined the banking sector's robust recovery by almost quadrupling annual
earnings.
RBC is the first Canadian financial services group to post annual profits of
more than a billion dollars, with net earnings climbing to CDollars 1.17bn
(USDollars 852m), or CDollars 3.19 a share, in the year to October 31.
Earnings the previous year, totalling CDollars 300m, or 46 cents a share,
were dented by hefty restructuring charges and loan write-downs. Return on
equity improved to 16.8 per cent from 2.4 per cent.
RBC, with assets of CDollars 173.1bn on October 31, ascribed the strong
improvement mainly to sharply lower loan losses, a shrinking non-performing
loan portfolio and the absence of one-time restructuring charges.
Loan-loss provisions were more than halved to CDollars 820m from CDollars
1.75bn, but the drop includes a CDollars 250m reversal in general
provisions.
Non-performing loans at the year end fell 36 per cent to CDollars 2.1bn. RBC
was hit in the early 1990s by heavy exposure to the troubled property
market, especially in the Toronto area, and to resource industries. The bank
has written off 15 per cent of its commercial real estate exposure.
Loans to business and government have shrunk by 3 per cent in the past year
as part of efforts to reduce exposure to large companies and to commercial
property.
The strongest growth has come from personal financial services, including a
36 per cent jump in mutual fund revenues and a 64 per cent rise in the
fledgling insurance arm. Residential mortgages and consumer loans rose by 1
per cent.
RBC strengthened its personal finance business in 1993 with the acquisition
of Royal Trust, Canada's second-biggest trust and loan company. It now has
close to 3,950 automated teller machines, giving it the widest ATM network
of any North American bank.
In spite of the Royal Trust takeover, RBC's payroll has dropped from 52,700
to 49,200 in the past year, reflecting aggressive efforts to cut costs.

Hawker Siddeley Canada (HSC) has buttressed the long term expansion of its
Orenda Aerospace Division with a CDollars 230m (USDollars 167m) agreement to
make and service jet engines and parts for GE Aircraft Engines Canada, one
of the world's two biggest jet engine producers.
Orenda repairs and overhauls large jet engines and makes components for both
jets and industrial turbines. It is HSC's biggest single subsidiary. The
others lease railcars and build sawmill, mining and materials handling
equipment.
BTR sold its 59 per cent control of HSC last spring in a CDollars 122m
secondary share offer.
Orenda will become GE Aircraft's designated manufacturer of selected turbine
discs and other parts for three engine series sold worldwide.
The agreement will produce at least CDollars 230m worth of business over 20
years, and could generate further orders by providing access to European and
Middle East markets.
Orenda has already extended operations to the US. It has sold its steel
foundry division in Canada and is struggling to turn round its loss-making
sawmill equipment unit in the US.
The British mining equipment unit is being restructured, while railcar
leasing is highly profitable with booming North American commodity traffic.

Westcoast Energy, an expanding western Canada natural gas producer and owner
of a big Ontario distributor, is stepping into the Australian market with
Broken Hill Proprietary as partner.
The two companies will jointly study the feasibility of building a USDollars
300m 400-mile pipeline to bring gas from Bass Strait to the Melbourne and
Sydney areas. Westcoast would supply pipeline construction and operating
expertise.
BHP controls large gas reserves in the Bass Strait off the south east coast,
and its industrial operations are potential gas customers. The Australian
gas market is developing quickly because of environmental concerns about
coal.

FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Heinz rises 23% in quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
H. J. Heinz, the US food group, yesterday showed signs of a strengthening
recovery from last year's disappointing performance by announcing that
underlying operating profits had risen by 23 per cent in its second quarter
to October.
Net profits were sharply down, falling from Dollars 193.1m to Dollars
139.6m, but the comparison was distorted by a big increase in the tax charge
and by non-recurring gains in the year-ago period that resulted from the
disposal of its confectionery and specialty rice business-es.
Heinz said a better indicator of underlying performance was at the operating
profit level. Stripping out the comparable period's non-recurring gains
totalling Dollars 127m before tax, operating profits rose from Dollars
220.4m to Dollars 272.1m.
Earnings per share, adversely affected by an increase in the tax rate from
28.4 per cent to 37.5 per cent but boosted by company share repurchases,
were 56 cents. This represented an increase of 10 per cent from the
comparable period's 51 cents excluding the non-recurring gains, but fell
short of the 60 cents seen in the second quarter of 1992.
Heinz said the profits increase resulted from a 9 per cent increase in sales
to Dollars 1.98bn. Volume gains accounted for 4 percentage points of the
increase, acquisitions accounted for 3 percentage points, and the remaining
2 percentage points came from changes in currency translation rates.
The company said all divisions were performing well and it was still on
target for achieving double-digit earnings growth in the current fiscal
year.
During the quarter Heinz expanded its infant food business by completing the
acquisition of the family products division of Glaxo India. Since the
quarter-end it has also completed the acquisition of The Budget Gourmet
frozen foods brand in the US, which it predicts will add annual sales of
about Dollars 650m.

FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: French bank finds few friends -
A look at BCP's tough struggle to steer clear of bankruptcy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For troubled French banks, it helps to be big. While Credit Lyonnais, the
loss-making state-owned bank has received capital injections of more than
FFr5bn (Dollars 925m) to rescue it from sustained and substantial losses,
Banque Commercial Privee, a minnow in comparison, has faced a tougher
struggle in its battle against bankruptcy.
Since the declaration of a cessation of payments on Monday, the Paris-based
bank, which has 1,200 clients, one branch, 50 staff, and which requires an
estimated recapitalisation of FFr140m, has presented France's financial
community with a test of its ability to revive the smaller players in the
financial sector.
'It is the first French bank to close its doors since 1992, when Banque
Majorel failed,' says one French official. He argues that several small
banks have been weakened by the impact of recession in 1992 and 1993 and the
resulting bankruptcies which have continued to rise, in spite of broader
economic recovery this year. 'When you are small, you are more vulnerable.
It is often harder to find a white knight.'
Yesterday, the French banking community moved to reassure BCP's depositors
who have had their accounts frozen since November 21. The Association of
French Banks said it was invoking its so-called, 'solidarity mechanism'
through which its 428 members provide funds to repay up to FFr400,000 per
deposit. This is estimated to involve a cost of about FFr70m.
But whether the bank itself can find relief, however, remains far from
clear.
The Commission Bancaire, the regulatory arm of the Bank of France, the
country's central bank, has sought to bring pressure to bear on BCP's
shareholders to come to its rescue. It has done so through the application
of article 52-1 of the banking law, a provision which calls on shareholders
to provide funds for insolvent financial institutions.
This provision contrasts with article 52-2, under which the whole of the
French banking system is called to the rescue of a troubled bank. This
provision, last used in 1988 for the rescue of the Al-Saudi bank, is invoked
when the image and stability of the French financial system is considered to
be jeopardised.
'This is not the case with BCP,' says one French banker. 'It is not seen as
a big risk to the financial community or a political issue, so the rescue is
being sought through a recourse to shareholders.' For Mr Jean Varda,
appointed as provisional administrator of the bank, it is a vital search.
'It is imperative that we find a shareholder of reference to restore
liquidity and assure survival,' he says.
The problem for BCP, however, is that its shareholders are unable or so far
unwilling to jump into the breach. GAN, the loss-making state-owned insurer,
is one of the biggest investors in UNI, a holding company which controls 86
per cent of the shares of BCP.
However, it has said that it does not feel responsible for BCP and has
increased the plight of the bank by ending its access to the interbanking
market through UIC, GAN's banking division.
Macif, the mutual insurance company which holds 14 per cent of BCP, has
similarly indicated a reluctance to advance fresh capital, while UNI itself
is thought to lack the funds necessary to shore up the balance sheet.
The irony is that many in the banking community believe that the situation
facing BCP is far from terminal. Although it has suffered losses over the
past two years, and has been particularly exposed to the impact of recession
because of its loans to the small business sector, the required
recapitalisation is small compared with the bank's assets of about FFr1.7bn.
'It is not in such bad shape,' says one banking source. 'Liquidation could
be avoided.'
Whether it will be depends partly on a meeting tomorrow of the Paris
Tribunal de Commerce, the capital's commercial court. The meeting will
determine whether to wind up the bank or place it under judicial
redressment, a procedure which grants court appointed administrators six
months to seek a solution for the bank.
For most observers, the latter is the more likely outcome. BCP's client list
may attract potential buyers, while GAN's state shareholder may also exert
pressure on the insurance group to provide the necessary funds. For the
meantime, however, the bank and its depositors face a nail-biting wait.

FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Progress on German share front
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dresdner Bank yesterday took a significant step towards realising the
concept of wider share ownership by becoming the first big German
corporation to announce it will split up its shares to make them more
affordable.
Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, chairman, said the bank would propose to the next annual
meeting that the nominal value of its shares be reduced to DM5 from DM50
each.
Other companies, such as the Schering chemicals group, have said they plan
to do this, but Dresdner is the first to make the move.
German shares are some of the most expensive in the world. Dresdner Bank's
share price yesterday stood at about DM408 (Dollars 260); adopting a nominal
share denomination of DM5 that would be reduced to just over DM40.
The costliest share in Germany is that of the Allianz insurance group,
yesterday quoted at DM2,475.
Mr Sarrazin said he hoped other German companies would take advantage of the
provision in the new financial market promotion law allowing companies to
cut their nominal share values.
He said it was likely the DM15bn share issue by state-owned Deutsche
Telekom, the German telecommunications group, in 1996 would be in the form
of DM5 shares to attract a wide range of investors.
'I assume that all big companies want a wider spread in the ownership of
their shares,' he added.
The next six to 12 months would show how much interest there was in moving
to lower denominated shares.
Two recent German new issues - the Fielmann optical chain and Hanover Re,
the reinsurance group - have been in DM5 nominal shares.
A recent study by DG Bank concluded that a move towards DM5 nominal shares
would raise the interest of private investors in equities.
Compared with many other countries, investment in shares is a low proportion
of total savings and investment.
DG Bank said the average value of units in the DAX index of leading shares
was DM570 in April.
Only Switzerland, with an average price of DM1,625 was higher. US shares
were quoted at an average equivalent of about DM70, with those in Tokyo at
DM20 and in London at DM13.

FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Own-account losses lead to sharp
drop at Dresdner
</HEADLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dresdner Bank yesterday announced a sharp fall in profits at the 10-month
stage as the weakness in world bond markets pushed its financial trading
activities into the red.
Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, chairman, also hit out at the official investigation
into allegations that the bank had helped investors to evade tax by
transferring funds to Luxembourg.
The resulting debate was damaging for Germany's status as a financial
centre, he said. The authorities' actions, he added, set a 'questionable
signal' and 'criminalise the financial centre of Luxembourg'.
Group operating profits dropped by 17 per cent to DM1.33bn (Dollars 850m) in
the January-October period. Heavy write-offs on its bond holdings, caused by
rising capital market interest rates, meant Dresdner's own-account trading -
including securities, foreign exchange and other financial dealings -
produced a net loss of DM301m against a profit of DM536m. Two-thirds of the
loss stemmed from derivatives business by a Paris-based subsidiary but was
more than compensated for by profits elsewhere on linked interest rate
transactions.
The deterioration in Dresdner's performance is in line with the figures
presented by its competitors. Commerzbank has reported a 27 per cent fall in
operating profits to DM660m, although asset disposals lifted its pre-tax
figure.
BHF-Bank's own-account trading result was 85 per cent lower at DM14m,
although its operating result was steady at DM265m. Deutsche Bank announces
its 10-month results today.
Dresdner's partial operating profit, reflecting its basic lending, deposit
and investment business and excluding own-account trading, was 17.5 per cent
higher at DM2.8bn.
The surplus on interest rate business, including the profits on
derivatives-linked business, increased by 12 per cent to DM5.7bn
Commission income rose by 7 per cent to DM2.5bn. Preventing an even steeper
slide in operating profits was a 16 per cent reduction in loan loss
provisions to DM1.05bn.
Mr Sarrazin said the need for provisions on domestic loans was well below
the 1993 level.
Referring to the probe over alleged abetting of tax evasion, he said German
financial authorities misunderstood the concept of free capital movements.
Only if investors could depend on open borders for their money would Germany
continue to attract much-needed foreign capital.
The bank has denied wrongdoing and sharply criticised the probe by tax
officials and the state prosecutor's office into allegations it was covering
up transfers of funds to Luxembourg to help investors avoid German
withholding tax.

Burmeister &amp; Wain, the troubled Copenhagen shipyard, has abandoned plans for
co-operation with Kockums, the Swedish shipyard in Malmo, across the straits
from the Danish capital.
Plans for integrated co-operation between the Danish and Swedish yards,
which included evaluation of a new joint shipyard company, were announced
last month, but the yards said yesterday they could not find a satisfactory
financial basis for co-operation.
However, the Danish yard, with about 1,700 employees, said it hoped to
strengthen its financial position by selling its shares in shipping company
BurWain Tankers International, in which it has a 70 per cent holding.
The yard has built ships on a speculative basis for the shipping company,
whose losses are contributing to the group's problems.
It also said it was in negotiations with American insurance companies to
restructure a dollar loan. However it said the financing of work on six bulk
carriers, which the yard has on order, is being provided by its banks.
B&amp;W Holding shares fell DKr10 to DKr45 yesterday, compared with DKr394 at
the end of last year.

FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: German shipping group sees
record year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hapag-Lloyd, the German shipping and tourism group, expects operating
profits to increase to a record DM720m (Dollars 460m) in 1994, in spite of
the failure of its container shipping operations to achieve its target of
breaking even.
The main contribution to profits, up from DM645m last year, is expected to
come from the Hamburg-based company's tourism activities, including leisure
air travel, package holidays and its travel agency.
Profits of the company's cruise operations have fallen, partly because the
destinations served by the cruise liner Europa - including India and South
Africa - did not prove popular. Nevertheless, Hapag has chartered a second
smaller cruise liner, the Bremen, and may exercise an option to buy it next
year
Hapag's container operations will make an operating loss of between DM10m
and DM15m, Mr Bernd Wrede, chairman, said in London. This represents an
improvement on the 1993 loss of DM50m but is less than the forecast
break-even. The company now hopes to reach break-even in 1995, Mr Wrede
added.
The company's container activities have been restructured over the past two
years, resulting in a 20 per cent fall in employee numbers to 3,300.
At the same time, the number of containers shipped has risen by 15 per cent
to 850,000 twenty-foot unit equivalents (teu) while operating costs have
remained steady.
Total group turnover is expected to rise to DM4.1bn in 1994 from DM3.9bn the
year before. Container shipping accounts for just over half of the total.
Hapag expects to invest just over DM400m this year, compared with the
average of DM500m to DM550m in recent years. The company has disposed of its
towing operations, contributing DM85m towards a total capital gain on asset
sales of DM120m included in the operating profit figure.

Exxon, the US energy group, has finalised details of its Dollars 40bn
agreement with Indonesia to develop the giant Natuna natural gas field.
Mr Fritz Voight, vice president for gas, this week dismissed industry
rumours that key details of the deal signed last month in Jakarta with
Pertamina, the Indonesian state energy company, still need to be resolved.
He said Exxon considered the agreement complete, and 'there is no need for
further negotiation'. A formal signing of the contract will take place after
January 1.
The preliminary agreement did not include full details because Exxon was
waiting for beneficial changes to Indonesia's tax laws which only come into
force next month, he said.
Natuna, which has been the subject of negotiations since 1980, will be
Exxon's first big foray into the liquefied natural gas (LNG) market in Asia.
The field, located in the Natuna Sea about 1,250km north of Jakarta, is the
largest undeveloped hydrocarbon resource in south-east Asia.
It is equivalent in size to the Norway's Troll gas field, the largest in
western Europe.
The timing of the Natuna deal has surprised many industry executives. They
say the persistence of relatively low oil prices undermines the economic
viability of such long-term, capital intensive projects.
Demand forecasts for LNG vary widely. In addition, a number of existing LNG
plants, which supply Japan and the other main Asian markets, plan to expand
capacity, while Middle-Eastern producers, such as Qatar, have also embarked
on large-scale LNG projects targeted at Asia.
Mr Voight agrees there is little need for additional LNG supplies in Asia up
to the end of the decade and that Exxon's demand forecasts for Japan are
'slightly more optimistic' than those of the Tokyo government.
But he denies there is a danger of an LNG surplus. Exxon believes there will
be a 'significant need' for Japan to increase its LNG imports for power
generation between 2000 and 2010, the period in which Natuna is due to come
on stream.
It also predicts demand will grow in Taiwan and South Korea.
Mr Voight said China was likely to be an attractive market for Natuna gas.
He said it was impossible to give a start-up date for the project until
Pertamina signs up an initial buyer.
Exxon estimates it will take eight years to complete the first phase of the
project from the time the first sales agreement is reached.

FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Trygg-Hansa in Dollars 590m
refinancing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trygg-Hansa, the Swedish insurer, has arranged a Dollars 590m refinancing of
its troubled US associate, Home Holdings, as it moves to draw a line under
its investment in the group.
The debacle is set to cost Trygg about SKr5bn (Dollars 667m), including more
than SKr4bn in losses which will hit its 1994 results. Trygg bought into the
US company, which is nearly three times its size, in 1991.
'This investment has produced catastrophic economic results for Trygg. The
strategy was wrong from the beginning,' said Mr Lars Thunell, Trygg's
newly-appointed chief executive. He said Trygg was beginning a new era after
'four lost years' when it ceded Swedish market share and suffered huge
losses because of its involvement in Sweden's Gota AB, Svenska Kredit and IC
Holding, which all collapsed in 1992. Losses from Home, Gota, Svenska Kredit
and IC Holding exceed SKr11bn.
A US investor group, comprising Fund American Enterprises Holdings, Trident
Partnership and Hellman &amp; Friedman, is investing Dollars 420m in Home to
strengthen its balance sheet.
The move should should allow Home to regain a competitive rating, after
downgradings by three US rating agencies, and strengthen its market
position.
Trygg is writing off a Dollars 170m loan to Home and giving the US investor
group an option to buy 14.5m of its 22.5m shares. As a result ofthe dilutive
effect of the deal Trygg's stake in Home will fall to 18 per cent from 64.5
per cent and to as little as 6 per cent if the option is exercised.
On Monday the Swedish company announced plans to write down its investment
in Home by at least SKr2.8bn.
Mr Thunell said Trygg's remaining investment was 'purely financial' and
suggested it would probably be sold if an acceptable offer were made.
The refinancing is expected to be finalised in the next few weeks.
Mr Jack Byrne, chairman of Fund American, will be Home Holdings new
chairman. Fund American is a Vermont-based financial services group. Hellman
&amp; Friedman is a San Francisco-based merchant bank and Trident Partnership an
investment fund organised by J. P. Morgan and Marsh &amp; McLennan.
Home has been hit by its exposure to long-term environmental and
professional liability claims and by hefty unrealised losses on its bond
portfolio. Its nine-month loss of Dollars 121m was due mainly to Dollars
175m in reserve building.

FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Rolls-Royce on course to conclude Mercedes
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the Vickers-owned luxury car maker, expects to meet
its target of concluding an engine supply deal with Mercedes-Benz of Germany
before the end of this year.
Mercedes will supply its 6 litre V12 engine and possibly some other
components to Rolls-Royce under an agreement now in the final stages of
negotiation. 'We can't say yet that a deal has been concluded and we have
made no plans for an announcement this week,' Rolls-Royce said. 'However,
talks are at a very advanced stage.'
The company, based in Crewe, Cheshire, has been negotiating with Mercedes
for nearly a year, although it has never formally identified the Stuttgart
concern as the potential supplier of the engine to replace Rolls' own 6.75
litre units.
The current engines used in Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars are derived from a
Crewe-produced unit launched by the company in 1958 and updated
substantially.
The Mercedes engine, launched in 1991, is currently produced at a rate of
only 8,500 units a year. The potential extra output of more than 1,500,
which could arise from supplying Rolls-Royce, could improve economies of
scale substantially.

Pounds 6m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The turnround at Ransomes, the manufacturer of grass-cutting equipment and
specialist industrial trucks, continued yesterday with the announcement that
it made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 6.11m in the nine months to September 30.
The profits were the result of cost reductions and an improved performance
in the US and came after Ransomes made a loss of Pounds 8.93m in the year
ended December 31. The group has changed its reporting period to reflect the
seasonality of its business.
Turnover for the nine-month period was Pounds 132m (Pounds 166m) and
earnings per share was 1p against a loss of 25.9p. Operating profit
increased from Pounds 2.38m to Pounds 14.4m. However, operating profit for
the three months to September, the slowest period of the year, was Pounds
1.87m, less than the interest charge of Pounds 2.46m.
There is no ordinary dividend and the company is still one payment in
arrears on the dividends from its preference shares. Net debt fell to Pounds
72.8m (Pounds 75.3m) giving the group gearing of 509 per cent.
Mr John Clement, chairman, said: 'If we can maintain a period of stability,
we can then set about restructuring the balance sheet.'
The group made a profit of Pounds 690,000 on property sales, which are being
used to lower debt levels. In November itex changed contracts with Sears
Property Developments for the Pounds 8.55m sale of part of the Europark
sight.
Sales in North America improved to Pounds 64m (Pounds 72m), reflecting
strong demand for Cushman trucks and operating profits from the commercial
division advanced to Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 4.38m).
The consumer division recorded profits of Pounds 2.19m (Pounds 3.80m)
because of poor market conditions and a movement towards the group's lower
margin products.
The group hopes to make savings of Dollars 1m a year from the new banking
arrangements it has agreed with Barclays and NatWest.

sales

In spite of a fall in turnover from Pounds 42.7m to Pounds 42.1m, Eldridge
Pope, the USM-quoted brewer and wine merchant, reported annual pre-tax
profits ahead 50 per cent at Pounds 2.64m, against Pounds 1.76m.
The result for the year to September 30 was helped by lower finance charges
of Pounds 1.09m (Pounds 1.63m) the result of lower borrowings and interest
rates.
The fall in turnover was the result of selling its beer wholesaling business
in July last year.
The Hovetop pubs, acquired in the summer, contributed operating profits of
Pounds 164,000 to a total of Pounds 3.95m from turnover of Pounds 1.54m.
Earnings per share came out at 11.6p (8.6p) and the proposed final dividend
is raised to 2.6p for a total of 4.1p (3.55p).

FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Spending increases loss at Bell Cablemedia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bell Cablemedia, now the UK's third largest cable operator, made net losses
of Pounds 15.7m for the nine months to the end of September, compared with a
Pounds 3.6m loss last time
The increased deficit reflects the accelerating pace of investment and
development, with capital expenditure for the period increasing from Pounds
28m to Pounds 53.7m. Equity cable subscriptions were up by 37,835 and equity
telephone lines by 36,693.
The equity subscription concept is used by the cable industry to aggregate
minority stakes in cable franchises so that the equity total reflects 100
per cent ownership.
Operating revenue for the third quarter grew to Pounds 5.56m, compared with
Pounds 1.36m.
Bell Cablemedia, which floated last year on NASDAQ in New York and plans to
seek a London listing, now manages 18 franchises in the UK and has a 30.8
per cent stake in Videotron's 10 franchises.
The company's main shareholders are Bell Canada International,the Canadian
telecommunications group, Jones Intercable, the US cable operator and Cable
and Wireless,the London based telecommunications company.
Mr Alan Bates, Bell Cablemedia chief executive, said the results reflected
the 'heavy investment phase we are currently in'. Following the debt and
equity fund-raising the company's cash balance was Pounds 253.9m at the end
of September.

pre-tax profits for the six months to September 25 ahead from Pounds 13.9m
to Pounds 16.3m. Turnover increased by 4.7 per cent to Pounds 81.7m (Pounds
78m).
Pro forma earnings per share were 16.5p, up from 16p. Fully diluted earnings
per share were 20.2p (29.1p).
The shares, floated at 200p, closed at 283p, up 3p.
The increase in pre-tax profits reflects sharply lower interest payments of
Pounds 1.8m, down from a previous Pounds 5.18m, following the flotation,
which raised Pounds 27.5m net of expenses. Profits before interest were
lower at Pounds 18.1m, compared with Pounds 19.1m.
Mr Alan Goodenough, chief executive, said the fall in profit before interest
had been expected, as the previous figure included an exceptional
performance at the Ritz. The figures had been flattered by a high incidence
of high rollers, and the group's win percentage was much higher than normal.
'We are very pleased to have got so close to the previous figure from a much
better balance of business,' he said.
The Ritz and Les Ambassadeurs - the two up-market operations - contributed
69 per cent of the interim profits, compared with 84 per cent.
Following changes in gaming legislation, the group is introducing two new
games next year - Super Pan 9 and a variation of stud poker. Mr Goodenough
believes the addition to the traditional roulette, Punto Banco and Blackjack
will help to increase attendances, which were 16 per cent ahead for the
half.
The group is also extending the casino in Taba, opened in June on the border
between Israel and Egypt, and has signed a concession for a casino at
Hurghada, on the Red Sea coast, to open early next year.

FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Merseybus value surges to Pounds 10m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some 2,200 bus drivers and mechanics who bought their lossmaking company
from Merseyside's passenger transport authority for only Pounds 1 as part of
bus privatisation two years ago have learned that it is now worth about
Pounds 10m.
The latest assessment of the value of MTL Trust Holdings - known best as
Merseybus - by Coopers &amp; Lybrand puts each share at Pounds 12.78. This means
the average holding is worth nearly Pounds 4,000.
The company - which has since become Britain's fifth largest bus operator -
is owned by its employees. Losses were Pounds 8m on annual turnover of
Pounds 50m shortly before its sale, when employees were given 250 shares
worth 1p each, plus two extra shares for every year of service.
Financial turnround has seen annual profits running at about Pounds 1m with
Pounds 10m a year being spent on new buses. MTL bought London Northern, one
of the 10 companies created to privatise London Transport's buses, for
Pounds 20.5m in October.

FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: National Grid float now expected in May or
June
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bryan Townsend, chief executive of Midlands Electricity, said yesterday
he did not expect an announcement on the flotation of the National Grid
until after mid-January.
Mr Townsend, speaking at his company's interim results, said he expected a
Grid flotation in the late spring.
'Provided everything works out all right, we expect to float in May or
June,' he said.
Mr Townsend, who is leading negotiations with the government over the
treatment of proceeds from the demerger, said discussions were 'on track'.
There were tax issues to be resolved, as well as the benefits to customers
and shareholders.
Last week, the government, which owns a golden share in the Grid, said it
would appoint financial advisers for the flotation. Mr Townsend said
speculation that flotation would put a value of Pounds 5bn on the Grid was
'way over the top'.
Meanwhile, Midlands' shares slipped 15p to 765p, in spite of a 14 per cent
increase in interim pre-tax profits and a 22 per cent rise in the dividend.
The market was disappointed by the dividend increase, although profits were
at the top end of expectations.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 89.5m to Pounds 102.4m for the half-year to
September 30, on sales down from Pounds 625.5m to Pounds 621.6m.
The restructuring of the core business announced in September was
progressing well.
Midlands expected 500 of the targeted 1,200 job losses to be completed by
the end of the year. During the first half, before restructuring benefits,
costs had fallen by 3.9 per cent.
A strong distribution performance and higher interest gains helped improve
profits. The operating return from distribution rose 15 per cent to Pounds
76.1m, owing to strong unit growth and cost control.
Industrial and commercial demand showed a 3 per cent increase.
Supply profits were steady at Pounds 17.5m, in spite of tougher price
controls.
Earnings were 4p higher at 34.1p and the dividend rises from 7.65p to 9.3p.
COMMENT
Excluding the effects of the Pounds 154.5m share buy-back in October, the
underlying increase in the dividend was a disappointing 10 per cent.
However, the market should have realised Midlands would find it politically
difficult to unveil a bigger increase. Once the talks are out of the way,
however, Midlands has substantial scope to push dividend growth. A strong
balance sheet and high dividend cover give it plenty of room for manoeuvre.
Forecasts are for profits of Pounds 210m and a dividend of 28.3p. On this
basis, Midlands' yield is 4.6 per cent, a slight premium to the sector.
Midlands' attraction lies in its potential to improve this position even
further.

Strong growth in northern Europe, particularly Germany, helped Acal, the
electronics distributor, almost triple interim pre-tax profits. The figures
were also boosted by the purchase of 70 per cent of EAF.
On turnover for the period to September 30 up by a third to Pounds 50.3m
(Pounds 37.7m) profits were Pounds 3.47m (Pounds 1.31m). EAF contributed
turnover of Pounds 7.91m and operating profits of Pounds 1.25m to a total of

<TEXT>
Kwik-Fit Holdings, the vehicle component group, yesterday confirmed that it
was considering entering the car insurance market. The policies would be
sold through a direct telephone sales service and underwritten by a number
of insurers.
Mr Peter Holmes, sales and marketing director, said: 'We are looking at the
insurance market as one of a number of options. No formal decision has been
taken yet.' He added that the group expected to make an official
announcement in the new year.
The move into the increasingly crowded market for direct insurance services
will add further to the uncertainty currently pervading the insurance
business.
The success of Direct Line, the insurance arm of the Royal Bank of Scotland
which has taken about a 13 per cent share of the car market, has attracted
other entrants, to the detriment of established groups such as the
Automobile Association and Swinton Insurance.

FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Halifax schedule slips for deal with BNP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The schedule for Halifax Building Society to buy the UK mortgage business of
Banque Nationale de Paris has slipped by about a month, and the deal is now
unlikely to be completed until late January or early February next year.
The total of outstanding mortgages in the BNP business is also slipping and
will probably amount to about Pounds 1.4bn when the deal is concluded,
compared with the Pounds 1.5bn it represented when the negotiations were
announced in August.
However, this still amounts to almost 0.5 per cent of the total UK mortgage
market, where Halifax is already the UK's largest mortgage lender. The
society's proposed merger with Leeds Permanent, the UK's fifth largest
society, would give it about 20 per cent of the total.
Mr Dick Spelman, marketing general manager at Halifax, said that all the
main negotiations had been completed satisfactorily, and the remaining task
was to agree the detail of the sale and purchase arrangements.

FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Powell Duffryn calls for Pounds 71m -
Expansion of ports activities proposed as profits reach Pounds 17m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Powell Duffryn is proposing to raise Pounds 70.7m net of expenses via a
rights issue, to fund the acquisition of the shares it does not own in
Teesside Holdings and Humberside Holdings.
The specialist engineering, distribution and storage company said the
acquisition would fit in with the corporate strategy of expanding its ports
activities.
Teesside Holdings, which owns Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority, is owned
by a consortium of Powell Duffryn, 3i Group and Humberside Holdings.
Humberside is owned equally by Powell Duffryn and the family of Mr John
Holloway, chief executive of Teesside and a director of Humberside.
The 1-for-4 issue of 16.6m new ordinary shares is priced at 440p and has
been underwritten by SG Warburg. The share price yesterday closed 25p down
at 517p.
Powell Duffryn is planning a total investment of Pounds 98.4m, including an
offer of Pounds 8.6m for the employees' 5 per cent holding in Teesside.
Mr Bill Andrews, chief executive, said about 350 employees were shareholders
and, if they accepted a cash offer of Pounds 18.17 a share, the maximum any
individual would receive would be about Pounds 60,000 before tax.
The group is planning to pay Pounds 82.3m for the acquisitions, of which
Pounds 12m is in the form of loan notes, Pounds 7.5m in Powell Duffryn
shares and the balance in cash. In addition, the vendors of Humberside will
receive a cash dividend of Pounds 7.5m.
The rights issue and acquisitions are subject to shareholder approval and an
extraordinary general meeting will be held on December 29.
Powell Duffryn said its investment, made in early 1992, had been 'extremely
successful'. Teesside made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 13.6m in the year to
end-March.
Humberside Holdings, which runs services at east coast ports including
Immingham, Hull and Grimsby, made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 6.7m in the
year to end-March.
Mr David Hubbard, chairman, said pro-forma gearing after the rights issue
would be about 30 per cent, which he described as 'very comfortable'.
The group also announced an advance in pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.3m to
Pounds 17m on turnover up by Pounds 8.8m to Pounds 354m for the six months
to end-September.
The pre-tax outcome, however, included a profit of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 5.7m
deficit) from discontinued activities.
The interest charge was cut to Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 2.6m) and earnings came
out at 17.8p (8.2p) - or 15p (14.1p) excluding exceptionals. The interim
dividend is being raised to 8p (6.6p).
Mr Hubbard said: 'With some exceptions, trading throughout the group
continues to show the benefits of the steady improvement now evident in the
UK and US economies.'

FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: New SE proposals are put on trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Stock Exchange yesterday staged a partial trial of new proposals
designed to alert investors when there is evidence that price-sensitive
information has been leaked, writes Paul Taylor.
The Exchange insisted that De La Rue and Portals' share prices on the Seaq
quotation system were 'indicative only' pending a joint company
announcement.
The move came after renewed speculation about a possible bid by De La Rue,
the banknote printer, for Portals, the security and specialist papermaker,
which sent shares soaring.
In their statement the two companies said that although they continued to
enjoy 'an exceptionally close commercial relationship' De La Rue had 'no
present intention of making an offer for Portals without the recommendation
of the Portals board'.
However the companies confirmed that, 'following on from continued
commercial contact between the two companies, De La Rue has recently
suggested to Portals that discussions on ways in which their co-operation
might be enhanced should include the possibility of De La Rue making an
offer for Portals'. The companies broke off merger talks in May when they
said they had been 'unable to reach agreement'.
It was the sharp rise in Portal's shares in May that prompted the Stock
Exchange to propose new measures to minimise the effects of insider trading
on investors' confidence in the market.
The Stock Exchange scheme, unveiled in October, was the brainchild of Mr
Michael Lawrence, the exchange's chief executive.
Under his proposals trading in individual companies' shares would be
suspended if there was evidence that price-sensitive information concerning
those companies has been leaked.
Consultations over the proposals have been completed, although the new rules
have yet to be implemented. Nevertheless yesterday's action, which
coincidently also involved Portals and De La Rue's shares, was seen as a
trial run. Portals' shares closed 66p higher at 771p.

FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Holmes &amp; Marchant down 39% for year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Holmes &amp; Marchant, the marketing services company, blamed difficult trading
conditions and rationalisation costs for a 39 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 1.25m to Pounds 764,000 for the year to September 30.
While the marketing sector as a whole generally picked up during the past
year, many of Holmes' clients either cut or deferred expenditure and
turnover fell 22 per cent to Pounds 25.3m (Pounds 32.3m).
Mr John Holmes, chairman and chief executive, said more than Pounds 3m of
the decline was the result of product launch costs and rationalisation of
its consumer advertising agency.
Shares closed 2p down at 33p. . In July, when the company warned of a
profits shortfall, shares fell 17p in a day.
Earnings per share fell to 2.5p (4.1p).

FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Allied Colloids disappoints with 27% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Allied Colloids fell 13p to 117p yesterday after its first half
results fell short of market expectations, despite a 27 per cent increase in
profits.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to October 1 rose from Pounds 19m to
Pounds 24.2m, on turnover ahead 7 per cent at Pounds 170.2m (Pounds 159.3m)
 -a slowdown on the 10.8 per cent growth reported in the year to end March.
The company admitted, however, that half the profits increase was due to
favourable exchange rates, with overseas sales accounting for 86 per cent of
the total.
Profits were also enhanced by improved cost controls and lower raw material
prices, although these have risen sharply in recent months.
Contract prices for acrylonitrile - one of Allied Colloids' main raw
materials - have risen from a January low of Dm1,065 per tonne to a high
last month of Dm1,830.
Spot prices, meanwhile, have increase from Dollars 675 per tonne to Dollars
1,220 per tonne over the same period.
Mr Gordon Senior, finance director, said higher raw material price would
have an impact in the second half, but claimed the company would be able to
pass on most of the increase to customers.
'We expect to recover costs by not only passing on prices but also
increasing volume sales and reducing unit costs,' he said.
In the first half, sales growth was underpinned by buoyant demand in North
America and continental Europe, which rose 10.7 per cent to Pounds 57.6m and
7.7 per cent to Pounds 57.9m respectively.
Sales in other markets were more modest, with UK turnover rising slightly
from Pounds 21.6m to Pounds 22.7m.
Of the group's core products, only paper products showed any sizeable
increase and improvements in pollution control, textiles, mineral processing
and coatings remained sluggish.
Nevertheless, the company said its balance sheet was strong and it would
continue with capital expenditure on new plant and facilities, which reached
a record Pounds 22.5m in the first half.
Earnings per share rose 34 per cent from 2.5p to 3.35p, and an interim
dividend of 0.55p (0.5p) is declared.
COMMENT
Allied Colloids will need to engineer a strong second half sales performance
to recover some of the market confidence lost yesterday. Analysts downgraded
their full year forecasts from Pounds 56m to Pounds 51m and expressed
scepticism of improving sales growth as higher raw material prices begin to
bite. Some of its rivals, however, would be happy with margins of 14 per
cent and Allied Colloids' strong product portfolio. On a forward multiple of
16.5, a 21 per cent premium to the market, the shares may yet fall further.
But they remain a safe bet in the medium term.

FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Prudential in Pounds 106m Canadian sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer, is to complete its
departure from the Canadian insurance market by selling its life and savings
businesses to the Mutual Life Assurance Company of Canada for about CDollars
230m (Pounds 106m) in cash.
The move follows disposals of other elements of its Canadian operations and
of its Irish subsidiary.
Mr Mick Newmarch, Prudential chief executive, has made it clear that the
group intends to concentrate on its preferred markets of the UK, North
America and the Far East.
Prudential said yesterday that before the sale, it was buying back from its
Canadian businesses mortgages and bonds worth CDollars 310m (Pounds 144m)
and other assets worth about CDollars 120m (Pounds 56m), which Mutual Life
did not want to acquire. These will be sold over the coming months.
The transaction, which is unlikely to be completed before the beginning of
March and is subject to regulators' approval, is expected to produce a small
profit of between Pounds 10m and Pounds 20m for Prudential.
With CDollars 16.6bn assets at the end of last year, Mutual Life is one of
the largest Canadian life companies, while the net assets of the businesses
Prudential is selling amounted only to CDollars 59m at the same time.
In a generally flat Canadian life insurance market, Prudential's gross
premium income last year was CDollars 302m (Pounds 154m). Prudential
believes that it will be better placed to expand in Canada through Jackson
National Life, its US subsidiary, rather than by maintaining a very small
presence through other operations.
The Canadian businesses contributed just Pounds 5m to Prudential's half-year
pre-tax profits of Pounds 280m.

FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Taunton held back by price wars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taunton Cider sales were flat and profits down at the half-way stage, but
the group has lifted the dividend as a sign of confidence in the long-term
future of the market.
'There is evidence that the worst of the price wars is over,' said Mr Nick
Pearch, finance director, yesterday.
Shares in the group shed 11p to 143p.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to October 29 fell from Pounds 11m to
Pounds 10.4m on sales of Pounds 65.2m (Pounds 65.1m). Earnings per share
fell from 6.9p to 6.7p, and the interim dividend is lifted from 2.65p to
2.8p.
The UK volume market for cider grew by almost 8 per cent in the first half,
The group, which ended the half with Pounds 4.5m net cash, said its
performance in the take-home sector was ahead of the market. It plans to
spend Pounds 7m this year on packaging equipment, while a new plastic
bottling line has started operating and a new canning line is expected to
come on stream in the second half.
Sales of Dry Blackthorn were 10 per cent up and sales of Diamond White,
recently launched as a canned drink, grew by 8 per cent. 'Our brands are our
key strength. They give us grounds for confidence as more and more consumers
join the marketplace,' Mr Pearch said.

FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hazlewood halved at Pounds 10.7m - Problems
at four plants, now solved, cost group Pounds 7m in first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Problems at four UK plants helped to halve Hazlewood Foods interim profits.
Mr John Simons, the former finance director who took over as UK chief
executive in September, said yesterday that the problems had cost the group
Pounds 7m. However, all four problem areas had now been sorted out.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to October 1 fell from Pounds 23.3m to
Pounds 10.7m, while total sales grew from Pounds 403.9m to Pounds 426.1m.
Excluding exceptionals, profits were Pounds 12.1m (Pounds 25.6m). Sales from
continuing operations were ahead from Pounds 390.9m to Pounds 414m.
The group said it had returned two of the problem plants to profit - the
Sheffield sausage factory and the Wrexham ready meals plant. The Hilliers
plant in Plymouth, which makes chilled pies and quiches, was breaking even
at the end of the half following losses which at one time hit Pounds 90,000
a week. The salad processor in Waltham Abbey was sold.
'We made a small loss in the first quarter,' said Mr Simons. 'But we have
come back to substantial profitability after taking these actions.'
Produce was the only one of the group's eight operating divisions to show an
increase in operating profits and margins, making Pounds 5m (Pounds 3.3m) on
sales of Pounds 35.4m (Pounds 37.8m).
The ready meals division fell into the red to the tune of Pounds 1.1m,
compared with a profit of Pounds 6.3m. The result was hit by the Wrexham
plant problems, a depressed ice cream market, and raw material costs at Fri
D'Or, the Dutch potato processor.
The non-food division, which makes nappies and other paper goods, was also
hit by raw material increases which sent it Pounds 100,000 into the red
(Pounds 1.5m profit).
Grocery division profits fell to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 4.3m), hit by price
rises of up to 50 per cent for soft fruit for jam making, and by a falling
market for pickles.
Mr Simons said the group had now tidied up most of the peripheral problems,
and had established itself as a strong competitor in the convenient food and
ready meal markets. 'The team is very confident that this will lead to a
better second half performance.'
Earnings a share fell from 6.94p to 3.27p. The interim dividend is unchanged
at 2.4p.
COMMENT
The past 12 months have been traumatic for Hazlewood. Its response to
mounting problems has been reasonably rapid, and its has brought in new
blood and attacked its cost base. After a great deal of work, the group is
climbing out of the hole it dug for itself. But the pressures will continue,
not least from raw material price increases, particularly in packaging. The
trouble appears to be that the group is a hotch-potch of relatively small
businesses, with no critical mass in any single one, although it will argue
that 60 per cent of sales now come from the targetted ready meals sector.
Profit forecasts for the full year range from Pounds 29m to Pounds 39m, so
it is probably now best considered as a yield stock. An unchanged dividend
gives a yield of 8 per cent, which is below that of the similarly struggling
Albert Fisher.

FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Metro Radio in talks with Minster Sound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Metro Radio, the Newcastle-based commercial radio group, is in talks to
acquire Minster Sound, which operates radio stations in York and
Scarborough.
Metro, which last week announced a near doubling of profit to Pounds 4.63m
in the year to September 30, said yesterday it was in discussions with
Minster 'which may or may not lead to an offer being made for the whole of
the issued share capital'.
The approach is being judged friendly and a deal seems likely.
The acquisition would fill another gap in Metro's coverage of north-east
England. Minister launched on air in York in July 1992. It won an additional
broadcasting licence for Scarborough and began broadcasting there a year
ago.
After breaking even at the trading level in its first full year, Minster
made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 154,000 on a turnover of Pounds 1.2m in the
year to September 30.
The two largest investors in Minster are Radio Investments, which has a
portfolio of stakes in commercial radio, and GWR, the Bristol-based radio
group.
Minster shareholders were advised to do nothing ahead of a further
announcement.

FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Ross hit with Pounds 502,000 debt as
Gemforce folds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent disposal of In-Flight Supply Services (International) by Ross
Group, the consumer products and technical services company, has run into
difficulties.
The purchaser, Gemforce, a private interest controlled by Mr Ross Marks, a
founder and former executive director of Ross, has gone into voluntary
liquidation leaving outstanding debts to Ross of more than Pounds 500,000.
Ross has had a number of problems in recent years arising mainly from
loss-making companies it purchased on a Pounds 23m acquisition spree over
three years up to 1992.
Yesterday its share price dropped by 1.5p to close at 5.5p.
Gemforce paid an initial Pounds 225,000 in cash for In-Flight in October.
Further payments were to include a yearly Pounds 100,000 in royalties for
five years, along with an extra Pounds 250,000. Mr Marks was also to assume
responsibility for around Pounds 350,000 borrowings of In-Flight.
Ross said that discounting the royalty fee, a debt of Pounds 502,000 was
outstanding from the sale but the company expected some recovery.
Ross reported profits of Pounds 15,000 in the six months to June 30.

FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Swedish purchase lifts Charter - Shares
rise 25p after better than expected interim results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Charter jumped yesterday in a falling market, rising 25p to 780p,
as the UK industrial group announced better than expected interim operating
profits of Pounds 28.2m.
The result, which compared with Pounds 19.5m last time, was about Pounds 5m
better than expectations.
The market was particularly impressed with Charter's progress in integrating
Esab, the Swedish welding business acquired for Pounds 293m in August.
In the six weeks it contributed to these results, Esab returned operating
profits of Pounds 8.4m. 'The assumptions we had made for Esab in 1997 have
already been surpassed in this six week period,' said one analyst.
Esab was already achieving margins of 11 per cent, with further scope for
imporvement, analysts said, against expectations of 10 per cent.
Mr Jeffrey Herbert, chief executive said the restructuring of Esab was going
well. Charter expected to incur exceptional costs of between Pounds 10m and
Pounds 20m as a result.
The pre-tax line appeared less encouraging, with profits falling by 2 per
cent from Pounds 31.3m to Pounds 30.8m. Sales for the six months to
September 30 moved ahead from Pounds 288.4m to Pounds 358.8m.
Charter said the decline in pre-tax profits was due to a Pounds 6.6m drop in
interest gains to Pounds 2.6m. On a like-for-like basis, pre-tax profits had
improved by more than 20 per cent. Interest fell as a result of the buy-back
of shares held by Minorco, the off-shore arm of Anglo-American.
The company was restructured last year selling its stake in Johnson Matthey
and using part of the proceeds to buy back Minorco's 36 per cent stake. This
had left it with a cash pile which helped to fund the Esab purchase.
Excluding Esab, Charter's three divisions of building products, railtrack
equipment and coal returned marginally higher operating profits of Pounds
19.8m (Pounds 19.5m).
Mr Herbert said that he was confident of a further improvement for most
businesses in the current year, with the exception of coal. There remained
considerable uncertainties given the the privatisation of British Coal in
the UK and the competitive environment in the US.
Charter increased its interim dividend from 7p to 7.5p. Earnings per share
rose from 18.8p to 23.7p.
COMMENT
deal look like a steal. Few suspected that Charter would be able to get
margins up to these levels so soon, not even the management. Even better,
there appears to be substantial scope for further improvement through brand
synergies and rationalisation. Esab is also experiencing recovery in several
markets, most notably the US and Pacific, while Europe finally appears to
have hit bottom. So much good news might make investors wonder when it will
all turn to tears. For the moment however, the Esab story is a tempting one.
Forecasts are for profits of about Pounds 63m this year, rising to Pounds
88m in calendar 1995. The propective p/e for 1995 of about 14 times looks
decent value given Esab's potential.

FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Sterling Publishing rises 5% to Pounds
1.38m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sterling Publishing, which specialises in international business reference
books and magazines, increased interim pre-tax profits by 5 per cent.
The rise in profits to Pounds 1.38m (Pounds 1.31m) in the six months to
September 30, was achieved on turnover up 46 per cent at Pounds 24.9m
(Pounds 17.1m).
Mr Roger Harrison, chairman, said the group's publishing cycle was still
heavily biased towards the second half and as profits were only recognised
on publication, the first-half results were not a good guide for the rest of
the year.
The two international business publishing subsidiaries, Sterling
Publications and Cornhill Publications, increased operating profit by 14 per
cent and introduced eight new titles.
Fully diluted earnings per share amounted to 2p (1.9p). The interim dividend
is increased to 0.75p (0.7p).

FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Tibbett makes Austrian purchase from
Unilever
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tibbett &amp; Britten International, a wholly-owned subsidiary of UK-based
distribution group Tibbett &amp; Britten, is to acquire Eskimo-Iglo
Tiefkuhllogistik (TKL), a distribution and logistics company within
Unilever's Austrian frozen foods division.
The deal will be completed on January 1 1995, when an initial cash payment
of Sch100m (Pounds 5.9m) will be made from the parent group's existing
resources for 70 per cent of the Vienna-based company. A further Sch100m is
payable on the final day of the year.
The remaining 30 per cent of TKL's shares will be acquired by January 1 1997
for a performance-related figure of not more than Sch125m, payable in
instalments between 1997 and 2000.
Mr John Harvey, TBI chairman, said: 'This acquisition is consistent with our
strategy of development within our established business sectors while
translating our experience into new markets by working with existing
multinational clients.'
The acquisition will give Tibbett a long-term contract with Unilever and a
well-developed national network.
The deal will also see 500 employees and about 250 refrigerated vehicles
transfer to TBI.

FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Improved efficiency helps Stagecoach
advance 64%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stagecoach Holdings, the UK's largest bus group, yesterday announced a 64
per cent rise in pre-tax profits, with its continuing operations showing a
dramatic improvement in operating efficiency.
The profits, which rose from Pounds 8.86m to Pounds 14.5m in the six months
to October 15, were better than expected. The share price jumped 12p to
227p.
Stagecoach has been expanding aggressively through acquisitions, and
boosting the performance of new subsidiaries through bulk buying of buses
and components, and streamlining management.
However, during the period, UK operating profits on continuing businesses,
excluding acquisitions, came to Pounds 11.7m (Pounds 8.6m) giving operating
margins up from 14.8 per cent to 18.9 per cent.
Acquisitions since April 1993 added a further Pounds 5.44m, while there was
a Pounds 2.77m profit from the overseas operations in Africa, New Zealand
and Hong Kong.
Stagecoach is faced with a UK bus market which is shrinking, due to
increasing car usage, but the group achieved revenue growth from continuing
operations, and total turnover rose from Pounds 81m to Pounds 126.3m.
The company took Pounds 1.57m of redundancy costs in the first half, and
reorganisation costs are expected to come to about Pounds 3m for the full
year.
Stagecoach has so far added about Pounds 158m of annual turnover through
acquisitions this year. During the first half it spent about Pounds 73m in
bus companies and Pounds 26m on new vehicles.
Net debt amounted to Pounds 112m, representing gearing of 157 per cent.
Interest costs rose from Pounds 1.95m to Pounds 2.63m, but were covered 6.5
times, and the company said it would be comfortable with gearing below 175
per cent.
The dividend is raised by 10 per cent from 1.5p to 1.65p, against a 66 per
cent increase in earnings per share to 7.3p (4.4p), reflecting rising
capital expenditure on fleet and acquisitions.
COMMENT
The party is almost over for bus operators, as the pace of consolidation
within the industry starts to slow, and managements have to focus on
squeezing organic growth from a declining market. Stagecoach has always
stated that it could substantially improve operating efficiency, and the
latest results support its claims. Flexible pricing, and a creative approach
to new routes and bus types, are already paying off. This year's figures
will benefit from a full contribution from recent London acquisitions, and
pre-tax profits should rise to Pounds 31m, representing a p/e of 14.6. The
following year sees the full benefit of recent acquisitions. The shares are
at a premium to both stock market and sector, but the management has done
everything to deserve it, and the shares should continue to out-perform.

FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: GKN sells 20% of Chep UK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GKN, the automotive products, aerospace and special vehicles group, is
selling 20 per cent of Chep UK, its pallet pooling business, to Brambles of
Australia for Pounds 25m in cash.
The deal, creating a 50/50 joint venture between the two groups, includes a
provision for a further payment of Pounds 3m depending on Chep's
profitability for the two years ending December 31 1996.
Brambles has also agreed to acquire a 20 per cent interest in shareholders'
loans made to Chep UK for an estimated Pounds 7.2m.
The two groups also agreed that further global expansion would be on a 50/50
basis.
Chep UK, with 14m pallets in circulation, made pre-tax profits of Pounds
14.9m in the year to December 31 1993.
GKN has also sold its equipment rental activities in the US and Australia
for Pounds 5m, net of costs.
The consideration compares with a book value of Pounds 12m and goodwill
already written off of Pounds 22m. The effect on the group's results will
therefore be an exceptional loss of Pounds 29m and a reduction in
shareholders' funds of Pounds 7m.
The GKN rentals division in the US is being sold to a number of purchasers
led by Pro Equipment Rentals, while GKN Australia and its subsidiaries have
been sold to Kennards Hire. In 1993 the two businesses made losses of Pounds
6m.

FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Strategy to protect future expansion plans
at Sturge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sturge, one of Lloyd's biggest managing agencies, is to set up a new holding
company in an attempt to protect future expansion plans against legal action
threatened by lossmaking members of the insurance market.
The announcement came as the group announced a fall in pre-tax profits,
after stripping out lossmaking discontinued operations, to Pounds 3.06m in
the year to September 30 from Pounds 4.42m. Sturge Holdings also includes
Wise Speke, the private client stockbroker.
Last month the Sturge Names' Action Group, representing more than 3,000
Lloyd's members, said it would issue writs in January seeking compensation
for heavy losses incurred in the early 1990s on Sturge-run insurance
syndicates. SNAG said its claims might eventually total Pounds 1bn.
Lord Poole, Sturge's chief executive, said any action would be resisted
vigorously and that SNAG had little chance of winning.
He said the new holding company could not shield existing businesses from
legal action, but Sturge wanted to expand its range of businesses in the
financial services sector and the new holding company, Ockham Holdings,
would be clearly distanced from the Lloyd's insurance market.
He said any 'cunning ruse' to avoid litigation costs would have been stopped
by the High Court, which has to approve the transfer of Sturge shareholders'
interests into the new company. Separately, Sturge Holdings has increased
its provisions against litigation by Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 5m.
SNAG said it would seek to 'thwart any attempt to stop proper restitution of
assets that have been purloined from Names'.
The annual figures show the heavy cost of Sturge's discontinued members'
agencies, which act for individual members, and recorded an operating loss
of Pounds 2.93m against a loss of Pounds 3.28m last time.
The on-going members' agencies business was sold in October for an initial
consideration of Pounds 500,000. In relation to the disposal, Sturge wrote
off Pounds 12m in goodwill and made a provision for future losses of Pounds
3.78m.
Turnover on continuing operations fell to Pounds 21.6m (Pounds 27.7m).
Earnings per share for continuing operations were 3.9p (7p). Including
discontinued operations, losses per share were 31.1p against earnings of
1.5p. The final dividend is maintained at 2p making 3p for the year.

FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Saatchi to launch Zenith giant in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising group, is to launch its Zenith
media-buying business in the US from next month, it was announced yesterday.
Zenith Media US, with billings of about Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.20bn), will be
the largest media buyer in the US. It will initially draw its business from
Saatchi's three US advertising networks, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising,
Bates USA and Campbell Mithun Esty.
Zenith is well established in Europe and is the top-ranking media-buying
business in the UK, where about half its business comes from outside
Saatchi-owned agencies. The group hopes to develop similar third-party
business in the US.
Clients will be offered research and planning on where to place
advertisements, and consultancy on new media technology, said Saatchi.
Media-buying specialists can also obtain airtime and space in newspapers and
magazines at discount rates due to the volume of their purchases.
Saatchi's move comes at a time when media buying in the US appears to be
consolidating. Last month Interpublic, the US advertising group, announced
it was to acquire Western International Media, the country's largest
independent media-buying company.
Mr Charlie Scott, Saatchi chief executive, said the launch was an important
development for the group's US and worldwide clients. 'As the media
marketplace becomes more complex our clients will make their media spend
work hardest for them by using the skills, information sources and buying
leverage of a major player like Zenith,' he said.
Saatchi said it was also 'an important step in the development of the
world's first global media buying agency'. It would be the only specialist
media agency to provide a service to clients in the world's two leading
marketing regions of Europe and the US. Zenith is also expected to be
launched in China late next year.
Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst with Goldman Sachs, said the Zenith
announcement was not expected to affect Saatchi's profits forecasts in the
short term. The move would not involve extra expenditure on premises or
personnel, because existing resources would be used.
Longer-term success would depend on how much third-party business they could
win, he said.

FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: BSS advances to Pounds 6.7m midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interim profits at BSS Group, the heating, plumbing and process control
supplier, grew 33 per cent from Pounds 5.07m to Pounds 6.74m.
The shares edged ahead 1p to 520p, prompting Mr Peter Cooper, chief
executive, to remark that the group's shares were always 'slow to respond'.
However, he said he was pleased with the results.
Turnover in the six months to September 30 rose 13 per cent to Pounds 139.7m
(Pounds 123.3m). Operating profits emerged 27 per cent ahead at Pounds 7.11m
(5.58m), after a Pounds 100,000 charge for the reorganisation of the
domestic division.
Mr Cooper said that 'at long last', the group had seen a degree of recovery
in the industrial and commercial construction industry. He thought that
after 'three, though it seems like four, years of recession', this recovery
looked set to continue.
'We have seen a 2 1/2 per cent increase in the market as it affects us, as a
group,' he said, adding that BSS was now being vindicated in its policy of
not reducing investment through the recession.
The industrial and commercial division, comprising BSS and Manor, lifted
profits 16 per cent to Pounds 7.99m (Pounds 6.88m) on turnover up at Pounds
84m (Pounds 78.5m).
Sales on the domestic side expanded 24 per cent to Pounds 55.7m (Pounds
44.8m) and losses were reduced to Pounds 31,000 (Pounds 567,000). Mr Cooper
said the division, which is heavily biased towards the colder second half,
was recovering market share.
He reckoned that the whole market had grown 3.7 per cent on last time and
that the division's share rose from 10 to 12 per cent. This puts the group
second behind Wolseley, which has 27 per cent.
Mr Cooper said BSS now had a base for organic growth over the next two or
three years. The new distribution centre was complete and the unification of
the whole group onto one computer system was in process.
Earnings were 16.7p (12.3p) per share and the interim dividend is lifted to
6.25p (5.75p).

FT  07 DEC 94 / Don't think small when you can think micro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If small is beautiful, microscopic must be exquisite. That appears to be the
philosophy behind the new Gartmore Micro Index Trust, a closed-end fund for
which Gartmore is battling to collect up to Pounds 50m by next Tuesday in
tough UK market conditions. However, it claims to have the Pounds 34m
institutional allocation safely gathered.
Another interpretation of the Micro approach - which is to invest in the
London stock market's smallest companies which in aggregate make up 1 per
cent of the capitalisation - is that small cap managers are having to dig
deeper to find any gold.
The MicroCap index is the latest product of two prolific London Business
School professors, Elroy Dimson and Paul Marsh. They designed the Hoare
Govett Smaller Companies index in 1986, covering the bottom 10 per cent of
the market by capitalisation.
Their HGSC index revealed substantial and consistent outperformance over
many years of history. It helped to trigger a vogue for smaller company
stocks in the UK, mirroring a similar US fashion.
But as so often happens, backtesting of statistics has proved to be a poor
guide to the future. Small cap outperformance in the UK has melted away: the
HGSC index has slightly underperformed the All-Share index over both the
past five-year and ten-year periods.
Undaunted, Dimson and Marsh have dug deeper. They have dreamed up the HG
1000, covering the bottom 2 per cent of the London market by capitalisation.
A Pounds 30m Hoare Govett 1000 Investment Trust was launched last month. Now
the still more selective MicroCap index has been licensed to Gartmore. Like
the HG 1000 trust the Micro fund is a closed-end index-tracker, a format
which recognises poor liquidity at this market fringe.
And whatever may have happened over the past few years, small cap fans have
enjoyed 1994. The FT-SE 100 index of the biggest blue chips has been the
worst-performing of the various UK indices with a negative total return of
6.4 per cent to the end of November. The HGSC index shows minus 2.6 per cent
but the HG 1000 (excluding investment trusts) is at plus 3.1 per cent. As
for the MicroCap, it has returned 4.7 per cent, outperforming the All-Share
by about 11 per cent in eleven months.
What about the very long run? From 1955 to 1993 inclusive, the MicroCap
achieved an annualised average rate of return of 22.0 per cent, against 18.7
per cent for the HSGC and 14.5 per cent for the All-Share. An extra 7.5 per
cent a year is extraordinary.
Where does the extra performance come from? At the bottom of the market lies
an odd collection of the has-been and the never-was, plus the odd gems in
turnrounds and shells. Right now there are recovery hopes and above-average
exposure to manufacturing.
Micro companies are cheap on the basis of share price to sales, but not on
price to earnings. The fund offers institutions the chance to diversify into
a market sector where they probably are not already exposed. Gartmore's
statistics suggest cheekily that MicroCap returns have been higher and less
volatile than Hong Kong's.
But on the basis of its often troubled constituents this is more of a
submerging than an emerging market. True, there is an enhanced small company
effect, a higher return which probably relates to the poor liquidity and
high specific risk when you scrape the bottom of the stock market's barrel.
There is also a rebalancing effect, similar to that recently discussed in
the rather different context of pension fund asset allocation strategy.
Here the rebalancing arises from the way the MicroCap index is constructed,
with the more successful constituents climbing out but weak companies
sinking in. A manager tracking the index is forced to take profits on
winners and reinvest in losers. So long as enough losers recover - which in
deep recessions they may not - this recycling process is likely to add
value.
Let's hope so. Although the micro formula may have worked over 40 years and
over one year it has struggled since the late 1980s. But with Pounds 80m of
new money going into the bottom 2 per cent of the UK market the dogs may be
about to have their day.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Magellan skips cash payout: Fidelity's Dollars 35bn US
mutual fund cites tax rules as move unsettles markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fidelity Investments' Magellan Fund, the US's biggest mutual fund, said it
would not make a year-end distribution to its 3m investors, the first time
it has not made a year-end cash payment since 1988. The news raised concerns
about the cash reserves of Magellan, the US's biggest and most famous mutual
fund with assets of Dollars 35bn (Pounds 21bn). The fund has been operating
with little liquidity for most of this year.
However, Fidelity, the Boston-based mutual funds group, said the lack of a
cash distribution reflected US tax-accounting rules, rather than an internal
decision to conserve cash. 'We don't pay out any more than what's required
because there would be tax implications for our shareholders,' Fidelity
said. 'The fund's goal is to provide long-term capital appreciation.'
Under US tax rules, mutual funds have to distribute all dividend and
interest income, together with net capital gains from buying and selling
shares. Individual investors are then taxed on the cash they receive.
For this reason, Fidelity said, it does not pay out any cash other than that
required under the tax rules. It made an interim cash payment in May. The
announcement comes three weeks after Fidelity had calculated a year-end
payment of Dollars 4.32 a share for Magellan shareholders.
The change 'does not reflect any recent portfolio activity', it said.
Instead, it added, the original calculation had been an error. The Dollars
4.32-a-share payment would have amounted to a total cash distribution of
about Dollars 2bn.
Magellan's cash reserves amounted to just 2.2 per cent of its total assets
at the end of September, compared to what Fidelity said was an average of
5-10 per cent in its mutual funds. If it needed to raise cash quickly, for
instance to repay investors who wanted to withdraw their money, it could be
forced into selling stocks - a move which, given Magellan's size, could
depress prices generally.
The recent decline in US stock prices, together with a modest recovery in
bonds, has helped to stem the flow of cash into stock funds in recent weeks,
though there is little evidence of cash being withdrawn. The most recent
figures indicate that investors bought Dollars 8.3bn of shares in stock
funds in October, net of sales, compared with Dollars 10bn the month before.
Magellan's net asset value has fallen by 3.2 per cent this year.
The news late on Monday had contributed to declines in world stock markets
yesterday. In early trading, the US market also fell, partly in reaction to
the news from Magellan, but it shrugged off the losses by midday.

FT  07 DEC 94 / RJB plans offer close to price at suspension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RJB Mining, the coal company making a controversial bid for British Coal's
English assets, is telling institutional investors it is likely to offer
equity to finance the deal at a price only marginally below the level at
which existing shares were suspended.
Institutional investors have been told to expect the Pounds 400m of shares
being sold to be offered at around 340p each. This compares with the 348p
suspension price of shares in the existing RJB business.
The narrow discount has surprised analysts who had expected a significant
gap between the offer price and suspension price because of the controversy
surrounding the bid. Some analysts expect the offer price to fall, widening
the gap.
With up to six days to go before the price is fixed, RJB and its adviser,
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, are facing a mixed reaction from existing
shareholders.
One large investor says it plans to take up no new shares. 'RJB's
projections will not be wildly out,' he said. 'However, we do not think the
shares will jump to a big premium.'
But at least two large shareholders said yesterday they would subscribe for
more than Pounds 20m each of shares. 'We are aware of the risks after 1998
but we think they are being discounted in the price,' said one.
The price will depend on market conditions but BZW appears to have decided a
large discount on the suspension price would risk alienating existing
investors without providing a significant advantage in selling the shares.
RJB aims to raise Pounds 400m through equity. Assuming a 340p offer price,
this implies the issue of 120m shares, including 2m free for employees,
compared with 45m in issue.
With RJB predicting after-tax profits of Pounds 75m next year from the
British Coal assets and at least Pounds 10.5m expected from its existing
business, the prospective price earnings ratio would be 6.5.
Mr Malcolm Edwards, chairman of Coal Investments, said yesterday there was a
risk of the English coal industry being 'drained dry' because of the debt
RJB was taking on to finance the bid.
'All the profits that the industry is capable of making may be needed to
service the debt,' he said.

FT  07 DEC 94 / NFC suspends profit-share scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in NFC, the UK's largest transport and logistics group, fell 9 per
cent yesterday after it revealed a fall in full-year operating profits,
because of losses in European logistics, and a declining contribution from
removal services.
NFC also announced the first suspension of its employee profit-sharing
scheme since it was privatised in 1982, a significant blow for a company
which prides itself on its employee participation and ownership. NFC paid
out Pounds 3.5m to staff in the previous year. In an effort to reassure
institutional shareholders, however, NFC will lift its full-year dividend by
4 per cent from 6.72p to 7p.
NFC launched a Pounds 263m rights issue and Pounds 45m restructuring last
December, but its UK and European logistics businesses, and its global
removal services all saw profits slide in the fourth quarter of 1994.
Operations were adversely affected by the uncertainty following the sudden
resignation of Mr Peter Sherlock as chief executive in August. A replacement
has not been revealed, but is expected at the end of the year.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 104.9m to Pounds 105.6m for the year to
October 1. Excluding exceptional items, the figure rose from Pounds 95.1m to
Pounds 106.3m. Operating profits fell to Pounds 114.2m from Pounds 116.7m.
UK logistics, which includes the Exel operations, remained NFC's largest
profit maker reporting a slight increase in operating profits to Pounds
60.4m, from Pounds 60.1m.
A large number of contracts came up for renewal during the year, and Exel
had a success rate of close to 85 per cent, although it lost the Woolworths
account. Increasing competition, however, resulted in a number of contracts
being renewed at reduced rates.
In Europe, the logistics business lost Pounds 4.6m against a Pounds 4.4m
profit, despite investments during the year. NFC spent Pounds 10m on two
acquisitions from Frigoscandia last May, reducing the German operations to
an overall loss. The US business increased profits from Pounds 20.6m to
Pounds 23.3m, but at the expense of reduced margins.
Moving services, including Allied Pickfords, was hit by weak European
property markets, and profits fell from Pounds 20.6m to Pounds 16m. However,
Lynx, its parcel service, reduced losses from Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 5.9m.
Group turnover rose 7 per cent to Pounds 2.03bn (Pounds 1.9bn).
Mr James Watson, chairman, said: 'We are now focusing on areas where a
change in the business will produce immediate cost reductions.' It is adding
Pounds 5m to the Pounds 45m set aside for the restructuring and has
indicated that restructuring is accelerating.
NFC is paying a final dividend of 2.6p (2.5p), on earnings per share (before
exceptional items) of 12p (12.6p). Its shares closed 15p lower at 147p.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Siebe goes for growth after jump in profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Siebe, the international controls group, yesterday said it would accelerate
its global expansion programme following a 28.5 per cent increase in
first-half profits.
The company, one of the UK's largest engineering companies, saw pre-tax
profits increase from Pounds 93m to Pounds 119.5m in the six months to
September 30, as sales rose 13 per cent to Pounds 1.01bn.
Welcoming the figures, Mr Allen Yurko, chief executive, said they provided a
strong platform for growth both organically and by acquisition. 'We're
stepping up our expansion and we'd like to enhance our presence in eastern
Europe, the Far East and South America,' he said.
Although North America remained its largest market with increased sales of
Pounds 465.1m, against Pounds 435.6m, the group is keen to exploit growing
demand in Asia and the Pacific Rim, where turnover rose 34.9 per cent to
Pounds 136.8m.
Mr Yurko said the group, which manufactures products ranging from
sophisticated process controls systems to mass-produced components, would
seek acquisitions in the region but was likely to focus initially on further
joint ventures.
In recent months, Siebe has announced plans for three acquisitions totalling
Pounds 79.7m, while its new subsidiaries - Eckardt and NAF - made first time
sales contributions of Pounds 52m.
The group's acquisition strategy, financed partly from borrowings and funds
left over from last year's Pounds 184.3m rights issue, would continue at a
similar pace, Mr Yurko added.
Profits on continuing operations, meanwhile, rose from Pounds 121.2m to
Pounds 139.7m.
The improvement was underpinned by its two largest divisions - temperature &amp;
appliance controls and controls systems - which reported increased profits
of Pounds 57.4m (Pounds 52.9m) and Pounds 57.2m (Pounds 43.2m) respectively.
'Control systems has been a real sizzler and orders have increased by more
than 30 per cent,' said Mr Yurko.
Its contribution was offset, however, by declining profits in safety and
life support systems and specialist mechanical engineering, which was hit by
cuts in defence spending.
Earnings per share rose from 13.2p to 16.2p, and the group declared a 10 per
cent increase in the interim dividend to 4.03p (3.66p).

FT  07 DEC 94 / Blow to Clinton as Bentsen quits: President nominates Rubin
to take over US Treasury post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton is to nominate Mr Robert Rubin as Treasury secretary,
taking over from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the administration's elder statesman, who
announced his resignation yesterday.
Mr Rubin, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street investment
bank, heads the National Economic Council, a White House policy
co-ordination unit.
Mr Bentsen, 73, who on Monday had called speculation on his departure
'premature', said he had told Mr Clinton in September that he wanted to step
down.
His leaving is not expected to signal any sharp change in economic policy.
Mr Rubin and Mr Bentsen stand on the conservative wing of the Democratic
party and share a commitment to free trade, fiscal responsibility and
pro-business policies.
However, after last month's devastating defeat for Democrats in the
congressional elections, the loss of Mr Bentsen, who will return to Texas to
relaunch his business career, is expected to be sorely felt.
One of the criticisms most frequently levelled at Mr Clinton's White House
is its failure to persuade Congress of its way of thinking. That task will
be harder with Republican majorities in the Senate and the House of
Representatives.
With six years' service in the House and 22 in the Senate - the last six as
chairman of the powerful finance committee - Mr Bentsen had an instinct for
Congress's mood and an ability to work with the Republicans that was rare in
the Clinton administration.
Mr Rubin's confirmation by the Senate is not expected to pose difficulties.
He was endorsed yesterday by Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader in
the Senate, and by Senator Pete Domenici, who will chair the budget
committee.
But Mr Bentsen's retirement still leaves Mr Clinton with a large array of
vacancies to fill. A successor must be found to Mr Rubin at the NEC - the
most widely mentioned candidate is Mr Erskine Bowles, an investment banker.
Mr Clinton also still needs to pick a successor to Mr Mike Espy, who
resigned as agriculture secretary over charges of ethics violations. The
Democrats' political apparatus is also in disarray after last month's poll
setback. Mr Clinton needs to fill the jobs of White House political
director, head of the Democratic National Committee and head of his own
re-election committee.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Brussels to re-examine UK's Pounds 61m grant for textile
plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is to re-examine its approval this year of a Pounds
61m UK government grant for a textiles plant to be built by Hualon of Taiwan
in Belfast.
It suspects information it received from UK authorities was inaccurate.
Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, will write to the UK
Department of Trade and Industry, asking it to clarify evidence given by the
government about the project and its likely impact on the European textiles
market.
Commission officials said if the department failed to provide satisfactory
answers, the case would be reopened. That might lead to Brussels prohibiting
the grant and ordering the government to recover any money paid to Hualon.
The Commission approved the subsidy to Hualon, one of Taiwan's biggest
industrial groups, in May, after intense lobbying by UK ministers. They were
supported by Mr Jacques Delors, outgoing president of the European
Commission, in the interests of underpinning the Northern Ireland peace
process.
Brussels accepted the UK government's arguments that the plant would not
disrupt the European textiles market, in that it would supply synthetic
fibre to low-cost clothing manufacturers in Europe, and that its output
would substitute for imports from outside the European Union.
However, Mr Van Miert is now seeking further assurances that the plant will
not add to excess capacity in the European textiles industry by producing
high-quality products that will undercut existing manufacturers and create
unemployment.
'At the time (of the approval) we were convinced that production was at the
lower end of the market,' said a senior commission official yesterday. 'But
some doubt has come up and now we want reassurances. If not, we will have to
look into the files.'
Last week, European textiles and clothing manufacturers challenged the
Commission's decision in the European Court. They argue that the Pounds 157m
plant will threaten jobs in an already over-supplied sector.
Britain has long prided itself on a rigorous application of EU competition
rules and regularly complains when state aids in steel and the airline
industry are handed out in other member states.
The timing of Mr Van Miert's re-examination is doubly sensitive, as the UK
government is expected to win at least Pounds 250m in special EU aid to
Northern Ireland at this week's European Council in Essen.
Next week, it hosts an international conference in Northern Ireland, to
attract investment to the region.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Siebe has been promising organic growth for some time. Yesterday it produced
some. The controls group has yet to reach its target of increasing sales
from existing operations by 10 per cent. But organic growth in the half year
to end-September was 7.2 per cent and orders were up 13.4 per cent - meaning
Siebe should achieve its goal for the second half. Operating margins were
slightly up despite low margins at some recently acquired companies. In
time, these should rise towards Siebe's 14 per cent average.
The strength of Siebe's business is shown by its return on net assets which
has moved over 26 per cent. The group benefits from operating in markets
which are growing fairly quickly but which are protected by high barriers to
entry. Siebe's high levels of research and capital spending should enable it
to increase its market share steadily without suffering an erosion of
margins.
With annual cash flow of about Pounds 100m and gearing at the half year down
to 19 per cent, Siebe is well-placed to keep up a steady flow of infill
acquisitions. So far, it has shown itself adept at integrating new
purchases. If Siebe also confirms in coming months its capacity to grow
organically, its shares will deserve more than the slight market premium on
which they now trade.

FT  07 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: NFC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market has lost its patience with NFC. The stock was supposed to be a
recovery play. Yet with its main markets out of recession, year-on-year
operating profits in the fourth quarter dropped 23 per cent. Particularly
worrying was the continental European operations' plunge into loss. This was
where NFC was supposed to generate its future expansion.
NFC's underlying businesses appear to be in trouble: lower growth rates,
better organised competition, and increasingly price-conscious customers are
undermining the economics of the group's operations. Management has not
reacted fast enough to the new environment. Costs need to be cut sharply if
NFC is to compete with low-overhead competitors. It also needs to focus on
its core expertise, disposing of the low-margin BRS truck rental business
and Lynx parcel service.
Apart from Eurotunnel, NFC has been the transport sector's worst performing
stock this year, down 48 per cent from its peak. The shares are unlikely to
go much lower given the 6 per cent yield. But the group is not bid-proof:
its employees' double voting rights provide less protection than before,
given they now command only 11 per cent of the shares. Nor do its customers'
contracts, which permit renegotiation if NFC has new owners, provide an
insurmountable barrier. The new chairman and his soon-to-be-appointed chief
executive cannot afford to add to NFC's mistakes.

The reaction in some quarters to high-profile losses from derivatives and
other leveraged financial instruments has been near-hysterical. There is a
danger that regulators will respond by throwing out the tried and tested
principle of caveat emptor. There is pressure to replace it with rules
requiring banks to establish whether a product is suitable for a particular
client before selling it. Fortunately, regulators have so far stepped back
from embracing this suitability criterion.
This week's agreement between Bankers Trust and the Federal Reserve goes
about as far as is sensible in regulating the relationship between banks and
their clients in this area. It requires the bank to ensure that its clients
have sufficient information to understand the risks they are assuming. The
final responsibility for judging whether products are suitable rests with
the clients, which is as things should be.
If there is a case for more action, it is in pushing the disclosure
principle further down the line. Companies and institutional investors could
disclose to their ultimate beneficiaries the risks they are assuming. If the
likes of Orange County and Procter &amp; Gamble had to reveal to taxpayers and
shareholders exactly what they were investing in, they might think more
carefully whether leveraged products really suited their needs.

FT  07 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: The morning after
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England will have plenty to
talk about when they meet this morning for their monthly chat about interest
rate policy. In economic terms, the effect of last night's political upset
is not very significant. At stake was a tax increase which would have
increased the net take from VAT by not much more than Pounds 1bn - a figure
which amounts to little more than a rounding up adjustment when set against
total spending of the order of Pounds 300bn. Certainly the Chancellor should
not have much difficulty in fulfilling the promise that he would find ways
of making good the shortfall in his statement tomorrow.
The potential political damage is much more serious. The government's
tactics in attempting to bring unruly backbenchers back into line are shown
to have been deeply flawed. Its ability to control its own finances can no
longer be taken for granted. The assumption that a conservative government
will be in office for at least another two years will also need to be
reassessed.
It is true that some of this uncertainty has already been reflected in the
weakness of London's security markets during the past few days. But last
night's debacle may make the Chancellor less inclined to resist any pressure
from the Governor for a pre-emptive rise in interest rates: after all, he
now has scapegoats to point to. The next day or two may be uncomfortable.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Whips seek last-minute support for VAT vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior ministers and government whips were frantically trying to rally
support for increasing value-added tax on heating fuel last night, battling
growing unrest among Tory backbenchers.
Amid rising fears in Downing Street that Labour would succeed in forcing the
withdrawal of the planned increase, Mr John Major flew home early from the
European security conference in Budapest to direct the government's
fightback.
Mr Major saw Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, immediately on his return to
plan the government's approach to a crucial Commons vote said by Tory whips
to be 'on a knife edge'.
At least four Tory backbenchers were threatening to vote with Labour,
reducing the government's notional majority to six, including the nine
Conservatives who lost the whip after last week's rebellion on UK
contributions to the EU.
Up to eight Tories were threatening to abstain - more than enough to defeat
the government in the absence of assistance from the 10 Ulster unionists,
who were planning to vote with Labour.
Mr Clarke and Mr Richard Ryder, the government chief whip, spent most of
yesterday afternoon in meetings with rebellious backbenchers demanding the
withdrawal of the increase.
Mr Clarke, who discussed the crisis with Mr Major on Monday night, even
telephoned Mr Geoffrey Dickens, a seriously ill Conservative backbencher, to
gauge his support.
There were signs that the government pressure was making headway, but the
chancellor faced demands from some backbenchers for more compensation for
pensioners and the low paid.
Even government loyalists were grumbling about the government's refusal to
drop the second phase of VAT on heating fuel, which will raise the tax from
8 per cent to 17.5 per cent.
One backbench MP, normally a supporter of Mr Major, said the issue had been
handled with 'all the guile of a newt'. Another said it was 'a bit of a
mess'.
However, few were willing to go as far as Sir George Gardiner, the rightwing
MP for Reigate, who said in an article in The Times that the cabinet had
brought the Conservative party 'to the brink of disaster'.
Downing Street officials said the prime minister stood by warnings from Mr
Clarke that the government would have to raise other taxes if Conservative
rebels succeeded in forcing the withdrawal of the VAT increase.
The second tranche would raise about Pounds 1.5bn a year, on top of about
Pounds 1.4bn from the first increase to 8 per cent last April.
Mr Tony Newton, the Leader of the Commons, accused Labour of lacking an
alternative to raising VAT. He said Labour plans to close tax loopholes and
tax the windfall profits of utilities were 'an irresponsible cop out'.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Working in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is regrettable that the UK employment minister, Mr Michael Portillo,
opted for a display of anti-Brussels theatrics at yesterday's meeting of
European Union social affairs ministers in Brussels. The UK government's
suspicion of the old-style EU social agenda was usually justifiable. But
much of the debate in Europe has now moved on. Mr Portillo would make a more
valuable contribution to EU employment policy if he moved with it.
Britain had been widely expected to block the two directives debated
yesterday, one enforcing equal rights for part-time workers, the other
proposing equal treatment of workers posted to other countries. In the
event, Mr Portillo only needed to veto the first, since the other requires
redrafting, but this is unlikely to change the UK's position.
Both directives represent the last gasps of the aggressive social action
programme drawn up five years ago by the then European commissioner for
social affairs, Ms Vasso Papandreou. It was that long list of measures that
led the UK to argue for the right to 'opt out' of the social chapter of the
1991 Maastricht treaty, and Mr Portillo could justifiably use many of the
UK's traditional arguments for exercising a veto.
Mr Portillo viewed the other talking point of the meeting, a further set of
German-sponsored proposals, as a sign of more to come. But these are the
fruit of a visibly softened attitude to employment legislation in Brussels.
Mr Portillo ought to question whether the UK's past objections still have
the same force.
Subsidiarity
Traditionally, the UK's opposition rested on three planks. The first was a
principled objection, on grounds of subsidiarity, to European legislation
which went beyond the broadly uncontroversial desire to secure a basic
framework of rights for all EU workers, and enhance labour mobility within
the single market.
A second, and in many cases, underlying objection was more substantive: the
Continental quasi-corporatist model of employment policy implicit in several
directives was at odds with the deregulatory emphasis of Conservative policy
in this area. Finally, and with some justification, British ministers would
accuse fellow European ministers of using EU social policy proposals to
pursue essentially domestic political ends.
Politicking
There was certainly a fair amount of domestic politicking behind yesterday's
discussions. German part-time workers already enjoy most of the rights
included in the directive. The German government's enthusiasm yesterday for
pressing ahead with the legislation owes much to a desire to trumpet the
virtues of part-time work at home. Similarly, France was backing the
posted-workers directive strongly, since it has just passed similar
legislation at home, and wishes to avoid a legal proceeding against it on
competition grounds.
Mr Portillo was not averse yesterday to winning some domestic political
points of his own by opposing Germany's further policy suggestions. In
truth, however, the longstanding German wish-list - for EU-wide worker
protection against unfair dismissal, for example - is tame by comparison
with the early Delors agenda.
Both the principle and the substance of the European Commission's thinking
on social policy has changed substantially over the past two years. The UK
ought to work to influence the new model of employment policy that is
currently being forged, helping to tilt it further towards job creation and
towards allowing scope for different countries to experiment with different
regulatory and other safeguards. Many on the Continent are already moving in
this direction. Mr Portillo could push them further by cultivating a less
bombastic, case by case, approach to the debate.

FT  07 DEC 94 / In search of a unifying threat: Nato has been unable to
resolve its identity crisis, brought on by the collapse of the Soviet Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nato is in trouble. It is divided over Bosnia, but that is not the reason.
If there had not been Bosnia, there would have been something else. Nato is
in trouble because it no longer knows what it is for.
The west cannot say it was not warned. Back in 1987 it was told by Mr Georgy
Arbatov, the Soviet Union's top Americanologist, 'we have a 'secret weapon'
that will work almost regardless of the American response - we would deprive
America of The Enemy'. The end of the Soviet Union in 1991 fulfilled that
prediction well beyond its author's expectations.
Technically, a defensive alliance has no need of an identified enemy, and
indeed you will search the text of the North Atlantic treaty in vain for any
mention of the Soviet Union. On paper, it is simply an agreement by a group
of like-minded nations to come to each other's assistance if attacked,
irrespective of the attacker. But no one in 1949, or for most of the ensuing
40 years, was in doubt where any attack would come from.
So the disappearance of the Soviet Union and the withdrawal of Russian
troops from central Europe have left western policymakers floundering to
explain what the purpose of the alliance now is. Nato is no longer manning a
frontline on the Elbe, which is now simply a river in the middle of one of
its members.
The problem was already apparent in July 1990, when Nato leaders gathered in
London to state solemnly that they no longer regarded the members of the
Warsaw Pact as adversaries.
At the Rome summit of November 1991, Nato unveiled its 'new strategic
concept', in which it assigned to itself four core security functions:
'To provide one of the indispensable foundations for a stable security
environment in Europe.'
'To serve . . . as a transatlantic forum for allied consultations.'
'To deter and defend any threat of aggression against the territory of any
Nato member state.'
'To preserve the strategic balance within Europe.'
The lack of a clear direction was obvious. Only the third function has any
concrete meaning, and that left it deliberately unclear against whom or what
such deterrence and defence were now required.
The other three are classic communique-speak. 'Strategic balance' is a
meaningless concept unless one defines the forces that need to be balanced;
while to define an alliance as a forum for allied consultations is
tautological. A 'stable security environment' could mean anything or
nothing.
Probably it was intended to mean that Nato, by its very existence, provides
a degree of security to others in Europe, and notably in central and eastern
Europe, besides its own members. But that half-promise has raised
expectations that Nato is so far unable to fulfil, and its attempts to
fulfil them have led it into new problems.
The security problems of central and eastern Europe are essentially of two
types. There is the danger of ethnic conflict within or across state
borders, of which Bosnia has become the archetype; and there is the fear of
renewed Russian domination. (Lurking in the background is also the fear that
Germany might one day revert to expansionism.)
Both types of problem are acute in the former Soviet Union, where they
overlap, since concern for ethnic Russians in the other republics is one of
the main motives or pretexts for the reassertion of Russian influence. The
ethnic problem is also acute in the western Balkans, but appears to be under
control in Bulgaria. The situation of the Hungarian minorities in Romania
and Slovakia is a potential source of trouble, but there seems little
likelihood of that trouble taking a military form. In Poland and the Czech
Republic there are no ethnic problems to speak of. And the Russian threat to
central Europe, while still a vivid memory, has become fairly remote.
If that threat were to become less remote, Nato is probably still capable of
deterring it. There is a plausible argument that the four 'Visegrad states'
 -Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia - should be admitted to
Nato before the Russian threat reappears. This is unlikely to happen,
however, for two reasons: it would be foolish to push the Russians
gratuitously into a threatening attitude; and it would be even more foolish
to draw a line that implicitly leaves some states such as Ukraine and the
Baltics outside, for the Russians to do with as they please.
Those reasons were eloquently explained by the Clinton administration before
and during last January's Nato summit, which carefully fudged the issue by
producing the so-called 'Partnership for Peace' programme, under which all
east European states, including Russia, are encouraged to co-operate with
Nato, with no overt discrimination between them. So European governments
have been bemused in the past few weeks to find that same administration
staging a confrontation with Russia, by announcing plans to speed up Nato
enlargement. Although President Bill Clinton said on Monday that 'Nato will
not automatically exclude any nation from joining', the Russians know that
early enlargement would not include them.
Mr Clinton's aim, presumably, is to distract attention from the row over
Bosnia, and to provide the newly powerful Republican right with a rationale
for carrying on with Nato that is likely to appeal to them.
The trouble with this strategy, if such it can be called, is twofold: early
enlargement would be offered only to those central European states that need
it least; and any attempt to revive the Russian threat as Nato's raison
d'etre, so long as the threat is not unmistakable, is more likely to divide
the alliance than to unite it. West European governments can already be
heard expressing caution, which will no doubt leave the Republican right
even more disgusted with Nato than it already is.
Of course, we should not be in that situation if Nato had shown itself able
to deal with the other problem, that of ethnic conflict. But it has not.
That is not a criticism of Nato as an organisation: Nato, like the UN, is a
composite body which can only do what its member states will it to do.
At the beginning of the Yugoslav conflict, there was a consensus that Nato
had no role to play. It was, initially, an internal conflict in a non-member
state. With the recognition of the successor states in early 1992, it became
an international conflict, but the element of Serbian aggression was almost
impossible to disentangle from the conflict among Bosnian citizens.
Anyway, Nato has no mandate to defend non-members against each other. That
is properly a matter for the UN, and it was only in an attempt to enforce UN
resolutions that Nato did get involved in Bosnia, in support of a UN force
furnished partly by Nato members.
Unfortunately the mandate of the UN force was a hopeless mishmash of
enforcement and peacekeeping. The peacekeeping role dictated a troop
deployment that makes serious enforcement impossible, since UN soldiers are
effectively hostages in the hands of the 'enemy' against which enforcement
action would be taken. But that difficulty has only masked an even more
awkward question: whether collective security can be made effective in this
kind of conflict without deploying ground troops in a combat role.
The US argument has been that Nato air power, combined with arms supplies,
would redress the balance of forces against the aggressor and in favour of
the victim. That may or may not be right, but in either case it falls far
short of the commitment that Nato makes to the defence of its own members.
The fact is that none of Nato's members, and perhaps least of all the US,
feels sufficiently threatened by a Bosnia-type conflict to take the kind of
risks in dealing with it that they were prepared to take during the cold
war.
Until they do perceive such a threat, the alliance will remain ineffective,
and confidence in it will continue to ebb on both sides of the Atlantic.

The government can go on like this. Alas, it probably will. The question is
 -for how long? Yesterday the answer might have been clear. The assumption
was that the Conservative term that began in April 1992 would last the full
five years, if the party managers thought they could improve their chances
of winning the next election by hanging on. That assumption is now history.
Mr John Major can no longer bank on a full term. He is the plaything of
fate. He cannot credibly aspire to be the master of events. His
administration is not about to fall, but it is increasingly unsteady on its
feet.
We could, therefore, be in for an indefinite period of unstable government,
one that should go but nevertheless stays. It is only when - if - a ministry
is forced to abandon its budgetary stance that it can be said to have failed
absolutely. In such circumstances it is obliged to resign. As matters rest,
the prime minister can hold on, hoping for a turn in the Conservatives'
political fortunes. His strategies may appear in ruins - a familiar sight -
but in theory he could recover.
Mr Major was careful to establish that the vote he lost last night was not a
matter of confidence. He was, of course, technically correct. Labour's
successful motion merely amended the parliamentary procedure for handling
this year's finance bill. The Chancellor's sensible response to the vote was
instantly to throw in his losing hand, and it should not take too much
imagination for him to come up tomorrow with substitute taxes or further
expenditure cuts to plug the financial gap.
But in the real world of contemporary politics, nothing is that simple. The
government was knocked sideways in September 1992, when, on Black Wednesday,
sterling was summarily ejected from the European exchange rate mechanism.
That set off a downward spiral of political misfortune from which the
administration has spasmodically managed to extricate itself, always to fall
back into a hole shortly afterwards.
Mr Major may go down in history as the Phoenix with nine lives. He is ever
picking himself up, always to be slammed over again.
Every Conservative knows why. The party, divided on Europe before Black
Wednesday, became more deeply schismatic after that searing experience. Most
of its leaders achieved political maturity during the 1980s, when the Tories
enjoyed 100-plus majorities. They have found Parliament more difficult to
manage with the small and dwindling majority won in spring 1992. Mr Major
would have resigned a few months later if he had lost the vote on the bill
to ratify the Maastricht treaty, or last week if he had failed to win the
vote on an increase in European Union funds. The government shrank from
privatising the Post Office because, as it admitted, it did not command the
necessary parliamentary support.
It is moving in a world of shifting coalitions, familiar in other European
countries and the US, but alien to the English mind. Whitehall is horrified
at the prospect of power sharing. Yet on one issue the government must gain
the support of Ulster Unionists; on a second it must declare a vote of
confidence to avoid defeat; on a third it is obliged to engineer a further
turn of the ratchet towards the Eurosceptics. Mr Major's posture on the EU,
his arms around its heart while he kicks it in the shins, is increasingly
difficult to sustain. Mr Kenneth Clarke's cunning Budget plan, building up
indirect taxes today in order to bribe the voters with cuts in income tax
next year, would make sense if the Tories were united, but plainly they are
not.
Previous lost budgetary votes are an unreliable guide to what happens now.
Labour lost a clutch of them in 1977. It was turfed out two years later.
In 1981 Lord Howe, then chancellor, raised several taxes, but was defeated
by a Labour amendment that deleted an increase in the duty on diesel. He
responded by increasing other imposts. Yet the most triumphant years of the
Thatcher government of which he was then a pillar followed.
Mr Major's present situation undoubtedly bears a closer resemblance to that
of the Callaghan administration of 1978-79 than it does to the Thatcher
ministry of the early 1980s. The last Labour government struggled on, with
the help of Ulster votes, past everyone's patience. It is possible, but
increasingly less likely, that the Tories will manage to do the same.

So Patrick Minford is back in favour. Margaret Thatcher's erstwhile
economics mentor is not only well dug in as a member of the Treasury's panel
of economic advisers, but is now poised to receive Pounds 120,000 of
government money to help out over the next four years with his economic
modelling activities.
Minford, who caught the Iron Lady's eye in the 1970s with his theories about
free-market economics, was summarily dropped from the Economic and Social
Research Council's funding list in 1990. He began to fret that his ideas
were, well, insufficiently appreciated by the mainstream.
Not that he is letting this new-found largesse go to his head. The monies
will be put to reasonably eccentric use - for one thing, towards hooking up
with a Cray supercomputer at the government's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory
in Oxfordshire.
Undeterred by the fact that such machines are normally the preserve of
nuclear scientists or aircraft engineers rather than of practitioners of the
dismal science, Minford reckons he can harness their massive power to figure
out knotty little problems of trade flows and the role of markets in the
world economy. He's even christened his baby in suitably user-unfriendly
terms. Roll on the 'computable general equilibrium model'.

John Major's ministers cast around for ways in which a Conservative
government can curb 'unjustified' pay awards without being made to look too
foolish.
Meanwhile, an ad appears in the national press for the first time for a
Whitehall vacancy at permanent secretary level (in this instance at the
Department of Employment), illustrating a rather different problem. Who do
Michael Portillo and others expect to find to manage 'a programme and
administrative expenditure totalling Pounds 4.6bn and 58,000 staff' at a
salary of just Pounds 95,000 'subject to review'.
While the analogy of a top civil servant with the chief executive of a
public company may be less than complete, the ad states that the successful
candidate 'will have worked at (or near) the top of a large private or
public sector organisation'. Hence the relevance of the order of
remuneration of, say, Tony Greener, chairman of Guinness: turnover in 1993,
Pounds 4.66bn (though staff of only just over 23,000); remuneration Pounds
648,000.

Some light relief at last for Russian TV viewers less than wholly addicted
to a gruesome Saturday evening series entitled Catastrophes of the Week, an
undiluted diet of terrible accidents and human tragedies.
The bright spot is New Year's eve, when the schedule promises a Russian
version of the UK programme Spitting Image and its rubber puppets created to
demolish the publicly pompous. Called Kukly - Puppets - the show will
constitute a reprise of 1994, with star turns from the likes of Viktor
Gerashchenko, hapless former governor of the central bank axed after
October's rouble crisis. The mayor of Moscow, Yury Luzhkov, is also promised
an outing. With his attachment to undertaking forays into the city's sewage
system, he must be a parodist's gift.

Not many places you can get 10 per cent interest on as little as a fiver
these days. Of course, there's a catch. The myriad hoarders of small sums in
glass jars and bedroom drawers around the Irish Republic have created a
shortage of small coins. Which is apparently a serious business over the
hectic Christmas period. So the short-changed banks are now offering a 10
per cent bounty for one and two pence coins, counted and bagged and with a
minimum value of IPounds 5. Canny leprechauns should start collecting now -

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
European Commission president Jacques Delors has finally revealed that he
has made up his mind whether to run for the French presidency. Trouble is,
he failed to divulge the nature of his decision.
Tantalised Delorologists fell on a single cryptic statement. It was
suggested he might feel he was betraying the French left by failing to
stand, to which Delors replied: 'I have always done my duty . . . it's an
eminently personal decision that depends only on my own conscience.'
No one could agree what that meant. For some, the reference to 'duty' meant
that he would run; he has already said that, if he made a bid for the
Elysee, it would be 'out of duty'. Others homed in on the word 'personal' -
a telling reference, they felt, to the family implications for a 69-year-old
of a seven-year commitment after a gruelling decade running Europe.
Some of Delors' closest advisers remain convinced he will not run. But
Delors' widening lead in the opinion polls over potential Gaullist rivals
like Jacques Chirac and Edouard Balladur clearly puts increasing pressure on
him to throw his hat in the ring. So when will he put the pundits out of
their misery? Well, he is due to appear on French prime-time TV on Sunday.
Until then, they will have to content themselves with feeding on the most
substantial indicator of presidential intent so far. Last Friday, when
visiting the Elysee, Delors eschewed his usual foreign-made car for a
Renault.

FT  07 DEC 94 / A nice little earner: The UK's nuclear levy, a redundant
tax, should be allowed to lapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A little-noticed aspect of the review that the UK government is currently
conducting of the nuclear power industry concerns the so-called nuclear
levy.
This surcharge on electricity bills for decommissioning old nuclear power
stations, which brings in Pounds 1.2bn a year, is supposed to expire in
1998. But it is hard to see the Treasury - or any of the other potential
beneficiaries - allowing such a nice little earner to lapse without a
struggle.
The levy was introduced when the government created Nuclear Electric to own
and run nuclear power stations in England and Wales in 1989. It gave the
company responsibility for decommissioning them, but not enough money to pay
for the job. Instead, it instituted a temporary levy on electricity bills to
raise Pounds 8.5bn over 10 years. The levy is set each year by the
electricity industry regulator and is currently 10 per cent, but because
receipts are behind schedule it may have to be raised next year.
(This means, incidentally, that when the government introduced value added
tax on home energy bills earlier this year, it began to tax the levy as well
 -a clever way of compounding tax revenues. If VAT goes up to 17.5 per cent
next April, VAT revenues attributable to the levy will be more than Pounds
200m.)
Although the levy is supposed to end in 1998, it is questionable whether any
government - Conservative or Labour - will allow this handy form of taxation
to lapse. Even if Nuclear Electric's need for it were to disappear, there
are would be those arguing against cancelling the levy itself.
Imagine for a moment what would happen if the levy was cancelled, they would
say. Straightaway, electricity bills would fall by more than 10 per cent.
While that may seem a good thing, the present government is committed to
pushing the cost of energy up - not down - to curb demand and reduce the
environmental impact of power generation.
And, in any case, underlying electricity prices are falling as the benefits
of privatisation finally begin to work their way through. So there is
actually a case for saying that taxation of energy bills should not merely
be preserved but increased to support the objectives of current policy.
But though the environmental case for propping up energy prices is strong,
that is not the reason why the Treasury may want to keep the levy. Here,
after all, is a revenue-raising measure that is in place, that is collected
automatically and that people will notice only if it disappears.
For those who would retain the levy after 1998, the only point for
discussion is whether the proceeds should in future be fed straight into the
Treasury's coffers or whether, being a specific revenue measure, they should
be spent on a specific cause.
The latter course is the one currently generating the greatest interest.
Already the would-be recipients include the renewable energy lobby, which
wants more subsidies for wind farms and landfill gas projects, and the
coal-fired power generators, which want help to clean up dirty stations.
There is also the ill-starred Energy Saving Trust that was supposed to be
spearheading the government's campaign against energy waste. It has so far
been short of funds because of the refusal of gas and electricity regulators
to authorise even more levies on home energy bills to pay for it.
The argument over the future of the levy is therefore likely to provide the
unedifying spectacle of government struggling to justify preserving a
redundant tax.
We shall be treated to sonorous warnings from the Department of the
Environment on the need for greater energy efficiency. Junior Treasury
ministers will talk of the extraordinary difficulty (for technical reasons)
of cancelling a taxation measure. The Department of Trade and Industry will
highlight the business opportunities that should arise from whatever new use
the levy proceeds are put to. All this will be said with a straight face.
But no one will be fooled. Governments do not readily cut taxes, even though
that is precisely what they should do in this case.
The only sensible course is to allow the levy to lapse. The Treasury does
not currently budget for the proceeds, and a firm statement of intent now
would make it harder for this or a future chancellor to start factoring them
into his revenue calculations.
True, energy prices would fall, and that will encourage waste. But one of
the main purposes of electricity and gas privatisation was to bring down
energy costs and benefit the economy at large.
If broader policy requires energy prices to be raised, this should be done
through plain and open taxation, rather than by a residual measure that was
created for a wholly different purpose.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Extending the EU eastwards
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is five years since the the end of the Soviet empire in eastern Europe.
But western Europe has still not recovered from the shock. Members of the
European Union have been timid, where eastern Europeans have been heroic.
Judged by the 'pre-accession strategy' for the associated countries of
central and eastern Europe, to be discussed at the meeting of the European
Council in Essen this week, the EU still fails to appreciate the urgency of
the challenge.
This does not mean that the EU has done nothing. At the Copenhagen summit in
1993, the European Council 'agreed that the associated countries in central
and eastern Europe that so desire shall become members of the European
Union. Accession will take place as soon as an associated country is able to
assume the obligations of membership by satisfying the economic and
political conditions required.' In addition, the 'Europe Agreements' have
committed the EU to industrial free trade with Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,
Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. Slovenia and the Baltic republics are
expected to join quite soon.
Yet this is insufficient either to provide adequate encouragement to reform
in eastern Europe now, or to ensure a smooth transition to membership of the
EU later on. The fundamental failure has been an unwillingness to recognise
what is at stake. The mission of the EU is neither to protect European
farmers, nor to succour European steel mills, nor to transfer the odd tens
of billions of Ecu from rich members to poorer ones. It is to integrate
Europe. The fall of the Soviet empire was not an annoying interruption, but
what made this feasible at last.
The enlargement of Nato is, happily, a side issue. Extension of the
opportunities afforded by a prosperous market economy will integrate and
stabilise the two halves of divided Europe, as it once did the divided and
impoverished west. This task is not similar to the challenge posed by north
Africa, partly because these countries will never join the EU.
Free trade
The EU should start by providing industrial free trade to eastern Europe
now. If EU competition policy is adopted by these countries, it should also
eschew anti-dumping and other forms of contingent protection. And it should
insist that liberalisation by these partners towards the EU be extended,
automatically, to one another, in order to avoid the emergence of a
discriminatory 'hub-and-spoke' relationship.
Eastern Europeans need secure market access if they are to attract more
foreign direct investment. For this reason, they must be protected from EU
contingent protection, particularly since their exports are concentrated in
'sensitive sectors'. The EU should remember that, in 1992, it enjoyed a
surplus of Dollars 13bn in manufactures with eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union. Total imports of manufactures from all these countries were
less than 60 per cent of imports from Switzerland alone. The terror felt by
EU member states - demonstrated by the fact that the Europe Agreements
contain seven safeguard clauses - is pathological.
Preconditions
The second requirement is a statement of the preconditions for accession,
particularly of how and when the candidate states are to apply the acquis
communautaire. Those preconditions should not, as the statement from leading
European economists published today by London's Centre for Economic Policy
Research rightly argues, include conditions EU members themselves do not
meet.
The third - and most difficult - requirement is to change the EU. A study by
Prof Richard Baldwin for the CEPR concluded that by the end of the century
the net budgetary cost of enlargement might be 70 per cent of the planned
budget. This may be an exaggeration. But it would still be less than 1 per
cent of the EU's total GDP. What is needed is cuts in spending, particularly
on agriculture (perhaps by nationalising most compensation payments) and
some increase in revenue.
Whatever happens in the meantime, accession negotiations should be started
directly after the inter-governmental conference in 1996. Even if those
negotiations were completed swiftly, there would, no doubt, be a lengthy and
well-defined period of transition. Such a period is precisely what is needed
by both sides. Why should the most advanced countries not have finished that
transition by 2005? Sixteen years from the end of communism to the first
full memberships does not seem unduly hasty.
The EU is a creature of timetables. It should commit itself now to a date
for opening membership negotiations, along with a statement of what will
need to happen if they are to be concluded satisfactorily.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: What should the ratio be of top to
low wages?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr FRANK BLACKABY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is one of the curiosities of current economic debate that basic
questions are no longer asked, for instance, how can we get a more sensible
distribution of the labour input needed by a modern economy? Why have
recessions?
Here is another current example - what spread of earnings is needed in a big
company, from cleaner to chief executive, to provide adequate incentives? Is
the ratio 1 to 30, 1 to 50, 1 to 100, or what? Does it have to keep moving
up towards 1 to infinity?
It is a question which the incestuous remuneration committees of large
companies never ask - incestuous, because the non-executive director of
company A is likely to be the chief executive of company B, so that anything
which pushes up top salaries will be to his advantage when his turn comes
round. All we have are highly selected comparisons usually with Americans,
never with Japanese, where the spread from bottom to top is much smaller.
Actually, high pay probably makes chief executives lazier - once they have
bought their yachts, they have to spend time on them.
If there is to be a cabinet sub-committee on this question, perhaps one
member of it might raise this simple basic question - what should the ratio
be?

FT  07 DEC 94 / Alarming instrument of financial change: A look at corporate
concerns over derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a disquieting few days for the thousands of corporate treasurers
who buy the complex financial instruments called derivatives.
Concern over derivatives - instruments that derive their value from that of
an underlying asset or financial index - has been mounting after a series of
losses involving them at companies and investment funds.
This week, it emerged that Bankers Trust, the US bank that pioneered
derivatives, has agreed with the supervisors of the New York Federal Reserve
to tighten internal controls over its business. The supervisors say that
this is not part of a wider crackdown, but want it to be seen as a warning
to other banks not to be over-zealous in selling derivatives. Meanwhile, a
study published on Monday found that few companies monitor their derivatives
risks as expertly as they might.
These events are already having an impact on treasurers, who increasingly
use financial derivatives at least in a simple form. There can be few boards
of directors, or chief executives, who have not sent urgent requests to
their finance directors and treasurers to find out what arcane instruments
they may have bought, and why.
Regulators and politicians have fretted over the rapid growth in derivatives
for the past two years; the banks that trade in them have tried to improve
their internal risk management systems to avoid unexpected losses. But the
burden of concern is now shifting to buyers of derivatives.
There are two broad purposes for which companies and other investing funds
use derivatives. First is to hedge risks, the reason given by banks in
marketing the products. A company that has borrowed at variable interest
rates can protect itself against rises in rates by swapping into fixed rate
obligations. A similar approach can be adopted to minimise exchange rate
risks.
Second is the use that has received the most publicity this year, and the
one to which derivatives have been put by many fund managers. This is to
amplify the effect of bets on the future direction of bond and currency
markets. Most well-known cases of derivatives losses this year  - such as
those of the US companies Gibson Greetings and Procter &amp; Gamble - have
involved such bets on future interest rates.
Derivatives can be used to increase potential profits - and losses - of bets
by leveraging the sum invested. Investors usually have to pay the full value
of a conventional security when they buy it. But most derivative contracts
allow them to pay money only when the contracts show a loss, and receive it
when they show a profit. This allows a fund to take much bigger positions
with the same amount of capital.
However, investors do not have to use derivatives to leverage investments,
as some recent cases have shown. The paper loss of Dollars 1.5bn on an
Dollars 8bn investment fund reported last weekend by Orange County in
California was initially suspected to have arisen from buying derivatives.
The loss forced the resignation of Mr Robert Citron, its treasurer.
In fact, Mr Citron used other forms of leverage, borrowing some Dollars 12bn
through securities repurchase agreements, and then buying a type of security
that paid a higher investment return as interest rates fell. The securities
 -known as 'inverse floating rate notes' - share characteristics with
derivatives, but are not in the same category. Mr Citron was taking
leveraged investment risk without derivatives.
Such cases are used by bankers to argue that derivatives have been unfairly
blamed for losses, since they are only one of several ways of making
leveraged bets. Some boards of directors have been more worried about their
treasuries adopting high-risk investment strategies than whether they use
derivatives to do so.
A study by the Group of Thirty, a Washington-based group of senior bankers,
this week found that managers are now trying to monitor their treasury
operations more closely. More now review risk management policies than 18
months ago, when the public debate over the use of derivatives started to
grow. Others plan to implement stricter internal controls within the next
year, as well as introducing fresh risk management guidelines.
But there is a second cause for unease, which applies strongly to
derivatives: that even treasuries of companies may not fully understand the
risks they are taking. The G30 study found that only 8 per cent of users
said they had adopted the 'value at risk' method of calculating how much
they stood to lose from market movements when buying derivatives - a method
used by sophisticated traders to monitor their portfolios.
This has disturbing implications, if companies that think they are using
derivatives for hedging purposes find they are taking a much riskier
leveraged bet on which the losses could be substantial. The issue will be at
the heart of the legal action by Procter &amp; Gamble over a Dollars 200m
leveraged interest rate swap it was sold by Bankers Trust. The company
argues that it was not given enough information to understand fully the
product or the true risks involved.
If more users carried out complex tests on derivatives portfolios - such as
'stress tests' showing price movements in conditions of market volatility -
it would make it easier to avoid unwanted risks. Not all companies buying
derivatives need do so. Some only buy a few, quite simple, products, which
means it is unlikely to be worth emulating the risk management models of the
biggest banks.
But an obstacle for big users that want to improve their risk management is
that they cannot get access to banks' privately developed software for
valuing derivatives. 'If multinationals are hesitant, it is not lack of
goodwill,' says Mr Alexander von Ungern-Sternberg, an executive
vice-president of Deutsche Bank. 'They clearly want these tools, and I think
it is something that will develop next year.'
More information is becoming public. The bank JP Morgan has recently
published a database of market volatility that it uses in its own risk
models. But few buyers can yet rival the sellers' expertise. Until they do,
the latest rash of losses among fund managers and companies is likely to
make them even more wary about trusting the word of derivatives dealers over
whether they should buy the latest 'perfect hedge'.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Performance funding flaws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Despite the enthusiasm voiced by Training and Enterprise Councils for
greater performance-related funding for government schemes (The Budget:
'Tecs hail funding change as boost for unemployed', December 1) those
organisations which actually deliver training for the unemployed are less
convinced.
Performance-related funding is already set at 40 per cent for most such
organisations. Those which support the most disadvantaged among the
unemployed report that this system forces them to think increasingly
selectively about who they can afford to take on. Tecs will no doubt insist
that they now weight payments to take account of this. But their definition
of 'special needs' can often be a narrow one.
Essentially, performance-related funding assumes the unemployed are making
rational decisions in a rational labour market.
No allowance is made for trainees who fail an exam, for those who simply
walk away before completing a course, or for the possibility that there
simply may be no job vacancies at the end.
Training providers have to pay the price for this fantasy, knowing there is
a perfectly justifiable case for paying them on the training weeks they
deliver on behalf of Tecs.

<BYLINE>
   From S W MOREL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The letter from Richard V Giordano, chairman of British Gas, (December
1) in defence of Mr Cedric Brown's salary increase, illustrates in admirable
fashion the arrogance with which top British management treats both its
shareholders and public alike.
As an average shareholder, a retired university science professor who worked
overseas in poverty-stricken countries, I am expected to vote every year for
the directors of the 30 large companies in which I have invested my savings.
In one year alone Mr Cedric Brown's salary rise is equivalent to a
lifetime's savings and was 'fixed' by a remuneration committee of gentlemen
who have joined the club of 'you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours'.
I no longer feel that I can vote for a government that taxes such salaries
at only 40 per cent.
I now make a habit of putting a cross against the re-election of any
director of the companies in which I invest unless their remuneration is
reasonable, the company profitable and dividends adequate. And I advise
fellow shareholders to use their votes in a similar fashion.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From D R MYDDELTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, According to your report 'Stock market bar to China pension funds'
(December 1), the Chinese finance ministry is banning pension funds from
investing in stock markets on the grounds that they are too risky.
Instead the government is stipulating that 80 per cent of pension funds
should be spent on 'safe instruments', namely treasury bonds.
I seem to remember a similar rule in this country after the war.
Unfortunately, due to currency debasement, the real value of UK government
securities fell by about 75 per cent in the 15 years between 1946 and 1961.
Quoted equities, in contrast, rose in real terms.
No doubt they meant well; but the fact remains that the interference of the
gentlemen in Whitehall caused very large real losses to British pensioners.
I do hope these pensioners fare better.
I wonder if there's a lesson here? Government officials can always offer
advice to people, and I'm sure it will be gratefully received.
Using the age-old maxim caveat emptor we can then choose for ourselves. But
some of us don't like being told what to do.

contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From PETER MCGREGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Cadbury committee was supposed to have taken a good look at
corporate governance in the UK.
But there still seems to be a good deal of free-floating anxiety on the part
of shareholders, and especially institutional shareholders, about some
issues, currently the length and nature of directors' contracts and the size
of their salaries.
This is another matter which could be handled much more effectively if we
had a continental-style two-board system, to which Cadbury paid inadequate
attention.
The single board has few virtues and enables executive management to do what
it wants.
It is time that shareholders had a more effective voice, as the Germans
discovered when they introduced their two-board system in the last century.

Sir, The chairman of British Gas will be aware that the remuneration of the
boards of public companies has soared over the past 10 years, rising far
more than the increase in the value of share capital or the remuneration of
other valuable members of society.
The rise reflects the growth in power of financial institutions and the
interrelationship between the two. Private individuals, not financial
institutions, are the real shareholders of public companies.
I doubt whether many accept as necessary the current remunerations.
However, to obtain tax relief nearly all Peps and pensions have to be
channelled through financial institutions and these take over the voting
rights. The power of the institutions can be seen in their management fee:
only 0.5 per cent to 0.75 per cent typically in the early 1970s, but,
despite computerisation, nearer 1.5 per cent now.
To ensure genuine control of public companies, individuals should be allowed
to obtain the tax concessions from direct investments.
Also institutions, as trustees, should be required legally to be responsive
to the views of the owners of funds.
Unless such steps are taken the boards will continue to take an increasing
proportion of our wealth because, to end with a seasonable note, turkeys do
not vote for Christmas.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Nothing unusual in BAe accounting
policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From RICHARD LAPTHORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Many things concerned me about your article 'VSEL's suitors fight a war
of whispers' published on December 5.
In particular:
It is wrong to suggest that many substantial companies do not treat pension
fund prepayments as assets.
I cite the following that do so: Shell, BP, Glaxo, Marks and Spencer,
Unilever, RTZ and GrandMet.
It is wrong to suggest that many substantial companies do not treat as
assets undepreciated launch costs.
Boeing, Rolls-Royce, Aerospatiale, Saab Scania, United Technologies,
McDonnell Douglas and Fokker all carry forward such costs.
It is wrong to suggest that there is anything unusual in the BAe treatment
of capitalised rationalisation costs.
These items relate to expected costs in bringing to a suitable condition for
development the development land stock owned by Arlington Securities.
Our treatment is appropriate and expressly approved by SSAP 9 para. 19 (c).
Your treatment of the above three points is not only incorrect, but taken as
whole contains the extremely damaging implication that BAe's balance sheet
assets are being inflated by means of questionable accounting policies.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Slow but sure progress on electricity
liberalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL K LYONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial on 'Electricity gridlock' (December 5) raises a number
of interesting points, but fails to recognise that progress is being made
after several years of stalemate. The two energy councils in 1994 have led
to a positive and formal accord among member states on two of the three main
parts of the electricity liberalisation directive.
On the third key area - competition in national markets - the Commission has
already tried to resist the French concept of the single buyer, as you
suggest, since it was put forward earlier this year as an alternative to
third party access. However, negotiations in the council on an internal
electricity market have been so difficult, for all the reasons you mention,
that the member states are anxious to find solutions, even if they are far
from perfect.
At last week's energy council, they asked the Commission to look more
carefully at the anticipated consequences of the side-by-side application of
third party access and the single buyer system. The Commission is therefore
bound to make an objective study and report back to the council.
Your article also touches on the need for regulation and the possibility of
an energy chapter. There is a crucial point here about the UK government's
position. The UK has argued forcibly for an internal energy market, yet has
refused to countenance any new Union competences in energy.
As the only member state more or less self-sufficient in energy resources,
this stance may be all too clear. But, how can the UK expect the Union to
sign up to an open and liberal market in energy and not recognise the
legitimate concerns of other member states to have some joint EU safeguards
for security and stability of supply to customers?

FT  07 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Fat salaries for the big league
players carry personal risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms IRENE INNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Regarding the 75 per cent pay increase to British Gas's chief
executive, the reason why the increase is so high is that public-sector top
management pay is so low in comparison with similar jobs elsewhere.
Even spreading the increase over three years would have provoked a public
outcry. Attention is drawn because Cedric Brown is a long-serving employee.
Had someone been recruited from outside, no one would have raised an
eyebrow. It is therefore a one-off.
If, however, Mr Brown does not perform at the level his new salary demands
then inbuilt penalties should be invoked. High salaries for big league
players carry high personal risk.

Sir, Regarding the article 'Drugs claim on Gibraltar border' (December 3-4),
while the Spanish government's apparent concern about illicit smuggling into
Spain is admirable, its own efforts to control a substantial black economy
and, in particular, illegal money laundering activities via the
Franco-Spanish frontiers is shameful.
What is remarkable is the extent to which this activity has fuelled a
mini-property boom in neighbouring Biarritz in the midst of a deep economic
recession.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Arts: A Christmas Carol - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To see Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol onstage is to know again, with a
frisson of joy, how theatrical its author's instincts were.
What, I wonder, would he have made of the coup de theatre with which the
Royal Shakespeare Company's new version of A Christmas Carol opens? The
panoramic view of London in dark silhouette, dominated by the dome of St
Paul's, lifts yards into the sky - and, from the blackness beneath, there
emerge people, also in black: in Bible black, indeed, for Marley's funeral.
I hope Dickens would have marvelled at all this, and at much that follows in
Ian Judge's staging of John Mortimer's new adaptation.
This Christmas Carol, following the haunting RSC precedent of Trevor Nunn's
Nicholas Nickleby, proceeds on three main levels: as a series of stage
pictures, as a stage elucidation of Dickens's text, and as a collage of
Victorian Christmas music. Sometimes the three come thrillingly together: as
when Scrooge snuffs out the Spirit of Christmas Past. We see the conical
snuffing-cap pushing the Spirit down into (and through) the ground; we
follow Scrooge's exhausting travail much as Dickens described it; and
meanwhile the scene is watched by a chorus of Victorians in black, who sing
'Hark the herald angels sing' with warning fierceness. The melodramatic
excitement, the psychological intensity, the sense of Christmas as a
jubilantly lyrical experience that is being threatened by Scrooge - all
these are there together.
Visually, the production is consistently excellent - thanks in particular to
John Gunter's set, Deirdre Clancy's costumes, and Nigel Levings's lighting.
Verbally, Mortimer's text is first-rate; he is plainly in love with Dickens
as both sound and sense. And so are most of Judge's RSC actors, most of them
playing several roles each. A pity that he lets them make too little of some
lines (Scrooge 'carried his own low temperature always about with him') and
some episodes (Belle breaking off her engagement to a younger Scrooge). But
where the production is more frequently flawed is with Nigel Hess's music.
Most of the onstage singing is weak, but the taped music and orchestrations
are worse. The difference a few live instruments - - and less amplification
 -would make] As an arranger, he could have struck more gold from his
material; but since his material is mainly the classic Christmas carols we
all know, the perfect Dickensian fusion of generosity and sentiment is
achieved now and then.
Clive Francis is a first-rate Scrooge, an antique crustacean who manages to
glow friskily once he learns to drop his shell. Paul Greenwood and Polly
James do good work as the tender Cratchit parents, as do Philip Quast and
Sara Weymouth as Scrooge's laughing nephew and his wife, Cherry Morris and
Peter Warnock as the bubbling old Fezziwigs. The Spirit of Christmas Present
(John Kane) is too bombastic, and Christmas past (Stephen Jean) too mild;
they should be Virgil to Scrooge's Dante. Marley's ghost - so plainly
modelled on Hamlet's papa - is over-miked and under-chained.
But the 18-foot Christmas Yet To Come, hooded and cloaked like a Grim Reaper
with only two skeletal claws visible, is splendid. The party scenes are all
infectious. And the finale, with snow falling through the hovering Christmas
trees and rooftops onto the cast, whose black attire is now illumined by
scarlet winter scarves, is ideal.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Arts: An alternative 'Nutcracker' - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even before those dread wailings at the door - Marley's Ghost? No: Carol
singers - the festive season announces itself with a first Nutcracker.
Happily, Adventures in Motion Pictures' irreverent re-working avoids most of
the care-worn elements of the story - one more smirking stage-tot
registering delight at the sight of a Christmas tree and I take seriously to
drink - and turns the tale jokily upside down. No cosy Biedermeier household
but a grim children's home; Drosselmeyer as Himmler; Clara in danger of
losing her Nutcracker beau to a skating sex-bomb.
AMP's staging is, we are told, in its last season. Which is a pity. I
reported with pleasure on its Edinburgh Festival creation two years ago, and
on last year's revival. It is still entertaining on its current outing at
Sadler's Wells, and stage successes being as rare as they are for modern
dance, I would urge mothballs rather than the knacker's yard.
Matthew Bourne's production cocks snooks in the best fashion, sending up the
ideas of a Victorian orphanage, Dickensian merriment - I love the way the
pauperish decorations are whisked away as soon as benign visitors leave the
orphanage - and the dire and sugary divertissements of Ye Olde Nutcracker
itself.
This year AMP again fields some of its original cast. Etta Murfitt is a
touchingly tough Clara, and Andrew George looms large as the Nutcracker of
her dreams (and just what those dreams are we surmise from his ultimate
occupancy of her bed). I also enjoy Barry Atkinson's vicious Dr Dross with
his bruise-a-kiddie philosophy.
The staging is polished, speedy, well performed, and includes a neat
complement of snide jokes, not least the boy orphan who wants a doll and
gets a football.
Bourne's dances are bright, clever for the generality of the action - he
maintains a brisk pace - but he is defeated by Tchaikovsky's greatest
moments. To make sense of the sublimities of the adagio after the
mouse-battle, of the snowflake waltz and the great pas de deux, needs
stronger dancers and more searching dances. (The score, in a skilled
reduction, sounds well with the New London Orchestra under Ronald Corp).
It is, all in all, a jolly evening, and can be seen as an inoculation
against the conventional Nutcrackers that are massed on the dance-horizon,
rich with menace and sweeties and optimistic choreography and performance.
More, I suppose, of all that anon.
Staging sponsored by The Kobler Trust. At Sadler's Wells until December 10.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Arts: National Theatre announces 1995 programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Eyre confirmed yesterday that he was quitting as director of the
Royal National Theatre in 1997. He described his years there as 'the time of
my life'. If there was a downside it was the 'blocked lavatory syndrome':
being responsible for holes in the carpet as well as artistic excellence.
'Running the National is like grief - you can never shake it off'.
He looks forward to directing films as well as plays, and to writing. There
is always the possibility of another big job - like chairing the Arts
Council for a Labour government?
Meantime, he announced the 1995 programme. Former RSC director Terry Hands'
makes his debut at the National, with Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of
Windsor, with Dennis Quilley as Falstaff. Then comes Richard Wilson and John
Alderton in Joe Orton's What the Butler Saw. Dylan Thomas's Under Milk Wood
appears, and there is a return to the bigger Lyttelton stage from the
Cottesloe of Peter Brook's production of The Man Who. In May David Hare's
new play, a three hander with Michael Gambon, opens at the Cottesloe while
at the Lyttelton Rodney Ackland's 1945 play Absolute Hell is revived, with
Judi Dench repeating her 1992 television success.
The summer sees Eduardo de Filippo's La Grande Magia, directed by Eyre, and
Volpone with Michael Gambon. The year's musical, subsidised by Cameron
Mackintosh, is Sondheim's A Little Night Music. The year ends with Fiona
Shaw in Congreve's The Way of the World and a co-production with Tara Arts
of Cyrano de Bergerac.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Arts: Go tell it to the Martians - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Figures published last week by the Church of England show that in 1991-92
only 2.3 per cent of the population was attending Anglican churches. So if
97 per cent of the population now stays away, why do the mass media devote
so much time to church matters, from women priests to the 'politically
correct' Bible? A good question but for another column. Television which,
even in the days of the 'god slot', rarely concerned itself with religious
belief, much preferring to have Harry Secombe sing a nice song, now pays
virtually no attention to the central tenets of religion - faith, the
divine, self denial - favouring instead either programmes designed to
comfort the elderly or series concerned with ethics.
It has been said that when people stop believing in god they do not start
believing in nothing but in anything. Sure enough British television
channels are now competing to show programmes which pander to a rapidly
broadening spectrum of increasingly daft ideas, ranging from poltergeists to
'angelic intervention'. If you object to BBC1 featuring an alleged psychic
in the opening programme of the British national lottery you are likely to
be called a killjoy. If you suggest that an ITV series purporting to show
hypnotism on screen is not only highly questionable (if hypnosis made yellow
objects invisible to the subject of Monday's programme, why did he not see
straight through the close-fitting yellow suit of the man who was
'levitating' the bottle to the body beneath?) but also possibly dangerous,
you will be told 'It's only a bit of fun'.
But is it really a bit of fun when television begins to pursue the
irrational with as much, or more, enthusiasm than the rational? On Sunday
last week BBC2's Timewatch devoted 50 minutes to the theory that the sphinx
is much older than the pyramids: 'A radical new view of history, pushing the
dawn of civilisation back by thousands of years'. It began with a seemingly
reasonable argument about the speed of weathering, the claim being that the
sphinx was more deeply eroded than the pyramids because it was much older.
In the letters column of The Times one writer pointed out that the sphinx
was buried in the sand for much of its history and, unlike the pyramids, its
limestone could thus have been eroded by the slow seepage of water. Another
reminded us that the pyramids were originally 'streamlined' in a cladding of
finely dressed limestone thus avoiding erosion.
How could the Timewatch team be so inefficient as to overlook such seemingly
obvious and telling arguments? That is hardly the point, as anyone who saw
how the programme ended will have realised. Having relied, up to then, on
John West, a tour guide with no qualifications in archaeology or anything
else, whose method was described as 'part psychic intuition, part
showmanship', they finally turned to a man named Richard Hoagland. He showed
us a photo of the surface of Mars with what could have been an odd smudge
or, if you had a powerful imagination, a large stone carving of a head in
the desert. So it seems the big question is: was Egypt's sphinx built by
Martians? Timewatch used to be a reliable, generally admirable, series. What
on earth is going on?
Next day Horizon, an older and even more highly regarded series, spent 50
minutes on a subject which America's pulp paperbacks and screaming tabloids
have been exploiting for decades: abduction by aliens. Millions of Americans
(mostly women, judging from this programme) claim to have been whisked away
to flying saucers by little grey men so Horizon happily trotted around and
interviewed a few of these poor people. They assured us they were not
dreaming, they really did 'inter-act with these beings', and if not a single
one of the capsules which the aliens habitually stuff up human noses has
ever been found that is simply because they are all sneezed out and . . .
and what? And lost in the fluff under the bed presumably. Presenter Dr Sue
Blackmore suggested that belief in alien abduction could best be explained
by sleep paralysis or temporal lobe seizure, hence, it may be said, no
irrationality on the part of Horizon. But is this really the most important
thing for Britain's oldest science series to be spending its money on?
Next day, Tuesday, BBC1 screened Natural Neighbours. The billing asked 'Can
we talk to the dolphins? Do they have the power to heal our bodies and our
minds?' and the narration began by describing the dolphin as 'this mystical
animal'. Once again American women loomed large among the believers who were
seen jumping off a motorboat in the Bahamas to swim among dolphins and then
return to declare how good they felt. It was, to say the least, unfortunate
that in the case of the most extreme example, a 17-year-old English girl
said to be suffering from ME, we were shown just seven seconds of her and
her dolphin together in the water, during which time she did not seem aware
that he was behind her. Not to worry, though, the girl assured us 'I didn't
have to tell him I was ill'. Anyone who has kept a horse knows there can be
a remarkable degree of communication between man and animal. Anyone who has
seen the effect of an affectionate dog on a geriatric ward knows that an
animal can make the ill feel better. But dolphins healing our bodies? What
is the BBC coming to?
Nothing quite as extreme or as silly as ITV. On Friday's Strange But True?
Michael Aspel first gave us ghosts: not only the Phantom Monk Of The
Stockbridge By-pass but also the ghosts of the children who might have been
killed in an ancient mining disaster and now chose to dance in circles among
the electricity pylons. To illustrate this, Aspel had film of them doing it.
Well perhaps not film of the actual ghosts; as throughout the whole history
of the camera, this programme seems to have been unable to get any authentic
photos of ghosts, so they did a nice reconstruction. OK, a nice
construction. Well all right, a rather naff and silly bit of invention
designed to appeal to the credulous. In the second half we had an account by
yet another American woman of how her male partner fell down a cliff and was
killed while she somehow arrived at the bottom unharmed. Angelic
intervention, she reckoned. No one was rude enough to ask 'How come the
angels dropped your bloke?'
Of course there is no denying that material of this sort attracts big
audiences. It seems that many people need the irrational in their lives:
deprive them of supernatural beings called 'gods' and they will jump at the
chance to hear about supernatural animals or superior beings from other
planets. Television which is now concerned first and foremost with ratings
can therefore be expected to offer more and more of this claptrap.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Arts: Children behaving badly - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a seaside town live four girl friends: mid-teens, tough-talking,
hardbitten. It is an occasional pastime of theirs to lure some solitary man,
kick him to the ground and rob him. They are used to being taken in by the
police for cautioning, and they have come to know Daniel, a fanciable
policeman; one or two of them have already shagged him, and others want to.
What they do not know is that he is a women's-shoe fetishist whose libido is
draining steadily away into his kink. This causes misunderstandings, and
eventually some gory, entirely predictable trouble.
The Royal Court Theatre Upstairs,like indeed the Royal Court, has been here
often before, as far back as Edward Bond's Saved: children of a demoralised
working-class behaving badly. In Judy Upton's new play Ashes and Sand, which
won this year's George Devine Award, slaggish young Hayley gets a speech
ringingly addressed to nobody in particular - ie us - which says it's all
because there are no jobs and nothing to do. That may well be so.
Ms Upton, however, lacks Bond's hard, dry eloquence. The girls mostly talk
punk-demotic, without frills, and the cops television-speak; but from time
to time some sentence emerges which is so clankingly articulate and stilted
as to fall stone dead upon the ear. Directed by Ian Rickson, the coven all
work hard at being BAD, without quite silencing echoes of St. Trinian's.
Superficially, Susan Lynch's vocally abrasive Hayley might seem a piece of
rolling-eyed, overstated acting - but perhaps just on that account, it may
be closely observed naturalism.
The other girls, Rakie Ayola, Samantha Morton and Melissa Wilson, do their
best with the bitty cameos they get between their feral group-assaults. Ms
Upton connects very little up: the girls' peculiar savagery, Daniel's
shoe-fetish, a colleague's unnatural affection for him, his dogged desire to
transfer his job to Gibraltar - all float free and unexplained.
The trendy Lolita-gang motif - Furies, banshees, perhaps even maenads - was
pre-empted by Philip Ridley's Ghost from a Perfect Place at Hampstead last
season, and taken to such campily extravagant lengths as to cripple
imitators. Ashes &amp; Sand is tamer, and vaguer; at the end, I was unable to
guess whether the debagged Daniel had actually been castrated by the coven,
or just embarrassed by being smeared with body-paint.
But Nick Reding's Daniel is the performance of the evening: chirpy, evasive
and sad-eyed in public, prematurely weary alone, he suggests dumb, unhappy
depths beyond anything in the text. Michael Packer is deft with several
small roles, and Richard Albrecht makes something solid of Daniel's bluff,
shyly devoted colleague. Jeremy Herbert's designs involve a
mirror-contraption that permits quick cinematic cuts from one scene to
another: ingenious, though it works better if you sit near the middle. Ashes
&amp; Sand takes an hour and a half, with no interval.

You can share two very different trips tonight. In Great Journeys (9.30pm
BBC2) the young Scots timpanist Evelyn Glennie travels through Korea in
search of the country's musical roots. The Korean paradox - an ancient
culture combined with a booming economy and ruthless western modernisation -
leaves her with the suspicion of a tourist-conscious heritage industry
artificially kept alive and swamping the real thing (it sounds familiar).
After noting Confucianism and Buddhism, Glennie decides that Shamanism, the
worship of spirits, embodies the true Korea. We leave her on the seashore
with a beautifully photographed Shaman ceremony and an interview with 'the
Kiri Te Kanawa' of Korean opera, where a song can last 12 hours.
Specialised perhaps, but Glennie's unself-conscious enthusiasm gives it
integrity. Travelog (8.30pm Channel 4) is as synthetic as its title. A
former stand-up comic goes mechanically through the motions; whether in
Cyprus or Hungary the cliches come thick and fast.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Management: Mixing MS with work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An international campaign to counter workplace discrimination against people
with multiple sclerosis has been launched.
According to the International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies,
which is spearheading the initiative with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries of
Israel, misconceptions about MS often result in the 'inappropriate'
management of affected employees. 'Losing a job, cutting short a career or
being unable to find suitable work can add to the difficulties and
uncertainties of coping with the disease,' it said yesterday at a London
briefing.
Known to medical science for more than 150 years, MS is one of the most
common diseases of the central nervous system and afflicts around 2.5m
people around the world, particularly young adults. Its cause is not yet
known and its course is unpredictable and variable, but it is not fatal.
The IFMSS campaign will encourage employers to look at policies and
procedures and 'identify realistic goals based on the principle that people
with MS are usually able to continue as contributing, productive employees
often with minimal or minor accommodations'.
Companies should provide information to employees and senior managers which
dispels myths (for example, that MS is infectious), increases knowledge
about the different ways that MS affects people, and encourages a supporting
environment.
'MS is a condition that affects far more people than is generally realised,'
says George Remington, senior medical adviser of Marks and Spencer and a
keen supporter of the campaign. 'But it is usually very mild. Few cases are
as bad as, say, the cellist Jacqueline du Pre's, which was well known and
which alarmed everyone.'

FT  07 DEC 94 / Management: All aboard for the Channel tunnel - A look at
the merits of having a union as a business partner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALLAN BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The executive of the GMB union formally decided yesterday to join a
consortium of companies in its Pounds 2.7bn bid to build the Channel tunnel
rail link.
We have been asked, along with other rail and transport unions, to take an
equity stake in return for an interest in a new railway and associated real
estate. The project includes two stations at Waterloo and St Pancras in
London and nearly 70 miles of track to the tunnel entrance.
When Costain, the UK building company with a turnover of Pounds 1.2bn,
approached me to ask the GMB to join the consortium - which also includes
international companies Hochteif, Nisimatsu, Siemens, Hambros Bank and
Prideaux Associates - even Costain admitted it was with some trepidation.
The view that a union could be a partner on the board of management is not a
common one in the UK.
But it is in Europe. Building unions into the consortium of a project is
just part of the procedure to win contracts on the Continent.
The British construction industry is becoming more Europeanised and its
working practices are likely to become more common, as major continental
construction firms increase their stake in the domestic construction market.
The Channel tunnel rail link is likely to employ 10,000 workers at its
height. Apart from the obvious benefits for the union in future membership -
the joint aim is to have a unionised contract - we were delighted to be
asked to be a part of the project that will bring so many badly needed jobs
to the south and London regions.
The GMB union can offer the workers a package, which includes health and
safety measures that will be too good to turn down. We have just appointed
five recruitment officers specifically for the construction industry, and
when it comes to recruiting on the channel link project we feel we will have
the edge because we will already have a foot in the boardroom. This will
allow us to have a major say in designing health and safety policies and
influencing site organisation.
The endorsement yesterday to proceed with the project will involve having
union representation on the supervisory board. Although there are bound to
be differences of opinion, the very involvement of unions on the board
should encourage a dialogue which will minimise any differences. That
dialogue has already begun.
The nature of this dialogue will be set in the boardroom, but also by the
investment that the union makes. As a symbol of our commitment to this
partnership the GMB is considering how much of an investment it can make.
Our finance committee will be considering the investment at its next
meeting.
Our discussions with the contractors suggested that there are at least three
advantages for employers in partnership projects of this nature. First, an
early input on the crucial area of health and safety can save millions of
pounds; second, we can establish formal industrial relations procedures,
ensuring the smooth completion of this project; third, we can give priority
to proper consultation at every stage of the project to ensure that the
workforce is fully informed and confident of management's intentions.
Both sides, an employer wanting good industrial relations and a progressive
and forward-looking union can gain a great deal from this partnership. The
pitfalls can be avoided before they occur.
The Channel link experiment is by far the biggest potential partnership
scheme but there are others on the horizon. These include a batch of
privatised road building projects which are also likely to attract
involvement by foreign construction firms.
Just as the future for the British economy lies in Europe, so the GMB
recognises the value of European involvement. We already have an office in
Brussels and are talking with the German construction union Bau Stein Erden
about forming a partnership in Germany. There are at least 30,000 British
and Irish construction workers in Germany alone.
The move throughout Europe is towards international construction firms.
Bouygues, the French group, employs 55,000 people, five or six times more
than the largest British contractor.
This firm and others are increasingly likely to look towards the British
market. The GMB union is ready to work with these companies - we would
consider working in partnership with companies in future projects. Companies
which recognise the value of social partnership are on the increase.
This is the future, not only for the construction industry, but for British
industry as a whole.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Management: Rewards for bright ideas - A look at the ways
big companies encourage innovative employees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month a group of experts on valve emissions controls, aluminium
sulphate elimination and vibration-aided furnace decoking held a celebration
in a Buckingham management centre.
These were the winners of a new award set up by BP Chemicals to encourage
innovation. It is one of a number of companies hoping that the recognition
of success will provide role models, encourage innovators and motivate
others.
Bryan Sanderson, chief executive of BP Chemicals, says he was startled by
the response to the awards, which attracted 155 entries. 'It seems there was
a lot of potential for innovation which we did not know about,' he says.
The awards were conceived at a time when BP Chemicals was concerned about a
staff survey that suggested many employees did not feel the company was
innovative.
That posed a problem for a company which believes that its drive for greater
efficiency of the last few years has to be replaced with a more creative
philosophy. 'Rapid cost reduction and focusing is a miserable management job
but conceptually it is easy,' says Sanderson. 'But getting the next phase of
profit improvement is difficult and increasingly it will have to come from
more innovative thinking which increases performance and productivity.'
When BP Chemicals decided to introduce an innovation award, it looked to
similar schemes set up by BOC, the UK gases company, 3M, the US
manufacturing group, Dow, the US chemical company, and Elf Acquitaine, the
French petrochemical company. Some of these awards are designed to recognise
technological achievement; others to recognise innovation in every function
of the organisation.
These innovation awards tend to reward winners with glory, rather than hard
cash. Like BP, which primarily gives its prize winners 'a big public
thank-you', BOC does not give cash awards for its main scheme. Instead,
winners receive a team trophy, individual plaques, some publicity and a trip
to London, Washington or New York for a meeting with BOC's top management
and a dinner dance.
Some companies have experimented with giving sabbaticals or grants to their
most creative employees. In 1991, an IBM research centre in California
introduced a scheme which rewarded the person who had the best idea with the
services of a research assistant for two years.
One reason why companies shy away from financial rewards for innovation is
that bringing an idea to market often involves complex teamwork in which it
is hard to assess individual achievements.
The importance of teamwork in bringing new ideas to the market was a factor
in BOC's setting up an award for technological innovation five years ago. It
felt its reward structure placed too much emphasis on individual
achievement. That was compounded by scientists' tendency to revere
individuals for past scientific achievements. 'We wanted to change our
recognition system to put more emphasis on teams,' says Deb Chatterji,
managing director, technology.
Awards can raise the profile of an innovation but they cannot work in
isolation. If an organisation is inimical to innovation, investing Pounds
25,000 a year on an award scheme is little more than window dressing.
Even companies with highly creative employees will not produce innovations
unless the resources are available to ensure that new ideas are
commercialised. Market-driven innovation also needs good communications
between the design, development and marketing arms of the company.
Moreover, many companies frustrate the creativity of their employees with
badly-designed incentive schemes linked to short-term goals, according to
Clive Fletcher, a psychologist at Goldsmith's College at the University of
London. 'Companies often operate systems which squeeze the innovation out of
people,' he says.
He believes that introducing awards for innovation can play a useful role.
'Set against all the things that organisations do which counter innovation,
it is a positive step,' he says.
The difficulty in measuring creativity makes it hard for companies to assess
the effectiveness of award schemes. However, top managers are enthusiastic.
'It is hard to measure but one gets a clear feeling that it has a
motivational impact,' says Chatterji.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir David Trippier, the former small firms and environment minister who lost
his Rossendale seat at the last general election, yesterday entrenched
himself firmly in Manchester's financial and professional community by
becoming non-executive chairman of the Davenham Group, an emergent corporate
finance and investment specialist.
Davenham was bought out by Colin Davenport and Mike Hamlyn - hence the name
 -from the Burns-Anderson Group, then a Bristol-based company with a
Manchester office, in 1991 after even the fabled Sir John Harvey-Jones as
its chairman had failed to save it from collapse.
Davenham has since done well, including managing the assets of Edington,
Henry Cooke group's failed mini-merchant bank, for the KPMG Peat Marwick
administrator; Edington's depositors are now expected to get back 100p in
the pound.
With offices in Manchester and Sheffield, Davenham was backed by Pounds 10m
of equity and debt at the buyout, so it knows something about its own
market, which is finance for growing business, mainly in the north. It also
has a small stockbroking subsidiary in which Trippier, who was a stockbroker
before becoming an MP, will take a close interest.
Trippier's other Manchester activities include a seat on the board of
surveyors Dunlop Heywood and a consultancy with solicitors Halliwell Landau;
he has dropped the chairmanship of Tepnel Diagnostics, the biotech business
which was spun out of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and
Technology, while keeping his share options.
'I couldn't do much more for Tepnel now it is past the start-up stage,' he
said yesterday. 'Because it helps to finance growing businesses, Davenham is
always going to be at the exciting end of things. It is certainly hard work
trying to do all those things I used to tell people they should be doing
when I was small firms minister.'

Peter Johnson, 47, is to become the new chief executive of Inchcape Motors
Retail, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Inchcape, following the retirement of
Les Taylor early next year.
Johnson will take control of one of the UK's largest car retail groups,
which achieved Pounds 1.07bn sales in the first half of 1994, and operating
profits of Pounds 42.7m, up from Pounds 35m in the previous year. A former
director of Rover Group, in 1988 he moved to became managing director of
Applied Chemicals, and then took on his current position as chief executive
of Marshall Motors, based in Cambridge.
Inchcape has been streamlining its operations following the acquisitions of
TKM and Hogg Group, and it announced the sale of its entire vehicle rental
business on Monday. However, car distribution and retail remain core
activities.
Inchcape Motors has 109 franchises in 32 countries, and represents 43
different manufacturers, including Rover, BMW and Jaguar. Its UK franchises
include Mann Egerton, Coopers and HA Fox.
Les Taylor, 60, had worked for Inchcape subsidiary Wadham for 30 years, and
had been due to retire last summer.

The Aerostructures Hamble shambles has claimed another victim - Brian Barr,
son of the former chief executive, who yesterday resigned as a director.
Barr, 31, made almost Pounds 600,000 from the June flotation of the
Southampton-based aircraft parts-maker. He was the production director
responsible for the performance of the factory where Harrier parts were
made, and where the company's problems began.
At the time of the second profits warning in October he was moved from the
production to the engineering side of the company. His father, Andrew Barr,
who made Pounds 1.75m from the flotation, took early retirement.
The father and son team moved to Aerostructures from the Rover cars group.
They were keen to introduce Rover-style lean manufacturing techniques to the
aircraft industry.
A week ago Aerostructures ended its search for a new chief executive by
appointing Christopher West, who has been acting as a consultant since
leaving Westland Helicopters in 1992.
Yesterday the group announced the appointment of Hugh Curran, 41, as
director with responsibility for manufacturing. Curran, now operations
director at BTR-Westinghouse Brakes, was formerly with Shorts in Belfast.
Both he and West will take up their duties at the beginning of next month.
David Ring, acting chief executive at Aerostructures, says the group is not
abandoning the introduction of techniques learned in the motor industry. 'We
are making sure we have the latest and most appropriate technologies - many
of which come from the motor industry. However, the aircraft industry is
still a craft industry in many ways.'
Shares in Aerostructures, floated at 120p, fell to 24p in October but have
since recovered to 31p.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unisys, the US-based information technology group, has appointed George Cox
as chief executive of its UK subsidiary in succession to John Perry, who has
taken early retirement for personal reasons. Cox, 54, is currently chairman
of P-E International, the management consultancy. His appointment marks a
further stage in Unisys's transformation from a traditional computer
manufacturer selling mainframe and minicomputers to an information
management company offering a broad range of computing services. Cox will
report to Malcolm Coster, who was appointed president of Unisys
Europe-Africa earlier this year. Coster was formerly head of international
business development at the management consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand. The
transformation of Unisys, now trading profitably after several years of
losses, is credited to James Unruh, chairman and chief executive, who has
been seeking top management consultants to run strategic areas of the
business.
Cox was a co-founder with David Butler of Butler-Cox, based in London, which
was sold to Computer Sciences Corporation in 1992. He became head of P-E
International where he worked on focusing the company's development, cutting
away non-core activities and improving its financial strength. Last year he
negotiated a merger with Cray Electronics of the UK.
Cos says his immediate job is to develop a marketing approach to help
establish Unisys's new image with the public; most of the restructuring has
been done; drastic action is not required.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Recruitment: Proving a point withoutformal certificates -
The need for paper qualifications is becoming less important in some areas
of selection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How much should we insist on formal qualifications to do particular jobs?
How much do they obscure objectivity in assessing people's ability to carry
out work?
The Employment Service, a UK Civil Service agency which runs high street job
centres, has gone some way towards answering these questions by dispensing
with the need for paper qualifications such as GCSEs for most of its
entrants.
It happened about three years ago when the service, anxious to attract a
broader range of job candidate, including more ethnic minorities, older
applicants and women returners, designed an application form that sought to
identify people's particular job competencies.
We can define competencies - civil service psychologists call them widgets -
as those skills, abilities or behavioural traits that differentiate levels
of performance in a job.
Psychologists looked at the typical Employment Service roles and identified
nine prime competencies most useful for doing the job. One of them,
numeracy, in fact, was not identified as being so important, but the
Treasury, which had a hand in sanctioning the exercise, insisted on that
one.
The nine competencies included such qualities as getting on with people,
oral communication skills, planning work with the right priorities, and
managing change. 'We found that educational qualifications weren't terribly
good predictors of people's ability in these areas,' said Roger Cross, a
principal psychologist in the service who worked on the new entry
requirements.
These were then incorporated into a new application form, notable
principally for its omissions. Nowhere does it ask for educational
qualifications. Instead it poses questions, based on the identified
competencies. For example, in a sectioned designed to discover a candidate's
ability to get on with people it says: 'Executive officers have to be able
to deal with people, relate to colleagues and the public, even in difficult
circumstances. Please give an example of how you have had to deal with
difficult or unco-operative people.'
When confronted with the new application forms, candidates found them
difficult at first, said Cross. 'It was a cultural shock to people used to
filling in forms based on qualifications and CVs to actually have to think
about some of these things,' he said.
The downturn in unemployment since the new system was introduced has meant
that the service has had comparatively few new recruits in the past three
years with which to form a clear picture of its effect on adverse impact.
While switching from qualifications to competencies may have reduced the
adverse impact of other types of entrance requirement on certain groups, it
is not thought to have led to a significant increase in ethnic minority
recruitment. That may in part be because the service has not got the message
through to potential candidates, but another problem is likely to be in the
identified competencies which expect candidates to demonstrate good verbal
and communications skills.
Validity tests, however, have shown favourable results in the quality of
candidates. Competency-based recruitment and assessment is now becoming
quite common in the Civil Service although most departments would take a
more traditional approach to the possession of educational qualifications.
The Employment Service itself now uses competency-based recruitment in all
of its high volume recruitment covering junior management and administrative
grades, and some private employers are starting to use them in recruitment,
usually, however, alongside requirements for paper qualifications.
An addendum to the points on qualifications. I was told the other day about
a City investment bank which was recruiting new traders. On the section of
the application form seeking information about qualifications one candidate
simply wrote: 'I have been an unqualified success in every job I have
undertaken.' The employer recruited him and he went on to become one of its
best traders.
The table (left) is compiled from P-E International management consultancy's
1994 survey of executive salaries and benefits in the UK. It was carried out
in July and covered nearly 9,000 executive grades ranging from chairman to
junior manager employed by 662 companies.
The extract covers fringe benefits typically awarded in UK executive ranks.
It's interesting to note, if you look at the figures, that the rule seems to
be the higher people are paid, the more chance they seem to have of getting
benefits. The complete report, which includes data on salaries and bonuses,
costs Pounds 400 and can be obtained from Karen Gallagher at the
consultancy's address, Park House, Wick Road, Egham, Surrey TW20 OHW,

FT  07 DEC 94 / Business and the Environment: Hybrid car sets out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hydro-Quebec, one of Canada's two biggest power utilities, has developed a
hybrid electric car technology that it says will reduce emissions and
increase energy efficiency.
Hydro, best known for long-distance power transmission, electro-chemical and
battery research, has unveiled its Couture Powertrain system, which runs on
electric batteries backed up by a small gasoline engine. It has spent
CDollars 22m (Pounds 9.8m) since 1991 proving technical feasibility and will
spend a further CDollars 50m to reach the commercialisation phase.
The hybrid traction system, designed and developed by researcher Pierre
Couture, uses high-efficiency batteries to drive electric motors in each of
a car's four wheels. A conventional gearbox, differential, drive shaft and
gasoline engine are not needed.
A small gasoline engine recharges the batteries. The whole system, including
central generator-motor, is computer controlled. It has a 30hp, two-stroke
gasoline engine, with a catalytic converter. The engine runs for a maximum
of 30 minutes per hour of driving.
Couture says the system offers twice a conventional (internal combustion
engine) car's energy efficiency, reduces emissions and makes significant
savings in materials. Total vehicle weight is about the same as conventional
cars. Manufacturing costs could be less.
Hydro is testing the technology on a standard Chrysler Intrepid sedan. Its
rear wheels are driven by individual electric motors powered by batteries
kept in the boot. The normal frontwheel drive system is disengaged.
Many groups are working on electric cars and hybrids worldwide. Recent US
research shows that better design and electronics could raise average
mileage per gallon to 46, or 65 per cent, according to research, but this is
likely to add Dollars 1,000 (Pounds 610) to the cost.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Business and the Environment: Trouble brewing over sewage
plan - A look at controversy in California over recycled water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA TWARONITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The idea of beer brewed from recycled sewer water might deter even the most
dedicated beer drinker, but it could become reality in drought-prone
southern California.
In August, the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District decided on
a Dollars 25m (Pounds 15m) plan to pipe reclaimed water from a nearby sewage
treatment facility to an area near the Irwindale plant of the
Wisconsin-based Miller Brewing company.
The US's second-largest brewer responded by filing a lawsuit, expected to be
heard early next year, in an attempt to halt the project, citing potential
pollution of the area's water supply.
'We believe we have an obligation as a corporate citizen, on behalf of our
employees and consumers throughout California, to voice our strong concern
about the safety, feasibility and overall public benefits of the project,'
said the company.
Robert Berlien, general manager of the water district, argues that the
recycled water will meet all state health standards.
Water is a precious resource in southern California, where it is often
imported hundreds of miles from its source to thirsty urban areas. The San
Gabriel Valley now imports about a quarter of its water from other regions.
The proposed reclamation project would save about 10bn gallons each year,
reducing the valley's dependence on imported water by about a third.
'We pump more water out of the ground than nature puts back in,' Berlien
says. 'And the imported water supply is becoming less and less reliable and
more and more expensive.'
He points out that water from the same sewage treatment plant has been
transported to other areas for the past three decades, where households have
used it with no apparent ill effects.
California has more than 200 such recycling plants, supplying about 5 per
cent of the state's water. First, solid wastes are removed in settling
tanks. Next, bacteria are added to consume organic impurities. The water is
then filtered through sand and charcoal, and finally mixed with chlorine, to
kill anything that remains.
The water is then ready for industrial use and irrigation, but before being
supplied to households it is taken to 'spreading grounds' where it is
released to naturally seep back into the underground water supply. State
regulations mandate that the water must remain in the ground for at least
six months before it can be drawn up and used.
The Miller plant turns about 680m gallons of water into 170.5m gallons of
beer each year. The Irwindale site was chosen, the company says in its
lawsuit, for its proximity to an ample supply of 'high-quality' water,
essential to the production of beer.
'When 90 per cent of your product is water, you want to make sure that water
is pure,' says Miller spokesman Michael Brophy. Miller is concerned that
some of the recycled water will contain industrial waste, which could
contaminate the ground water. The soil of the proposed 'spreading ground' is
coarse and rocky and therefore unsuitable to filter out contaminants
adequately, says Brophy. The water authority counters by saying that the
soil is adequate to take the water.
Miller's suit challenges not just the proposed project but the overall
safety of recycled water. It says no conclusive data exist to prove that
people who have been consuming recycled water are unaffected. It cites a
study carried out on recycled water in nearby Orange County, which found a
significant amount of chlorine-resistant bacteria.
Local environmental groups are split on the issue. Some favour more impact
assessments before recycled water is put back into the ground. Other groups
insist reclamation is a necessary part of responsible water use.
'We have some very serious questions about this project, about its
technology and, ultimately, its effects,' says Brophy. 'What's wrong with
second-guessing what a water district is doing? It is something we're going
to keep fighting for.'

FT  07 DEC 94 / Business and the Environment: Less is more - Manufacturers
are trying to cut their use of packaging materials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the early 1980s, when Procter &amp; Gamble first test-marketed a highly
concentrated laundry product, few people would buy it. Shoppers were put off
by what they perceived to be less fabric softener or washing liquid at a
premium price. Few of them seemed to care very much that so-called 'ultra'
products could slash the amount of packaging finding its way into landfills.
But it was hard to keep a good idea down. P&amp;G and other big consumer
products manufacturers are now profiting from a shift in consumer sentiment.
By 1993, 'ultra' - or concentrated - products were capturing about 70 per
cent of the laundry market, according to Green MarketAlert, a trade
news-letter.
'Consumers once believed more is more, now they think otherwise,' says
Jacqueline Ottman, a New York environmental consultant.
Concentrates are perhaps the most conspicuous success in the campaign by US
companies over the past decade to minimise the undesirable effects of their
packaging, most often by cutting the amount of material that requires
disposal.
'Source reduction' is the buzzword phrase used in the field to describe a
movement that embraces package redesign, 'light-weighting', and greater use
of refillable containers and concentrates. It overlaps with efforts to
promote recycling, which slows down demand for virgin materials.
Industry representatives and environmental activists agree that it is a
cause that seems to be coming into its own in the US.
Over the past four years, P&amp;G has cut its use of packaging materials overall
by 24 per cent, including a 42 per cent reduction in paperboard. It has also
lifted the level of recycled materials in its packaging to 37 per cent, from
23 per cent in 1989-90.
'There is now a critical mass of recycled materials available to meet our
needs and those of our competitors,' says Scott Stewart, a spokesman for
P&amp;G.
Between 1985 and 1992, the rate at which solid waste in the US was recovered
doubled to 21 per cent, according a recent study prepared by Franklin
Associates, a Kansas waste-management consultancy.
In the soft drinks industry, the American Plastics Council says nearly 58
per cent of plastic bottles shipped last year were recycled. The rate for
aluminium cans was 63 per cent, according to trade groups.
In part, these trends have picked up momentum because of new regulatory
initiatives at state level and increased pressure by government officials of
every stripe, from the federal Environmental Protection Agency to the local
level.
Under the Clinton administration, the EPA has placed a stronger emphasis on
source reduction in all areas of environmental control. In the field of
solid waste, however, the agency has shied away from imposing rules to
require certain levels of recycled content in products or packaging.
Many cities and towns have taken a more active role, enacting laws that
require residents and businesses to separate discarded cans, bottles and
paper for recycling. For the most part, there is strong political support
for such measures in spite of recent evidence that the US is not running out
of landfill space as fast as was feared in the late 1980s.
Meanwhile, nine states have controversial 'bottle' bills on their books,
which promote recycling by imposing returnable deposit fees on beverage
containers. In Florida, the state has taken a unique carrot-and-stick
approach. Certain containers that meet targets for recycling or recycled
content are exempt from an 'advance disposal fee'.
Mostly, however, source reduction and the use of recycled materials are
succeeding because they can be profitable in their own right.
'Source reduction yields significant economic benefits,' says Ann Mattheis,
director of the Source Reduction Task Force of the Council of Northeastern
Governors. 'When companies choose to eliminate or minimise the amount of
packaging they use, that translates into reduced costs for materials,
transportation and retailing.'
The task force has sought to prod the private sector gently along the green
path by drawing up a set of guidelines on preferred packaging. Companies are
invited to set their own timetables for conforming with the principles and
to report annually on their progress. So far, 50 of them - from the leading
multi-nationals to small niche marketers - have agreed to participate.
Their solutions range from the obvious to the ingenious. Mobil was able to
pack its Hefty trash bags with 10 per cent less material by devising a
better method for squeezing out the air between them. For Crisco cooking
oil, P&amp;G designed a squat container which carries the same volume with 30
per cent less plastic than its predecessor. Many marketers have simply
eliminated unnecessary cartons and wrap-pers.
'Because of the economic considerations, companies will continue to reduce
their packaging to whatever extent they can and still retain the integrity
of their products,' says Anthony Montrone, vice president of environmental
business strategies at the Arthur D. Little consultancy group.
A secondary benefit for marketers is an improved public image. Nevertheless,
when shoppers make their choice, a product's perceived environmental
qualities usually are not as important as its performance, convenience and
price, according to experts in consumer behaviour. 'Most often, the
environment is a tie-breaker. When two products are otherwise equal, the tie
usually goes to the dolphin,' says Ottman.
Likewise, public demand is a big reason why marketers are turning to
recycled materials for their packaging. 'Companies are trying hard to keep
in step with the environmental wishes of consumers as well as the policy
makers,' says E. Gifford Stack, vice president of environmental affairs at
the National Soft Drink Association.
But they are not using more recycled material simply to curry favour, says
Montrone. 'They are doing it because it makes economic sense - it's a
cheaper packaging material,' he says.
Not as cheap as it was, however. Prices for recycled materials have risen
over the past two years, in part because the US economic upturn has
accelerated the demand for raw materials of all types.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Shipping lines press for decision on BR sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twelve big international shipping lines will meet the government next week
to press for a rapid decision on the sale of Freightliner, the loss-making
British Rail subsidiary which moves containers.
The lines, which include Hapag-Lloyd of Germany, Evergreen of Taiwan, NYK
Line and Mitsui-OSK of Japan, T&amp;J Harrison of the UK and Lykes Lines of the
US, are concerned about the six-month delay in the privatisation plans.
They are also worried that Freightliner, which carries containers from
deep-sea ports to inland terminals, might be sold to a consortium partly
owned by rival shipping companies or ports. One of the bidding consortia
involves Maersk, a Danish shipping company, and another includes UK shipping
group P&amp;O and the Port of Felixstowe.
The sale of Freightliner was expected to be the first substantial sale of
part of BR since legislation authorising privatisation was passed in
November 1993. But delays on concluding a deal have highlighted the problems
of selling the loss-making parts of BR and angered the three consortia
bidding.
They complain that the cost of maintaining bid teams and advisers rises the
longer they have to wait.
The shipping lines are to meet transport minister Mr John Watts, his senior
civil servants and representatives of BR's vendor unit which is responsible
for handling sales. 'It is partly exasperation at the delay and partly
because we fear a monopoly being established by a port organisation or a
shipping line,' said Mr Keith Duggan, director of transport at Hapag-Lloyd.
But a spokesman for Project Freightliner, comprising P&amp;O Distribution,
Russell Davies, a distribution group, and the Port of Felixstowe, said: 'We
look to serve the main container ports. It would be daft to run only to
Felixstowe.'
The sale memorandum for Freightliner was published seven months later than
planned last May. Bids were made in June but were rejected by the government
as lacking in detail. More information was made available to the bidders and
they refiled their bids in October.
One reason for the delayed sale is the loss of Pounds 38m which Freightliner
made on sales of Pounds 78m last year which has made it difficult to
structure a satisfactory deal.
Some of the bidders want further government support if they are to maintain
the more heavily loss-making routes on which Freightliner operates. This
could come either in the form of a continued subsidy or a special
arrangement with Railtrack on the level of access fees for using the track.
The three bidders for Freightliner are MCB, a buy-out bid mounted by a team
of Freightliner managers; Project Freightliner; and FL2000 consisting of
former Freightliner managers, Maersk and - until it withdrew last month - CP
Rail Systems of Canada.
MCB makes much of the fact that its is the only bid which involves the
acquisition of locomotives and train crews who account for 1,500 of the
2,000 Freightliner employees. But the other two bidders say that it makes
more sense to hire in 'traction' from the other larger parts of BR's freight
activities.
The bid consortia hope that the government will make up its mind on the
successful bidder by Christmas though it is unlikely a sale could be
concluded before March or April.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Glaxo sued for Pounds 80m by patients
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo, the pharmaceuticals manufacturer, is being sued for more than Pounds
80m by about 400 former hospital patients in the first of a series of cases
concerning the medical dye Myodil.
Patients say Myodil, which was widely used in spinal X-rays between 1944 and
1987, when it was discontinued, damaged nerves, causing acute pain and even
partial paralysis. They say Glaxo failed to issue adequate warnings about
side-effects.
Glaxo denies negligence and says Myodil's risks were well documented.
Solicitors say the group action, to be heard at the High Court in London in
April, represents a test case for other Myodil claims. Lawyers are thought
to be preparing cases in Scotland and Ireland. The dye was also used in
Australia, Canada and South Africa.
Doctors injected the dye as part of a technique called myelography. Patients
say the dye stayed in the spine for several years, causing inflammation of
the spinal column membrane.
Glaxo says that the risks were highlighted in leaflets which accompanied the
product. The company said: 'We supplied this product to meet the needs of a
very knowledgeable medical profession. It was known for many years that
myelography could be followed by arachnoiditis.'
The Myodil case would be the first group action for personal injury against
a drug company to come to trial.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Bank unions urge Sunday work ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banking unions yesterday urged their members not to volunteer for Sunday
working, as National Westminster Bank confirmed that 23 of its 2,500
branches would be open for business on the two Sundays before Christmas.
The NatWest Staff Association, which has about 40,000 members, and the
banking union Bifu, which has about 16,000 members in NatWest, urged staff
not to volunteer.
If they did not volunteer the bank's management would have to negotiate
terms for Sunday working.
NatWest is the first of the four biggest UK high street banks to make this
move. The others said yesterday that they had no plans to follow suit.
The bank said branches would be open between 10.30am and 3.30pm in areas
including shopping centres and high streets, where area managers believed
there was a commercial justification for opening and staff were prepared to
work Sundays.
Saturday banking has proved popular with customers seeking investment or
mortgage advice rather than simply access to their accounts, which can be
provided through cash machines.
But the NatWest Staff Association and some of NatWest's competitors doubted
that there was a business case for Sunday opening that could be established
in the pre-Christmas rush. Mr Dai Davies, general secretary of the staff
association, said: 'I can't believe anybody would go into NatWest on a
Sunday before Christmas in search of a mortgage.'
Bank customers using the branches will be asked their views about Sunday
opening. A strong positive response would increase the prospect of regular
Sunday opening next year and would put more pressure on other high street
banks to do the same.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Warning on car lease VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government plans to allow car leasing companies to reclaim value added tax
on their car purchases for the first time will distort the car market and
depress new car sales next summer, accountants Grant Thornton said
yesterday.
The draft legislation, which is open to further amendment until March,
removes the disadvantages which car leasing companies - which account for
about 800,000 of the 2.4m company cars on the road - have suffered when
leasing to private individuals and VAT-exempt companies, such as banks and
building societies, which are unable to recover the VAT they pay.
If the leasing companies are allowed to recover the 17.5 per cent VAT
private individuals and financial sector customers will no longer be forced
to pay 'VAT on VAT' - both on the vehicle purchase and the lease company's
charges.
Accountants and organisations involved with the leasing industry, such as
the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association and the Finance and
Leasing Association say, however, that the legislation will give an
advantage to the leasing sector compared with the outright purchase of
vehicles by companies.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Motor industry alarmed as private sales decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A further sharp fall last month in the number of new cars purchased has
caused increasing alarm in the UK motor trade that private buyers are
deserting the market in growing numbers.
Industry officials yesterday described last month's 13.5 per cent fall in
the number of new cars bought privately, compared with November 1993, as
another indication of the UK's faltering economic recovery and lack of
consumer confidence.
However, a further strong rise in commercial vehicle registrations last
month - of 17.13 per cent year-on-year - and a 15.7 per cent rise in fleet
car registrations, is seen by some analysts as a sign that the industry may
have to look elsewhere to explain the steep fall-off in private buyers
during recent months.
They suggest that prices higher than private buyers consider justified,
followed by rapid depreciation - caused in part by manufacturers giving
priority to the fleet market - are leading private customers to opt for
low-mileage used cars.
Mr Alan Pulham, director of the National Franchised Dealers Association, has
criticised manufacturers' pricing policies and the fact that cars are mainly
designed for the business car market. Overall, he says, the price of a
medium-sized family car is about Pounds 2,000 higher than it would be
otherwise, and values on the used market have been undermined by deeply
discounted sales to fleets.
Prof Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff Business
School, has warned that many private buyers may not return to the new car
market until prices fall nearer to North American levels, which are as much
as 40 per cent lower than in the UK.
Statistics from HPI, the vehicle finance monitoring organisation, also show
credit purchases of used cars rising by 11. l per cent in the first nine
months of this year - almost twice the new car level.
Manufacturers have expressed concern privately about the trend, but publicly
insist that the problem is one of confidence.
Mr Ernie Thompson, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, said yesterday: 'The continuing decline in the retail market in
November continues to demonstrate how fragile consumer confidence remains.'
Ford continues to dominate the list of best-selling cars, with the Escort,
Mondeo and Fiesta occupying the top three places, in spite of production
cuts at the Dagenham and Ellesmere Port plants.
New car registration statistics published by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders yesterday show Ford was market leader last month,
with a 21.83 per cent share, slightly up from the same period last year. Its
share for the first 11 months of the year has also improved marginally,
opening a gap of nearly 6 percentage points over second-place Vauxhall,
whose share fell by nearly one point.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Shareholders flex a muscle on top pay: A look at the options
as Whitehall ponders ways of restraining directors' salaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers and officials who are looking at ways of limiting directors'
salaries at public companies should pay a visit to Arlen, a tiny electrical
manufacturer and distributor based in Kent.
Mr Greville Howard, the new managing director of Arlen, is planning to
introduce changes to the company's articles of association so that any
directors' contract longer than six months will have to be approved by
shareholders.
Mr Howard said: 'If a director wants a contract longer than six months and
some particular pay level then he is going to have to get their approval.'
Arlen's move, likely to be implemented at its next annual general meeting,
will be food for thought in Whitehall. After recent public anger at pay
rises such as the 75 per cent awarded last month to Mr Cedric Brown, chief
executive of British Gas, Mr John Major has asked ministers and officials to
come up with ways of giving shareholders greater influence over top
executives' pay.
The prime minister believes that doing this will allay public suspicion that
the government is unwilling to do anything to stop directors receiving big
pay rises while continuing to clamp down on workforce pay.
Arlen is an exception. Most companies are unwilling to give shareholders a
veto on directors' pay.
The issue has now been referred to the cabinet's industrial and consumer
affairs committee, after Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
made clear his opposition.
The practical implications of any proposed changes, including the need for
legislation, are being explored by an interdepartmental working party of
Treasury and DTI officials.
Top of the agenda is a possible change in company law to give shareholders
the right at company annual meetings to vote specifically on directors'
salary packages. One idea is that shareholders would be given a summary of
the main points of directors' contracts and asked to approve them if they
have changed substantially from the previous year.
At the moment the only means by which shareholders can publicly register
their disapproval is by voting against the acceptance of a company's annual
report and accounts or by voting against the election or re-election of
non-executive directors, who usually set the pay of executive directors.
A fund manager of a large pension fund said: 'Neither of these are very
satisfactory. Non-executives only come up for re-election every three years
and getting rid of them would undoubtedly cause problems for the company.'
Mr Stuart Bell of PIRC, the corporate governance consultancy, agreed. He
said shareholders protesting against directors' pay by voting against the
annual report or re-election of non-executive directors was 'the
sledge-hammer and nut syndrome'.
PIRC supports giving shareholders a formal mechanism for voting against
directors' pay, as does the UK Shareholders' Association, a group which
represents individual shareholders. Its chairman, Mr Donald Butcher, said:
'If the government's idea is to encourage greater transparency so that
shareholders have a better understanding of how much directors' are paid and
also the means by which to vote against it, then that can only be a good
thing.'
Mr Butcher and others want to ensure that the summary of remuneration given
to shareholders includes several areas which often escape attention:
The cost to companies of directors' pensions entitlement. Big salary
increases to directors just before they retire can result in substantial
pension costs for the company and therefore the shareholders. The value of
share options awarded to directors. Disclosure of options held by directors
has improved recently because of accounting rule changes, but some fund
managers want to see companies having to estimate a current monetary value
of the options held by directors.
Experts stress, however, that persuading the government to force companies
to give shareholders greater information on pay, as well as the chance to
vote specifically on the issue each year, is only the half the battle. Mr
Butcher said: 'Motivating both institutional and private shareholders to use
their votes is the real battle.'
Only a small percentage of institutional fund managers in the UK routinely
vote at companies' AGMs.
The answer may lie in corporate governance developments in the US. A ruling
by the US Department of Labour means that US pension funds may now have to
exercise their votes in overseas companies in which they hold shares.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Air traffic control to be 'sold secretly'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is secretly planning to sell off air traffic control, Mr
Henry McLeish, Labour's transport spokesman, said yesterday.
He said the Civil Aviation Authority's budget was to be cut so severely that
only through privatisation could it make its targets.
The CAA's external financing limit is to fall from Pounds 52m in 1994-95 to
Pounds 27m in 1995-96 and to Pounds 3m in 1996-97. It will rise to Pounds 6m
in 1997-98.
Mr McLeish said this meant air traffic control was to be privatised 'without
even the decency of a public statement'.
He said responses to the government's air traffic privatisation proposals
had been published in an obscure parliamentary written answer.
They showed 188 people had responded to a privatisation paper, yet 168
opposed the plan or expressed doubts.
Of the 14 supporting the government one was a Conservative MP, three were
potential competitors to the CAA and three were privatisation consultants.
Mr McLeish said: 'Never has the lack of support for the dogma of
privatisation been so clearly demonstrated.' CAA figures published yesterday
suggest that package holidaymakers are still bearing the brunt of airport
delays.
Only 51 per cent of charter flights in to and out of airports in April-June
1994 were on time (within 15 minutes) compared with 52 per cent for the same
period last year.
For the same period, 83 per cent of scheduled flights were on time compared
with 79 per cent in the corresponding period last year and only 73 per cent
in the same period in 1992.
The CAA figures showed that in the period April-June just 50 per cent of
Gatwick airport charter flights were on time, compared with 52 per cent in
the same period last year. At Manchester airport only 49 per cent of
charters were on time, compared with 52 per cent in April-June 1993.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Glaxo faces lawsuit by 400 dye patients
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo, the pharmaceuticals manufacturer, is being sued for more than Pounds
80m by about 400 former hospital patients in the first of a series of cases
concerning the medical dye Myodil.
Patients say Myodil, which was widely used in spinal X-rays between 1944 and
1987, damaged nerves, causing acute pain and even partial paralysis. They
say Glaxo failed to issue adequate warnings about side effects. Glaxo denies
negligence, saying that Myodil's risks were well documented.
Solicitors say the group action, to be heard at the High Court in London in
April, represents a test case for other Myodil claims. Lawyers are thought
to be preparing cases in Scotland and Ireland. The dye was also used in
Australia, Canada and South Africa.
Myodil was discontinued seven years ago. Glaxo said demand had declined.
Doctors injected the dye as part of a technique called myelography. Patients
say the dye remained in the spine for several years, leading to the
condition known as arachnoiditis - inflammation of the spinal column
membrane.
Glaxo says that the risks were highlighted in leaflets which accompanied the
product. The company said: 'We supplied this product to meet the needs of a
very knowledgeable medical profession. It was known for many years that
myelography could be followed by arachnoiditis.'
Mr Simon Gowler, of Alexander Harris, the solicitors who represent the
patients, said: 'They said there was a risk of arachnoiditis, but that can
mean many things to many people. There is a huge difference between
arachnoiditis which can be seen on a myelography film, and those who develop
symptoms.'
The Myodil case would be the first group action for personal injury against
a drug company to come to trial.
Previous cases have been settled out of court after several years of
litigation. About 90 per cent of the Myodil patients are supported by legal
aid because of their disabilities.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Ford continues to lead new car registrations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford continues to dominate the list of best-selling cars, with the Escort,
Mondeo and Fiesta occupying the top three places, in spite of production
cuts at the Dagenham and Ellesmere Port plants.
New car registration statistics, published by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders yesterday, show Ford was market leader last month,
with a 21.83 per cent share, slightly up on the same period last year. Its
share for the first 11 months of the year has also improved marginally,
opening a gap of nearly six percentage points over second-placed Vauxhall,
whose share fell nearly one point.
Importers' share of registrations fell slightly in November, to 55.16 per
cent compared with 55.23 per cent in the previous November.
For the first 11 months, however, more than 100,000 extra imports have
lifted their share to 57.23 per cent compared with 55.55 per cent a year
ago.
The top ten best-selling cars in the first 11 months of this year were: 1
Ford Escort, 139,133; 2 Ford Mondeo 122,863; 3 Ford Fiesta 118,380; 4
Vauxhall Cavalier 96,558; 5 Vauxhall Astra 94,685; 6 Rover 200 76,543; 7
Vauxhall Corsa 75,969; 8 Rover Metro 54,462; 9 Renault Clio 47,949; 10
Peugeot 306 47,539.

The Accounting Standards Board has confirmed that it will defer aspects of
one of its financial reporting rules in certain areas of insurance.
Financial Reporting Standard 5, which is designed to make company
transactions reflect their real substance, not merely their legal form, will
be deferred for two years for insurance broking transactions and financial
reinsurance included in the accounts of Lloyd's syndicates.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Coal arm quizzes DTI on its future
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal Enterprise, the job-creation arm of British Coal, is seeking
urgent clarification by the government of its future before the
privatisation of its parent.
Mr Philip Andrews, BCE chief executive, said the Department of Trade and
Industry had indicated that a decision would be made before November. He
said the uncertainty was affecting staff morale and customer confidence.
The department said yesterday that it was examining all the options. It
said: 'Everyone agrees that they do a very good job, and we want to make
sure that those skills don't disappear.' It denied that there had been a
decision deadline.
BCE, which was formed in 1984, estimates that it has been finding jobs or
training for redundant miners at the rate of 100 a week. It also provides
soft loans to small businesses in coalfield areas at rates subsidised by the
government through British Coal. The privatisation of the corporation, due
on December 24, will leave BCE without financial support.
Mr Andrews said he believed BCE could raise funds through the City, or
international sources such as the European Investment Bank. There were
structural programmes which would provide matching funds to cover BCE's
operating costs of about Pounds 5m a year.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Caution urged over future cuts in taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's chief economist gave a warning yesterday that it would be
unwise to cut taxes in the future if the economy was running at or above
full capacity or if such action threatened the health of the public
finances.
Mr Alan Budd, the Treasury's chief economic adviser, told the Commons
Treasury and civil service committee in evidence on last week's Budget,
however, that the economy still had spare capacity, although it was
impossible to know precisely how much.
He estimated that the economy's output gap - the difference between the
actual level of gross domestic product and the level that would exist if it
had grown at its long-term trend rate in recent years - was in a range of 1
per cent to 4 per cent.
Mr Budd said past evidence suggested that there was room for unemployment to
fall further - to perhaps 2m compared with present levels of about 2.5m -
before stimulating inflationary pressures.
Mr Budd said he hoped that changes in the supply side of the British economy
during the 1980s meant that the level of unemployment compatible with low
inflation could go below 2m.
He hoped that the changes, such as labour reforms and privatisation, had
raised the annual rate of sustainable growth in Britain from the long-term
average of 2 per cent to 2 1/2 per cent.
Although it was difficult to judge whether there had been a structural
improvement to the economy, he said policymakers drew 'some comfort' from
the combination of output growth and falling inflation since the UK had
started its recovery from recession.
The UK's present strong recovery will be one of the issues for discussion at
today's monetary meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr
Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England.
Although there is broad agreement in the Treasury and the Bank of England
that the next move in UK bank base rates will have to be upwards from 5.75
per cent to keep control of inflation, it is unclear whether the chancellor
will feel the need to act before Christmas.
Yesterday, Mr Budd was careful to sidestep questions on the interest rate
expectations underpinning the government's forecasts.
He warned, however, that an injudicious tax cut in a future budget, that
boosted the economy when it was running at or above capacity, would have to
be offset by tighter monetary policies.
Asked about sterling, Mr Budd said the present value of the pound seemed to
be 'about right'. He said the fall in sterling's exchange rate since it left
the European exchange rate mechanism had helped to produce a 'quite
remarkable' boost to trade and that this seemed to be sustainable.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Cash hopes rise for Polly Peck creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The administrators to Polly Peck International, part of the collapsed
business empire of fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir, announced a
breakthrough yesterday in settling the claims of creditors.
As a result of a deal, agreed in principle with creditors of other parts of
the Polly Peck Group, an interim payment is likely to be made to up to 1,500
creditors by early summer.
Mr Christopher Barlow, a partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand and lead administrator
to PPI, told creditors yesterday that he estimated the interim payment at
1.2p to 1.8p in the pound.
Further payments are possible up to a further 2.6p in the pound, although
that does not include income from legal claims or assets held beyond the
reach of the administrators in northern Cyprus.
Last May Mr Nadir fled the UK for his native Cyprus while facing charges of
false accounting and theft involving Pounds 34m. The administrators reported
yesterday that they were in talks with the government of northern Cyprus on
settling control of the disputed assets.
In his eighth report to creditors since the collapse of the company in 1990
with debts of more than Pounds 1bn, Mr Barlow was able to report that
complex legal issues stemming from the structure of the Polly Peck Group
were very close to being settled. A deal is expected to be signed in a week.
As a result Dollars 180m (Pounds 109.7m) held in PPI Holdings BV, a Dutch
company, will be released and some funds allowed to flow on to PPI. The
funds include the proceeds of the sale of the Del Monte fresh fruit
business.
The deal puts in place an agreed formula for the distribution of future
assets realised from the Polly Peck Group and should mean that they will
flow relatively smoothly to the creditors of PPI. The deal would also settle
a legal dispute over the routeing of funds through the Polly Peck Group
involving Dollars 400m. The total assets so far realised from the Polly Peck
Group total Dollars 680m.
According to the report to PII creditors the deal, if signed, will remove
'any scope' for further arguments about the claims from the different sets
of creditors in the Polly Peck Group. The basis of the split between groups
of creditors is confidential.
Mr Barlow said he was 'cautiously hopeful' that direct talks with the
government in northern Cyprus would unlock the remaining assets - which
include three hotels, a cardboard box company, and a fruit packer  - in
return for the payment of debts to the government. The assets in question in
northern Cyprus have a book value of Pounds 50m but it is thought they would
realise something more than Pounds 15m if sold.
UK law bars administrators from paying creditors. Mr Barlow is suggesting,
and has the agreement in principle of the creditors' committee, that PPI be
placed under a scheme of arrangement under the Companies Act - a form of
insolvency procedure.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Warning on VAT plans for car leases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government plans to allow car leasing companies to reclaim value added tax
on their car purchases for the first time will distort the car market and
depress new car sales next summer, accountants Grant Thornton said
yesterday.
The draft legislation, which is open to further amendment until March,
removes the disadvantages which car leasing companies - which account for
about 800,000 of the 2.4m company cars on the road - have suffered when
leasing to private individuals and VAT-exempt companies, such as banks and
building societies, which are unable to recover VAT they pay.
If the leasing companies are allowed to recover the 17.5 per cent VAT,
private individuals and financial sector customers will no longer be forced
to pay 'VAT on VAT' when leasing - both on the vehicle purchase and the
lease company's charges.
Accountants and organisations involved with leasing say, however, that the
legislation will give an advantage to the leasing sector compared with the
outright purchase of vehicles by companies.
The accountants said that if left intact, the legislation, which will allow
the leasing industry to reclaim VAT from next August 1, would depress new
car sales throughout next summer because businesses would extend leases on
their existing cars until they could take advantage of the new tax regime.
Mr Frank Hartley, an analyst with Grant Thornton, said: 'Now that the draft
legislation has been published it makes clear that the government does not
intend to allow user companies buying their cars to reclaim any VAT on
directly purchased cars if there is any element of private use whatsoever.
'Yet if a fully taxable business leases its cars and allows private use of
them, it will still be able to reclaim 50 per cent of the VAT on the lease
charges.'
This would far outweigh the slightly higher total of VAT payable to reflect
the finance element of the leasing charges.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Row brews between BBC and ITC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tension is growing between the BBC and the Independent Television Commission
over the future direction of the corporation's commercial policy.
On Monday night Mr Bob Phillis, deputy director-general of the BBC,
surprised a Royal Television Society dinner by attacking the ITC for its
evidence to the government on the white paper to renew the corporation's
royal charter.
The attack came in part of the speech not released in advance by the BBC.
Minutes after Sir George Russell, chairman of the ITC, had been made a
fellow of the RTS, Mr Phillis criticised the ITC for submitting 'the least
supportive response' to the government.
In its evidence to the government, which was published last month, the ITC
suggested that the BBC 'as a publicly funded broadcaster is not in a
position to balance successfully the mixed cultures of public service
broadcasting and commercial business enterprise'.
The BBC has been encouraged by ministers to develop its commercial
activities worldwide.
Next month, in a joint venture with Pearson, the media group that owns the
Financial Times, the corporation will launch two 24-hour satellite channels
aimed at Europe, one for news and one for entertainment.
The ITC said that the company exploiting the relevant BBC assets and rights
should not be owned by the corporation. Instead the assets should be
franchised for a period to a wholly commercial group by competitive tender.
The ITC called for the creation of an audit committee of BBC governors to
review the franchising arrangements, and the privatisation of BBC
transmitters to provide competition for National Transcomm, which transmits
the commercial broadcasting channels.
Mr Phillis said he had to question whether a regulator 'ought, in effect, to
argue the case for those whom it actually regulates'.
He also said:
A possible move into digital terrestrial television would be damaged
severely by the privatisation of BBC transmitters.
He saw no logic in the franchising suggestion and asked why assets created
by licence payers' money and the skills of BBC staff should be used to
generate profit for shareholders in a franchise vehicle.
Promised licence fee funding would not be put at risk and added that
controls put in place meant that what the ITC described as 'dilemmas of cost
allocation' would not arise.

FT  07 DEC 94 / BSkyB's posters 'trivialise violence'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Advertising Standards Authority has upheld two separate complaints
against British Sky Broadcasting about its poster advertising, accusing the
company of trivialising violent crime.
The ASA findings, published today, follow a request on Monday by the
Independent Television Commission for BSkyB to purge images of Joseph Stalin
from future television advertisements.
The first poster objected to by the ASA was headlined 'The Simpsons. You saw
it first on Sky' next to a police photograph of OJ Simpson, the former
American football player accused of murder. The photograph was captioned
'Sky News. On the hour, every hour, 24 hours'.
The ASA said it considered it offensive 'to trivialise a crime of this
nature by linking it with the cartoon series' of the Simpson family.
The second complaint concerned a poster featuring the chalk outline of a
dead body with an erect penis. The poster was headlined 'Cause of death:
Madonna' and advertised a film on Sky's movie channel. The ASA said it was
concerned about the use of the image, 'particularly in the context of a
poster advertisement'.
BSkyB said the poster was part of a campaign 'characterised by irreverence,
youthful energy, wit and sense of fun'.
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a 17.5 per cent stake in BSkyB.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Ulster peace expected to bring Pounds 180m security cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A saving of Pounds 180m can be expected from cuts in security spending in
the next three years following the paramilitary ceasefires in Northern
Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday.
His announcement of a 'cautious peace dividend' will give a boost to the
local economy before next week's International Investment Conference in
Belfast.
The announcement comes only four days before the planned opening talks
between British government officials and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political
wing.
The savings, which Sir Patrick announced with public spending plans for the
province, represent cuts in the compensation paid for bomb and other
terrorist damage to property and a planned reduction in the overtime bill of
the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
The savings will be reallocated to the education and health budgets.
Spending on law and order, excluding army costs which are carried by the
Ministry of Defence, comes to Pounds 889m a year.
About Pounds 50m will be saved this year, rising to Pounds 60m in 1996-97
and a further Pounds 70m in 1997-98. RUC overtime currently costs Pounds 82m
a year.
Overall spending for Northern Ireland over the period is expected to remain
fairly constant at Pounds 8bn in real terms.
Sir Patrick warned, however, that the measures were contingent on the
ceasefire being maintained. He emphasised that RUC staffing numbers would
remain the same, and that recent security moves, such as reducing police and
army presence on the streets, could be reversed 'within 24 hours'.
Sir Patrick said: 'I hope that we are entering a new phase in the history of
Northern Ireland.
'Peace, if it is seen to be established, will provide a chance for a fresh
start for the people of Northern Ireland who for the first time in 25 years
have had the opportunity to experience daily life free from the fear of
violence.'
Sir Patrick said there had been a 'substantial' number of acceptances of
invitations to the investment conference.
Invitations went out to all elected MPs and MEPs for the opening dinner. The
government said that representatives from the economic committees in Belfast
and Londonderry city councils had been invited to the working sessions.
Sinn Fein seemed set to boycott the investment conference, however, saying
it had been snubbed and demanding treatment equal to that of the other
political parties.
The row surfaced after it emerged that a full invitation to the dinner had
been sent to Mr John Alderdice of the Alliance party, who is a local
councillor and whose party has smaller electoral support than Sinn Fein.
Government officials yesterday said the three Belfast Sinn Fein councillors,
Mr Mairtin Muilleoir, Mr Joe Austin and Ms Una Gillespie, had initially
indicated that they would attend the Wednesday sessions.
Yet Sinn Fein said yesterday it was boycotting the conference and the three
councillors briefly picketed the offices of the Industrial Development
Board, which is organising the conference, saying that they were treated as
'second class citizens'.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Defeat may sound Tory death knell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a serious defeat. Bad now, and potentially more damaging in the
future.
No amount of shoulder shrugging or bluff confidence from the chancellor and
his colleagues can disguise it.
Losing a Budget measure is not the end of the world. Many Conservative
voters will cheer the fact that valued added tax on domestic fuel will not
rise from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent.
But there were plenty of Conservatives at Westminster last night wondering
whether this is the beginning of the end.
Ask a senior minister these days why anyone should believe this government
is capable of winning a fifth term in office and invariably the answer is
that it has time on its side. That means time before an election due by
mid-1997 for economic recovery to erase memories of recession and of broken
promises. And time for Mr Kenneth Clarke to stuff money into the voters'
pockets with cuts in the basic rate of income tax.
The strategy is imperilled. Last week's rebellion over Europe, the constant
hum of speculation about Mr Major's leadership and the defeat over VAT on
fuel should be taken together.
The cumulative effect is to raise a serious question-mark over whether the
Tory party will sustain this administration for a full parliamentary term.
If the government cannot choose the election date it has lost a precious
political asset.
First, however, there is the short term.
Mr Clarke responded instantly to the vote by stressing he would protect the
Budget arithmetic. Other taxes had to rise, spending had to be cut or there
had to be a combination of both to plug the Pounds 1bn hole left by the
government's defeat. The chancellor will publish precise proposals within
days.
He could do nothing else. The financial markets, notably tolerant so far of
these recurring shambles, may decide it is time to punish the government.
A motley crew of Tory rebels has tilted the balance of argument in favour of
any early rise in interest rates. Doubtless Mr Eddie George, the Bank
governor, will make the point in his monthly review of the outlook with Mr
Clarke. By coincidence that meeting is today.
Beyond that, the consequences for the prime minister are as awful as they
are obvious. It was Mr Clarke who insisted on pushing ahead with the
two-stage increase in VAT on domestic fuel first unveiled by his predecessor
Mr Norman Lamont in March last year.
Only a few days ago the chancellor was assuring colleagues that the
rebellion could be faced down. Like a striker on a football pitch his Budget
strategy was to create space - to put himself in a goal-scoring position
before the general election. The second stage of VAT on fuel provided some
of that space.
Mr Jeremy Hanley, the party chairman, had doubts. So too, by some accounts,
did Mr Major. But most cabinet ministers believed to retreat without a fight
after taking so much political flak would have been bad politics as well as
questionable economics.
It is Mr Major who will be caught in the political backlash. When a prime
minister is as beleaguered as he is, then the full force of political
defeats is felt inevitably by 10 Downing Street.
Wisely, Mr Major keeps away from journalists these days. Most have tormented
him ever since sterling's ejection from the European exchange rate mechanism
two years ago. So it is impossible to judge his mood at first hand.
But close friends insist a hangdog demeanour in the Commons in recent weeks
is not a signal that he is about to quit. Rather he is more determined than
ever to prove the critics wrong. The next 12 months will tell whether
determination is enough.
The Conservatives' reputation in the 1980s as a tax-cutting party rested on
a conjuring trick. Over a run of years the tax burden remained constant at
best - even before the hefty post-1992 increases. But successive rises in
the rate and the scope of VAT provided the room for election-winning income
tax cuts.
This administration has come to the end of that particular stretch of road.
By rejecting higher VAT on fuel the Conservative party may have put a
roadblock up against any further extension of the indirect tax base. If that
is the case then the income tax trick will have lost its magic.
Tuppence off the basic rate may be possible without a parallel widening of
the VAT net. But a 20p basic rate looks well beyond reach either side of the
next general election.
There is something else. Last night provided another reminder of how strong
the habit of rebellion has become on the Tory back benches.
Running beneath the sporadic revolts on individual issues has been a
dangerous growth of factionalism - almost a mirror image of the divisions
which tore apart the Labour party in the early 1980s.
For the Conservatives the future of the European Union has been the catalyst
for the corrosion. Unless another truce is called over Europe and Tory
sceptics are brought back into the fold somehow then Mr Major will be
threatened at every turn.
Even with them, the government can no longer be sure that it will get
through its legislation in the present atmosphere. The long game on which
ministers rest their hopes for political revival may no longer be possible.
There are some senior Conservatives at Westminster who argue strongly that
we have all become too excited about such arithmetic.
The Thatcher administrations with their impregnable majorities were an
aberration. Look instead, they say, at how Mr Harold Wilson in the late
1960s and Mr Edward Heath and Mr James Callaghan in the 1970s had to tack
and trim to stay in power.
That is true. But each of those prime ministers lost the succeeding general
election.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Flattery, cash and threats foiled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They threatened. They flattered. They cajoled. And finally they threw more
money at the problem. But still it was not enough to stave off last night's
government defeat over value added tax on fuel.
The defeat was all the more devastating since it followed strenuous efforts
by business managers to dragoon prospective rebels into line.
These efforts culminated just two minutes before the end of last night's
final Budget debate, when Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, acceded to
backbench demands for more compensation for pensioners.
To judge by the relaxed air on the Tory front bench immediately before the
result was announced the government thought it had won. But it was not to
be. By 10.20pm the waving ballot papers on the opposition side of the House
were hailing the defeat.
What may have fooled government business managers was the extent of
opposition among the nine Tory MPs without the whip since last week's vote
of confidence on Europe. Eight of these voted against or abstained.
The government's futile attempts to win the day began last Tuesday, when Mr
Clarke unveiled new compensation measures for pensioners in his Budget
speech.
But it quickly became clear that his package had failed to allay Tory
misgivings. Accordingly, when MPs left for their constituencies two days
later government business managers got on the telephones, seeking to sound
out the detailed concerns of likely rebels.
On Monday afternoon the whips reassembled at Westminster. In what was widely
seen as an early sign that the government was in difficulties, the meeting
went on longer than expected.
Meanwhile in Brussels the chancellor went on the offensive with a warning
that MPs would look 'extremely foolish' if they blocked the government's
proposals. Mr Clarke was backed up by business managers warning that an
increase in income tax or the general rate of VAT was a distinct possibility
if the government lost the vote.
But just before 8pm the government was rocked when Mr David Sumberg, MP for
Bury South, announced on the Commons floor that he would vote with Labour.
By early yesterday afternoon Westminster was livening up.
As Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, opened the last day
of Budget debates Mr Clarke and Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip, embarked on a
series of meetings with the most likely rebels. Emerging from a meeting with
Mr Ryder soon after 5pm Sir Andrew Bowden, MP for Brighton Kemptown,
explained that ministers had not conceded his calls for an extra Pounds 88m
worth of concessions to pensioners.
At an increasingly tense Westminster MPs who were confidently expected to
vote with the government were seen in animated conversation with whips and
ministers in another bad sign for the government.
Then came another crucial meeting between Mr Clarke and potential rebels, at
which the government is said to have made clear for the first time that it
was prepared to put up more money, in response to Sir Andrew's demands.
This appears to have been enough for him. But 15 Tory MPs defied the
government.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Defiant Clarke pledges to maintain recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, told the Commons last night that the
package of taxation measures and public spending cuts he would unveil
tomorrow would ensure that the strength of the economic recovery was
sustained.
Ignoring cries of 'resign' from jeering Labour MPs he made it clear that the
proposals would fill the gap in his Budget calculations resulting from the
government's dramatic eight-vote defeat (319-311). The result meant Labour
had succeeded in its bid to prevent the planned increase from 8 per cent to
17.5 per cent value added tax on domestic fuel from April.
The Conservative MPs who voted against the government were: Mr Michael
Carttiss, Mr Paul Marland, Mr Tony Marlow, Mr Richard Shepherd, Mr David
Sumberg, Mrs Ann Winterton, and Mr Nicholas Winterton.
Tories who abstained were: Mr Phil Gallie, Mr Christopher Gill, Sir Richard
Body, Sir Rhodes Boyson, Mrs Teresa Gorman, Mr William Powell, Sir Teddy
Taylor and Mr John Wilkinson.
Jubilant Labour MPs cheered when Mr Clarke undertook to include a clause in
the forthcoming finance bill to hold the VAT on domestic fuel at the 8 per
cent rate.
He said his package of measures to fill the gap caused by Labour's
'opportunistic' manoeuvre would be designed to ensure that the scheduled
reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement remained on course.
Mr Clarke said: 'Proceeding in that way is essential to keep this recovery
on course to achieve the prosperity and jobs we need in this country.'
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said the move to increase VAT on
domestic had been stopped dead in its tracks. He described it as a
'humiliating defeat' for the cabinet, for the chancellor and for Mr John
Major, the prime minister.
Mr Brown said VAT should never have been imposed on domestic fuel in the
first place in view of the pledges given by the prime minister that its
scope would not be extended.
Mr Major gestured in irritation when Mr Brown insisted that 'promises made
by political parties at elections should be kept'.
The shadow chancellor told protesting Tory backbenchers that they would have
to listen to the British people. He said that the government's defeat
signalled a turning point in British politics.
To further Labour cheers he said: 'The Conservative party may remain in
office. But they are tired. They are discredited and they are out of touch.'
Ministers scoffed when Mr Brown said that it was the Labour party that now
represented and spoke for the people of Britain.
Mr Clarke rejected a suggestion by Mr Brown that he should consult
opposition leaders before reaching decisions about the package of proposals
to be unveiled tomorrow.
Backed by government cheers the chancellor said that the failure of Labour
MPs to produce any practical proposals to replace the revenue lost by
keeping VAT on domestic fuel at 8 per cent showed that they were 'utterly
unfitted to take forward the affairs of this country'.
Mr Clarke said Labour MPs had been irresponsible as well as opportunistic in
defeating the government. 'They may gloat today, but we have the
responsibility of keeping British industry on course tomorrow,' he said.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said the government
had suffered a 'monumental rejection' of its policies. A discredited
government had been rejected by the Commons and it should get out, he said.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Celebrities line up for road protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Protest groups fighting proposals to build or widen roads across
environmentally sensitive land and near houses are signing up celebrity
support across the country.
The Department of Transport's plan to build an 11-mile stretch of dual
carriageway close to the existing A27 north of Lewes in East Sussex is one
proposal which has attracted much celebrity support.
Designed to facilitate east-west traffic, particularlycoming off the M23
around Brighton and Lewes, it will cut through the South Downs, an area of
outstanding natural beauty.
The 1,000-member A27 Action Group, formed in January, counts among its
backers Sir Dirk Bogarde, the actor, Lord Healey, the former chancellor of
the exchequer, and Lord Skidelsky, the economist and political historian.
With such heavyweight opponents the road's backers, which include East
Sussex County Council and local chambers of commerce, will have their work
cut out in the publicity war.
The road is on the DoT's priority two list, so it may not be built for ten
years. A public inquiry is not likely for another two years at least.
Mr Nick Davies, secretary of the A27 Action Group, said the road would cost
Pounds 70m and be the biggest construction project ever in the area.' It
would cause considerable damage to our homes, our countryside and our
health,' he said.
He said that there had already been too much development along the south
coast and disputed the economic case for the development.
Mr Bob Wilkins, East Sussex county engineer, rejected comparisons with
Twyford Down, where the M3 extension was the subject of a bitter protest.
He said: 'There is not a physical cut through the downs like there was at
Twyford. The road will run around the side of Mount Cabourn. It will be a
dual carriageway, not a superhighway. It will not be lit along the route, as
critics have suggested. It is true there will be an elevated ramp going up
to 35 feet. But this will be of short duration. Proper landscaping could
make the ramp unobtrusive.'
The county council wants the extension to help with tourism - the county's
main industry - and to help fill a number of small industrial estates.
Mr Robert Caffyn, a local industrialist, has written: 'Tourists enjoy
Eastbourne when they arrive but complain bitterly about the last part of the
journey. Large employers have left the town largely because of poor access.'
The council says that the A27 is dangerous, with too much traffic, too many
blind bends and too many accidents. It said that in the first six months of
the year the number of accidents doubled compared with the same period of
last year.
Mr Davies agreed that the road was dangerous and inadequate. 'But that does
not mean you have to build a new road,' he said. Black spots could be
converted to dual carriageway 'as an interim measure'.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Roche to sell or close drugs research centre in Edinburgh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 280-employee drug development centre in Edinburgh is to close or be sold
by its new owner, Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals company.
Roche said yesterday: 'We are in the process of trying to sell it.' A
decision would probably be made by the end of January whether a sale of all
or part of the centre was possible or whether it would close.
A closure would be a blow to the small Scottish pharmaceuticals research
sector.
The centre was acquired by Roche in May, when it bought Syntex, a
Californian drugs company, for Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.23bn).
The company said that employees at the Edinburgh centre, which conducts
pre-clinical trials with potential drugs discovered at other parts of
Syntex, would be free to apply for vacancies in Roche.
The company has its own research centre in the UK, in Welwyn Garden City,
Hertfordshire, which employs about 300 people.
Roche has said that it plans to cut 5,000 jobs worldwide from its
pharmaceutical division following the integration of Syntex, including
several hundreds at its Basle headquarters.
Roche retains its Scottish manufacturing plant, at Dalry in Ayrshire, which
makes vitamin C.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Minister faces legal challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government faces a further embarrassing legal challenge to a ministerial
decision following a High Court ruling yesterday.
Two sisters who had murder convictions quashed because their trial was
prejudiced by press coverage were granted leave to seek a judicial review of
the solicitor-general's decision not to bring contempt proceedings against
the newspapers involved.
Michelle and Lisa Taylor were jailed for life at the Old Bailey in July 1992
for the murder of bank clerk Alison Shaughnessy. Their convictions were
quashed by the Court of Appeal last June.
The judges ordered the trial papers to be sent to Sir Nicholas Lyell,
attorney-general, to consider contempt proceedings against The Sun, Daily
Mirror, Daily Star and Daily Express. Sir Derek Spencer, solicitor-general,
acting for Sir Nicholas, decided proceedings were 'not appropriate'.
Mr Justice Schiemann, giving leave to the sisters to challenge that
decision, rejected the government argument that, because of the
attorney-general's unique role as 'guardian of the public interest', his
decisions could not be reviewed by the High Court.
Mr Geoffrey Robertson QC, counsel for the sisters, told the judge it was the
first occasion in British history when a court had ruled that defendants
were denied the right to a fair trial as a result of prejudicial press
coverage.
Mr Robertson said it was the sisters' concern that the same thing might
happen again and that others might suffer as they had suffered if the
attorney-general did not act.
Prejudicial material which was inadmissible in court might be published  -
as in the sisters' case - 'and so the danger of trial by newspaper will
become a reality', he said.

FT  07 DEC 94 / FT Conferences: BT urges end of support for telecoms rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Preferential support for new contenders in the telecommunications market
should be abandoned soon, Sir Iain Vallance, British Telecommunications
chairman, said yesterday.
Speaking on the first day of a Financial Times conference, he said: 'I am
not suggesting limits or controls on market entry. But I am suggesting that
the phase of preferential support for new entrants may soon be ready to
close.'
He also looked forward to deregulated telecoms markets elsewhere in Europe,
arguing that there was a need to develop a 'common and converging'
regulatory framework worldwide.
Sir Iain was speaking a day before the publication by Oftel, the telecoms
regulator, of a consultative document that is expected to precipitate a
fierce debate about the role of regulation in the UK industry.
Since BT was privatised a decade ago a variety of devices have been employed
to protect newcomers from BT's market power and promote competition. The
most important instruments are regulations to keep call prices up and access
prices down. BT is prevented by means of an agreed formula from raising
prices overall. At present the cap is the retail prices index minus 7 1/2
percentage points.
Sir Iain said there should be three specific milestones towards a new
regime:
A commitment to deregulate all retail price activity from 1997. Specific
time limitations on any remaining market entry supports.
A stable and explicit regime for interconnection services that applies to
all licensed network operators.
At present competing operators pay BT a fee for interconnection to its
network to route calls to their eventual destination. The way the
interconnection charge is calculated has been challenged by BT's
competitors.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Nolan to probe NHS and House of Lords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Nolan committee on standards in public life will include National Health
Service trusts and the House of Lords among three 'key areas' in its first
report, to be published next spring.
They will be examined alongside the more widely expected subjects of the
lobbying and financial interests of MPs, and the rules governing the conduct
of ministers and civil servants.
The committee, established by Mr John Major after October's 'cash for
questions' row in the House of Commons, will take written and oral evidence
in the new year.
Lord Nolan, a law lord, said he expected the oral hearings to be in public,
and the committee intended to study overseas practice - particularly recent
moves to regulate abuse of public office in France, the US, Ireland and
Australia, especially Queensland.
He said the three main areas to be covered by the first report would be:
Parliament, including 'cash for questions' in the Commons and the role of
lobbyists. In October controversy about this caused the resignation of Mr
Neil Hamilton and Mr Tim Smith from the government.
Ministers and civil servants - notably the acceptance of gifts, possible
conflicts of interest, and employment on leaving office, issues raised by
cases of former ministers and civil servants taking jobs with companies for
which they were responsible in government.
The 'big spending quangos', including NHS trusts, where the committee will
examine methods of appointment, possible conflicts of interest and standards
of conduct.
The inclusion of NHS trusts in the first report reflects sustained
controversy in the past year about the appointment of leading Conservatives
to the boards of NHS trusts, and their level of remuneration.
The inclusion of the House of Lords was less widely expected. One member of
the committee, Lord Thomson of Monifieth, a former Labour minister, said the
committee would examine the case for obliging peers to enter their outside
financial concerns in a register of interests akin to that used in the
Commons.
By convention peers declare relevant financial interests at the beginning of
speeches in the Lords, but the upper house has no formal register. A move to
introduce one would be highly controversial, particularly among Tory peers,
many of whom are company directors.
The committee yesterday published a note raising the questions it intended
to address. It noted on the issue of MPs' pay and outside interests that the
level of parliamentary salaries 'is in itself not a matter for us', but
added: 'Our task is to consider whether the present relationship between
MPs' parliamentary responsibilities and their outside interests gives rise
to difficulties, and if so whether changes are needed.'
Lord Nolan said the committee would not tackle areas such as local
government, universities and the honours system until the initial report was
completed.

FT  07 DEC 94 / MPs cast doubt on benefits from freed gas market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A cross-party committee of MPs yesterday cast doubt on claims that the
planned liberalisation of the domestic gas market would lead to substantial
savings for consumers.
The Commons trade and industry committee said in a report which gave a
guarded welcome to liberalisation that consumers would benefit from a choice
of supplier, and some cost savings were likely.
But Mr Richard Caborn, the committee's Labour chairman, said there was no
evidence that liberalisation would bring 'immediate and substantial price
cuts'.
Many prospective rivals of British Gas have predicted that competition could
result in savings of as much as 10 per cent on current prices.
Mr Caborn's view was echoed by Conservative committee members. Mr John
Butterfill said the abolition of British Gas's monopoly on supplying 18m
households was unlikely to produce a 'consumer bonanza'.
The government and several independent gas marketing companies disagreed. Mr
Tim Eggar, energy minister, said he would be surprised if 'a very
significant number of consumers' were not offered such discounts when the
market was opened in 1996.
Several independent gas marketers yesterday said they stuck by their
forecasts of 10 per cent price cuts.
Mr Caborn said the committee found that the scope for reductions was limited
as a high proportion of costs were fixed. He said only '25 per cent of the
total price of gas would be open to competition'.
The committee welcomed the government's 'more pragmatic' approach to
liberalisation. Two modest regional pilot programmes are planned in 1996 and
1997 before full competition in 1998.
The committee was also assured that competition would not result in
'millions of losers' as British Gas had claimed in the past.
But Mr Caborn said parliament should receive a full report on the
performance of the pilot programmes before full liberalisation was allowed
to proceed.
Mr Eggar said it 'gives me no problem' if the committee wanted to stay close
to the issue. But he was less receptive to the committee's suggestion that
the new gas bill address detailed concerns.
Both the Department of Trade and Industry and Ofgas, the industry regulator,
prefer that the primary legislation be kept relatively short, with the
detailed conditions of competition contained in the new public gas supply
licenses being prepared by Ofgas.
The committee agreed that the introduction of competition would lead to
differences in pricing for various categories of gas customers. But it
emphasised that there should be no unfair discrimination against low volume
users.

But Mr Ralph Preece, a partner at Touche Ross, said the inclusion of a

counted separately, boosted the overall tally and gave a 'bleaker impression
than is perhaps the case'.

British Telecommunications yesterday assured its workforce that it saw no
need for any compulsory redundancies 'in the foreseeable future'.
The group, which this year announced plans for 15,000 redundancies during
its current financial year, has so far agreed 13,000 voluntary redundancies
and said this year's programme was on target.
Unions said they were pleased that they had been able to negotiate the
redeployment of staff members who wished to stay.
In August Sir Iain Vallance, BT chairman, said he was aiming to shed a
further one-third of the group's workforce - 50,000 jobs - in the medium
term.
This week Mercury Communications, BT's biggest competitor, said it would cut
2,500 jobs.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Roche to close or sell drug centre

FT  07 DEC 94 / Scottish spending plan is criticised
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday described the 1994-95 public spending settlement
for Scotland as an increase, while the opposition attacked it as a cut in
real terms.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, told the Commons the Pounds 14.25bn
settlement was an increase of about Pounds 250m on this year's spending and
1 per cent higher than previous plans. The 'very fair' settlement amounted
to more Pounds 6,200 for every home in Scotland.
Mr George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary, said total spending over the
next three years would fall by more than 4 per cent in real terms. He warned
that jobs and services would be cut.
Comparing the spending plans with those for Wales, Northern Ireland and
England, he complained that Scotland was being 'short-changed yet again'.
The settlement was 'nothing short of a personal humiliation' for Mr Lang and
a 'hammer-blow for Scotland'.
Mr Lang said that thanks to lower inflation, spending power in 1995-96 would
be 2.5 per cent higher than expected. But the government could not let that
'feed through into a higher level of real spending without jeopardising' the
broader objectives of sustained growth.
Apart from the Scottish Prison Service, which would get extra cash, the cost
of running other departments would fall over the next three years by more
than 10 per cent.
Mr Lang was 'tightening up aspects of the capital control regime', and from
April next year notional receipts from the lease of assets to third parties
would not entitle councils to extra capital spending.
But with capital spending from all sources likely to exceed Pounds 1.2bn
next year, the resources available to local authorities for investment
remained substantial.
Mr Lang also said education spending would exceed Pounds 1.35bn next year
and Pounds 1.8bn would go on industry, enterprise and training over the next
three years.

FT  07 DEC 94 / London is biggest winner of regeneration funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London was the biggest winner in the first competition for funds under the
unified Single Regeneration Budget, announced by the Department of the
Environment yesterday.
Projects in London received commitments of Pounds 36.5m for 1995-96 out of a
total of Pounds 125m available.
The government has also committed Pounds 225m to the winning projects for
each of the following two years. Funding for some long-running projects will
last for seven years.
Total funding over the seven years will be about Pounds 757m, of which
London will receive Pounds 316.7m.
The budget, announced earlier this year, unites 20 existing regeneration
programmes from five government departments. Projects, led by local
authorities, Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs), or private sector
organisations, had to submit competitive bids, which were then judged by
civil servants.
More than half of the 469 bids received were unsuccessful, while others
received less funding than they had requested.
The cross-party Association of District Councils said that many local
authorities had wasted time and resources in abortive work. It said this
would not have happened if bids were negotiated rather than competitive.
The process should be made clearer, it said, and regional regeneration
statements should be developed so that in future the budget could be focused
on the needs of regions.
Sir Jeremy Beecham, chairman of the Labour-controlled Association of
Metropolitan Authorities, described the process as 'a series of arbitrary
acts of patronage out of place in a democracy'.
Saying the money was as welcome to the winners as 'a chance win on the
National Lottery', Sir Jeremy pointed out that the announcement came days
after the government's revenue support settlement for local authorities had
cut Pounds 900m from the amount local authorities could spend on capital
projects next year.
In London the biggest winners were the 'Thames Gateway' region in east
London, which Mr David Curry, local government minister, described as 'an
area of real opportunity', and the Upper Lee Valley, straddling the north
London boroughs of Haringey and Enfield.
Projects in the Gateway region receive Pounds 54m in total over seven years,
with various projects to improve skills across east London receiving a
further Pounds 17.7m.
In the Upper Lee Valley, which will receive Pounds 40m over seven years,
funding will go towards two business support centres, and a series of
infrastructure and communications projects. North London Tec predicted that
15,000 jobs would be created in the area.
Several more rural areas have also won funds. The West Cornwall Initiative
won Pounds 2.8m while the Energising Eastbourne scheme received Pounds 1.5m.
The Battle for Hastings project will receive Pounds 450m.
The Lancashire towns of Blackburn and Burnley won the greatest funding
outside London, both with commitments of Pounds 19.5m over seven years.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Clarke condemns Labour over its stance on VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, accused Labour leaders in the Commons
last night of failing to face up to the policy implications of their attempt
to prevent value added tax on domestic fuel being increased from 8 per cent
to 17.5 per cent in April.
As the five-day Budget debate neared its conclusion he urged them to show
their commitment to healthy public finances by indicating whether they
wanted lower taxation or higher public borrowing.
Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow trade and industry secretary, refused to
anticipate a Labour budget, which was unlikely to be introduced for another
2 1/2 years. He said Mr Clarke was being 'absolutely fatuous' in making such
a demand.
Ministers and Tory backbenchers were repeatedly accused from the opposition
benches of breaching specific promises not to extend VAT to domestic fuel.
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, initiated the charges during Question Time
exchanges before the start of the debate.
He said that in the subsequent vote on a Labour procedural motion, designed
to provide an opportunity to reconsider the decision to increase VAT on
domestic fuel, there would be 'two types of Tory MP' taking part, those who
would 'abide by their specific promise' not to extend VAT to domestic fuel
and those who would make any promise to get elected with no intention of
keeping it.
He asked ministers if they were really saying that there was no other way of
restoring the nation's finances 'than through this most hated and unpopular
tax'.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, defended the VAT
increase and insisted that it had enabled the chancellor to produce a Budget
that had 'gained the confidence of the markets'.
Underlining the importance of market confidence, Mr Heseltine said it was
'an essential pre-requisite' to maintaining the economic growth on which the
prosperity of the nation depended.
He urged Labour MPs who impugned the integrity of ministers to examine the
role of Mr Blair in seeking to abandon their party's principles in regard to
public ownership and opposition to grant maintained schools.
Mr Heseltine said government policies were delivering a strong and
prosperous economy and attacked Labour MPs for failing to acknowledge the
'transformation' that had taken place over the past 15 years.
He contrasted their attitude to that of managers in industry and commerce
who knew 'just how exciting are the prospects for their products and
services in world markets'.

There was no claim of responsibility. The bombs were in video cassettes and

FT  07 DEC 94 / World Trade News: US and Japan to resume glass talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US and Japan were yesterday due to re-open talks aimed at fulfilling an
autumn pledge to open Japan's Dollars 4.5bn flat-glass market.
The two sides struck an agreement in principle in early October but
negotiations have failed to yield an actual pact. The two sides have agreed
the principles for opening Japan's flat glass market but some issues remain
over the details of foreign access and technical aspects.
Washington and Tokyo decided to extend the deadline for agreement on the
flat glass sector negotiations after last month's failure to secure a
comprehensive accord. Japan has agreed to promote the use of foreign-made
glass in some government-funded facilities which would serve as model
projects.
There is also broad agreement on the use of objective criteria to measure
progress in import penetration. Differences remain, however, over whether
the objective criteria should be forward-looking, as the US hopes, or should
only measure past developments, as the Japanese insist.
Japanese officials are concerned that forward-looking measures could turn
into restrictive targets aimed at ensuring a specific market share for
foreign products in the domestic glass market.
There has been less progress in parallel talks on access for US vehicles and
vehicle parts in the Japanese market. Negotiations have not been resumed
since September when the US cited Japan's vehicle parts after-sales market
as being characterised by 'unfair and discriminatory trade practices' and
unilaterally began an investigation under Section 301 of its trade act.

FT  07 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Scania plans attack on Renault's
domination of French bus sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ANGERS.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Scania, the Swedish commercial vehicle maker, is to start assembly of buses
at its plant at Angers in western France.
It is also raising truck output at the plant, which was opened in 1992 as
the group's third European truck assembly facility, to meet rising demand in
Europe.
Mr Bengt Klingberg, president of Scania Production Angers, said truck
assembly in France had risen from 7 units a day last January to 25 units a
day now. In that time the workforce had doubled to 400.
Production would be raised to 34 trucks a day by April with an increase in
the labour force to 485 as the plant reached its full single shift capacity
of more than 7,000 trucks a year.
The move to begin bus assembly in Angers is part of the group's strategy for
expanding its share of the west European heavy bus and coach market from 6
per cent at present to 10 per cent by the end of the decade.
In France it is seeking to weaken the domination of the market by Renault,
the French state-owned car and commercial vehicle maker, and Heuliez, its
bus-making affiliate.
Mr Arne Karlsson, head of Scania Buses &amp; Coaches, said the company planned
to begin bus production in Angers in the second half of 1996. It would
produce a range of city and inter-city buses with capacity planned to rise
to around 300 a year by the end of the 1990s. The project will create around
250 jobs at full production.
Mr Karlsson said the move signalled Scania's increased interest in the
French market. The ability to offer locally built products would provide 'a
major competitive edge' over European rivals importing buses into France.
France has a total market of around 3,000 city, route, and tourist buses and
coaches a year, of which more than 75 per cent are supplied by domestic
manufacturers. Around two-thirds of the market are city and route buses.
The bus industry in Europe is going through a period of far-reaching
restructuring with several of the leading truck and bus chassis makers such
as Mercedes-Benz, Volvo and Scania moving to take over small bus and coach
body builders in a sector which has been highly fragmented.
Earlier this year Scania, the world's fifth largest manufacturer of
heavy-duty buses and coaches, acquired DAB-Silkeborg, the Danish bus
manufacturer, with an annual capacity for 300 buses. It has also entered
joint ventures to assemble buses in Poland, Russia and Estonia.
Mr Karlsson said the restructuring in the bus industry would 'continue for
some time yet'. He warned that there was a large number of coachbuilders in
particular in southern Europe, that 'may run into trouble' because of new
market requirements and more stringent legislation.

<TEXT>
Ecuador will be hit if the European Union decides to remove flowers, tuna
fish, and shrimp from the general system of preferences granted to Andean
countries, according to the government. Support for the Andean countries'
export industries through tariff concessions has been part of a EU policy
that recognises efforts by Andean Pact governments in the fight against
narcotics trafficking. A few weeks ago EU delegates to the Andean-European
Commission recommended to the EU Council a 10-year renewal of the existing
trade preference list.
A preliminary decision, to be confirmed or rejected by the Council of
Ministers on December 19, would remove these agricultural products from the
preference list. For Ecuador, which is pursuing free-trade policies and
seeking entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, this comes as
yet another blow, after the US earlier this year imposed anti-dumping
tariffs on its flower exports.

'Capital investment will account for 25 per cent of the total and the rest

But the company has still to reach a profit agreement with local government
before a contract can be signed. 'We hope they will accept Huaneng's current

In June, the ministry cleared a price policy for Huaneng based on a 15 per

Singapore has called for tenders for two light-rail train (LRT) systems
which will serve as feeder services to stations on the existing mass rapid
transit (MRT) rail network. Each of the new LRT systems will be about 10km
long and cost about SDollars 300m (USDollars 205m). Although Singapore has
one of the world's most modern and efficient transport systems, the
government is under political pressure to improve the network.
A licensing system which seeks to limit the number of cars on Singapore's
roads has pushed the price of owning a vehicle beyond the reach of many
citizens. 'We cannot promise every Singaporean a car,' said Mr Mah Bow Tan,
communications minister. 'But we can promise every Singaporean a
comfortable, convenient and cost-effective transport system.' Tenders have
been called on a turnkey basis, with submission by the end of January.
Preference will be given to proposals involving joint ventures with equity
participation by Singapore-owned companies.

process brings dividends for exporters

<TEXT>
Israeli exports to Asia have risen by a third in the first nine months of
this year, highlighting the growing trade benefits resulting from the Middle
East peace process, according to Israeli Treasury officials.
Including diamonds, Israeli exports to Asia climbed to Dollars 2.3bn between
January and September compared to Dollars 1.8bn for the same period in 1993.
The Treasury said the trend reflected the development of non-traditional
markets. Exports to Asia now account for 12.4 per cent of total Israeli
exports, compared to only 8.1 per cent in 1992, the Treasury said.
The figures were announced ahead of next week's visit to Tokyo by the
Israeli prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin. During the visit, the first to
Japan by an Israeli premier, Mr Rabin is expected to sign two agreements;
the first on cultural exchanges and the second on co-operation in science
and technology. Israeli officials said the visit would be a landmark in
Israeli-Japanese relations after a prolonged period in which Israel regarded
Tokyo as taking a pro-Arab line on foreign policy because of its dependence
on Arab crude oil.
Israeli exports to Japan rose 17.5 per cent in the first nine months of this
year to Dollars 681.5m, compared to Dollars 579.6m for the same period in
1993. However, almost 70 per cent of Israeli exports to Japan are diamonds.
Since the Israeli-Palestinian peace breakthrough last September, Mr Rabin
has also visited China, Singapore and Indonesia. After his visit to Tokyo he
will travel to South Korea.
The Treasury also said that total exports, including services, are forecast
to grow by approximately 9 per cent this year, after a 12 per cent increase
last year, and that the high level of inward investment in the Israeli
economy would ensure continued high growth of exports in 1995.
Israeli exports of merchandise, excluding diamonds and services, reached
Dollars 10bn in the first ten months of this year - an increase of 12.1 per
cent in real terms over last year.
Agricultural exports rose 7.2 per cent during the first ten months and
industrial exports, excluding diamonds, climbed 12.3 per cent. Exports rose
3 per cent to the European Union, 13 per cent to the European Free Trade
Association and 7 per cent to the US.

FT  07 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Big coalfield reclamation agreed - Germany
to spend DM12bn on clean-up of lignite sites
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's federal and state authorities are to pay DM12bn (Dollars 8bn) for
one of the largest reclamation programmes for eastern Germany's open cast
brown coal, or lignite, fields.
The environment ministry yesterday confirmed that the programme will run a
further five years to 2002. It was begun in 1991 and had been due to end in
1997. . The extension follows agreement by environmental ministers from the
eastern German states to provide additional financing.
Strabag, Hochtief, and Thyssen Handelsunion, the country's largest
construction and engineering companies, are expected to play a major role in
removing contaminated material and reclaiming at least 10,000 hectares.
But the Treuhand privatisation agency, which oversees land reclamation
projects in eastern Germany, rejected a bid from Morrison Knudsen, the US
mining corporation, to participate in the project. Along with Britain's
PowerGen and NRG of Minneapolis, Morrison Knudsen last year bought the
viable parts of the Mibrag brown coal fields which straddle the eastern
states of Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt. The uneconomic parts are being closed by
the Treuhand.
Depending on the level of contamination, the reclaimed land will generally
be used for recreation or farming. Already some of Mibrag's sites have been
turned into lakes and leisure centres.
The financing of the project, considered by energy experts as one of the
environmental ministry's most ambitious land reclamation projects in eastern
Germany, will be split between the Bund, or federal authorities, and the
eastern states. The Bund will pay 75 per cent.
The environment ministry estimated approximately DM1.5bn would be spent each
year from 1995 to finance the project, in addition to the DM6bn already
spent.
'But apart from bringing the land back to economic use, the decision to
continue the land reclamation programme until 2002 means that 17,000
full-time jobs - maybe even 20,000 - will be guaranteed,' the ministry said.
Many of the employees are former miners made redundant after German
unification.
The land reclamation schemes follow closures of several uneconomic brown
coal fields belonging to Laubag, eastern Germany's largest lignite complex,
located in the eastern state of Brandenburg, and Mibrag.
Brown coal, one of the main culprits of east Germany's environmental
problems under the communists, was the main source of energy for the
region's factories.
Laubag was recently sold to a west German energy consortium led by
Rheinbraun, the brown coal subsidiary of RWE, the country's largest utility,
and including PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk.

FT  07 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Change of heart by US on Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US is expected this week to withdraw its threat to leave the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade soon after the World Trade Organisation,
Gatt's successor, comes into force on January 1. The move would have left
those countries which were not WTO members by the date the US left without
legal protection for existing Gatt benefits.
Washington's change of heart follows a deal between the leading trading
nations under which WTO members will have the right to pull out of Gatt
after the end of next year. Since virtually all Gatt's 124 members are
expected to be WTO members by then, Gatt will effectively cease to exist.
During 1995 Gatt and WTO rules will run in parallel, a legally uncomfortable
arrangement that the US had wanted to avoid. WTO rules and commitments will
take precedence where the two overlap or conflict. Trade diplomats said
yesterday that the deal, worked out last weekend between the US, European
Union, Japan and Canada had won broad acceptance among Gatt members. It was
expected to be formally endorsed at tomorrow's WTO implementation conference
which must decide on transitional arrangements.
However, to the alarm of trading partners, the US was sticking to its
intention to leave the various voluntary Gatt codes of fair trade practice
early next year. This would deprive countries of the right to challenge US
anti-dumping and anti-subsidy actions initiated under Gatt rules.
The WTO anti-dumping and countervailing duty accords, which will apply to
all WTO members, allow recourse to the organisation's disputes procedure
only for suits filed after January 1. Suits filed before that date could
result in duties being imposed which could not be challenged either under
the WTO or under the Gatt codes because the US would no longer be a member.
Washington has said it is prepared to acknowledge cases already going
through Gatt procedures, which include an important EU challenge on
anti-subsidy duties on steel. US officials claim withdrawal will not make
much difference to the outcome of these disputes, since under existing Gatt
rules any nation can block adoption of panel rulings it disputes.
Trade officials were also trying to sort out before tomorrow's meeting a
wrangle over who should chair the key WTO committee which will monitor the
dismantlement of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement restricting imports of textiles
and clothing from the Third World. The decision on who should head the WTO,
could be postponed to early next year.

Mr Ahn Byong-hwa, a former South Korean state utility chairman, was
sentenced yesterday to three years in prison for receiving bribes in
connection with a multi-billion dollar nuclear power project. The heads of
three conglomerates involved in the 1990 project were also found guilty of
giving bribes to Mr Ahn and received a suspended 10-month prison sentence
each. A three-judge court said the business leaders were given lenient
sentences in consideration of their contribution to the nation's economic
development.
Mr Ahn, who served as president of the state-run Korea Electric Power in
1989-92, was charged with receiving Dollars 1.1m in bribes in connection
with a Dollars 2bn nuclear power project. The three business leaders
involved are Mr Kim Woo-joong of the Daewoo group, Mr Choi Won-suk of the Mr
Dong Ah group and Mr Park Ki-suk of Samsung Construction a construction arm
of the giant Samsung group. The outcome came as a surprise in a country
where businessmen usually maintain close ties with the government. Few
business leaders have been punished in the past although some have been
found involved in corruption and other scandals.

<TEXT>
The Australian transport group Mayne Nickless, and a number of its present
and former executives, yesterday agreed to settle a price-fixing case
brought against it by the Trade Practices Commission (TPC), Australia's
competition watchdog. Mayne Nickless was ordered to pay ADollars 7.7m
(Pounds 3.8m) in penalties and costs. Executives on whom penalties were
imposed included Mr William Bytheway, Mayne's managing director. The company
said it had discontinued the defence 'reluctantly'. The prospect of a long
court case would have 'absorbed enormous management resources', it said.
The TPC had alleged that Mayne, together with TNT Australia and Ansett
Transport Industries, ran a cartel in the express freight industry from the
1970s to the early 1990s. It alleged that the companies, with an aggregate
90 per cent market share, had arrangements not to poach each other's
clients. If a customer did switch carriers, the new carrier 'burnt' the
client, by raising rates or providing poor service, so that the client
returned to the original service provider.

<TEXT>
Ali Vakili Rad was sentenced in Paris yesterday to life in prison for the
1991 assassination of Shapour Bakhtiar, the late Shah of Iran's last prime
minister. A second Iranian, Massoud Hendi, was sentenced to 10 years in
prison for complicity in the case, but Mr Zeynalabedine Sarhadi, a
great-nephew of Iran's President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, was acquitted
and ordered freed by the court. Mr Sarhadi's acquittal was likely to be
greeted with relief on the part of French diplomats because his presence in
the dock had been the focus of high tension between Paris and Tehran during
the month-long trial.
Prosecutors had argued that the three men had acted on direct orders from
Iran's revolutionary government, and Mr Sarhadi had been accused of being
the key link between the Iranian intelligence services and the assassins.
Mr Bakhtiar, overthrown in the 1979 Islamic revolution, and Mr Sorush
Katibeh, his secretary, were found with their throats slit at their Paris
home. Two other alleged killers are to be tried later in absentia along with
four other alleged accomplices. Iran has always denied any involvement in
the killing.

FT  07 DEC 94 / India's October exports up 27%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India's exports soared 26.9 per cent in October to Dollars 2.2bn,
confounding fears they would be affected by the plague which hit parts of
the country and caused panic around the world. The October increase, the
biggest monthly improvement this year, took the rise in exports for the
first seven months of the financial year, starting in April, to 13.9 per
cent, above the 9.4 per cent recorded in the first three months when concern
arose about apparent sluggishness of exports. But that growth rate still
lags behind the record 20 per cent posted in the year to March 1994 and is
short of the government's 15 per cent target for 1994-95.
Imports in October also rose sharply, by 29.7 per cent, to Dollars 2.33bn,
mainly because of a sharp increase in industrial output which draws in
imports of machinery and other capital goods. The commerce ministry said
that while the recovery in industry, after three years' stagnation, was
welcome, the trade deficit needed watching.
The ministry said the impact on trade of the plague, which killed about 50
people before it was brought under control in October, had been
'insignificant' despite curbs imposed by many importing countries. While
relief may be premature, since the curbs could have affected shipments made
after October, it is clear that estimates of export losses of Dollars 1bn
are wide of the mark.
The government's latest sale of shares in state-owned companies has had a
poor response, with investors taking up only 12 per cent of the 345m shares
on offer. The sale of the shares in six state-owned undertakings, all of
which are listed on the stock exchanges, raised Rs22.3bn (Pounds 443m), a
fraction of the government's target. India is selling shares in about 35
central government businesses to raise funds and grant a measure of
management independence. But the government is retaining a controlling stake
of at least 51 per cent in each company and has no full-scale privatisation
plans.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Patience runs out in S Africa: A look at grievances over
living conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As so often in the past, downtown Johannesburg on Monday night was the scene
of violent confrontation between angry black demonstrators and police. But
unlike the clashes of earlier years, this was no clear-cut battle between
the heartless enforcers of apartheid and their defiant victims.
Instead, it was triggered by police evicting homeless people who had
illegally occupied a vacant building in protest at the government's seeming
inability to find them alternative accommodation.
Images of destitute families thrown out on to the street encapsulate a cruel
moral and practical dilemma for the African National Congress-led
government: how can it cater to the demands of its long-suffering black
constituents while reintroducing a culture of law and order?
'Disaffection is growing,' says Mr David Maepa, a local government expert
with First National Bank. 'People are willing to wait if they know something
is being done, but the impression the government gives is of talk and no
action.'
Part of the problem is a crisis in local government across the country. On
everything from the provision of housing to the building of schools, the ANC
has insisted communities should be directly involved; the problem is that as
yet, there exist no post-apartheid local authorities qualified or equipped
to assume such roles.
'At national level, the legitimacy crisis was solved (through the April
elections) before delivery (on black expectations). At local level, the
problems of legitimacy and delivery will have to be confronted at the same
time,' Mr Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, the veteran political analyst charged
with running new local government elections, said in a recent article.
The problem is unlikely to be resolved soon. A year ago, constitutional
negotiators confidently predicted the first democratic local elections would
take place by the end of November. Six months later, the new government put
this date back by a year for logistical reasons, but retained the beginning
of December as the target for integrating white towns and black townships
into single metropolitan councils.
But fewer than half all municipalities have managed even this task,
necessary before voters' rolls can be compiled. The likelihood of elected
authorities taking over before 1996 is receding rapidly.
The corrosive rent and services boycotts that began during the mid-1980s as
a form of political protest are exacerbating the problem by leaving local
bodies short of the funds to undertake development.
As a result, although the cabinet has agreed to write off tenant arrears to
the end of January 1994, at the cost of several billion rands, the strain on
national finances has forced it to insist that payments due from February
onwards must be met in full, a sum that already amounts to R324m in the
so-called PWV area around Johannesburg alone.
While both national and regional ANC leaders are threatening tough action,
including politically unpopular evictions if payments are not met, they are
coming under fire from grassroots organisations. The South African National
Civic Organisation, an umbrella body for the ANC-aligned civic associations
that sprang up in the mid-1980s as alternatives to official government
bodies, has called on the government to scrap all arrears and further cut
the already subsidised rent for township dwellers.
'Basic services must first be guaranteed and an affordable rate needs to be
negotiated with the people,' says Mr Mbongeni Ngubeni, head of Sanco's local
government unit.
Some residents say the time for boycotts has passed, but most chafe at
paying before services are upgraded. 'Why should people pay for faulty
houses and an unreliable water supply?' asks one angry inhabitant of Soweto,
the black township near Johannesburg.
Eskom, the electricity utility, supports the view that improved services
would lead to a higher level of payments, and says that since it upgraded
its infrastructure in Soweto and began an educational and promotional
programme in the area, revenues have risen.
'In October, 40 per cent of residents paid their bills compared to only 26
per cent in September,' says Mr Martin Opperman, the company's negotiations
manager.
As the squatters' protest this week indicated, patience is likely to run out
unless there is a visible effort to address popular grievances well before
the oft-postponed local elections take place. 'They have been sending the
wrong signals so far,' says First National's Mr Maepa. 'It is time for the
government to start addressing grassroots concerns.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, arrived in Israel from Syria
yesterday as part of an intensive push by Washington to break the deadlock
in peace talks between Jerusalem and Damascus amid growing pessimism on both
sides.
Israeli officials said the focus of Mr Christopher's seventh Middle East
shuttle this year was to edge forward agreement on security arrangements
that would be put in place following an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan
Heights. Israel and the US hope Mr Christopher will persuade Syria to send
military experts to take part in a future round of negotiations between
ambassadors in Washington.
Gen John Shalikashvili, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, is also in
Israel and has held talks with Israeli military officials to discuss the
deployment of US troops on the Golan following an Israeli-Syrian peace
accord.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, has emphasised the importance of
stationing US troops on the Heights, perhaps as the main component of a
multinational force. He lobbied the US Congress to support such a move
during his visit to Washington last month.
Mr Rabin said earlier this week that huge gaps still separated the two
sides, but he has increasingly been outlining the details of the security
negotiations. On Monday he told the parliamentary defence committee there
were three key security issues: preventing border incidents; mutual
arrangements to prevent a surprise attack; and how to reduce the defence
burden of the security package.
In public, Syria continues to state its traditional line that Israel must
first make a firm open commitment to full withdrawal from every inch of the
Golan and has criticised Mr Rabin's proposal to hold an Israeli referendum
on withdrawal from the Heights.
Official Syrian newspapers attacked Israel yesterday, saying Israeli leaders
'rushed to put obstacles to stall the peace process'. Damascus has shown
anger at Israel's demand for security arrangements to be more extensive on
the Syrian side and insists on a policy of equality. But Israeli officials
say in private Syrian negotiators are more willing to discuss security
details and compromises with Mr Christopher.
Both sides have been warning that time is running out for an agreement. Mr
Walid al-Mu'allem, Syrian ambassador to Washington, said recently: 'The time
which remains for achieving the agreement is months, not years.' He added
that Syria would not be able to wait much longer and certainly not until the
Middle East business conference in Amman set for June next year.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Japanese managers suffer winds of change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hard-pressed managers at Matsushita, the consumer electronics group, are
having to face a change in a once honourable tradition - annual bonuses are
no longer to be based on years of service, but on performance.
About 11,000 Matsushita managers opened envelopes containing the details of
their winter bonus packet to find a sum rather different to what they had
come to expect.
With the new system, complacent managers who have almost always seen their
bonuses rise with their years of service, could find the amount they receive
to be as much as Y1.5m (Pounds 9,600) less than that paid to the best
performers.
On the other hand, ambitious younger managers are supposed to find that
seniority is no longer a barrier to financial reward.
'The new system could boost the morale of younger managers,' a Matsushita
official said optimistically.
The company's decision to relate bonuses, which comprise roughly half a
manager's annual pay, to performance represents a significant departure from
traditional Japanese management practice which values loyal service over
real performance.
As Japan's economic growth has slowed and the country sees itself going
through an industrial transition, company executives have been calling for a
review of traditional employment practices, such as lifetime employment and
seniority-based pay,
These practices were formerly considered inviolable by large blue-chip
companies but are now seen increasingly as an obstacle to competitiveness
and the structural adjustments the country needs.
Matsushita is not the first large Japanese company to adopt a pay system
that ties employees' remuneration to performance, but its decision is
expected to have a significant impact on other companies.
The company is considered a symbol of Japanese business conservatism and is
a wage trend-setter in the electronics industry.
For Matsushita, which has grown over the years into a large and unwieldy
corporation, the measure is part of an effort to improve profitability
through a three-year restructuring programme.
Mr Yoichi Morishita, the company's president, has stated his intention to
raise its ratio of operating profits to sales from 2.6 per cent to 5 per
cent by the end of fiscal 1996.
To soften the blow of the new system, however, the company still retains the
seniority system in annual salaries paid to managers.
Managers who are affected generally appeared to accept the need for change
in theory but the new system is bound to raise concerns about the fairness
of performance assessments and the threat the spread of merit-based pay
poses to Japan's much-vaunted social equality.

<TEXT>
Taiwan's leading opposition, the Democratic Progressive party (DPP), faces
the formidable challenge of proving to voters it is fit to lead the country
when its testing ground is a city which verges on being ungovernable.
The eight-year-old party is renowned as much for sparking parliamentary
brawls as for generating good ideas later co-opted by the ruling Kuomintang
(KMT).
Now it must make a swift transition from the enfant terrible of Taiwan
politics into an organisation capable of managing the chaotic capital
Taipei.
Later this month Mr Chen Shui-bian, a DPP legislator, will take up the post
of Taipei mayor after winning elections last weekend against the ruling
party incumbent candidate for the post which previously had been an
appointment.
He will command a municipal budget of TDollars 130bn (Pounds 3.2bn) in the
current fiscal year for the city of 2.7m residents.
This will be the most important administrative position the DPP has held
since political reforms and regular elections began in the late 1980s. Its
performance running the island's biggest city will be critical to gaining
voters' confidence before the first-ever direct presidential elections
slated for early 1996.
Taipei's woes are legion and stem mostly from a combination of poor planning
and rapid economic growth.
The KMT, which has ruled the island since 1949, has historically been loth
to invest in non-productive services and infrastructure, hoping instead to
realise the long-cherished dream of reconquering mainland China.
Open drains flow by dilapidated, or nonexistent, sidewalks on streets where
garbage piles mount, stray dogs roam and double-parking is the norm rather
than the exception.
The capital's traffic bottlenecks and air pollution problems are legendary,
parks are few and real estate is overpriced. Traffic regulations are
observed largely in the breach and loosely enforced by a seemingly
demoralised police force.
Mr Chen, a Taiwan-trained lawyer, built a fearsome reputation ferreting out
military and official corruption in the Kuomintang government. But he will
have to show that he is more than just a crack investigator and smooth
talker once he finds himself at the receiving end rather than on the attack.
Mr Chen faces the urgent task of revitalising city services and restoring
morale among government employees and residents. Not least of Mr Chen's
challenges will be to sort out the city's unfinished accident-prone,
corruption-plagued urban mass transit system. He got a taste of what is to
come yesterday when a carriage derailed during a test run. Experts dismissed
the mishap as minor but it topped the evening new programmes and fuelled
public fears about the system's safety.
The traffic-clogged capital's mass transit system was originally scheduled
to start running in August 1991 at a budget of TDollars 250bn. Costs have
ballooned to TDollars 444bn and after a succession of delays the first line
has yet to open.
Believed to be the world's most expensive per kilometre, the system has
attracted widespread allegations of corruption. The first chief of the
department overseeing construction, Mr Chi Pao-cheng, was impeached, and the
second, Mr Lai Shih-sheng, faces corruption-related charges. His case is
pending.
France's Matra Transport, the general contractor on one of the system's main
lines, is embroiled in a contract dispute with the department over damages
claims because of construction delays. The mayor-elect has promised to
conduct a top-to-bottom review of the system.
Mr Chen will have a grace period during which he can blame his predecessor
when things go wrong. But eventually Taipei residents will want to see
progress on his pledges to improve the quality of life, break the 'hung pao'
culture - the practice of giving red envelopes, or bribes - in city
government, and curb gangster-related violence.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Alarm bells ring for China investors: Concern is growing
over accumulating problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a familiar litany from Chinese leaders at their Central Economic Work
Conference in Beijing last week. They agreed to quicken the pace of
enterprise reform, improve macro-economic measures and further develop the
market system and economic legislation.
These worthy aims, which included a call on government at all levels to
achieve a 'correct balance' between reform, progress and stability, are
unlikely to have lessened the growing concern of international creditors
over an accumulation of nagging problems. Companies planning to invest in
China are also being caught up in a mood swing that began surfacing last
month.
'People are very uneasy,' said an American banker in Beijing. 'Sometime in
November the fear factor really kicked in.'
It was inevitable that a more sober view of the risks and rewards of doing
business with China would materialise sooner or later, but the intensity of
present disquiet says a lot about overheated expectations of the past year
or so.
'Nothing has changed that much from six months ago,' the banker added. 'But
what has changed is that people have ceased suspending disbelief.'
Problems that raised the alarm and prompted a rash of inquiries from anxious
head offices to their representatives in China and Hong Kong do not in
themselves portend disaster but, taken together, create a somewhat
disturbing picture.
They include news that Lehman Brothers is suing leading Chinese enterprises
over non-payment of Dollars 100m (Pounds 62.5m) in losses incurred in
currency trading; publicity given to the old issue of long-overdue payments
on leasing debts; an argument between the China International Trust and
Investment Corporation and the London Metals Exchange over alleged unpaid
obligations on commodities trading by Citic's Shanghai branch; and attempts
by the Beijing Municipality to remove a McDonalds from a prime site to make
way for a Hong Kong-funded development; this despite the fast-food chain
having a 20-year lease.
For those with a stake in China or contemplating one, these episodes raise
the question of whether they are part of a much wider problem, and mark the
beginning of a trend. Compounding the nervousness are concerns about China's
high inflation rate (consumer prices in the main cities up 27 per cent in
the 12 months to October), indications the reform effort may be faltering, a
continuing credit squeeze, and jitteriness about a transition to a younger
generation of leaders.
Western bankers in Beijing are loth to speak on the record about
difficulties with overdue payments, mainly from state enterprises, but they
confirm the problem is widespread. 'You are going around swapping names
these days of who you don't want to deal with,' the representative of a
large European bank, which has its share of troublesome clients, said.
Representatives of international lending institutions take a fairly sanguine
longer-term view of the latest developments, but believe that in the short
term, lenders and borrowers are in for a 'sobering-up' period, as one put
it.
'There are going to be some hard knocks,' one representative declared. 'Some
institutions have been excessively gung-ho about lending to China.' China's
international advisers are urging it to clarify what constitutes sovereign
risk to calm concerns among investors.
Western bankers estimate that about two-thirds of China's external
obligations are sovereign or government debt, but the proportion of
sovereign debt has been diminishing in light of a rash of borrowing outside
the state's borrowing plan.
Debt service on China's estimated Dollars 83.5bn external debt at the end of
last year stood at about 12 per cent, according to Mr Tan Jian, a finance
ministry official, who indicated Beijing wanted to keep the ratio below 15
per cent.
A recent World Bank analysis concluded that China's external debt and
debt-service position was 'sound' at the end of 1993, but also warned that
as state-owned enterprises became more autonomous, the authorities would
need to guard against too rapid build-up of their external debt obligations.
Of China's various arguments with foreign creditors, the leasing issue is
perhaps most revealing of the difficulties of operating in an environment
which, in the words of one banker, still resembles the 'wild east'.
Banks, including several of the larger Japanese and European institutions,
blundered into China in the mid-1980s, lending to state enterprises through
newly-established leasing companies in which the foreign banks were minority
shareholders.
Much of this lending went towards purchases of machinery for textile
factories, some of which have never repaid a cent. But the ability of the
leasing companies to retrieve the funds is limited by the fact that because
they are majority Chinese-owned concerns they are classified as local
operations.
This means they are obliged to take their place in a lengthening queue of
creditors among state enterprises caught up in China's huge triangular debt
problem: the inability of enterprises to pay each other for goods and
services.
Mr Gernot Kluss, chairman of the Friendship Association of Foreign Joint
Venture Leasing Companies, is not optimistic that the 31 leasing companies
affected will retrieve the Dollars 500m-Dollars 600m arrears owed despite a
recent appeal to Mr Zhu Rongji, the governor of the central bank and
vice-premier in charge of the economy.
But Mr Kluss also warned that if the funds are not forthcoming, it will
'affect China's creditworthiness'.
Heavily-borrowed enterprises considered vulnerable to a downturn in the
Chinese economy and rising interest rates include speculative real-estate
ventures such as hotels, fancy restaurants, condominiums, and golf courses.
Funds have poured into these areas in the past two years.
Bankers expect the authorities to crack down soon on borrowing outside the
state credit plan. 'It's only a matter of time before they begin restricting
borrowing,' one Hong Kong-based analyst says.
For all the gloomy talk, the fact remains that foreign direct investment is
continuing to pour into the country. At the end of October, Dollars 25.2bn
of funds had been utilised, up 44 per cent over the same period last year.
China's economy is continuing to grow strongly, with growth expected this
year of 11.5 per cent against more than 13 per cent last.
In most developing countries these statistics would indicate an
embarrassment of riches. But in China's case such is the task facing its
rulers that international confidence is likely to become more fickle, now
that the honeymoon with Western business appears to be coming to an end.

<TEXT>
Nearly two years after former president Fernando Collor de Mellor resigned
amid corruption allegations, the Brazilian Supreme Court today begins its
judgment of the case. Mr Collor, who resigned in December 1992 hours before
the Senate voted to impeach him, is accused of 'passive corruption' by the
attorney-general, who has collected more than 10,000 pages of evidence
against him. Mr Collor, who denies the charges, is accused of links to a
network of bribes and corruption operated by his former campaign treasurer,
Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, during and after the 1989 presidential election. Mr
Farias, who will also be judged, fled to London in July 1993 after an arrest
warrant was issued. He was later extradited from Thailand. If found guilty,
Mr Collor would face a jail term of up to eight years. He is not expected to
appear at the judgment, which could take several days.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Webster Hubbell, former associate attorney-general and a friend of
President Bill Clinton, pleaded guilty yesterday to charges of mail fraud
and tax evasion for overbilling his law clients. The plea bargain came on
charges brought by Mr Kenneth Starr, the special prosecutor appointed to
look into the Whitewater affair, which involves Mr and Mrs Clinton's
investment in a property venture and the failed savings and loan institution
run by their business partners.
Although Mr Hubbell is a close friend of the Clintons and a former law
partner of Mrs Hillary Clinton, the charges against him involve no evident
link to the Clintons. White House nervousness over the Whitewater affair has
risen in the last month with the prospect of further congressional hearings
when Senator Alfonse d'Amato, who has tried doggedly to find some wrongdoing
by the administration over Whitewater, takes over as chairman of the Senate
banking committee.

FT  07 DEC 94 / BT challenges Sprint alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecom, the UK's principal telephone operator, yesterday asked the
US Federal Communications Commission to withhold regulatory approval of an
alliance between a large US operator and French and German telephone groups.
It complained that the French and German markets were neither liberalised
nor effectively regulated and that the alliance - called Atlas and involving
Sprint, the US's third largest carrier, together with state-owned France
Telecom and Deutsche Bundespost Telekom - should not receive approval until
equivalence was reached with the US and UK, the world's most liberated
telecoms markets.
Atlas's aim is to provide telecoms facilities to large multinational
companies. BT is already active in this market through an alliance with MCI,
the second largest US long-distance carrier, called Concert. Sprint and its
allies had argued that, in the wake of the BT/MCI approval, the regulatory
process for Atlas could be foreshortened. BT also asked the FCC to look at
European alliances involving AT&amp;T of the US and state-owned companies from
Switzerland and the Netherlands.

FT  07 DEC 94 / 'Honest broker' on course for Treasury: Robert Rubin is
likely to adopt a conservative line if he assumes the economic reins in the
US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At 73, Mr Lloyd Bentsen has always seemed an outsider in the youthful
administration of President Bill Clinton. It was not just his age that set
him apart, however. His conservatism, his instincts for the dynamics of
Congress and his impatience with the White House's interminable policy
debates have all distinguished him.
They are qualities that the Clinton administration may need more than ever
as it faces the prospect of two years of intense ideological confrontation
with the new Republican majority in Congress.
Since their electoral defeat last month, Democrats have been trying to
figure out where they went wrong, and where they need to go to recover.
White House staffers debate feverishly over whether the president would be
better off veering left or right.
In this climate, Mr Bentsen's influence had seemed sure to grow, partly
because of his ability, demonstrated in six years as chairman of the Senate
finance committee, to work with the Republicans, and not least because he
has always seemed to be one of the few people who can force the Clinton
administration to make up its mind.
That is a quality shared by Mr Robert Rubin, 56, who will be nominated to
succeed Mr Bentsen as Treasury secretary. There will be no sharp difference
in philosophy between the two men.
When Mr Clinton asked Mr Bentsen in 1992, just after his election victory,
whom he should name to the Treasury, Mr Bentsen suggested Mr Rubin. Mr
Rubin, in turn, suggested Mr Bentsen. 'Ever since, Bob Rubin has insisted
that he had more influence with the president than I did,' Mr Bentsen said
yesterday.
Senate confirmation cannot be taken for granted with the pugnacious Senator
Alfonse D'Amato taking over as chairman of the Senate banking committee, but
there is no immediately obvious reason why Mr Rubin should face confirmation
difficulties.
A former chairman of the Goldman Sachs investment bank, Mr Rubin turned his
newly created position as head of the National Economic Council into an
essential centre for co-ordinating the work of often competing agencies such
as the Treasury, the US trade representative's office, the Environmental
Protection Agency and the Commerce Department. At a ceremony at the White
House yesterday, Mr Clinton called Mr Rubin 'the consummate honest broker'.
Mr Rubin will take the lead next year in the battle with the Republicans
over fiscal policy, and has served warning that he will demand that any tax
cuts be paid for by offsetting tax increases or spending cuts.
One of the secrets of his success in co-ordinating economic policy has been
his own modesty, which has helped to bring competing agencies together
without fear that the NEC would steal their thunder. That modesty is so rare
for Washington that the task of replacing him at the NEC is a difficult one.
The loss of Mr Roger Altman, another Wall Street investment banker who was
Mr Bentsen's deputy at the Treasury until he was forced to resign amid
charges that he had misled Congress over the Whitewater affair, is now
sorely felt.
Mr Rubin's two deputies at the NEC are Mr Bo Cutter, who has taken the lead
on trade policy, and Mr Gene Sperling, who is in charge of domestic policy.
But neither is expected to step up to the top job. Instead, the most widely
mentioned candidate is Mr Erskine Bowles, who founded his own investment
bank in North Carolina before being appointed head of the Small Business
Administration by Mr Clinton. A rising star in the administration, Mr Bowles
recently moved over to the White House as deputy chief of staff.
An economic team headed by Mr Rubin, Mr Bowles and Ms Alice Rivlin, budget
director, backed by Mr Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff and Ms
Rivlin's predecessor at the Office of Management and Budget, seems likely to
keep the administration on a conservative economic and fiscal course.
But the course may be harder to steer over the next two years than it has
been over the last two, when rising employment and low inflation have kept
the economic indicators favourable.
Mr Bentsen's successor faces the prospect of a slowing economy and the
possibility either of a resurgence of inflation or of the beginnings of a
recession.
Against this background Mr Rubin may be hard pressed to fend off the demands
of Mr Clinton's political advisers and core Democratic supporters on the
left and in the trade unions, and avoid the temptation of getting into a
bidding war over tax cuts with the Republican Congress.
Mr Bentsen, whose resignation will take effect on December 22, will return
to Texas to relaunch his business career. Mr Frank Newman, the current
deputy Treasury secretary, will serve as acting secretary until Mr Rubin is
confirmed.
Mr Bentsen has promised to come back to Washington frequently to be part of
what Mr Clinton called 'a seasoned kitchen cabinet'. 'You bet I'm not
retiring. I think you rust out before you wear out,' he said.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Zedillo swift to confront political tests: Mexican president
plans big overhaul of judicial system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's President Ernesto Zedillo has acted swiftly on two of the most
pressing political challenges facing his new administration. He has unveiled
plans for a sweeping overhaul of the judicial system and an accord designed
to prevent violence during this week's transfer of power in the southern
state of Chiapas.
The judicial reform would allow Mr Zedillo to remove all Supreme Court
magistrates and name a new court if he wishes, providing an opportunity to
clean house only weeks into his six-year term. The reforms would also
prohibit cabinet ministers and congressmen from being named to the court,
thus ending the practice whereby it had become a refuge for out-of-favour
politicians.
The judicial reforms, detailed on Monday, involve changes to the
constitution and require approval by both legislative chambers and state
legislatures. They would award more power to the traditionally weak
legislature by giving the Senate the authority to ratify the nation's
attorney-general and Supreme Court justices after open hearings.
Mr Zedillo's aides claim the reforms form a key component of a bigger agenda
of political reform by strengthening the judicial and legislative branches
of government at the expense of the president. But they also concede that
the 'top down' approach of the reforms makes them 'just a beginning, and it
will take the president's entire term for them to become fully functional'.
Mr Zedillo is relying on Mr Antonio Lozano, the new attorney-general, to
change the ethos and practices of the police, much criticised for corruption
an ineffectiveness. On Monday Mr Lozano, a member of the conservative
opposition National Action party, named fellow party members to all six top
jobs in his law enforcement agency.
Other aspects of the reforms include a mechanism allowing citizens to
challenge inaction by prosecutors and police, as well as the
constitutionality of federal, state and local laws.
In Chiapas, scene of a bloody Indian uprising earlier this year, the
interior ministry has reached an agreement with the self-styled State
Democratic Assembly, which groups the state's leftist opposition. The accord
calls for protesters to respect Thursday's swearing-in ceremony of
governor-elect Mr Eduardo Robledo, and for the state government to respect
the right to protest.
The assembly, backed by the Zapatista rebels, claims Mr Robledo was
fraudulently elected and had promised to use civil disobedience to prevent
his taking office. The Zedillo administration has insisted Mr Robledo take
office, saying its larger agenda of promoting the rule of law would be
undermined if it began forcing governors to resign.
It was not immediately clear if the agreement would be respected by all
assembly members.

US housing completions fell 2.3 per cent in October, the Commerce Department
said yesterday. It was the first decrease since July's 3.5 per cent drop.
Completions of single-family units fell 0.3 per cent in October after rising
in September by a revised 1.7 per cent. Multi-family unit completions fell
12 per cent in October after rising a month earlier by a revised 22.8 per
cent. Previously, the department said completions of single-family units
rose 1.9 per cent in September, and multi-family units climbed 22.3 per
cent.
Meanwhile, US mortgage delinquency rates fell in the third quarter to a
21-year low, a Mortgage Bankers' Association of America survey showed. The
quarterly national delinquency survey, which covers about a third of all
residential mortgages, showed the overall seasonally adjusted mortgage
delinquency rate on one- to four-unit homes was 3.9 per cent, down from 4.21
per cent in the second quarter. The third-quarter rate was the lowest since
the opening period of 1973, when it hit 3.89 per cent, the MBA said.

<TEXT>
Democratic party moderates blamed President Bill Clinton yesterday for last
month's mid-term election calamity, saying he campaigned as a centrist but
had failed to govern as such. The mood was sombre at the 10th anniversary
conference of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group once chaired by Mr
Clinton which is devoted to advancing a centrist political agenda. 'Amid the
avalanche of public disgust that swept our party from power in Congress,
Democrats once again face a crisis of values, a crisis of principles, a
crisis for the future of our country,' said Mr Dave McCurdy, council
chairman and an outgoing member of the House who lost his race for a Senate
seat in Oklahoma.
California Senator Dianne Feinstein, narrowly re-elected last month, singled
out what she termed Mr Clinton's over-ambitious effort to reform the
healthcare system as a key factor in the Democrats' election defeat.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Magistrate quits over interference

<TEXT>
Mr Antonio Di Pietro, Italy's best known anti-corruption magistrate,
resigned yesterday in protest over increasing interference by the Berlusconi
government in the Milan judiciary.
His resignation raised the temperature of the long-running confrontation
between Milan magistrates and the right-wing coalition. The value of shares
on the Milan stock exchange fell 2.3 per cent amid fears of increased
political uncertainty and the lira slipped to near-record lows against the
D-Mark.
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi sought to play down the resignation,
praising the man he asked six months ago to be a cabinet minister.
He said Mr Di Pietro's decision 'leaves a bitter taste in the mouth'.
But opposition politicians voiced alarm over the future of the 'clean hands'
investigations that have been spearheaded by Mr Di Pietro since February
1992. Mr Massimo D'Alema, leader of the party of the Democratic Left, former
communists, said: 'We can't but see a link between this resignation - a
source of bitterness to us and millions of citizens - and the increasingly
vicious assault directed against the magistrature in recent months.'
Mr Di Pietro announced his resignation in an emotional letter to Mr
Francesco Saverio Borrelli, the chief Milan public prosecutor, who has
co-ordinated the past 2 1/2 years of corruption investigations.
Mr Borrelli subsequently confirmed the resignation, suggesting that Mr Di
Pietro was unlikely in spite of pressure, to change his mind. He also gave a
strong political twist to Mr Di Pietro's move, attacking the government for
mounting a campaign of hostility against the magistrature and warning that
the corruption investigations would continue.
In his letter Mr Di Pietro placed more emphasis on his exasperation over the
high-profile role he had been forced to play. 'Whatever I do, my duties as a
magistrate seem to be interpreted as a personal competition,' he said.
'I refer in particular to the numerous recent demonstrations in the piazzas
which, whether for or against the group (of anti-corruption magistrates),
have viciously personalised my role to a point where my each and every
judicial action is interpreted for or against someone.'
Mr Di Pietro said he hoped his resignation would help to depersonalise the
judicial inquiries.
A Milan court yesterday sentenced ex-prime minister Bettino Craxi in his
absence to 5 1/2 years in jail for corruption. All 12 defendants were found
guilty over payments the prosecution said were made by insurance company SAI
for contracts with Eni, the state energy group. Mr Craxi, who lives in
Tunisia and claims to be too ill to return to Italy, was also sentenced to 8
1/2 years in July for fraudulent bankruptcy.

<TEXT>
The German Free Democratic party (FDP) yesterday made overtures to the
opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), the first step in a mating dance
which may pave the way for a coalition between the two parties. Mr Hermann
Otto Solms, the leader of the FDP's parliamentary party, said: 'If Scharping
can actually bring his party to change course in economic and social policy
then he will become an interesting and serious partner for talks with the
FDP.' There has been speculation that the FDP, which lost almost half of its
seats in the Bundestag at the recent elections, will eventually pull out of
the coalition with Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats. However,
the feelers that Mr Solms is putting out contrast sharply with comments by
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister and party leader, who has steadfastly
said that the FDP sees its fortunes tied to those of the CDU.

Intense diplomatic efforts were under way last night to take advantage of
signals from Bosnian Serb leaders that they may agree to restart the
paralysed peace process. However, there seemed to be little sign of peace on
the ground as fierce fighting raged in north-west Bosnia, involving as many
as six different parties. The United Nations said the fighting around the
designated 'safe area' of Bihac had worsened in the past 48 hours. Bosnian
government troops were fighting in the north against three sides - the
Bosnian Serbs, rebel Serbs from the Krajina region of Croatia, as well as
rebel Moslems loyal to breakaway leader Fikret Abdic. To the south of Bihac,
regular Croatian army troops sided with Bosnian Croat units fighting Bosnian
Serbs. Meanwhile, in an unannounced mission last night, international
mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg met President Slobodan
Milosevic of Serbia.

<TEXT>
President Sali Berisha of Albania has said that five ethnic Greeks convicted
last August of espionage and illegal possession of arms will be released
from jail 'very soon'. Mr Berisha told the Greek newspaper, Ta Nea, that
Greek-Albanian relations were on the road to recovery following Greece's
decision last week to drop its veto on an Ecu35m (Pounds 27.5m) European
Union loan package for Albania. The trial of the five, all members of
Omonia, an ethnic-Greek political movement, triggered the expulsion of more
than 40,000 Albanians working illegally in Greece and froze bilateral
economic relations. Greek businessmen now hope to revive plans for
investment in southern Albania, where the ethnic-Greek minority lives.

FT  07 DEC 94 / Iberia pilots force showdown

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The crisis at Iberia, the Spanish state airline, deepened yesterday after Mr
Javier Salas, the company's chairman, failed to convince the powerful
pilots' union to support a rescue plan for the financially crippled flag
carrier. The breakdown of what was viewed as a final negotiating round with
the pilots is now likely to force the government to intervene directly in
the dispute. Madrid will want to avert a resumption of strike action over
the peak Christmas period following last week's stoppages. Mr Salas said the
failure to obtain an agreement with the pilots, after the viability plan had
obtained preliminary acceptance by ground staff unions, meant he would now
press ahead with a controversial restructuring programme that involves
cutting some 5,000 jobs, 20 per cent of Iberia's labour force, and the sale
of subsidiaries in order to stave off the company's threatened bankruptcy.

<TEXT>
Russia and its breakaway republic of Chechnya have agreed to settle their
differences without force following last-ditch peace talks held yesterday in
the neighbouring region of Ingushetia. Both President Dzhokhar Dudayev of
Chechnya and General Pavel Grachev, Russia's defence minister, emerged from
more than an hour of talks to declare: 'There will not be a military
solution to the question.' President Boris Yeltsin also urged the Russian
parliament to declare an amnesty for those involved in the recent fighting.
The terms of the agreement were not immediately known but Russian military
sources suggested Gen Grachev would insist on three conditions being met: an
early meeting between Mr Dudayev and the opposition forces; the disarming of
illegal military units in Chechnya; and the immediate release of all Russian
servicemen captured in the recent fighting. Gen Grachev had earlier met
Chechen opposition leaders and promised them he would insist on free
parliamentary elections being held. According to the Interfax news agency,
Mr Dudayev's intentions in the talks were to ensure that Russia would stop
supporting Chechen opposition attacks and would withdraw its regular armed
forces, which have been massing on the border.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Rauf Denktash of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot republic in
northern Cyprus called yesterday for the arrest of the fugitive tycoon, Mr
Asil Nadir, on charges of tax evasion. A statement published in Turkish
Cypriot newspapers criticised the government for failing to arrest Mr Nadir
and demanded it do so without delay.
Mr Nadir, a Turkish Cypriot and former head of the collapsed Polly Peck
International empire, faces charges in Britain of theft and false
accounting. He jumped a bail of Pounds 3.5m in May 1993 and fled to northern
Cyprus. The breakaway republic, proclaimed in 1983 and recognised only by
Turkey, has no extradition treaty with Britain. President Denktash had
helped Mr Nadir lay the foundations of the Polly Peck empire by giving him
hotels, factories and other property seized from Greek Cypriots after the
invasion. The president rejected British requests for Mr Nadir's extradition
last year and treated him as an honoured guest. But relations have
deteriorated in recent months as Mr Nadir found himself increasingly unable
to pay taxes in northern Cyprus as well as the wages of 1,500 Turkish
Cypriots employed by his enterprises.

FT  07 DEC 94 / CSCE agrees to Karabakh peace operation

</DATELINE>

A conflict that has cast a long shadow over oil drilling contracts worth up
to Dollars 8bn moved closer to resolution yesterday when the summit of the
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe agreed in principle to
send a peacekeeping force to the war zone of Nagorno-Karabakh, an
Armenian-populated enclave of Azerbaijan.
Tens of thousands of people have been killed, and 20 per cent of
Azerbaijan's territory has been wrested from government control, by a war
which broke out in 1988 and has driven over a million people from their
homes.
Azerbaijan recently signed what it described as the 'contract of the
century' with a consortium led by BP for the extraction of oil from the
Caspian Sea. But Russia, which has broadly supported the Armenian side in
the past two years of war, has challenged the contract's validity and is
obstructing moves to build the pipeline which would be necessary to
transport the oil. Azerbaijan claims Russia is using the war to destabilise
the republic and prevent it from taking the benefit of its oil wealth.
Moscow's assent to the idea of a multinational - as opposed to
Russian-dominated - peacekeeping force was cautiously welcomed yesterday as
a gesture which could bring stability to the region. However, diplomats
warned that many points of detail were still outstanding. In a sign of
Russia's continuing wish for freedom of action in the southern republics of
the former Soviet Union, the summit failed to agree on a broader document
setting out general principles for peacekeeping over which diplomats have
been wrangling for many months.
If it goes ahead, the operation will be the first such effort to be
organised by the CSCE, a 53-nation body which has sought to carve a role for
itself as a smaller version of the United Nations.
Both the Nagorno-Karabakh force and the broader agreement of principles have
been held up by Russia's insistence on having as free a hand as possible for
its military activities in the former Soviet Union. Diplomats said the
Baltic states, Croatia and Hungary were among the countries which had
offered to provide troops for a force in Karabakh, which they expect to
number about 3,000.
Russia, which initially wanted to provide the main body of the force, has
apparently now accepted that its soldiers will not amount to more than 30
per cent. Azerbaijan, supported by its close ally Turkey, has opposed the
idea of a force dominated by Moscow, which over the past two years has
broadly supported the Armenian cause. Turkey also hopes to provide 30 per
cent of any force.
However, Mr Nyrup Rasmussen, Danish prime minister, said it remained 'very
uncertain' whether the Karabakh force would ever be constituted because so
many detailed points were still outstanding.
Hungary's President Arpad Goncz, chairing the summit, said of the Karabakh
force: 'The CSCE has taken one of the most important decisions in its
history.' Any satisfaction was balanced, however, by disappointment on the
sensitive issue of 'third-party peacekeeping', a term that in practice
refers mainly to Russian arbitration in the disputes of its smaller
neighbours.
Several CSCE members - including the US, and the Baltic states - remain
suspicious of Moscow's claim to be an impartial holder of the ring in the
multiple wars that have broken out on the periphery of the former Soviet
Union. In Moldova and Georgia, Russian officials have made no secret of
their sympathy for pro-Moscow secessionist movements.

Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, expressed confidence he would soon
be allowed to raise funds for his organisation in the US after a meeting at
the White House yesterday with President Bill Clinton's top foreign policy
adviser, reports George Graham from Washington.
'We're satisfied it will be resolved and resolved in a satisfactory way,' he
said. As a condition of his current visa to the US, Mr Adams is required to
refrain from fundraising, but Sinn Fein has set up an organisation in the US
and wants to start collecting from Irish Americans.
A senior US official said:
'Basically, I wouldn't rule it out. We've got some issues we're continuing
to work through with him.'
The US has said it can only allow fundraising if the IRA stops buying
weapons in the US, and if there is concrete progress towards disarming the
terrorist group. Sinn Fein is also trying to set up transparent accounting
procedures that would offer some assurance money it raised is not going to
the IRA.
