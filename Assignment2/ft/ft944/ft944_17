FT  03 DEC 94 / International Company News: HBO and studios in Asian pay-TV
venture

<TEXT>
HBO, the pay-TV subsidiary of Time Warner, has signed a deal with two
Japanese-owned Hollywood studios, Sony Pictures and MCA/Universal, for the
exclusive pay-TV showing of their films in Asia.
The deal sharpens competition between HBO and Mr Rupert Murdoch's Star TV, a
recent entrant to pay-TV in the region. HBO said it had brought in Sony and
MCA (owned by Matsushita) as equity partners in HBO Asia, a joint venture
originally formed between Time Warner and Paramount. Financial details were
not disclosed, but all four partners will have an equal stake.
The deal brings together four studios - Columbia, Warner Bros, Paramount and
Universal - which HBO said had between them produced 19 of the 25
top-selling pictures in 1993 and 1994, and accounted for almost 70 per cent
of US box office returns, excluding animated features. The deal gives HBO
Asia exclusive pay-TV rights to current and future titles, as well as to the
partners' film libraries.
HBO Asia is available in Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia,
Taiwan, Brunei and Papua New Guinea, and will shortly be in Bangladesh.
Talks are going on with the Chinese authorities over access to Chinese
hotels. Subscribers at the start of this year totalled 300,000, and the
figure is claimed to be higher.
The films will all be shown in English, with subtitles in Chinese, Thai and
Indonesian. This contrasts with Star TV, which shows Chinese-language films
as well as Hollywood productions.

FT  03 DEC 94 / International Company News: Bear Stearns buys Dollars 700m
of Kidder Peabody bonds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Bear Stearns has bought nearly Dollars 700m of mortgaged-backed bonds from
General Electric in a further liquidation of the bond portfolio once held by
Kidder Peabody, GE's investment banking unit.
The sale is believed to account for the bulk of the complex derivative-type
securities once held by Kidder.
Mr John Site, an executive vice-president at Bear Stearns, refused to
provide details of the type of securities the firm had bought, except to say
that they were all collateralised mortgage obligations.
Although securities, these instruments share many of the characteristics of
derivatives, since they provide a leveraged return based on underlying
interest rates.
The most common types are interest-only bonds (IOs) and principal-only
securities (POs,) which are created by dismantling standard mortgage-backed
bonds into separate interest and principal elements.
Bear Stearns is believed to have bought the securities in an auction among a
small number of Wall Street firms.
Among those bidding, according to one rival firm, was Mr Mike Vranos, the
head of mortgage-backed bonds at Kidder and the leading expert in the field
on Wall Street.
Mr Vranos, who has yet to announce his plans now Kidder's individual
businesses are being either sold to PaineWebber or closed down, was said to
have been backed in the bid by money from a wealthy US business family.
The latest sale marks one of the most significant in the liquidation of
Kidder's mortgage-backed bond portfolio, which stood at Dollars 16bn in
March but had been cut to Dollars 4bn by mid-November.
The CMO market was hit harder than other sectors of the fixed income markets
by the progressive rises in US interest rates earlier this year, due to the
complexity of many of the instruments traded and the leveraged nature of
their exposure to interest rates.
Commenting on the outlook for the CMO market, Mr Site said: 'We see it as
slowly correcting itself over time. Equilibrium has returned.'

FT  03 DEC 94 / International Company News: Indonesian groups reveal swaps
deficit
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Indah Kiat and Tjiwi Kimia, Indonesia's two largest paper and pulp
manufacturers, admitted they lost USDollars 47.5m in derivatives trading.
The companies join a string of international companies, including Procter &amp;
Gamble which have reported multi-million dollar losses on derivatives this
year.
Yesterday's announcement is a reminder that derivatives risk extends to the
developing world where financial markets are often less effectively
regulated.
The Jakarta stock exchange said Sinar Mas, the holding company for the two
companies, will absorb the losses so that reported earnings will be
unaffected.
Sinar Mas is Indonesia's second largest conglomerate with interests in
banking, property and plantations as well as paper.
The two companies suffered the losses from leveraged swaps with variable
interest rates taken out before the US Federal Reserve started tightening
its monetary policy in February.
The statement from the Jakarta stock exchange said the companies blamed
their losses on rising interest rates in the US.
Tjiwi Kimia and Indah Kiat were forced to report the losses after details of
the transactions were revealed in local press reports, but brokers in
Jakarta said they had been aware that the two companies were trading
actively in the derivatives market.
The news is likely to dampen investors' enthusiasm for the stock. 'This is
only one of the cases which has been reported,' said a broker at a British
securities firm in Jakarta.
'My question is, if Sinar Mas wants to trade in derivatives why do they use
their listed companies to do it.'
Indonesia's central bank is working with its counterparts elsewhere in the
south-east Asian region to get a grip on the derivatives market. However,
there are no plans to introduce regulations.
The Sinar Mas group is owned by the Eka Tjipta Widjaja family, one of
Indonesia's wealthiest.
They are a majority shareholder in Bank Internasional Indonesia, which ranks
as the country's largest listed bank in terms of profits.
Indah Kiat lost USDollars 35m in the derivatives market and Tjiwi Kimia lost
USDollars 12.5m.
Indah Kiat recently reported that its net profit for the nine months ended
September 30 this year totalled Rp131.57bn (Dollars 61m), compared with
Rp62.86bn, a year earlier.
Tjiwi Kimia's net profit for the same period rose to Rp78.10bn from
Rp57.12bn the previous year.

Last year's acquisitions helped Scott Pickford, the USM-quoted petroleum
consultant, to raise pre-tax profits by 53 per cent from Pounds 209,000 to
Pounds 321,000 in the six months to September 30. Turnover more than doubled

Mr Tony Burch, chairman, said the improvement reflected the changed nature
of the business and the successful strategy of having developed a wider
business base.
He said the group planned to make an acquisition worth up to Pounds 5m over
the next year or so, which would most likely be funded through some form of
share placing.
Earnings per share grew 31 per cent to 2.47p (1.89p).

NKK, the Japanese steelmaker, is now to cut steel jobs by 4,200 to 10,500
and costs by Y200bn (Dollars 2bn) by March 1997, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The figures are upward revisions of targets NKK announced in March this
year, NKK said.
NKK, second in crude steel production in Japan after Nippon Steel, was hit
by Japan's prolonged economic slump. In November, it posted a parent current
loss of Y37.91bn yen in the six months to September 30 1994. It then said it
would cut steel jobs by 3,300 by the end of March 1997 from 14,700 in March
1993 and would cut costs by Y175bn.
The revised cuts will be realised by streamlining production at two
steelworks in Japan.

FT  03 DEC 94 / International Company News: Piech intends to beat five-year
plan targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen yesterday said it intended to exceed the conservative performance
targets in its five-year plan. This contained profit projections which were
much lower than many analyst had forecast.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman of the German motor group, said the plan was
based on a much more cautious set of assumptions than VW's previous plans
and this was especially true for market share and volume forecasts.
He told analysts the figures in its internal plan represented a level which
could also be achieved under difficult circumstances. 'Of course, it is our
intention to exceed this planning in reality.' VW has not said what the plan
contains.
The report of the internal figures, believed to contain a pre-tax profit
projection for 1995 of about DM890m (Dollars 567m) which was well below
market expectations, depressed the share price and led analysts to wonder if
the company was playing down the extent of the recovery from heavy losses.
This could help create the right climate for more cost-cutting and for
government financial inducements to encourage the trading in of old cars.
The VW planning document reportedly said the 1995 result could be up to
DM200m higher or lower than in the plan, and sales would rise only modestly
next year with price rises being difficult to implement. The 1998 turnover
target of DM104bn was believed to have been revised to DM100bn in 1999. In
1993, VW made a DM1.94bn net loss on sales of DM76.5bn.
Mr Piech said although VW had performed well in the first 10 months, with
world sales up by 7 per cent to 2.75m vehicles, a lasting car market upturn
was not in sight. This was shown by the way markets had developed in the
second half of 1994. He said VW was starting its reconstruction, with only
20 per cent of the intended improvements achieved.
Progress had been made in cutting costs and improving quality, but much work
lay ahead before VW would be in the forefront of world competition.

FT  03 DEC 94 / International Company News: VW and Ford loosen Brazilian
straitjacket - Autolatina's winding up is expected to take the whole of 1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The separation of Volkswagen and Ford's joint operations in Brazil and
Argentina, announced on Thursday, could turn into one of the biggest and
most complicated industrial divorces in history.
The winding up of the holding company Autolatina is expected to take the
whole of 1995. The company is Latin America's biggest carmaker and Brazil's
largest private sector company with expected sales of Dollars 8bn this year.
In Brazil, where the vast majority of production is concentrated, the two
companies share seven plants and 47,000 workers as well as purchasing,
administrative, financial and legal services. Vehicle production was 612,000
units last year.
For VW, and particularly for Ford, there have been growing worries that what
began as a lifejacket in 1987 when Brazil's car market was in a slump had
become a straightjacket in the 1990s when production, and competition from
imports, were soaring.
Mr Pierre-Alain De Smedt, Autolatina president and future president of the
VW subsidiary, says the union was 'the right decision at the right time'. It
allowed the two companies to achieve economies of scale by making
similar-looking hybrid cars from joint production platforms at a time when
Brazil's market was largely closed to foreign competition.
However, since 1990 Autolatina's structure has appeared increasingly
ill-suited to an economy that has been gradually opened to imports and where
production has soared following tax cuts and higher productivity. The trend
towards global car production has also called into question the company's
structure.
Like Fiat and GM, the other two main car groups in the region, Autolatina
has benefited from Brazil's rising market but its share of the cake has
shrunk. Brazil's production will approach 1.6m vehicles this year compared
with 914,000 in 1990. But during that time Ford's share of sales has fallen
to 12 per cent from 18.8 per cent and VW to 33.6 from 37.4 per cent.
Rivalries between the two dealer networks also played a key role in the
split.
Earlier this year the VW dealers' association succeeded in its battle to
stop the company turning over the new production platform for its
best-selling Gol so that Ford could produce a similar car. The opposition
symbolised a growing dissatisfaction, prevalent among both VW and Ford
dealers, that the two companies' sales and brand awareness were suffering
from the joint venture.
There were tensions within Autolatina. 'In the later years, with the move
towards world cars, both sides got very protective about their research and
Ford, for example, was worried that its numbers were being relayed to
Germany,' says one industry observer.
Mr De Smedt says the relationship was successful: 'There were no more fights
than in any other family.'
He also stresses that Autolatina was almost continually financially
successful. Last year, after-tax profits increased to Dollars 377m from
Dollars 48m in 1992 and it only once made a loss, in 1991.
The task ahead will be to disentangle the companies' shared activities.
Although the companies will return to their original factories the
production of existing hybrid models will continue until the end of the
models' natural life, which will mean in practice beyond the dissolution of
Autolatina, says Mr de Smedt.
This means, for example, that the VW saloon models Pointer and Logus, which
are built on a Ford Escort production platform, will continue to be produced
when Ford returns to take over its plant in Taboao near Sao Paulo. Ford will
continue to build the VW cars and sell them to VW.
There are important management challenges for both car makers. Ford, which
dominated Autolatina's middle and upper management, particularly in finance,
will have to find a new cadre of production managers. Conversely VW, which
took charge of production management, will need middle and upper managers.
For Ford, the challenge is to increase its slumping market share. Sales have
been plummeting since the government announced in early 1993 large tax
breaks for one-litre cars, which now dominate the market. Fiat's subsidiary
has nearly doubled its market share to 26 per cent since 1990, partly thanks
to its one-litre Uno Mille car but Ford has not had a small car to take
advantage of the increased demand.
The company is likely to expand its product line by importing more models.
Importing has become a more viable strategy since the Brazilian government
recently reduced import duties to 20 per cent from 35 per cent.
The company is to import Fiestas from Europe next year and is planning a
Dollars 450m investment next year to build Fiestas locally. Industry experts
add that Ford will probably need to import a more powerful engine to replace
the current model developed in the 1970s.
VW's aspiration to return to its pre-Autolatina market share of 40 per cent
is regarded as wishful thinking given the increased competition from both
domestic competitors and from imports, which have increased sharply in the
last two years to 10 per cent of sales compared with 4 per cent.
However, it is still the dominant car maker in Brazil, which is VW's second
most important market worldwide. Its strategy will be to rely on production
of its new range of Gols, which range from one-litre models to a GTI model.
It may also produce the Golf and Passat in Brazil.
The company said it was considering a Dollars 100m investment in a
commercial vehicles' plant as Autolatina's lorry and bus factory in Sao
Paulo will be returned to Ford.

FT  03 DEC 94 / International Company News: Italian banks in negotiations
over Credito Italiano's new bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Credito Italiano, the Milan-based bank, and Credito Romagnolo of Bologna
were last night trying to reach agreement on the terms of a friendly bid by
Credito Italiano for control of the Bolognese bank's quoted holding company.
Full details of the new offer could be announced in the next few days,
assuming it is approved by Credito Romagnolo and the Bank of Italy, which
supervises the fragmented Italian banking sector.
Credito Italiano (Credit) last week offered to improve the terms of its bid,
plans for which were first outlined at the end of October and rejected by
Credito Romagnolo (Rolo).
The Milan bank has so far refused to specify whether it will pay more than
the price originally proposed - L19,000 a share - or offer to buy more than
a 50.1 per cent stake in Gruppo Bancario Credito Romagnolo.
Last night, advisers to both banks were working together in Milan on the
plans for a new bid. If Rolo decides to accept an improved Credit bid, it
will put paid to the alternative plan for a merger with Caer, the parent
company of another local bank, Cassa di Risparmio, in Bologna.
Under the terms outlined this week, Credit offered more management autonomy
to Rolo, albeit for a limited period, guaranteed the rights of minority
shareholders, and said it would recommend a dividend at least equal to 55
per cent of Rolo profit, in line with the trend in recent years.
Separately, Credit and the UK banking group National Westminster announced
yesterday they were intending to sell their majority stake in Banca
Creditwest e dei Comuni Vesuviani to Credito Emiliano Holding, a growing
privately owned Italian banking group.
Credit owns 68.04 per cent of Creditwest, and National Westminster a further
19.2 per cent.
Creditwest, which has about 20 branches and a headquarters in Milan, has
been handicapped by its size.
Credit and NatWest said they had signed a declaration of intent to sell to
Credito Emiliano and were now negotiating a price for the stake.
The 87.3 per cent stake in Creditwest could be valued at more than L120bn
(Dollars 74m) Italian news agencies reported yesterday.

Pearson, the media and entertainment group, yesterday took control of
Recoletos, the Spanish publishing group, with the purchase of a further 10

the Spanish group to 57 per cent.
Pearson, which owns the Financial Times, bought a small stake in Recoletos
more than five years ago, as part of a policy of taking stakes in publishers
of business and financial titles around the world.
Recoletos, publishes Marca, Spain's top daily sports newspaper. It also

FT  03 DEC 94 / International Company News: Korea likely to approve Samsung
car project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The South Korean government is set to approve Samsung's project to become
the country's fifth car manufacturer.
The company plans to start production in 1998, with an initial annual
capacity of 50,000 cars increasing to 500,000 by 2002.
However, Mr Park Un-so, the vice-minister for trade, industry and energy,
said yesterday the government was likely to approve Samsung's application to
import car technology from Nissan of Japan after Samsung promised to take
measures to avoid disrupting the Korean car industry.
The application is expected to be submitted next week,
Korea's car companies have opposed Samsung's plans, arguing that it would
lead to excessive competition and weaken the industry, which is rapidly
expanding production capacity to become the world's fourth biggest vehicle
manufacturer.
The government shared those doubts and tried to discourage Samsung, Korea's
second largest industrial group, from proceeding with its Dollars 5bn
project.
Samsung will recruit engineers from abroad and source most car components
from within the group, which would reduce competition with other Korean
carmakers for these resources.
It promised that most of its output would be for export, to avoid affecting
the domestic sales of the other carmakers, which rely heavily on the local
market.
Samsung has lobbied the government intensely for the past year to approve
the project, which it regards as vital to its ambitions of developing its
heavy machinery operations to match the success of its electronics business.
Although Samsung will be much smaller than the other Korean carmakers, it
plans to focus on the upper end of the market by producing three models of
2,000cc cars based on Nissan technology.
In what is regarded as an astute political move, Samsung will locate its car
plant in the south-eastern port of Pusan, the home town of South Korean
President Kim Young-sam. Pusan has recently suffered job losses due to the
decline of its textile and footwear industries.

FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Rap to raise Pounds 1m less than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rap Group, the rubber and plastics distributor, will raise Pounds 1m less
from its flotation than was expected when its pathfinder prospectus was
published on November 15.
In common with several recent new issues, Rap has had to alter its plans
because of lower than expected institutional demand.
Mr David Emmett, chairman and chief executive, who co-led a management
buy-out in 1991, said: 'We obviously had to react to market conditions but
the important thing is to get the listing.'
According to the prospectus, published yesterday, Rap will receive Pounds
3.55m net from the flotation compared with an original estimate of Pounds
4.6m. The market capitalisation will be Pounds 15.1m, down from Pounds 17m.
The planned placing price of 145p was lowered to 142p and the prospective
p/e for the year to December 31 is 11.1, down from 11.5. Gearing will rise
from an expected 12 per cent to 36 per cent.
The flotation involves the placing of 2.8m shares, 40 per cent of the equity
capital. The eight member management team will sell a further 450,000 shares
for Pounds 640,000, leaving it with a 36 per cent holding, and Causeway
Capital, the only investor at the time of the MBO, will sell 1m shares for
Pounds 1.42m, giving it a 23 per cent stake.
Of the Pounds 3.55m raised, Pounds 2.1m will be used to redeem the
outstanding preference shares, currently held by Causeway. The remainder
will be used to provide additional working capital and to finance further
acquisitions. New shares will be issued for larger acquisitions.
The pre-tax profits forecast for the year to December 31 remains Pounds
1.7m, up from Pounds 1.2m in 1993.

FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Lonrho fills vacant posts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robin Whitten, a chartered accountant who joined Lonrho in 1978, was
named yesterday as Lonrho's new finance director at the same time as Mr
Nicholas Morrell, another Lonrho stalwart, was appointed deputy managing
director.
The appointments were announced following the group's December board
meeting, the first since Mr Dieter Boch, the German financier, won his
year-long battle to persuade Mr Tiny Rowland to quit the Lonrho board.
Lonrho has not had a finance director since Mr Terry Robinson left to become
Union International's chief executive at the start of 1992.
Since then Mr Whitten and Mr Morrell have been acting as the Lonrho board's
finance committee. Mr Whitten has given recent City present- ations, so
institutional investors are familiar with him.
Their appointment to the two new roles is understood to reflect Mr Boch's
desire to restructure executive responsibilities without bringing in new
directors. He is chief executive and managing director.
Mr Whitten was appointed a Lonrho director in 1981 and has been responsible
for the group's Treasury functions, and for various operations in the UK and
Africa.
Mr Morrell joined Lonrho in 1981 and became managing director of The
Observer in 1988.
He was appointed an associate director in 1990 and a director in 1992 and is
currently responsible for certain UK operations and for Lonrho's operations
in Malawi, Nigeria and Zimbabwe.

FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Helping a minnow swallow a whale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Much is at stake in RJB's raising of funds for its bid for the English coal
mines, not least the reputation of its adviser, Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
For BZW has put itself on the line in what one rival calls a 'rather heroic'
effort to help a minnow swallow a whale. The BZW seal of approval is an
important component of the RJB bid. 'BZW and Rothschild (the government's
adviser) obviously add credibility,' said one investor. But, he added:
'Great names have given their names to propectuses in the past and they
haven't always worked out.'
Mr Graham Pimlott, managing director of BZW, shares the view that an
investment bank lives by its reputation.
However, he plays down the significance of the RJB deal. 'Other than the
publicity surrounding it, it is not significantly more interesting than
several other deals we are working on.'
The investment banking arm of Barclays is acting as joint adviser on the
sale of the government's 40 per cent holdings in the UK power generators. It
is by that transaction, rather than the RJB bid, that BZW's privatisation
skills will be judged.
Nor is coal as attractive a sector as some. Kleinwort Benson took the
expertise it accumulated in electricity privatisation to win mandates around
the world. Mr Pimlott sees no great wave of international coal
privatisations and intends to disband the RJB team.
The focus, moreover, is on RJB rather than its adviser. Even a critic such
as Mr Mark Wellesley-Wood, coal specialist at Kleinwort Benson, the
investment banker to a rival of RJB's, conceded: 'You can criticise an
adviser but the primary responsibility lies with the client.'
The RJB deal does nevertheless matter to BZW. The perfor mance of the
enlarged group and its leader, Mr Richard Budge, will reflect on the
investment bank's choice of clients. Rival bidders have questioned the
accuracy of RJB's assumptions in a bid to which BZW put its name. The
investment bank also advised RJB to put in a bid which turned out to be at
least Pounds 300m more than rival offers.
Even flawless execution is no defence. One BZW executive said privately that
somebody would have to take the rap if the bid failed and BZW could receive
a share of the blame.
There is a definite upside, however. Privatisations are prestigious
transactions. 'If you succeed it is a definite feather in your cap,' said Mr
Pimlott. The RJB transaction serves also to demonstrate BZW's broking and
placing power. 'They are selling the story quite well in face of tremendous
criticism,' said one observer. Problems associated with the offer have
received such an airing that a successful fund raising will be all the more
of an achievement.
However, it will be the securities side of BZW, always its stronger
dimension, that takes the credit from other investment bankers; not the
corporate finance department. 'They bid way more than they need have done.
If the broking side pulls it off, then it will be a great triumph for them,'
said a director at a UK house.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scantronic Holdings, the security components group, which has become the
subject of growing bid speculation in recent months, yesterday appointed
Samuel Montague as its financial adviser.
Scantronic said it would need the advice 'particularly in relation to the
unsolicited approaches received'. It also announced it was appointing Norton
Rose as legal adviser.
A number of companies have announced their interest in making a bid although
the company has declined to identify its other suitors.
Scantronic has appeared increasingly vulnerable over the past year. In July
it announced the departure of its finance director, Mr Ray Dias, claiming
that he had failed to alert the board to the twin impact of increased
borrowing and difficult trading conditions.

FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: UniChem Pounds 19m expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in UniChem rose yesterday as the pharmaceuticals retailer and
wholesaler bought another 43 chemists' shops.
The deal takes its chain of pharmacies to 351 - well ahead of AAH, its main
competitor - and consolidates its position as the third biggest in the UK,
behind Boots and Lloyds Chemists. The shares closed at 258p, up 11p.
UniChem is acquiring Molescroft Holdings and Investment, a Humberside group
that also has, in addition to the Selles shops, a small wholesale operation
and a business providing occupational health and first aid supplies.
The maximum cost will be Pounds 19.24m, comprising Pounds 16m plus a sum in
respect of net assets. It will be made up through the issue of 663,852
ordinary shares, valued at 256.2p, and Pounds 12.7m of loan notes. The
balance will be paid in cash.
Mr Jeff Harris, chief executive, said Molescroft was one of the few
independent chains of chemists still available for acquisition.
In September, UniChem announced a Pounds 58.4m rights issue to underpin its
expansion. The group planned to use the funds to wipe out short-term
borrowings, acquire retail outlets and move into other health-related
businesses.
Molescroft made pre-tax profits of Pounds 738,000 on sales of Pounds 23.7m
in the year to October 1993 - the last available accounts. It is expected to
contribute at least Pounds 2.6m of profits in its first year.
Selles will join UniChem's Moss chain. However, the Selles name is well
known in Humberside and will be retained for the foreseeable future.
Selles Medical, with sales of Pounds 2m, will be merged in UniChem's
existing occupational health business. The Molescroft wholesale operation,
which has external sales of Pounds 1m, will be merged in UniChem's national
operation.

FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: C&amp;G members can vote on March 31
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 1m-plus members of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, the UK's
sixth largest society, will be able to vote on the proposed cash bid for the
society by Lloyds Bank on Friday March 31, C&amp;G said yesterday.
The special meeting will be held at the London Arena, which holds about
12,000.
A transfer statement, giving details of the plans, will be sent out to
members in the last week of February. It will include the 1994 results for
both C&amp;G and Lloyds, which are likely to have been announced that month.
The transfer has to be agreed by separate votes of investors and of
borrowers. Under building societies' legislation, not all of them are
eligible for a share of the Pounds 1.8bn cash bid by Lloyds.
A simple majority of borrowers taking part in the vote is enough to pass
their resolution, but the investors' resolution must be passed by both 75
per cent of those voting and 50 per cent of those eligible to vote in the
case of the investors' resolution.
If members approve the deal, then C&amp;G will become part of the Lloyds Bank
group on August 1.
Cash payments to eligible investors and depositors are expected to be made
soon after that. C&amp;G estimates that the average total payment to an
individual will be about Pounds 2,000.

FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: The right sort of weather for Wolverhampton
&amp; Dudley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Good summer weather gave a fourth-quarter fillip to Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley
Breweries and helped it lift pre-tax profits for the year by 5 per cent from
Pounds 36.5m to Pounds 38.3m.
Volumes rose 2.3 per cent in the quarter, leaving volumes for the year down
0.5 per cent in a Midlands market off about 5 per cent. The group's lager
volumes grew well, indicating that it suffered a fall in ale, but it
declined to give a breakdown.
The latest trading period ended October 2 covered 52 weeks, against 53 weeks
a year earlier. Adjusted profits were up 8 per cent. Turnover was up 3.6 per
cent (or an adjusted 5.6 per cent) to Pounds 231m (Pounds 224m).
The results were also helped by lower production costs, a higher
contribution from Camerons, the north-east brewery it acquired in 1992, and
improved performance from restaurants and hotels. Food sales across the
group rose by 23 per cent. Beer benefited from the group's first sales in
draught cans and new products such as Zamek, an imported Czech lager. Sales
through supermarkets and the free trade were also ahead.
'We have plenty of scope for growth in our own areas,' said Mr David
Thompson, managing director. Trading in the first two months of this year
were good in comparison with a weaker period a year earlier, but it was too
early to extrapolate for the year, he added.
Pre-tax profits included Pounds 608,000 in property profits against Pounds
1.02m last time as the group continued to sell poorer properties and add new
ones.
A final dividend of 8.8p is proposed for a total of 13.9p, up 10.3 per cent.
Earnings per share were 39p (38.6p) after property profits and 38.5p (37.2p)
before.
COMMENT
A new mood of optimism from management, particularly about consumers'
intentions, prompted analysts to nudge up their forecasts for this year.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 41m for earnings of 41.5p puts the shares on a
pros-pective multiple of 12.5. This is a fraction behind a couple of other
regional brewers such as Greene King. The shares are fully valued but offer
steady growth to long-term holders. Do not expect fizz. The manage-ment, one
of the most consistent and competent among the regionals, believes in
working existing assets harder rather buying new businesses.

FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Heavy demand likely for BSkyB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Sky Broadcasting flotation is expected to be heavily
oversubscribed ahead of next week's announcement of the offer price and
share allocation.
Apart from strong institutional interest, more than 300,000 people
registered to receive details of the flotation, expected to value the
company at between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 4.6bn.
Keen interest in the float has come despite valuations ranging from Pounds
2.6bn to Pounds 3.6bn from some analysts.
The price has not yet been fixed. Because many of the shares offered through
shareshops are likely to go to BSkyB subscribers, there will be a strong
incentive to try to ensure the price does not fall after unconditional
dealing begins on December 15.
The price is, however, expected to reach at least the mid-point of the
valuation range of 233p-268p.
Meanwhile, stockbrokers James Capel yesterday published a note arguing that
the Pounds 4bn-Pounds 4.6bn valuation 'looked expensive' and instead
suggested Pounds 3.6bn - or 210p a share. Analyst Ms Lucy Broke identified
the potential risks as: the dish market maturing as cable developed; BSkyB
losing its stranglehold on key programming or having to pay more to keep
rights; and changes in the technological or regulatory environment.
County NatWest has retained its valuation of Pounds 3.3bn set earlier this
year and Smith New Court, co-managers of the deal, have gone for Pounds
3.7bn. Henderson Crosthwaite, at the low extreme, has valued BSkyB at Pounds
2.6bn, while other stockbroking firms are in the range of between Pounds 4bn
and Pounds 4.6bn.
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a 17.5 per cent stake in BSkyB.

FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Vendome shares dip despite 13% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Vendome Luxury Group fell 17p to 483p yesterday, as the holding
company for brands such as Cartier and Dunhill reported a 13 per cent rise
in pre-tax profits from SFr194.2m to SFr218.9m (Pounds 105.7m) for the six
months to September 30.
In sterling terms, the rise was greater at 21 per cent. The comparative
figures have been adjusted to remove the distorting effects of last year's
non-recurring SFr48.6m reconstruction costs, following the group's its
creation from the luxury businesses of Richemont, Rothmans and Dunhill.
Turnover climbed 8 per cent to SFr1.25bn (SFr1.16bn). Operating profits were
SFr203.3m (SFr181.4m).
Sales in the Far East rose the sharpest - at 13 per cent to SFr469.1m
(SFr416.7m), though Europe remains Vendome's main market. Here sales grew 8
per cent to SFr524.6m (SFr484.6m). Behind the Far Eastern performance lay
stronger growth than previously from Japan - a result of a rise in tourism
and a strong yen.
Mr Joseph Kanoui, chairman, said: 'I'm proud Europe is our main market, but
I would be as proud in five years to say the Far East had overtaken it.' The
group is making inroads into China, where it already has four Dunhill stores
and three Cartier. Lord Douro, deputy chairman, said there were more to
come.
Sales in the Americas slipped almost 2 per cent to SFr230.2m, though they
rose by 5 per cent in dollar terms.
The greatest fall was from the rest of the world, which includes the Middle
East. Here sales declined 16 per cent to SFr28.5m.
He was unworried by downturns in certain markets, however, saying the
group's geographical spread was its protection.
Mr Kanoui said the group continued to suffer counterfeiting at the hands of
organised crime and imitation from other companies, though he was reluctant
to give figures. He hoped the situation would improve with the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which requires signatories to help protect
intellectual property.
Leather goods showed the strongest growth with sales up 22 per cent to
SFR138.1m, while perfumes was the only sector down - by 13 per cent to
SFr45.4m.
Earnings rose 12 per cent to SFr0.248 and the maiden interim dividend is a
gross SFr0.075, which shareholders can receive as a net UK pay-out of 2.9p,
excluding any associated tax credit.

FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Daily Mail close to finalising Bailey deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Daily Mail and General Trust is expected to win the right to push ahead
with the Pounds 92m acquisition of T Bailey Forman, publisher of the
Nottingham Evening Post, despite the opposition of the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
It is believed a deal is close to being finalised between the DMGT and the
Department of Trade and Industry, under which the publishers of the Daily
Mail will make a number of compromises in order to get a deal.
The deal on offer would involve DMGT setting up independent editorial boards
for the main Bailey Forman titles to protect both their editorial
independence and local roots. In addition, peripheral businesses would have
to be sold.
The compromise has not yet been formally accepted by DMGT, but it is
considered likely that it will do so.
The national and regional newspaper group was given until December 5 to
convince Mr Tim Eggar, the trade secretary, that the deal should go ahead,
despite the MMC view that the bid could operate against the public interest.
The main MMC objection was that the DMGT already owned the nearby Leicester
Mercury and Derby Evening Telegraph through its Northcliffe Newspapers
subsidiary. This would give DMGT too high a concentration in the east
Midlands area.
Midland Independent Newspapers, publisher of the Birmingham Post and Mail,
told the government that the acquisition should remain blocked.
The Bailey Forman group was put up for sale this summer in an auction
organised by BZW, the merchant bank.
The final sale price was very much at the higher end of newspaper industry
expectations.
If the deal were to fall through, it would pose considerable difficulties
for Bailey Forman. Bids from other potential owners could start at about
Pounds 20m less than the DMGT bid.

FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Lilleshall's shares decline 18p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Lilleshall, the engineering and building products group, fell 18p
to 123p yesterday, after it warned that its two UK window companies would
perform disappointingly in the second half of the year.
Mr John Leek, chairman, said that profits for the year to December 31 would
be 'significantly ahead' of 1993, but lower than anticipated. Earnings per
share would remain flat at 10p.
In 1993 pre-tax profits were Pounds 3.91m, with Pounds 3.52m for the first
half of this year.
Following the announcement analysts lowered their forecasts for full-year
pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 5.1m.
Mr Leek said that Ideal Windows, the commercial window subsidiary, had
increased volumes but was suffering from competition, particularly in the
local authority market.
Its retail window business, St Helens Glass, was facing weak consumer
demand. The two companies make up 25 per cent of group turnover.
On Wednesday, Anglian Group reported a sharp decline in interim profits
because of reduced retail revenues and falling margins in the commercial
market.
Mr Leek said that the rest of the group was performing well. However
Lilleshall, which has made seven acquisitions in the last two years,
including St Helens Glass in September 1993, would not rush into further
acquisitions.

FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Row over RJB price discount - Government
under fire from failed bidders for British Coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was embroiled in a bitter row over coal privatisation
yesterday after confirming that RJB Mining, its preferred bidder for the
English regions, will pay Pounds 99m less than its offer price of Pounds
914m.
Failed bidders complained about a deal which allows Pounds 116m of the
Pounds 815m final price to be paid in instalments over three years, after an
initial payment of Pounds 699m.
The reduced price and deferment of some payments was viewed in the City as
increasing the chances of RJB raising the Pounds 894m needed to finance its
controversial bid for what it describes as English Coal.
However Mr Christopher Stainforth, a managing director of Guinness Mahon,
said his client, Coal Investments, had been told by government advisers that
its bid would have been invalid if it had included an element of deferred
consideration.
Another failed bidder said he had not known deferred payments were possible.
Mr Stainforth said that if his client had known such an arrangement was
possible, it could have increased its offer. 'The rules have been changed to
suit the bidder because he could not afford the price he offered. I do not
see how the government can know it got the best price.'
The Department of Trade and Industry said RJB was being treated no
differently from other bidders. The bid rules had not excluded deferred
payments.
It is understood that at least one of the deals for the South Wales and
Scottish regions could involve staged payments.
Coal Investments, led by Mr Malcolm Edwards, is part of the Mining Scotland
consortium which is preferred bidder for Scotland.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, told Parliament yesterday that Mining
Scotland would acquire the Scottish mining assets of British Coal for Pounds
39.4m and up to Pounds 10m extra for increased levels of stock.
As in the English regions, this was lower than the bid price. In the case of
RJB the adjustments of Pounds 99m related to changes in expected levels of
coal stocks and liabilities disclosed after bids were submitted.
Mr Eggar said RJB's final bid price of Pounds 815m represented the 'best
value for money' for the government.
The government's statement coincided with publication by RJB Mining of its
'pathfinder prospectus' laying out the details of its bid and projections
underpinning it.
The company, capitalised at Pounds 157m, is forecasting pre-tax profits of
Pounds 15m (Pounds 12.2m), above expectations, for its existing business
this year, earnings per share of 23.6p (22.7p) and a net dividend of 12.5p
(12p).
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, advising RJB, expects to publish a final prospectus,
including the price of shares to be sold to finance the bid, by Tuesday
December 13. The share offer would close on December 20. RJB has scheduled
an EGM for December 29 and expects to take control of the regions on that
day.
In the pathfinder, RJB says that of the deferred payments Pounds 80m will be
paid in two instalments of Pounds 40m, with interest at 1 per cent per annum
above bank base rate. A further Pounds 36m is payable in three instalments,
together with 9 per cent interest, on the first three anniversaries after
completion.
RJB will raise about Pounds 400m through a share issue and Pounds 494m
through bank debt.
RJB said it would increase dividends progressively. However, until the level
of post-acquisition debt reduced substantially, a higher level of dividend
cover than for the current financial year would not be appropriate.
RJB said the final price adjustments meant that the company would be taking
on more liabilities and less coal stocks than it expected when it made its
Pounds 914m bid.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Flicker on the big picture: Films have had a good year, but
costs are rising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When 20th Century Fox released Miracle on 34th Street last month, it hoped
the film would be a Christmas hit. But last week, Fox was forced to offer
'your money back if you don't enjoy it' in a desperate attempt to persuade
US cinema goers to see it.
Miracle is now vying with Kenneth Branagh's critically slated Mary Shelley's
Frankenstein for the dubious honour of becoming the celluloid turkey of
Christmas 1994. Both have flopped badly in the US in a prosperous period for
the movie business, as hit films such as Interview with the Vampire, Star
Trek Generations and The Lion King break records at the box office.
Yet concern is mounting in the industry about the spiralling cost of
film-making and declining profitability. Hollywood was shocked by the recent
announcement that Sony, the Japanese electronics group, had fallen into the
red in the first half of this year after making a Y265bn (Pounds 1.7bn)
write-off on its US film interests.
Sony apart, 1994 has been a good year for the industry on the revenue front.
The US box office has taken more than Dollars 4.5bn so far this year against
Dollars 4.35bn in the same period of 1993, according to Variety, the
industry magazine. Christmas looks set to continue this success, with the
top 30 US films having taken Dollars 100m during last weekend's Thanksgiving
Holiday, ahead of 1993's Dollars 82m.
Business is similarly buoyant in other countries with cinema attendances
rising in new markets in Asia, eastern Europe and Latin America, as well as
in western Europe where there has been heavy investment in new cinemas and
multiplex complexes. Industry estimates suggest that markets outside the US
now represent 60 per cent of box office returns, against 40 per cent 10
years ago.
Despite this, success in the US is usually critical in determining a film's
long-term prospects in other countries. 'This industry is glued to the
Variety league tables,' said Mr Michael Kuhn, chairman of PolyGram Film
Entertainment. 'If a movie isn't a hit when it opens in the US, it generally
won't succeed elsewhere.'
The rewards for successful films are higher than in the past, thanks to the
growth in additional income from video, television and computer games. A
Hollywood blockbuster now makes roughly 40 per cent of its total income from
video, 20 per cent from television, 10 per cent from other sources and just
30 per cent from the cinema.
The studios expect continued growth in these areas. They also hope for a
further boost from video-CDs, which should be widely available by the end of
1995. With image and sound superior to cassettes, they could stimulate video
sales just as compact discs boosted recorded music.
This outlook has brought a flood of new investment to Hollywood. Mr Ted
Turner, the cable TV entrepreneur, and PolyGram, the UK music group, have
increased their film interests in the early 1990s by start-up and
acquisition. Both had hits this year - Mr Turner with The Mask and PolyGram
with Four Weddings and a Funeral - and are now moving on to bigger budget
films.
There is also the arrival of the 'dream team' of Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg,
former head of Walt Disney's film division, Mr Steven Spielberg, the
Oscar-winning director, and Mr David Geffen, the billionaire music mogul.
They appear to be having no difficulty in interesting investors in their
plans for a new entertainment group. 'Everyone on Wall Street wants a slice
of that pie,' said one investment banker. Mr Bill Gates of Microsoft, the
world's largest software group, is also mooted as a likely investor.
As a result of this influx, the industry has increased its output. More than
200 films have already been released in the US this year, against 190 in the
same period of 1993, according to Hollywood Reporter, the trade magazine.
There are now 252 films in production or pre-production, 44 more than at
this time last year.
The crowded market is forcing the studios to pay more to attract stars. The
'talent' deals hit the headlines - such as the news that New Line, one of Mr
Turner's film subsidiaries, will pay Dollars 12m to Ms Julia Roberts and
Dollars 8m to Ms Meg Ryan to star in its remake of The Women, the 1939
classic.
But marketing costs are also escalating as competition intensifies. The
total marketing budget of a Dollars 40m or Dollars 50m film will typically
be Dollars 20m to Dollars 25m, with roughly Dollars 12m spent in the first
weekend of a US launch. It can cost more to publicise a small film than to
make it: Four Weddings and a Funeral took less than Dollars 5m to produce,
but PolyGram spent Dollars 18m on publicity in the US.
'Why is movie marketing so expensive? Because people panic,' said Mr Frank
Mancuso, chairman of MGM. 'There's so much money at stake when a film comes
out. If the marketplace is cluttered, you've got to shout very loud to make
your voice heard.'
The increase in costs make unsuccessful films even more expensive. The
failure of Frankenstein could cost Sony tens of millions of dollars.
And even for the successful films, the returns may not be spectacular. Most
studios now spread the risk of a flop by bringing in other investors or
paying the stars with part of the profits. This cushions their exposure to
flops, but also reduces their profits on hits.
'We're in a situation where it costs more to make a motion picture but the
returns are getting smaller and smaller,' said Mr Sidney Sheinberg,
president of MCA/Universal.
As Sony's plight suggests, this situation cannot continue indefinitely.
'Assuming that this industry is composed of people not all of whom are
totally stupid,' says Mr Sheinberg, 'we've got to do something to stop it.'

FT  03 DEC 94 / Bad news for the papers: French government concerns over
press revelations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prominence that the French press has been giving over the past few
months to the corruption scandals wracking the country is provoking a
political reaction.
It is not as harsh as that of Shakespeare's Cleopatra, who told a messenger
he should be 'whipped with wire and stewed in brine' for bringing her bad
news.
It is more a desire among politicians to put a stop to the torrent of
corruption stories in the press. These have precipitated the fall of three
government ministers: Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, Mr Alain
Carignon, communications minister, and Mr Michel Roussin, foreign aid
minister. They have also hit the share prices of top companies implicated in
the scandals, such as Alcatel, Generale des Eaux and Lyonnaise des Eaux.
In many of these stories, the press has been able to draw on investigating
magistrates' dossiers, even before they have been presented to the suspects.
A recent amendment to a justice bill passed by the National Assembly would
prevent the publication of information relating to people who are the
subject of an inquiry or judicial investigation without their consent.
The amendment, proposed by Mr Alain Marsaud, a Gaullist MP and former
magistrate, may get no further. It was voted through by only a handful of
deputies in a late-night session, and may be defeated when it goes before
the Senate later this month.
Even if the amendment falls, however, the Balladur government is working on
ways to prevent magistrates' dossiers leaking to the press. Yesterday, Prime
Minister Edouard Balladur's commission on anti-corruption reform insisted
that secrecy must be maintained.
These attempts to clamp down on press leaks come at a time when the French
press has been flagellating itself - or, more specifically, the magazine
Paris-Match and journalist Mr Philippe Alexandre - for breaking the taboo on
delving into the private lives of politicians. The weekly news magazine
revealed what all self-respecting Paris journalists now claim to have known
for years, that President Francois Mitterrand had, in addition to his
official 'first family' of wife Danielle and two sons, a 'second family' on
the side.
When Paris-Match ran some touching photos of the president and his
20-year-old daughter, and Mr Alexandre detailed their relationship in a
book, the condemnation was as loud from the press as from any other quarter.
Mr Jean Miot, a director of Le Figaro and president of the French press
federation, said the profession was in danger of 'falling into the gutter
with some of its Anglo-Saxon counterparts'.
Even Mr Claude Angeli, editor of the satirical weekly, Le Canard Enchaine,
joined the chorus. The magazine has been ready to have a go at France's
quasi-monarchical presidency since its revelations about the diamonds
ex-President Giscard d'Estaing received from 'Emperor' Bokassa, dictator of
the Central African Republic. But Mr Angeli said he was 'completely against
this unbundling of the private lives of politicians'.
What went virtually unremarked was the legitimate public issue that
President Mitterrand had maintained his second family on government
property, and therefore at taxpayers' expense.
But the French law on privacy, which strongly protects individuals against
press intrusion, is strongly upheld by the courts and by public opinion.
Politicians generally expect to keep their personal lives to themselves.
They are also expected to keep quiet about them: the aberration of Mr Michel
Rocard, the former Socialist prime minister, in announcing to the press in
1991 that he was separating from his then wife was partially excused on the
ground he was a Protestant.
Some of the moral outrage directed at Paris-Match and Mr Alexandre has been
tactical. As in countries such as the UK, the tabloid press is constantly
warned that its latest antics may precipitate legislation to control it. The
French press, therefore, does not want allegations about invasions of
privacy used as a pretext to muzzle it just when it is getting its teeth
into political corruption.
The semblance of government control over the French press has been slow to
disappear in France. It was only last summer that Mr Charles Pasqua, the
interior minister, moved to disband the 'political police' function of the
Renseignements Genereaux, a French security service, after an RG agent was
found to have eavesdropped on a Socialist party meeting. Up to then, French
national newspapers always had an RG man stationed at their printers to
check the first editions for anything sensitive or objectionable to the
government, though this rarely ended in an attempt at censorship.
In addition, French politicians still routinely insist on vetting the
wording of interviews they give to the press before these appear in print.
And the government gives newspapers some FFr4.2bn (Pounds 490m) a year in
cash and postal subsidies.
But the French press is as aggressive in its pursuit of the government and
business establishment as its Anglo-Saxon counterpart. In exposing recent
scandals, it has been able to ride on the back of a judiciary that has
suddenly taken the bit between its teeth in investigating corruption.
Magistrates' investigations are normally protected from exposure by the
secret d'instruction (secrecy of judicial investigation), which prevents law
and police officers from disclosing details of the case during its early
stages.
Secrecy is necessary because, during the long process of investigation,
suspects have fewer rights than under Anglo-Saxon law. They are, for
instance, not allowed to have a lawyer present for the first 19 hours of
their detention, and even after that can find it hard to discover the
charges against them.
However, the press is exempted from the secret d'instruction by the freedom
of expression provisions of the Declaration of Human Rights of 1789, and can
therefore legally print any leaks it gets. Some magistrates have been
quietly happy to leak details of cases to the press to prevent them being
stifled by the judicial hierarchy. A prosecutor in Valenciennes, for
example, has been giving open press conferences about his investigations
into football bribery allegations concerning Mr Bernard Tapie's
Olympique-Marseille team.
A new balance between an individual's right to be protected by judicial
secrecy and the public's right to know will have to be found, as Mr Pierre
Mehaignerie, the justice minister, recognises. A degree of secrecy may be
maintainable, he says, provided French magistrates can shorten their often
interminable investigations.
But even during the investigation period, 'windows of information' might be
arranged when more details might be released, particularly in cases
involving politicians. Perhaps magistrates could be given their own press
officers, he suggests.
The most thrusting of French investigative reporters might scoff at this.
But it would suit most of their colleagues.
The French press in general certainly does not want the public coming to
agree with the retort of Cleopatra's messenger: 'The nature of bad news
infects the teller.'

FT  03 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Share trade concern is valid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr M E R ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I believe the Office of Fair Trading is correct to express concern over
market-makers concealing trades in large blocks of shares from institutional
investors ('OFT says stock exchange price secrecy uncompetitive', November
25).
Institutions should operate broadly within the constraints of the Normal
Market Size, just as everyone else does.
Surely the solution lies in finding ways to boost liquidity, rather than
attempting to engineer liquidity where it does not exist?

FT  03 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Importance of 'positivity' in
confronting cancer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr REX WINSBURY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As someone recently diagnosed as having terminal cancer, I am pleased
that the articles on cancer by Clive Cookson (Technology: 'Closing in on a
serial killer', November 29 - first in series) will deal with diet, food
supplements and alternative remedies - with some sympathy, I hope, since
they are often (as in my case) ignored by conventional medicine as unproven
or cranky.
Since being written off by the National Health Service, I have met many
people who, by various combinations of radically altered diet, radically
altered life-style and personal determination, appear to have fought off
'the crab'. For how long, of course, who can say? Perhaps I shall find out.
But some doctors attest to the fact that those who attain that
hard-to-define but all-important 'positivity' last longer. That should be
part of the scientific evidence - and 'positivity', unlike certain drugs,
has no nasty side-effects.

FT  03 DEC 94 / An investment for the top drawer: Although gilts look like a
good long-term bet there is no rush to buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK inflation, as Mr Kenneth Clarke reminded listeners to his Budget speech
this week, has not been so low since England won football's World Cup in
1966.
But in the following year, two national humiliations occurred: the pound was
devalued and Scotland defeated England at Wembley. There has been little but
bad news on either the football or the inflation front ever since.
Investors in UK government bonds, or gilts, have suffered third division
returns for much of the intervening period, since inflation erodes the value
of fixed income investments. An investment of Pounds 100 in gilts in 1966
would, in inflation-adjusted terms, have been worth just Pounds 94 by 1985,
even allowing for the reinvestment of all gross income.
Only in the last few years have gilts rebounded sufficiently to earn
investors a decent return. Nevertheless, at the end of 1993, that original
Pounds 100 was still worth just Pounds 181, according to BZW's Equity-Gilt
Study, whereas the same sum invested in UK equities would have generated
Pounds 483.
This year has seen a return to the bad old days for gilt investors. The FT
government securities index has dropped from 107.6 on January 3 to 92.3
yesterday, forcing the yield on medium-term gilts up from 6.1 to 8.46 per
cent.
A look at the chart, however, shows that the real (inflation-adjusted)
return on gilts currently looks quite attractive in historical terms. The
benchmark 10-year gilt was offering a yield to maturity of 8.46 per cent at
the start of trading yesterday. That compares with a headline inflation rate
in October of just 2.4 per cent.
Inflation may have reached its trough as the recovery starts to pick up
speed both in the UK and worldwide. But even if one assumes that inflation
rises to the top of the government's 1-4 per cent target range, that still
means gilts would offer a real yield of around 4.5 per cent, compared with
negative returns for much of the 1970s.
Furthermore, after the Budget, UK government finances appear in good order.
Mr Clarke forecasts the public sector will be in surplus by 1998-99. By
1996, it will meet two of the main Maastricht criteria for joining European
monetary union; its deficit will be 3 per cent, and gross debt will be below
60 per cent, of gross domestic product.
In contrast, the likes of Belgium, Italy, Spain and Denmark seem in danger
of failing to meet one of the criteria. That may make UK gilts look more
attractive to international investors.
In the longer term, UK investment institutions may also be more willing to
buy gilts than in the recent past, so supporting prices. For a start,
pension funds are likely to increase their gilt holdings to meet the
solvency requirements suggested by the Goode Committee on pensions law
reform. But a low-inflation environment should in any case make the secure
returns offered by gilts a vital element of any institutional portfolio.
So does this make gilts a bargain? It all depends on your investment
horizon. According to Mr Simon Briscoe, bond analyst at S G Warburg: 'If
you're going to buy gilts and put them away in your top drawer, there hasn't
been a better time for a generation.' Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at
James Capel, agrees. 'If you are willing to hold gilts until redemption,
they are exceptionally good value,' he says.
But in the short term, the outlook does not look as good. Mr Skeoch says it
is 'very unusual for a bond market to rally without seeing the top in
short-term interest rates'. It is normally difficult for gilt prices to rise
when interest rates are increasing sharply.
Whether or not UK rates are increased after this week's meeting between Mr
Clarke and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, most people
believe they will go up early in the New Year. The Confederation of British
Industry expects base rates, currently 5.75 per cent, to reach 7.5 per cent
by 1996.
'UK markets are uncertain about chances of an imminent base rate rise,' says
Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets.
The world economic situation is not of a type normally conducive to a strong
performance by bonds. 'It is difficult for bonds to rally at a time when
economic growth is strong and cyclical inflation is rising,' says Mr Skeoch.
He emphasises that it is important to disentangle the long-term shift to a
low-inflation environment from the cyclical position of a UK economy growing
at 4 per cent a year against a background of rising commodity prices.
Furthermore, Ms Katy Peters, senior economist at Daiwa Europe, points out
that a 'lot of money went into gilts expecting a good Budget', and such a
buying spree is usually followed by a reaction. Markets are also likely to
be jittery until it becomes clear how much Mr Clarke will give away in
pre-election tax cuts.
So while gilts may look a good long-term bet, there is no rush to buy.
Income-seeking private investors could be tempted to wait until April when,
following a Budget change to personal equity plan rules, it will be possible
to own tax-free corporate bonds and preference shares instead.
Still, gilt investors should count themselves lucky. The patience needed by
the buyer of government securities is as nothing compared with that required
of the England football supporter. Roll on the World Cup of 2026.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Docklands was Heseltine's, not
Thatcher's, vehicle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr OSMAN STREATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Peter Marsh has walked London Docklands and interviewed residents
('Tales from London's rebuilt river bank', November 26/27). However, if he
thinks that the London Docklands Development Corporation 'was established as
a Thatcherite vehicle', he still has some way to go. Mrs Thatcher was not
remotely interested in inner city regeneration.
It was Michael Heseltine in Docklands, just as it was in Liverpool; and he
deserves a place in history for it, because the alternative, probably much
dearer to the Iron Lady's heart, was to leave the place to rot.
The resident he quotes as gesturing towards Canary Wharf and commenting:
'It's all shit. I wish the IRA would blow it up,' can perhaps be left to
stew in his own can of beer, which Mr Marsh describes him as putting down to
give us the benefit of his views. But the others who complain that they
haven't received any advantage from the new jobs in Docklands deserve more
thought.
There is an impression in the article that it is the job of government to
persist with what cannot continue: that if docks close, then further
unskilled work should be conjured up, without people being required to learn
new skills, or indeed any skill at all for the first time. This is simply
not true. Unskilled work has dried up all over the west, and that includes
London Docklands.
The 1960s local authority architecture which Mr Marsh castigates is, indeed,
horrible. Unfortunately, it was a characteristic of Labour councils at that
time to employ architects who liked nothing better than to put up concrete
tower blocks, while taking good care to live in pretty Georgian houses
themselves. It is a matter of note that the LDDC, from its inception in
1981, has taken care to foster a more human scale of architecture.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: The real purpose of competition
policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON BISHOP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial on Sir Bryan Carsberg's decision to step down as
director general of the Office of Fair Trading ('Trading places', November
30) appears to perpetuate the myth that the purpose of competition policy is
the protection of the consumer.
Competition policy in the UK, and elsewhere, is based on the notion of
public interest - that is, the long-term interests of society as a whole and
not the short-term interests of consumers.
It was this confusion over the aims of competition policy which brought Sir
Bryan and the OFT into conflict with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The most vivid manifestation of this conflict arises over the different
approaches taken by the OFT and MMC to so-called vertical restraints. The
OFT under Sir Bryan views any vertical restraint with suspicion.
Put crudely, it believes that all vertical arrangements are put in place
simply to enable companies to increase prices to the overall detriment of
the consumer.
In contrast, the MMC has a much more agnostic view. It recognises correctly
that in many cases vertical arrangements are pro-competitive and benefit the
consumer.
Moreover, it is important to remember that the OFT's assessment of the
competitive effects of vertical arrangements is necessarily limited - its
role is one of separating those cases which clearly do not raise any
concerns from those which might.
Any decisions it takes, therefore, should be seen as no more than
preliminary. In contrast, the role of the MMC is to undertake a much more
thorough investigation of those cases referred to it by the OFT. The fact
that a lengthy and in-depth investigation often reveals no public interest
issues should not be cause for censure.
Competition policy requires individuals who are capable of dispassionate and
objective economic analysis and who recognise the complexities of business.
As you say, finding a suitable new director general will not be easy.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PIERRE KERNEIS

<TEXT>
Sir, Having read what Patrick Nicholls, a Tory MP and former vice-president
of the Conservative party, thinks of France and the French, it is, I must
say, more and more difficult for a Frenchman to be an anglophile ('Outspoken
Tory resigns party post', November 25).
After all, perhaps the Europeans from the continent should leave Britain in
her splendide isolement.
Just as Talleyrand once said, 'what is excessive is without meaning'. Let us
hope that this view is shared by a majority in Britain.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Man in the News: The thorn in the flesh - Dzhokhar Dudayev
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHECHNYA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Of the many upstart local leaders who have poked the rump of the Russian
bear with a sharp stick, General Dzhokhar Dudayev is the boldest and the
most assertive.
Alone of the presidents of the Russian Federation's republics and regions,
he has declared the full independence of his state. Others such as Mr
Mintimer Shamieiyev of Tatarstan bargained for less.
Alone, he tried to acquire the symbols and currency of statehood - the
Utsyev brothers murdered in London last year were on an official Chechen
mission to acquire passports, money and stamps.
And now, alone, he faces Russia aroused. President Boris Yeltsin's troops
and armour have massed at the Chechen border during the last three days to
enforce a state of emergency in the republic - effectively an occupation.
The implementation of that state of emergency was delayed yesterday, but its
cancellation depends on a surrender that Gen Dudayev will not - cannot -
give.
Gen Dudayev was born 50 years ago when his people were being deported en
masse from Chechnya in the northern Caucasus to central Asia for alleged
collaboration with the Nazis. He spent his first 13 years in Kazakhstan, but
overcame the stigma carried by Chechens to become an air force officer,
rising to the rank of general.
His first public sign of deviance was allowing an Estonian flag to be raised
at a base he commanded in 1989. In 1990, back in Chechnya, he took part in
the republic's national congress and so impressed its members that he was
elected leader.
The failed August coup of 1991 gave Gen Dudayev his opportunity to break
away from Russia. He supported Mr Yeltsin in the battle against the
hardliners, declared independence and won an election with 85 per cent of
the vote.
Alarmed at the precedent, Mr Yeltsin sent troops to the Chechen capital of
Grozny to restore order. Within days, he was forced to withdraw them when
the Russian parliament refused to ratify his action.
In the three years since, half-hearted efforts to negotiate with Gen Dudayev
have yielded nothing. Earlier this year, Russia turned to covert support of
the motley armed opposition - one of whose leaders is, ironically, Mr Ruslan
Khasbulatov, Mr Yeltsin's former foe as speaker of the Russian parliament.
That opposition launched an abortive attack on Grozny, capital of Chechnya,
a week ago. Its rebuff by Chechen government forces was followed by a
Yeltsin ultimatum to Gen Dudayev to surrender or face imposition of the
state of emergency. An invasion force of paratroopers and other elite forces
gathered on the western border of Chechnya, more than adequate to brush
aside the lightly armed Chechen volunteers.
The insurrection in Chechnya has been much more serious for Mr Yeltsin than
the other small wars in the Caucasian cauldron that boiled up after the
collapse of the Soviet Union - not least because it is part of Russia.
Pressed by Russian nationalists, President Yeltsin cannot afford to give
away territory. Two weeks ago, at Pskov on the Estonian border - an area
claimed by Estonia - he swore 'not one centimetre' would be given up, no
matter who asked.
In Grozny yesterday, Mr Anatoly Shabad, a liberal Russian deputy from a
group of four who courageously volunteered to negotiate for the release of
more than 20 Russian prisoners, said: 'Our national patriots are urging the
president on, telling him to act decisively. This influences him a lot now.'
Over the border at the Russian Moszdok base where the troops are gathering,
Lt Col Vladimir Mozhaev says: 'Yeltsin should have done this two years ago.'
Chechnya remains a symbol of the uneasy imperial past of Russia, one not
exorcised by the collapse of the Soviet Union. Mr Iussif Shamsuddin, the
Chechen foreign minister - a dictionary of diplomacy on his desk, the Koran
on a table before him, and an AK-47 on the window sill beside him - says:
'We were almost destroyed as a nation by Stalin, we have been fighting for
freedom from Russia for 300 years.'
Prof Rosetta Yasenbayeva, a vice-secretary of state, says: 'We appeal to the
world society to recognise our country. Because the Soviet Union has gone,
slavery is hidden but slavery is still the same when hidden.'
The tiny nation threatens revenge against the attackers. 'If they come, look
out for what we will do in Russia, to the nuclear power stations,' says Mr
Shamsuddin.
Chechen blood feuds are a living tradition; the director of Grozny airport
(ruined by Russian bombs) Mr Ramzan Aliev promised that the pilots of the
Russian bombers would be found and killed. Terrorism is threatened and the
threat is real.
No other Russified people has been as resentful of Russian, then Soviet,
rule as the Chechens. But the Caucasian peoples, impoverished and mostly
Moslems, have some sympathy for Gen Dudayev.
Suppressing the insurrection in Chechnya forces Russia to prepare for war
within its borders. The Chechens are unpopular in Russia - being seen as
Mafiosi, a reputation some of them would seem to deserve. But this is much
more than rubbing out a Mafia clan. It requires the mobilisation of the
force of the Russian state.
Liberal deputies like Mr Shabad are worried; they say they will raise the
issue of Russian support for the opposition in the parliament. The National
Patriots and middle-ranking army officers like Col Mozhev now want their
say, and Chechnya is where they want it said.
This can only strengthen the nationalist mood in Russia, especially if the
Chechens carry out their threats of terrorism. Faced with an irreconcilable
foe, pushed by an impatient military and their supporters, unpopular,
lacking economic success, increasingly distant from one-time democratic
allies, Mr Yeltsin has a temptation before him  - to go in and sort it out.
Gen Dudayev is no longer a hero - the past three years have been too hard,
his power too corrupted for that. But the nation appears united against
Russia. Russia may take it, but is unlikely to hold it in peace.

FT  03 DEC 94 / 1,000 days of uncertainty: It is China that will call the
shots on the handover of Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Philip Tose, the maverick Hong Kong financier, once offered Britain's
Tory party Pounds 5m to remove Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor. Now,
he says, it is too late to make any difference.
With the battle over electoral reform ended, and less than 1,000 days to go
before the handover on June 30 1997, the die is cast. Hong Kong has embarked
on the final leg of its journey back to Chinese rule. And most people in the
colony believe there is little Britain can do by way of new initiatives.
As the sense of change becomes palpable - with China's Citic taking the
British trading company Jardine Matheson's seat on the board of the powerful
Jockey Club, and Mandarin beginning to displace Cantonese on the government
radio - it is now up to China to decide how smooth the handover will be, and
the shape of life beyond.
Optimists suggest that Chinese officials are beginning to realise that they
need British co-operation. 'Mr Patten is the governor and the representative
of the Hong Kong British government,' says one senior Chinese official in
Hong Kong. 'We have to deal with him. On many points we don't agree with him
but he is the governor.'
Some concrete evidence of this new realism is the agreement Beijing reached
last month with Britain on the funding for Hong Kong's HKDollars 160bn
(Pounds 13bn) airport development. This has freed funds for building a
railway connecting the airport to urban Hong Kong.
Encouragement is also taken from reports that Mr Qian Qichen, China's
foreign minister, is considering a visit to Britain next year. And Chinese
officials in Hong Kong indicate a desire to deal with the nitty-gritty of
the transfer at a meeting of the Joint Liaison Group, a bilateral body with
Britain, this month.
But Hong Kong's passage from British colony to a 'special administrative
region' of China still seems likely to be dogged by controversy.
'While we are totally sincere in wanting to be co-operative and
constructive, the nature of an enterprise as complicated as this makes it
very difficult to see circumstances in which there are not going to be any
more arguments,' says Mr Patten. 'What I hope is that we will make progress
in other areas which could avoid arguments becoming too poisonous and
seeping into everything.'
The chief obstacle to a smooth transition is the possibility of an exodus of
the senior civil servants, who have managed the colony with a light and
sophisticated touch. 'The biggest problem that Hong Kong faces is the
stability and continuity of the civil service,' says Mr Allen Lee, the
leader of the pro-business Liberal party.
Mr Lee says that, 'in general, Hong Kong people are still fearful of the
Communist party'. This is especially so among senior civil servants who will
have most day-to-day contact with representatives of the new sovereign power
after 1997. Many have come into close contact with mainland officials and
been subjected to humiliating treatment.
The importance of morale among the colony's 180,000 civil servants is
acknowledged by Chinese officials. Some, with a hint of desperation in their
voices, note that only the top 20 to 30 jobs will require vetting by
Beijing. 'The ones below . . . we hope these civil servants will stay,' says
one official. 'We need them; they have made a great contribution to Hong
Kong.'
It is hard to see how Beijing's desire to maintain a tight grip on the
levers of power can be meshed with the traditional independence and
professionalism of Hong Kong's civil service.
The transfer of sovereignty is full of seemingly innocuous details that turn
out to be traps for the unwary. Take school text books, which have recently
emerged as an issue because some pro-Beijing figures in Hong Kong do not
believe that the current texts used in schools are sufficiently 'patriotic'.
'We are not suggesting any change to the curriculum,' says Mr Tsang Yok
Sing, a leading Beijing adviser in Hong Kong who is himself a school
headmaster. 'We sent a selection of textbooks to Beijing and they were
shocked . . . by references to Taiwan as the Republic of China, the People's
Republic as a neighbour, and the glossing over of Britain's role in the
Opium War.'
Text books for the 1997/98 school year have to be ordered by the end of
1996. Already some publishers have said they may withdraw from the textbook
market. Given the high status accorded to education in Chinese society this
is a potentially explosive issue for Beijing if not handled sensitively.
Equally it is unclear quite what Britain can do to ease the situation.
But it is the absence of what is known as the through train that may prove
the most debilitating factor of all. The through train encapsulated the hope
that those elected in 1995 to the Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's
60-member law making body, would be able to serve their full four-year term,
regardless of the 1997 handover.
After the dispute on electoral reform, Beijing announced that it would
dismiss the 1995 LegCo once China resumed sovereignty of Hong Kong, and
replace it with a provisional legislature.
This decision is set to take Hong Kong into uncharted waters, and casts
doubt over the continuity of the colony's legal system.
The colonial government had planned to hand over by introducing a piece of
midnight legislation to eliminate all references in Hong Kong law to
institutions such as the governor and the Queen. But China says an
illegitimate 1995 LegCo cannot pass laws binding a future government.
However, the Basic Law - the China-drafted mini-constitution for post-1997
Hong Kong - does not provide for a provisional legislature as such, although
it does foresee a 'preparatory committee' to be formed in 1996 that will
determine who sits in this legislature.
Mr Tsang, a member of the Chinese government committee planning for the
handover, says the provisional legislature will have full powers to make
laws for an expected term of nine to 12 months.
'It's an extremely dangerous thing to have because they (Beijing) can clean,
with one sweep, any laws they don't like,' says Ms Anna Wu, an appointed
member of LegCo and a lawyer specialising in intellectual property law.
It seems likely that the committee to which Mr Tsang belongs, the
preliminary working committee, will become the 1996 preparatory committee.
That body may well elect from among itself the 60 members of the provisional
legislature.
Next year's elections will still matter, however. A strong showing by Hong
Kong's pro-democracy groups, led by Mr Martin Lee's Democratic party, will
be seen as a protest vote against Beijing. But a good showing by Beijing's
own supporters will create another problem: China would then have to decide
whether to accept an elected council favourable to its point of view.
Some take this prospect seriously. Mr Tsang says of the final
recommendations of the provisional legislature: 'I think it most likely that
any substantial conclusion will be deferred until after next year's
elections to see how things are.'
For Mr Patten, the cost of confronting China over the 1995 elections has
been high.
Even his supporters see him as a spent force. 'I think the governor has
become very stuck,' says Ms Wu, a Patten appointee. 'I can't see him
challenging the Chinese again over any other major issue. He will go for a
conciliatory, appeasement path,' she says, in the run up to the handover.
His critics go much further, suggesting that there is little chance of any
meaningful dialogue while Mr Patten occupies government house. 'At least one
senior Chinese official has said to me he believes there is no change of
restoring co-operation and trust unless and until we have a new governor,'
says Mr Tsang.
Mr Patten is adamant that he is not leaving Hong Kong until he has
discharged his duty. But it remains in China's gift to make Mr Patten a
player in the discussions on the transfer.
China's supporters in the colony claim that Mr Patten's policy is now to
make Hong Kong harder to govern by 'loosening the screws' before the British
leave. This is a reference to the repeal of some of the colony's more
repressive pieces of legislation, such as the power to censor films. Britain
used such ordinances to control Hong Kong but does not want to leave them on
the statute books for the incoming regime.
There is similar wariness among Chinese officials about the possibility that
Britain may lay down financial obligations which only have to be met after
1997.
Mr Zhou Nan, the most senior representative of the Chinese Communist party
and government in Hong Kong, recently attacked Mr Patten's plans for a
government-funded pension, saying: 'During the transition period, we should
not casually transplant a costly Euro-socialist pay-as-you-go concept to
Hong Kong without prudently taking into consideration similar western
programmes' long-standing track record of grossly under-estimating
liabilities and grossly over-estimating funding projections.'
Mr Patten claims that by 1997 public spending in Hong Kong as a percentage
of GDP will be lower than it was in 1982 - the year Britain began handover
negotiations with China. 'I don't think Hong Kong needs lectures on how to
run an economy or how to control public spending,' he says.
But this kind of debate is being increasingly overshadowed by the
realisation that the transition will be far from smooth.
One Chinese banker says: 'Hong Kong will become less free; more like
Singapore. There will be less freedom, but that's to be expected. The law
will become less important and personal contacts more important. There will
also be more corruption. These won't be immediate changes but will happen
over time. We will just have to get used to it.' In Mrs Wu's view: 'There is
no absolute guarantee for Hong Kong that the 1984 Sino-British joint
declaration will be met. The real issue is: how easy will it be (for China)
to break? 'One country two systems' is a political idea, not one that is
built on firm juridical foundations.'

FT  03 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Room for manoeuvre
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What Mr Kenneth Clarke delivered on Tuesday has been widely described as the
budget in between: between two that will raise more than Pounds 16bn in
extra taxes and two that will give most of that money back; between a huge
rise in indirect taxes and a subsequent lowering of direct taxes; between a
post-election period of sensible policy from a chastened government and a
pre-election period of idiotic policy from a desperate one.
Naturally, bluff Mr Clarke denies that he has any such devious intentions.
His first priority, he asserted, was 'to keep the economy on track to
achieve the great prize of sustainable growth. This recovery offers the best
prospect that the British people have faced for many years to enjoy the
benefits of growth that does not pass through illusory boom to painful
bust.' But he would say this, whatever his intentions. Delivering
sustainable growth will demand both determination and skill. Will the
fevered state of British politics allow him to demonstrate either?
What Mr Clarke - and Mr Lamont, before him - sought to achieve in the two
budgets of 1993 was room for manoeuvre. They found themselves in a fiscal
hole and proceeded to dig themselves out of it. With the public sector
borrowing requirement (PSBR) heading towards Pounds 50bn, the case for
fiscal stringency seemed overwhelming. At the beginning of a parliament, it
also looked well-timed.
Now the choices have become far more difficult. Making them wisely is also
being made less easy by the terms of the current debate. Most commentators
assume that the questions are only when, and by how much, to tighten
monetary policy and when, and by how much, to loosen fiscal policy.
Fiscal policy
This is absurd. First, the best policy option is not to loosen fiscal
policy, but rather to allow interest rates (and so the exchange rate) to be
lower than they would otherwise be. Second, following tax increases of as
much as 2 per cent of gross domestic product with lower taxes a year or two
later is senseless. But it would be worse than senseless if increases were
imposed when the economy is recovering and the reductions when it is close
to full capacity.
Yet fiscal relaxation seems highly likely. The PSBR is now forecast to
decline from 5 per cent of GDP this year to  3/4 of a per cent, by 1997-98.
Moreover, revenue may rise even more quickly than the Treasury forecasts.
Should inflation be higher than the low levels now forecast and the
cash-limited figures for public spending be retained, the fiscal position
would improve more quickly still.
In any case, the chancellor should enjoy room for fiscal manoeuvre. Part of
it might be exploited by raising public spending. Because inflation was much
lower this year than had been forecast a year ago, the expected squeeze
never happened: real general government spending is forecast to rise by 2.3
per cent in 1994-95, against the decline of 0.1 per cent forecast a year
ago. It is not surprising that managing the public sector has been easy.
Now, however, the plans are for a rise of only 2 per cent in the real level
of general government spending between 1994-95 and 1997-98.
Relaxation
It is not difficult to imagine a relaxation of this squeeze. Even so the
prospective PSBR should also allow large tax reductions. If the chancellor
were to eliminate the 25p basic rate in favour of the 20p rate, it would
cost the exchequer around Pounds 8.5bn. If this were done in 1996-97, the
PSBR would rise to just over Pounds 20bn, which would be less than 3 per
cent of GDP.
The political calculation would be whether the popularity of a lower basic
rate of tax would offset the unpopularity of higher interest rates. It may
well do so, because many voters - particularly elderly ones - would enjoy
the prospect of higher interest rates on their deposits. Meanwhile, in the
absence of much new borrowing, the cost of higher interest rates would fall
predominantly on the group of people who bought houses in the second half of
the 1980s. For a desperate government this would appear to be a promising
calculus.
From the economic point of view, however, such a switch would be far less
attractive. The Treasury's Red Book notes that net trade accounts for about
half the growth in 1994 this far. For once, the UK economy is enjoying
export-led growth. Any significant fiscal loosening, particularly if it were
offset by monetary tightening, could throw this gain away. Worse still would
be a failure to tighten monetary policy enough. In that case, everything
could be thrown away in yet another consumer-led boom.
The government has achieved the luxury - and the danger - of choice. The
economically wise thing to do would be to leave fiscal policy as it is. The
politically attractive choice would be to bribe the voters and let the
economy rip. To govern is to choose. The government will show what it is
made of by how it does so.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Sinn Fein shows it can win friends and influence people:
This week's events demonstrate that members of the IRA's political wing are
moving in powerful circles behind the scenes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There have been plenty of occasions in the past year when the extent of Mr
James Molyneaux's influence over the pace and shape of the Northern Ireland
peace process and efforts to forge a durable political settlement in Ulster
have been underlined.
Perhaps the best illustration was the setting up earlier this year of a
Northern Ireland select committee. This was a move the Ulster Unionist
leader and his party colleagues had long pushed for.
This week it was Sinn Fein's turn to demonstrate the power of its influence,
as the British government appeared to bow to US pressure over whether
members of the IRA's political wing would be invited to an important Belfast
investment forum.
Thursday's acknowledgement that a handful of Sinn Fein councillors would be
invited followed threats by several US institutions and corporations to
boycott the conference unless Sinn Fein was included.
This pressure was augmented by Congressional supporters of the Irish
republican cause who urged the US administration not to allow Mr Ron Brown,
US commerce secretary, to attend unless London modified its initial stance
that Sinn Fein would not be invited.
As one knowledgeable observer of the peace process observed in the wake of
the climbdown, Sinn Fein is more than just a party representing a small
minority of the electorate in Northern Ireland.
The decision is thought to have had an important bearing on the setting of
an earlier-than-expected date for the start of talks between Sinn Fein and
government officials, in effect entailing that they had to start before the
conference on December 13 and 14. The government said on Thursday it would
start talks on December 7. However the talks were put back 48 hours last
night at the request of Sinn Fein.
There has been a widespread impression that the handling of the invitations
was botched by the government, with the effect that efforts to drum up
much-needed investment at the conference risk being overshadowed by
politics.
Sinn Fein councillors on the two local council committees whose members are
being sent invitations include Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, the organisation's
northern chairman and a leading political strategist.
If Mr McLaughlin does attend, the economic news emerging from the forum
would have to be important indeed to distract attention from his presence at
a conference to be launched by Mr John Major, the prime minister.
The two committees whose members are now to be invited to the conference are
the development committee of Belfast City Council and the city marketing
committee of Londonderry City Council. According to the Northern Ireland
Office, a total of six Sinn Fein councillors are on the two bodies.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Lloyd's expects rise in business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London expects to underwrite insurance policies paying premiums
worth about Pounds 9.2bn next year - about Pounds 800m higher than in 1994,
according to a survey released yesterday.
The rise will be largely the result of underwriters making greater use of
funds available. Total underwriting capacity of Lloyd's insurance market -
which depends on the volume of money invested by Names and companies - may
even fall slightly.
The percentage of available gross capacity used for underwriting is expected
to rise to 84 per cent next year from 78 per cent this year, suggests the
poll of Lloyd's agencies responsible for managing the market's insurance
syndicates.
The Pounds 9.2bn figure for 1995's premiums excludes the impact of a planned
change in Lloyd's procedures for allocating risks to particular years which
takes effect from January.
The upturn in business at Lloyd's follows two relatively good years: both
1993 and 1994 are expected to produce profits when results are released
under Lloyd's three-year accounting system.
The legacy of losses in the late 1980s and early 1990s is expected to lead
to a further outflow of Lloyd's Names, individuals whose assets have
traditionally supported the insurance market.
But investment from new corporate companies for the 1995 underwriting year
has been higher than expected. Latest figures suggest Lloyd's capacity next
year will be between Pounds 9.9bn and Pounds 10.9bn.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
London Underground will revert to a more conventional tunnelling method at
London Bridge on the Jubilee line extension rather than wait for the results
of its investigation into the New Austrian Tunnelling Method.
London Underground said its inquiry into the acceptability of the Austrian
method would continue but sufficient tunnel segments were available from
stock for traditional tunnelling work to restart at London Bridge. The
decision to go ahead with the more conventional method means that further
delays to construction work will be avoided.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Ex-Brent Walker man must pay fine
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Wilfred Aquilina, the former finance director at Brent Walker, was
yesterday told he must pay a Pounds 25,000 fine for false accounting, even
though he pleaded poverty.
The judge, Mr Geoffrey Rivlin, refused to accept that Mr Aquilina was
insolvent.
He told him at Southwark Crown Court: 'To suggest that you can't afford to
pay is an affront to common sense and to the many people who are in a far
worse position than you to pay a fine.'
The fine was imposed three weeks ago in addition to a suspended sentence,
but an adjournment was granted for a special investigation into Mr
Aquilina's financial circumstances. Yesterday the judge extended from six
months to a year the period in which Mr Aquilina had to pay.

FT  03 DEC 94 / TUC denounces jobseeker's bill
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions and voluntary organisations have promised to campaign hard against
the government's new Jobseeker's Allowance, which the Trade Union Congress
described as a 'nasty and vindictive measure'.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, denounced the bill to implement the
allowance, which was published yesterday. He said it was 'based on the
wholly false view that the unemployed are work-shy shirkers that need to be
forced back to work by the heavy hand of state control'.
The new six-month allowance will replace unemployment benefit and income
support in April 1996.
Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, estimates the scheme will
mean a Pounds 100m net cut in government spending on unemployment in
1996-97, the first year, and would then save Pounds 200m every following
year.
The government described the allowance as 'a major step forward in the
reform of the benefit system but Mr Monks described it as 'a cruel parody of
redistribution'.

Police said yesterday that they believed they had foiled a massive
international fraud straddling UK and foreign banks which could have
involved more than Pounds 30m.
The Barclays Bank official worked as a business-centre manager in Derby,
where the bank has one of its largest regional branches. Four other people
arrested in London and Kent did not work for Barclays but were described by
police as having 'extensive banking expertise'.
Barclays said last night that the bank had worked closely with the police
investigation and was 'delighted' with the apparent success of the
anti-fraud operation.
The bank stressed that the fraud had been prevented and that therefore no
customers had been affected.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Ministers consider change to employers' liability law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is urgently considering a possible law change following
problems created by new terms that insurance companies plan to impose on
compulsory policies covering workplace deaths and injuries.
Ministers are expected to decide soon whether to change the 1969 Employers'
Liability Act which requires employers to have at least Pounds 2m of cover.
The move follows a private meeting this week between Department of
Employment officials and insurance industry representatives to discuss the
insurers' decision to introduce a basic Pounds 10m claims limit on
employers' liability policies renewed from January.
The announcement threatens to leave many large corporate groups without the
legally required level of insurance because the law at present stipulates
that the cover of each subsidiary company, or 'employer', must be Pounds 2m.
A change in the 1969 act could be implemented swiftly, possibly in time for
the January deadline, because the levels of cover required are set by
'statutory instruments' - regulations that can be changed relatively easily,
without long parliamentary procedures.
One proposal being mooted in Whitehall would allow corporate groups to be
treated as a single employer - though that would mean commercial giants
being treated in the same way as small companies. An alternative would be to
introduce a sliding scale for the amount of cover required.
Meanwhile, health and safety inspectors have been asked to consult Whitehall
before taking action against companies with inadequate cover.

FT  03 DEC 94 / PM orders end to Euro infighting: Tories told they may lose
election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major issued a stark warning yesterday that the Conservatives would
be defeated at the next general election unless the party stops its
infighting over Europe.
At the end of a week which saw the withdrawal of the whip from eight Tory
MPs - with a ninth resigning - Mr Major urged colleagues to 'put the
divisions behind us and work for the kind of Europe in which we believe'.
In an apparent sideswipe at divisions among ministers as well as on the back
benches, he said that Tory supporters expected unity from the parliamentary
party and the government.
But a row over the funding of the European Union's efforts to combat fraud
provided an awkward backdrop to the return to the Commons next week of the
legislation which provoked this week's revolt by Eurosceptics.
Mr Major told the annual conference of Conservative Women: 'It is perfectly
possible for us to win both the domestic and the European arguments - but
only if we work together as a party at all levels.'
In a tacit admission of the unspoken fears of many in the cabinet that the
party is close to fracturing permanently over Europe, Mr Major said economic
recovery alone would not guarantee an election victory. He added: 'It is the
Conservative party fighting the same fight, at the same time against the
same people - then we will win.'
The row over EU fraud was sparked when ministers acknowledged that Britain
had acquiesced in the cutting of the EU's Pounds 100m anti-fraud budget.
Mr Major has pledged initiatives to reduce fraud at next week's EU summit in
Essen, Germany, and he has used the government's tough line on spending
abuses to persuade rightwingers to back increases in the overall EU budget.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Treasury chief secretary, said the Pounds 4m
reduction was not thought to be 'of the greatest importance' and only
affected administration.
But Mrs Teresa Gorman, one of the eight rebels who were stripped of the
party whip after abstaining in votes on the EU finance bill, said it was
'astonishing' that the fraud budget was being cut.
Some of the rebels are considering not supporting the government when the
bill increasing Britain's contributions to the EU budget returns to the
Commons on Wednesday and Thursday.
Both Labour and Mr Bill Cash, a Tory Eurosceptic who supported the
government in Monday's votes, have tabled clauses for discussion next week
attempting to tie enactment of the bill to more effective anti-fraud
measures.
Labour also plans to push for a vote on whether MPs should be allowed to
debate a wider range of issues than just the principle of the bill. The
party believes this would open the door to the tabling of more substantive
amendments.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Student numbers to be capped for four years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Student numbers in UK universities will be held at their present level for
four years, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, told
vice-chancellors yesterday.
The decision, taken as part of the Budget, extends the planned period of
consolidation from the previously announced three years, and means the
proportion of 18-year-olds admitted by universities will not start to rise
again until 1998. Mrs Shephard said the total number of new students would
drop slightly next year, thanks to a fall in the number of 18-year-olds.
The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, which represents UK
universities, said it was 'very disappointed' by the decision which would
make it 'more difficult to achieve the government's targets by the end of
the century'. Lecturers responded angrily. The Association of University
Teachers said: 'This makes a nonsense of putting more resources into higher
education and increasing expectations.'
At present the government hopes 33 per cent of 18-year-olds will enter
higher education each year by the year 2000. The present figure is around 30
per cent.
Mrs Shephard said the government would encourage more part-time and mature
students. Ministers also want universities to use the period of
consolidation to ensure that their quality assurance systems are effective,
following claims of falling standards.
To achieve this, Mrs Shephard yesterday called for a reform of the system
for quality audit and assessment. At present, the Higher Education Quality
Council, a self-regulatory body, carries out audits to ensure standards are
uniform, while the Higher Education Funding Council, a government agency,
makes quality assessments to determine funding.
Mrs Shephard said: 'I recognise that the present separate assessment and
audit programmes are seen as heavy-handed.' She added that she sympathised
with those who wanted the two programmes brought together 'in the next year
or two'. She has asked the funding council to report on a new structure by
next spring, and said she hoped any system would be as transparent as
possible.
The vice-chancellors and principals committee said such a move would
'provide greater value for money, promote genuine quality enhancement and
reduce administrative burden', while the quality council agreed the two
processes should be brought together.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Labour postpones devolution answers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The way Scotland would be represented at Westminster after a Labour
government had set up a Scottish parliament can be decided only after Labour
has implemented all the changes it plans for the UK's regions.
Mr George Robertson, the shadow Scottish secretary, said yesterday that the
party was embarking on a dynamic process of constitutional change. There
would not be a 'pat answer' to every question concerning future regional
representation at Westminster. New anomalies would be created, he said.
Mr Robertson reiterated Labour's commitment to establish a Scottish
parliament and a Welsh assembly in its first year in office. It would then
set up regional assemblies in different parts of England.
Labour has been criticised by the Conservatives for failing to give detailed
answers to the questions of how Scotland and Wales will be represented at
Westminster after their assemblies are established.
In particular it has been challenged to answer the so-called West Lothian
question: why should Scottish MPs at Westminster be able to legislate for
matters such as education in England while English MPs will not be able to
legislate for education in Scotland?
Mr Robertson told the Scottish constitutional convention, an unofficial body
boycotted by the Tories and the Scottish National party, that there would be
'no precise point where everything must instantly adapt to accommodate just
some of the new institutions'.
Rather than get lost in 'the forest of detail and constitutional porridge',
it was more important to tell people what the Scottish parliament 'can do
and will do to change their lives'. It should outline options for issues
such as housing, community care, education, transport and the health
service.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Major attacks separate assemblies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's plans for a raft of constitutional changes including devolution for
Scotland and Wales were yesterday fiercely attacked by Mr John Major, the
prime minister.
In a speech indicating his determination to put the Tories' defence of the
constitutional status quo at the centre of the next election campaign, Mr
Major said Labour's commitment to separate assemblies for Scotland and Wales
would spell 'the beginning of the end for Britain'.
His comments were echoed last night by Mr Michael Portillo, the rightwing
employment minister. Underlining the potential for defence of the union to
provide a unifying theme across the party, Mr Portillo said the
Conservatives were 'first and foremost the party of the United Kingdom'.
He added that the people of Northern Ireland were guaranteed the decisive
voice in the province's future. The talks with Sinn Fein, the political wing
of the IRA, did not mean 'peace at any price'.
The prime minister, who also attacked opposition proposals for reform of the
House of Lords and a referendum on the voting system for Westminster, said a
legislative body in Scotland would be a 'recipe for constitutional chaos'.
It would breach 'natural justice' if Scottish MPs were able to vote in a
Scottish parliament on issues like health and education and then vote at
Westminster on policies affecting the same issues in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland. The result would be the break-up of the UK.
Speaking at the annual Conference of Conservative Women, Mr Major accused Mr
Tony Blair, the Labour leader, of considering changes to the
first-past-the-post system for electing MPs for narrow political advantage.
He told the conference: 'They (Labour) will twist and change the voting
system to build an almost permanent alliance between Labour and the Liberals
with one purpose and with one purpose above all - to try and keep the
Conservative party out.'
Mr Major added that Labour's attacks on the Lords were designed to attract
'a few cheap cheers'. He went on: 'The fact is that the House of Lords works
rather well. It is an important brake on over-mighty government, an
important part of our constitution - and it is a good deal more popular, by
and large, than the House of Commons.'
He said that Labour's proposals would make the Britain which has existed for
the past 300 years unrecognisable.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Motorola may buy Digital plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, TONY JACKSON and PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Digital Equipment, the loss-making US computer group, said yesterday that
Motorola, the US electronics group, had expressed interest in buying its
semiconductor plant in South Queensferry near Edinburgh.
Digital said: 'Our responsibility is to evaluate any proposal that the
company receives concerning its assets, and we are currently involved in
that process.'
In the UK, Motorola confirmed that the company was involved in talks with
Digital, and that the only plant mentioned in the discussions was the South
Queensferry site.
However Motorola said it would be 'inappropriate' to say more about the
discussions at this stage.
The South Queensferry plant, which opened in 1990, makes Digital's
high-powered Alpha microprocessors for use in the group's personal computers
and workstations.
Digital, which recently completed a Pounds 65m expansion of its facilities
at South Queensferry, agreed earlier this year to manufacture
microprocessors at the plant for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), the US
company which is a rival to Intel, the leading US microprocessor
manufacturer.
At the time there were strong suggestions that Digital might be considering
selling the plant to AMD. However Mr Vincenzo Damiani, Digital's European
president, said then that it was unlikely the semi-conductor operations
would be sold. Motorola also produces semiconductors in its plant at East
Kilbride which are used as microcontrollers in cellular telephones, fax
machines, engine controllers and smart cards.
In September Motorola announced a Pounds 250m expansion of the East Kilbride
facility to cope with rising worldwide demand. The expansion will be the
third, and by far the biggest, that the company has made at East Kilbride in
the past three years. It manufactures cellular telephone equipment at
another plant in Scotland at Easter Inch near Bathgate.
In contrast, Digital announced its third restructuring in two years in July,
involving the loss of 20,000 jobs and increasing its net losses for the year
to Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.34bn).

FT  03 DEC 94 / Portillo set to challenge EU work directives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, plans to strongly oppose
draft European Union directives which he believes would add to employer
costs and create more unemployment.
The proposed directives, to be discussed at next Tuesday's EU social affairs
council meeting in Brussels, concern part-time and fixed-contract work and
the terms of employment for workers who are sent by companies to posts
outside their own country.
Last night it emerged that the German government, which holds the EU
presidency until the end of the year, has split the part-time and
fixed-contract directive into two separate measures. But this will be
opposed by France and the UK is unlikely to support the move either.
Mr Portillo believes equalising part-time employment rights with those of
full-time workers as the directives require would restrict job opportunities
and add to the burdens on employers.
He is convinced the proposed directive would lead to companies firing
part-time employees, who are often women, and replacing them with a smaller
number of full-time workers who are usually men.
Britain's employment secretary also intends to argue that the so called
'posted workers directive' would reduce the free movement of services and
workers within the EU. This directive would require companies carrying out
contracts in member states other than their own to pay employees at the same
rates as the host country.
The government believes this measure could stop companies with low costs
from competing in high-cost countries. Mr Portillo is convinced it is
anti-competitive and would make it harder for the unemployed to find work.
The employment secretary is also expected to make a legal challenge against
the posted workers directive if his colleagues try and push the measure
through Tuesday's meeting by a qualified majority of votes and not by
unanimity.
Mr Portillo intends to tell his EU ministerial colleagues that they should
concentrate not on social regulations but on tackling European structural
unemployment in line with EU social affairs commissioner Padraig Flynn's
white paper on the future of European social policy, also to be discussed on
Tuesday.
Strong support for the employment secretary came yesterday from Mr Howard
Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry who told a
conference of Unice - the European employers organisation - in Berlin that
next Tuesday's meeting would provide 'an important test of the EU's
willingness to grasp the implications of its social policies on Europe's
competitiveness problem'.
Mr Davies said that while 'some basic rights' such as health and safety and
equal opportunities should apply to posted workers, a directive that covered
terms and conditions of employment was 'anti-competitive and inconsistent
with the principles of a single market'. He added that the latest draft
part-time and fixed contract work directives were 'unacceptable' as they
stood.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Big economic research bodies see grants cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Institute of Economic and Social Research and the London
Business School were told yesterday of large cuts in their government grants
under a new package of funding for economic research.
Cash that would have been taken by two of the country's biggest economics
research establishments is being channelled to smaller groups as part of an
effort by the Economic and Social Research Council, a government funding
agency, to increase diversity and competition.
The two organisations' combined share in the next phase of the council's
funding programme will be about 42 per cent, down from 70 per cent
previously. In effect this means their grants are cut by about 23 per cent
and 29 per cent respectively.
However, overall funding under the council's economic modelling programme is
being increased by 23 per cent in real terms. Economic models consist of
software which simulates the economy. They help with forecasting and, for
example, understanding how currency changes affect exports.
In the latest four-year phase of the programme, starting next September,
Pounds 3.2m is being earmarked for a group of between eight and 12 academic
researchers. The cash is up from Pounds 2.6m spread among four groups for
the period 1991-95. Of the Pounds 3.2m, some 75 per cent is coming from the
council, 20 per cent from the Treasury and 5 per cent from the Bank of
England.
The boost to funding was welcomed by economists, who had feared large cuts
following exasperation about the lack of accuracy of economic forecasts. Mr
Richard Freeman, chief economist at Imperial Chemical Industries, who
chaired a council panel evaluating the modelling bids, said: 'The UK has a
world lead in economic modelling. This programme aims to build on it.'
However, the extra cash only partly compensates for a 57 per cent real-terms
cut in support in the modelling programme four years ago.
The National Institute and London Business School said they had expected the
cuts and could probably make up shortfalls by getting more cash from the
private sector.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Government 'set to reduce road building'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is expected shortly to announce a significant scaling down of
its road building programme and an end to the construction of motorways with
more than eight lanes, the British Road Federation said yesterday.
Plans to widen some motorways to up to 14 lanes by the construction of roads
running alongside the main carriageway are expected to be dropped, said the
federation, which represents business road users and private motorists.
This reversal would be the result of cuts in the Department of Transport's
roads budget announced by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in the Budget
on Tuesday. Roads spending was cut by Pounds 200m over each of the next two
years.
It would also reflect the growing environmental pressures which led to the
government scrapping nearly a third of the road building programme last
March.
Further cuts in the roads programme would help establish the 'green'
credentials of Mr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary.
The Department of Transport said last night it could not comment on the
federation's claims. It added: 'The secretary of state has asked for
information on a number of schemes but no decisions have been taken on any
changes.'
Road widening schemes which would be dropped if the department does limit
motorways to eight lanes would include three of the most controversial
proposals, the federation said. They are the south-west quadrant of the M25,
which has provoked fierce opposition from local Conservative MPs as well as
from environmental groups, the M4 west of London, and the M62 north-west of
Manchester.
The federation said: 'These schemes were not introduced in response to
pressure from business and industry. They have attracted huge opposition and
are likely to be dropped.'
Proposals to widen the M42 around Birmingham from six lanes to 10 also
appear likely to be cut to eight lanes. This emerged from new traffic
evidence submitted by the Department of Transport to a public inquiry under
way into the Birmingham Northern Relief Road.
Eight new motorway schemes which are at an advanced stage will probably
still go ahead, as will three proposals to widen dual carriageways to
motorway standard, the federation said.
The new motorway schemes are the M66 Denton to Middleton, the M65 Blackburn
southern by-pass, and the approach roads to the second Severn Bridge, all of
which are under construction. Two privately financed projects, the A1-M1
link in the north and the Birmingham Northern Relief Road, are also expected
to be continued, as are three roads now in the planning process: the
Birmingham Western Orbital, the Stockport by-pass and the A556(M).
The dual carriageway widening schemes which are expected to be continued are
the A1 between London and Newcastle upon Tyne, the A14 between Cambridge and
Peterborough and the A74 from the M6 to the Scottish border.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Housing upturn 'further delayed by Budget'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Budget has further delayed recovery in the housing market after prices
continued to drift downwards or remain flat last month, the country's two
biggest building societies said in surveys yesterday.
Nationwide, the second largest society, said prices on average had fallen
2.7 per cent last month compared with October - the second largest monthly
fall recorded by the society this year.
It said the fall was due partly to seasonal factors. A better guide was the
annual fall in prices of 0.6 per cent since November last year.
Halifax, the biggest mortgage lender, which unlike Nationwide seasonally
adjusts its figures, said prices had fallen just 0.1 per cent in November
but had declined 1 per cent over the previous 12 months.
The housing market traditionally starts to fall away in late autumn. The
decline, however, appears to have begun earlier than usual in the past two
years since the government moved the Budget to November with the market
showing nerves in the run-up to it.
Halifax and Nationwide said that this year's Budget had done little to lift
the housing market out of the doldrums. They were particularly concerned
about the potentially damaging impact on consumer confidence of the decision
to limit entitlement to income support for homeowners who become unemployed.
From next October new borrowers will be barred from claiming income support
to cover mortgage interest payments for the first nine months. Mortgage
benefits have also been scaled back for existing borrowers.
Mr Gary Marsh of Halifax said the mortgage benefit measures had 'dealt
another blow to a housing market already living in the shadow of higher
borrowing costs'.
Mr Clarke and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, are due to
meet next Wednesday for their latest discussion of base rates, now at 5.75
per cent, amid speculation that rates could rise another half point this
month or next to guard against rising inflation.
Both Halifax and Nationwide expect house prices on average to rise by little
more than the rate of inflation next year.
Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide's chief executive, said: 'House prices will show
little change in 1994 as a whole. Affordability is excellent but concerns
over unemployment continue to affect confidence and are holding back
recovery.
'We continue to expect activity levels to improve next year but recovery in
the housing market is dependent upon the strengthening of the wider economy.
Against a background of generally low inflation, accompanying rises in house
prices may be modest and heavily dependent on local conditions.'
Halifax said: 'Generally speaking house prices in the UK remain broadly flat
and any significant recovery is dependent upon improved consumer
confidence.'
According to the Halifax the average price of a UK home in November was
Pounds 62,169 compared with Pounds 52,814 at Nationwide.

Fears about profits, cash flow and the recovery seem to have helped keep
average annual pay settlements in engineering down to 2.6 per cent in the
past three months in Yorkshire and Humberside.
Profit margins have tightened and raw material prices have risen, the
Engineering Employers Federation said.

FT  03 DEC 94 / PIA set for clash on training agents
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Personal Investment Authority, the private invesment watchdog, is
heading for a clash with independent financial advisers over plans which
would add about 10 per cent to the cost of ensuring that advisers are
properly trained.
The proposals would mean that all new sales agents or advisers, together
with those who supervise them, would have to pass all three papers of the
financial planning certificate or the investment advice certificate unless
they advised on only a limited range of products.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Nadir's empire under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The empire of fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir came under renewed pressure
yesterday as Turkish Cypriot authorities won a court order against his bank,
Kibris Endustri Bankasi, for defaulting on Dollars 4.2m in deposits for a
pension fund, Jim Kelly writes.
Mr Ozkan Murat, labour and social security minister, said: 'We have taken
legal action to make sure this money is not lost. We are not sure if the
assets of the bank will be enough . . . but we have taken action to save the
money of the workers.'
Under the court order Mr Nadir, who fled Britain last year to avoid facing
charges of theft and false accounting over his collapsed Polly Peck empire,
will continue to operate the bank but will not be able to sell its assets.
The bank is not part of Polly Peck.
It was also reported in the newspaper Kibris, which Mr Nadir owns, that he
had suspended buying citrus fruits from growers on the island and will close
down his packaging and juice extraction plants.
Mr Nadir also appeared to be facing defeat in his battle over control of the
Jasmine Court and Palm Beach hotels in northern Cyprus.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand reported that the government of northern Cyprus was close
to agreeing to hand over the hotels to their lawful owners - Voyager Kibris
Ltd (VKL), part of Polly Peck International.
According to reports, representatives of VKL met government officials
earlier this week to find a way of paying tax and rental liabilities. The
government had threatened to terminate the hotels' leases unless outstanding
rent of Dollars 97,000 was paid by Monday.
Coopers reported that yesterday the office of the deputy prime minister of
northern Cyprus had granted VKL an extension to meet the outstanding rent
debt until December 19.
Mr Chris Barlow, lead administrator of Polly Peck International and a
partner in Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'We view this as another significant
step towards gaining access to Polly Peck assets in Northern Cyprus.'

FT  03 DEC 94 / Row over FM radio licence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
XFM, the commercial radio consortium which recently failed to win a
broadcasting licence in London, may seek a judicial review of the Radio
Authority's decision.
Mr Chris Parry, executive chairman of XFM, which hoped to cater for young
Londoners with a taste in 'alternative, independent rock', said he would
decide next week whether to seek leave for a judicial review.
In October the Radio Authority, the regulatory body for commercial radio,
awarded four new licences for London, including two for FM.
The authority caused surprise by awarding one of the two FM licences to Mr
Richard Branson's Virgin 1215 even though it was already available all over
the UK on AM. The second went to Crystal FM, which offers soft adult rock.
Mr Parry said he is mainly concerned at the voting mechanism by which Virgin
was chosen over XFM.
He believes that one of the Radio Authority members, Mrs Margaret Corrigan,
who was unable to attend the meeting, had made her support for XFM clear.
Mrs Corrigan declined to comment on her views.
Mr Peter Baldwin, chief executive of the Radio Authority, has confirmed that
there was a deadlock over one of the FM licences.
It is believed that in the absence of Mrs Corrigan, Lord Chalfont, the Radio
Authority chairman, voted first as a member to tie the vote at four for
Virgin and four for XFM. He then used his casting vote as chairman to give
Virgin victory.
The procedures only allow a vote to members who attend and the chairman has
the casting vote in the case of a tie.
Mr Parry yesterday said Lord Chalfont's decision to vote twice was
outrageous.
Virgin has been campaigning for an FM licence for some time because of the
poor quality of AM frequencies.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Welsh may get aid for cable growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, yesterday forecast an expansion of
cable television in Wales with the possibility of financial help to take the
service to rural areas.
Mr Redwood told a Welsh Development Agency media seminar in Cardiff that the
Independent Television Commission was preparing to advertise new franchises
for much of south Wales early next year.
After a long gap, the ITC has again been advertising franchises and recently
offered a single franchise covering, at least in theory, all of Northern
Ireland.
Mr Redwood said yesterday that franchises for north Wales would follow.
'If companies think they need government help in remote rural areas, they
should say so when submitting the possible extent of their interest,' Mr
Redwood said. Mr Redwood's remarks are surprising because the cost of laying
cable means that it is usually only viable in urban areas.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Guinness trial lawyer convicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A solicitor who acted for one of the defendants in the Guinness trials was
himself convicted of fraud yesterday.
Mr Simon Easton was found guilty at Southwark Crown Court of submitting
false invoices to claim legal fees for a client's divorce.
The invoices led to money being removed from the client's business and its
pension fund.
Mr Easton was a partner with law firm Calow Easton in 1989 when the fraud
took place. Among his clients was US lawyer Mr Thomas Ward, who was
prosecuted over his role as adviser to Guinness during its 1986 takeover of
Distillers. Mr Ward was acquitted last year of the theft of Pounds 5.2m from
the drinks company.
The solicitor acted for Mr Ward after the former Guinness adviser was
arrested and charged but stopped acting for him shortly before the trial
started.
The court heard that Mr Easton charged a total of Pounds 114,000 in legal
fees for handling the Derbyshire businessman's divorce proceedings.
However, he submitted three separate invoices - one to the client for Pounds
68,000, a second to the client's company for Pounds 26,000 and a third to
the company pension scheme for Pounds 17,000.
In his defence, Mr Easton claimed the splitting of the bill had been an
honest mistake.
Mr Easton was found guilty on 10-2 majority verdicts of three counts of
false accounting. He will be sentenced on December 22 and was released on
unconditional bail until then.
Mr Easton's solicitors said afterwards they would be considering an appeal.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Store blackmail pair sent to jail
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two businessmen who tried to blackmail three supermarket chains into paying
a total of Pounds 12m by threatening to contaminate products with the HIV
virus were jailed at the Old Bailey yesterday.
Mr Michael Norman of Wreningham, Norfolk, was sentenced to eight years after
pleading guilty to three charges of blackmail. Mr Alexander Taylor of
Yeovil, Somerset, was jailed for five years after being convicted of
conspiracy to blackmail.
Mr Norman sent letters to Safeway, J. Sainsbury and Tesco threatening to
contaminate products on the shelves with chemicals and the HIV virus unless
the store groups paid up, the court heard.
The letters warned that if they did not do so, financial investors and the
press would be told there were contaminated products on store shelves.
At Mr Norman's request, Mr Taylor had previously looked into ways of
laundering large sums of money and placing them in overseas bank accounts
without trace.
The two were caught by police officers posing as supermarket
representatives.
Mr Taylor had acted as a go-between, meeting the officers as an agent of the
blackmailer. He was followed and seen meeting Mr Norman in motorway service
stations. The men were arrested just after the officers handed over a
suitcase containing Pounds 275,000 in cash as part of the blackmail payment.
Mr Norman told police he got the idea for the crime from the Dick Francis
thriller The Banker.
Sentencing the two men, the judge Mr Recorder Paul Focke said such blackmail
'strikes at the roots of the retail industry'.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Five bids likely for rail extension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At least five consortia, including some overseas companies, are likely to
submit preliminary bids for the Pounds 100m-Pounds 130m privately financed
extension of the London Docklands Light Railway to Lewisham in south London.
The contract, which is expected to be awarded next autumn, will form part of
the Pounds 5bn of private investment in infrastructure which Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, said in his Budget speech was likely to be placed
next year.
The closing date is December 14 and memberships of some of the consortia
have still to be finalised, but five potential candidates have emerged.
The list is understood to include a joint venture between Amec, the UK
construction group, Dragados, the Spanish contractor, and Brown and Root,
the US engineering group. Bovis, the construction arm of shipping group P&amp;O,
and Nishimatsu, a Japanese contractor specialising in tunnelling, are also
expected to bid jointly and are negotiating with other potential partners.
Mowlem, the UK construction group which built previous sections of the
Docklands Light Railway, is expected to lead another bid.
It has still to be decided whether GEC will support the Mowlem tender as the
signalling contract for the Lewisham extension has already been earmarked
for the Canadian subsidiary of Alcatel of France which is providing new
signalling for the existing railway.
Other potential bidders for the 2 1/2 -mile extension are believed to
include the BICC engineering group, which owns Balfour Beatty construction,
and Pell Frischmann, consulting engineers, which is understood to have had
negotiations with UK contractors Alfred McAlpine and Sir Robert McAlpine and
Sumitomo Bank of Japan.
Bidders for the extension have been invited to pre-qualify through the
official journal of the European Union. A shortlist of bidders is expected
in January.
The government intends that the Docklands Light Railway, which links the
City with east London, should be franchised to a private-sector operator in
1996 before being sold completely to the private sector seven years later.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Blair puts spotlight on EU steel crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's lack of credibility in Europe is making it harder for the UK steel
industry to win its campaign for a 'level playing field' in the European
market, said Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, yesterday.
In his first direct comments on the crisis in the European steel industry
and UK producers' fight against subsidies made to some continental European
rivals, Mr Blair said the UK had to make its voice heard in Europe to
achieve the action the industry needed.
Speaking at the annual lunch of the British Iron and Steel Producers
Association (Bispa) in London, Mr Blair said this did not mean the UK had to
go along with everything other European Union nations wanted.
However, the UK government's attitude was seen to be 'destructive' and it
was too concerned with its own internal problems to be a credible
participant in the debate about steel or other issues, such as the Common
Agricultural Policy, he said.
There is growing pessimism in the UK steel industry about the one big issue
outstanding from the European Commission's handling of the steel crisis -
the future of Eko Stahl, the biggest steel producer of former East Germany.
Last month the UK industry praised the refusal by Mr Tim Eggar, the industry
minister, to endorse a controversial proposal for a subsidised takeover of
Eko Stahl by Cockerill-Sambre, the Belgian steel producer.
But the rescue plan, which Bispa says involves the injection of DM1.6bn
(Pounds 650m) of public money into Eko Stahl, is strongly backed by the
German government, and one UK observer feared yesterday that the UK is
losing ground. The issue will be decided in the next few weeks.
Mr Blair, in a wide-ranging speech restating his views on industry, training
and other issues, said the UK steel sector was a perfect example of a
'modern, traditional' industry. But the UK needed more such success stories.
According to figures from the UK Steel Information Service yesterday, annual
output per employee has risen to 421 tonnes this year, up 13 per cent on
last year. It is the biggest annual rise in recent years, and accompanies a
fall in the workforce by a further 5 per cent to 38,000.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Japan sees strong signs of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's economy is showing the first strong signs of recovery after a rise
in consumer spending and a surprise pick-up in corporate investment.
According to figures released yesterday, gross domestic product grew at an
annualised rate of 3.7 per cent in the three months to September this year.
The government's Economic Planning Agency said that GDP rose by 0.9 per cent
from the previous quarter, putting Japan on track for a 'full-scale
recovery' this financial year.
However, most private sector economists expect a weak upturn, with a rise in
GDP this calendar year of 0.6 per cent.
The figures also show that growth is sucking in imports and driving down the
current account surplus; a help for hard-pressed Japanese exporters who are
keen to see a fall in the yen.
The government said the current account surplus fell to Dollars 8.9bn
(Pounds 5.4bn) in October, down 19.3 per cent against the same month last
year, the third consecutive monthly fall.
The deficit on the long-term capital account nearly doubled from Dollars
7.8bn in September to Dollars 14.1bn in October, a sign that previously
cautious Japanese investors have started to place their cash abroad again.
Imports rose by 4.4 per cent, encouraged by the strength of private demand,
and exports rose only 0.7 per cent. Consumption was up 4.6 per cent.
The GDP total was in line with analysts' average forecasts, but some of its
components surprised. Corporate investment, for example, rose 1.8 per cent
for the first time since the third quarter of 1991. That is taken as a sign
that a record fall in capital spending may have touched bottom.
Taken with the increase in company profits shown in the recent interim
results season, the rise in investment reinforces the sense of corporate
recovery, said Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Baring Securities in
Tokyo.
The agency also upgraded its results for the second three months, from the
initially estimated 0.4 per cent quarter-on-quarter fall, to a 0.2 per cent
rise. There was potentially worrying news with the first fall in the GDP
deflator, a broad measure of domestic prices, for seven years. It fell an
annualised 0.5 per cent in the third quarter, which could show deflation has
domestic causes as well as being a function of the cheap import prices
caused by the yen's strength.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Ariane crash may prompt premium rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The crash of a European Ariane rocket and its US satellite payload into the
sea off French Guyana on Thursday could prompt a rise in insurance premiums
for next year's satellite launches.
The insurance industry expects that the accident will mean satellite
insurance underwriters will make a loss this year. The crash could also open
the way for emerging launch projects in Russia and China.
Worldwide claims on satellite insurance policies so far this year total
Dollars 736m (Pounds 470m), according to Mr Simon Clapham, lead satellite
underwriter at Lloyd's of London. That includes more than Dollars 200m
resulting from the crash of the PanAmSat-3 satellite and its launch vehicle.
Mr Clapham said the latest setback to Ariane would lead to a reappraisal of
rates for planned 1995 satellite launches where insurance cover has not yet
been agreed. 'Underwriters are likely to increase rates for these
programmes,' he said.
Insuring satellites is a notoriously volatile business but has been very
profitable for many insurers. Lloyd's insurance market underwrites the
biggest share of world satellite policies. About Dollars 35m of the cost of
the latest claim was placed at Lloyd's. The latest crash, caused by failure
of a third-stage motor, according to Mr Charles Bigot, Arianespace
president, brought to seven the number of Ariane rockets lost in 70 space
shots since 1979. The previous failure on January 24 this year was also
caused by problems with the third stage. Failures have sometimes led to
delays as long as 16 months.
US-based PanAmSat said it planned to launch a replacement within a year for
the lost satellite. 'It's not a major setback. We have a long-term outlook,
and we are looking at the next 10-20 years,' said Mr Andrew Jordan,
vice-president for the Asia-Pacific region.
Hughes Aircraft Company, the designer of PAS-3, had already built components
for a spare PAS-3 that could be completed within a year, Mr Jordan said. The
satellite was to have covered North and South America, Europe and Africa.
Arianespace engineers will seek to recover the wreckage to see why a new
version of the rocket's third stage, utilising a new mix of oxygen and
hydrogen, failed to ignite properly after the first two stages had brought
it to an altitude of 218 kilometres. 'We hope to be back in business soon,'
said Mr Bigot at the Kourou launch site in French Guyana.
PanAmSat-4, which will cover the area between Hong Kong and Europe,
including India and Africa, will be launched on schedule in April or May
1995, he said.
Ariane rockets have put 94 satellites and 24 auxiliary loads into orbit
successfully. Arianespace has contracts worth FFr17.1bn (Pounds 2bn) to put
another 38 satellites into orbit.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Japan's million dollar mayor: A Wall Street banker who went
home to a clash of new and old style politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILL DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Wall Street banker Tetsundo Iwakuni went home to become a small town
mayor in south-western Japan he soon made an impact.
But it was not just bringing modern management to the town hall that did so
much for the town, it was also his old-style connections with a powerful
Tokyo politician that brought central government cash his way.
The experience of Mr Iwakuni illustrates the 'split personality' of today's
Japanese politics following the downfall of the Liberal Democratic Party
last year. Mr Iwakuni's town, Izumo, is a tranquil little place on the
south-west coast.
Mr Iwakuni, 58, is in the mainstream of political reform, a leading light of
decentralisation and a close friend of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the first
post-LDP prime minister. Yet he owes part of his success to the influence of
one of the most senior members of Japan's political old guard. He is Mr
Noboru Takeshita, 70, local member of parliament for the past 36 years, and
a former LDP prime minister.
Mr Iwakuni took a risk by leaving a Dollars 1m per year job as a senior vice
president of Merrill Lynch in New York to become mayor of his home town five
years ago, on the invitation of a local official related to Mr Takeshita. He
finds Izumo and Japan are changing.
The main change, he believes, is that voters have realised for the first
time since the war that there is an alternative to one-party LDP rule. And
yet Mr Iwakuni wonders whether democracy will ever catch on in Japan.
Mr Iwakuni's first step towards hauling Izumo into the 20th century was
symbolic, to change the local calendar from the old imperial to the western
system. He has also shaken up the town hall organisation, so that it won a
management prize as one of Japan's nine best-run corporations, along with
Toyota and Nintendo.
He has pushed the popular reformist cause of decentralisation by simply
ignoring the time honoured tradition of obtaining Tokyo bureaucrats'
permission for every small decision. Mr Iwakuni has proceeded, regardless,
with his own plans, like putting waste recycling bins at filling stations
and opening the town hall for service at weekends.
He is justly proud of his mayoral record, and won 87 per cent of the vote
when he was re-elected last year. Yet Mr Iwakuni makes no secret that his
real passion is to go into national politics, with the aim of making
domestically oriented Japan more influential in the international issues on
which its future increasingly hangs.
Mr Takeshita resigned as prime minister, to take responsibility for
political corruption in the LDP, in 1989, in the same month as Mr Iwakuni
took office, a coincidence which some argued at the time symbolised the
switch from the old style of politics to the new.
Yet there has not been a complete switch, rather a change in direction,
argues the mayor. Mr Takeshita, for example, has recently started to run the
LDP again, this time from behind the scenes. His power as a politician able
to help his own community, the secret of success in old style Japanese
politics, has never waned.
It is thanks to Mr Takeshita's influence with the public administration in
Tokyo that Izumo spends Y30bn (Pounds 189m) per year on public works, twice
as much as neighbouring towns. Today, Izumo hums with construction
machinery, diverting a river to reduce the risk of flooding at one end of
the town and building a by-pass at the other.
Mr Iwakuni freely admits that some of the glory for Mr Takeshita's
fundraising power rubs off on himself. Yet at the same time he points out
that Izumo's big public works budget only diminishes investments in towns
where there is no LDP heavyweight to pull strings in Tokyo.
The cosy nature of Izumo politics shows why Mr Iwakuni believes, with some
frustration, that political reforms alone will not change the way in which
Japan is governed. Old style Japanese politicians' weakness is that they
have to work so hard trying to channel central government money to their own
districts, that they have little time left for national, let alone foreign
policies, he argues.
The new system, under which multi-seat constituencies are replaced by a
mixture of single seat districts and proportional representation, will not
change anything, he believes. It will force politicians to work even harder
for public works funds and other local benefits because they will need a
bigger share of the vote to get elected.
'Local profits to local people will become the dominant factor in the new
style election fight, rather than what we do about the European Union or the
trade surplus,' argues Mr Iwakuni.
'If everyone competes in this way, who will direct the future of Japan? The
bureaucrats will.'
But in the long run, he says, parties with clear policies will be more
successful at influencing coalitions than traditional parties, such as the
LDP and the Socialists, which tend to believe that dogma is an encumbrance.
What if he is wrong? Mr Iwakuni shrugs his shoulders and says he would be
quite happy to go back to New York, to a mega-salary and his grown-up
daughters.
An old style politician would have held onto the mayor's job at any cost.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Swimmers' reputation takes a dive: The embarrassment of
China's drug-shamed sports leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's sports commissars banged the nationalist drum earlier this year when
rival countries alleged that the phenomenally successful Chinese swimmers at
the Rome world championships used performance-enhancing drugs.
Then, Zhou Ming, a Chinese swimming coach, rounded on western critics,
saying: 'I think the doping problem is a sort of political problem now
because in the sports world it's always the domain of western people. They
just can't tolerate that Asian peoples can be good in sport.'
But now the truth, of an epidemic of drug-taking among Chinese swimmers, is
dribbling out. Reports appeared this week that eight of them tested positive
at the recent Asian Games in Hiroshima, and statements from Beijing have
become contrite. Officials are still finding ways of blaming the west.
'Illegal drug abuse in sport is originally a western invention, but since
China opened its doors to the outside world 15 years ago, such a bad thing
seeped into China, too, just like prostitution,' Mr Yuan Jiawei, deputy
secretary general of China's swimming committee, said this week.
It is a moot point whether the world's oldest profession was ever completely
eradicated from China, but the scourge of drug-taking in sport has certainly
found its way to the Middle Kingdom, Chinese protestations to the contrary.
Now that the cat is out of the bag, Chinese officialdom is seeking to put
the best complexion on things but the doping scandal is a considerable
embarrassment for a country whose sporting aspirations are so entwined with
its political and commercial ambitions.
China lost face this week in the eyes of the world sporting fraternity and
in the process its credibility was harmed in a broader sense, at a moment
when it is seeking closer integration with the international community -
from membership of world trade organisations such as Gatt to a more active
role in arms control.
All these international commitments rest to an extent on trust and playing
by the rules. China is in the process of trying to convince a sceptical
world it will uphold Gatt principles, and honour undertakings to continue
liberalising its economy. 'This is the last thing they would have wanted at
this stage since international sporting success is part of their attempts to
build an image of a comprehensively successful and all-round China,' said a
western official in Beijing this week.
But the official also noted that the problem of drug-taking in sport is far
from confined to China; although few other nations have suffered the
embarrassment of having 11 of their athletes, including world-record
breaking swimmers, involved in a doping scandal all at once.
Before the latest reports emerged from Tokyo, drug-taking among Chinese
swimmers had already become a problem. In the past two years five had tested
positive, which equalled the number of positive tests by FINA, the
international swimming federation, in the previous 22 years.
Inevitably, suspicion that such champion swimmers as Lu Bin and Yang Aihua,
gold medallists in Rome, had taken steroids is casting doubt over the
performance of other Chinese athletes such as women distance runners who
have re-written the record books in the past year.
Ma Junren, the flamboyant Chinese athletics coach, claims that his 'army' of
woman runners owe their outstanding performances to a potion made from
crushed turtle, and other exotic ingredients, but rival athletes are
sceptical.
Compounding Beijing's embarrassment is the fact that at the Asian Games in
early October, Chinese sports officials had prevailed on the 43-member
Olympic Council of Asia to condemn the western media over the drug-taking
allegations at the Rome swimming championships.
Wei Jizhong, China's OCA delegate, welcomed the stand of fellow Asians,
saying: 'We are happy that the other Asian countries have finally decided to
support us.'
China won 137 gold medals out of 337 events at the Asian games, more than
double the tally of South Korea, its nearest competitor. Its women swimmers
won all 15 of their races and set a number of world records in the process.
Its women weightlifters dominated, setting 16 world records.
China hailed the results in official commentaries as a 'resounding success',
and singled out the women swimmers for special praise, saying their
'astonishing performances marked a shift in the balance in a sport which the
west had dominated for decades'. Those performances seem somewhat less
astonishing now.

The Polish parliament yesterday overrode President Lech Walesa's veto and
refused to cut next year's tax rates. The president, who is running for
re-election at the end of next year, argued that the original tax rates of
20, 30 and 40 per cent should be restored in 1995 as they were pushed up to
21, 33 and 45 per cent this year as a temporary measure. The tax cut would
have cost the government 12,000bn zlotys in budget revenues next year and
widened the planned 87,800bn zlotys deficit - 3.3 per cent of GDP - already
agreed with the International Monetary Fund.

Turkish Cypriot authorities have obtained a court order against a bank owned
by fugitive tycoon Mr Asil Nadir for defaulting on Dollars 4.2m in deposits
for a pension fund, Mr Ozkan Murat, minister of labour and social security,
said on Thursday. 'We have taken legal action to make sure this money is not
lost. We are not sure if the assets of the bank will be enough to meet this
amount, but we have taken action to save the money of the workers,' Mr Ozkan
said. Under the court order, Mr Nadir will continue to operate the Kibris
Endustri Bankasi but will not be able to sell its assets. Mr Murat said the
pension fund had deposited money to earn interest in the bank owned by Mr
Nadir, who fled to his native northern Cyprus in 1993 after jumping bail in
Britain to avoid trial on charges of theft and false accounting over his
collapsed fruit-to-electronics conglomerate Polly Peck.

Japanese politicians reacted angrily yesterday to a plan by the US to issue
postage stamps depicting the explosion of the atomic bomb over Hiroshima.
The US postal service said on Thursday that it would mark the 50th
anniversary of the end of the second world war next year by selling a set of
commemorative stamps, one of which shows a composite image of mushroom
clouds created by the wartime bombings and nuclear tests after the war. The
Japanese government has been angered by the words on the stamp: 'Atomic
bombs hasten war's end.' Mr Yohei Kono, the foreign minister, indicated that
Japan might protest formally to the US about the decision. 'I want to convey
Japanese feelings to the US in some form,' he said yesterday. The chief
cabinet secretary, Mr Kozo Igarashi, said: 'The dropping of the atom bomb
was an historical fact in itself but it also took the lives of more than
300,000 Japanese people.'

Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming was yesterday voted out of his position as
the Republican whip in the US Senate, in favour of Senator Trent Lott of
Mississippi. The whip is second in command to Senator Bob Dole, who was duly
elected yesterday to lead the Republican majority in the new Congress. The
acid-tongued Mr Simpson would have been expected to hold the fort loyally
for Mr Dole if he should leave Washington to campaign for the presidency,
while Mr Lott, an articulate believer in supply-side economics, is viewed as
an ally of Mr Dole's old enemy Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who is also
seeking the presidency. On the Democratic side, Senator Tom Daschle of South
Dakota was elected to succeed retiring Senator George Mitchell as the
Democratic leader in the Senate.

Mr Rafik Hariri, chief architect of Lebanon's multi-billion-dollar
rebuilding project, yesterday tendered his resignation as prime minister to
President Elias Hrawi. Mr Hariri's office said his decision was linked to a
'misleading media and political campaign' against him. The move follows
weeks of disagreement between Mr Hariri and other senior figures in
Lebanon's fractious cabinet and a spate of allegations of corruption and
drugs-dealing from outspoken members of parliament touching both the
presidency and Solidere, the property development company designed by Mr
Hariri to rebuild central Beirut.
Mr Hariri's departure would be a severe blow to local and international
confidence in Lebanon and place a serious question mark over the future of
the Dollars 11bn (Pounds 6.7bn) rebuilding effort now under way. But
political observers in Beirut said the move might be a gambit to force
greater co-operation from the cabinet, and particularly Mr Nabih Berri, the
powerful speaker of the assembly, with whom Hariri aides spoke of
'irreconcilable differences'.

Taiwan goes to the polls today to elect mayors for its two largest cities
and a provincial governor in what are widely seen as the most important
elections since the island threw off the yoke of military dictatorship seven
years ago. These are the most senior positions yet to be decided by popular
vote, and today's poll marks the penultimate stage in a process of
democratisation that will culminate in presidential elections in early 1996.
Debate has raged over a gamut of issues, starting with the fundamental issue
of Taiwan's future relationship with China, but feelings have also been
running high over the need to wipe out vote-buying and garbage collection in
Taipei.
In the election for provincial governor, the ruling Kuomintang's
well-entrenched and well-financed party machine is expected to carry the
day.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Political funding ban urged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
France should ban companies from funding political parties as part of a
crackdown on corruption, a group of experts appointed by conservative Prime
Minister Edouard Balladur said yesterday. The panel of three, set up in
September amid sleaze scandals in Balladur's centre-right government,
recommended that anyone convicted of corruption should be automatically
barred from standing for election. The experts also said France should
tighten its rules on judicial secrecy, reviving a controversy over how far
corruption probes should be hushed up before trial.
Mr Balladur said the government would take its time to study the report,
which comprises 27 recommendations for 'the moralisation of public life' and
is one of several projects on how to stop sleaze, including one from the
National Assembly. Mr Balladur's popularity has been dented by the
resignation of three cabinet ministers since July over corruption probes,
and recent opinion polls showed him trailing behind Socialist European
Commission President Jacques Delors in the undeclared race for next year's
presidential election.

A magistrate investigating alleged overbilling of state-owned France Telecom
plans to summon Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of French industrial giant Alcatel
Alsthom, for questioning, an official said yesterday. The news followed the
release earlier in the day of Mr Pierre Guichet, chairman of Alcatel's
telecommunications unit CIT, after two weeks in a Paris jail. Mr Guichet,
62, had received the full support of Alcatel CIT which expressed outrage at
his incarceration without charge. He remains under investigation.
Mr Guichet was ordered jailed by investigating magistrate Jean-Marie d'Huy
who is looking into the allegations that Alcatel CIT overcharged France
Telecom, its biggest customer, by an estimated FFr2bn (Pounds 230m). Alcatel
CIT has consistently rejected the allegations, saying there had been a
misunderstanding of its billing practices. The official said that Mr Suard,
head of parent Alcatel Alsthom, would be called in for questioning during
December. In July, Mr d'Huy placed Mr Suard under investigation on suspicion
of underpaying for security measures at his current and previous residences.
He was briefly arrested and questioned for 12 hours in July by the police
fraud squad.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Growth of derivatives 'could hinder Fed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rapid growth in the derivatives market could undermine the central bank's
ability to contain a future financial crisis, a senior official of the US
Federal Reserve warned yesterday.
The warning from Fed governor Ms Susan Phillips came a day after the
government of Orange County, a prosperous region in Southern California,
admitted that it had incurred paper losses of around Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds
957m) on a portfolio of investments that included a large number of
derivatives - financial instruments whose value is based in part on some
underlying market factor such as an interest rate or stock.
The losses were prompted by the sharp declines in the US bond market this
year. The impact of falling bond prices on Orange County's portfolio were
exaggerated by the leveraged nature of the derivatives instruments which
made up 25 per cent of the municipality's investment holdings.
Although Ms Phillips was not commenting directly on the Orange County case
yesterday, her remarks at a conference in Washington were clearly intended
as a warning to the banks and securities firms which create and sell the
derivatives, and the companies which buy them, to tread more carefully.
The Fed governor said the central bank's normal system for providing funding
to institutions during a crisis 'may not be well-suited' to deal with credit
quality concerns, because growth in derivatives meant financial disturbances
could now be rapidly transmitted from one part of the world's financial
system to another. Ms Phillips also called for banks and securities firms to
disclose more information on their derivatives activities.
In California, meanwhile, the fallout from the revelation of Orange County's
losses spread. Although treasurers of several cities in the region said they
would not withdraw their funds from the troubled investment portfolio, the
Standard &amp; Poor's ratings agency in New York - which is considering
downgrading Orange County's debt - said it was concerned that publicity
surrounding the losses might prompt some withdrawals, triggering a liquidity
crisis.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GROZNY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chechen leaders yesterday threatened widespread terrorism in Russia,
including attacks on nuclear power stations, if Russian troops massing on
the border invaded their breakaway state.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin has so far held back from his threat to
intervene. The deadline of his ultimatum to declare an emergency situation
in the rebel Caucasian republic ran out on Thursday.
Mr Russif Shamsuddin, the Chechen foreign minister, said: 'Our interests
would be nuclear power stations, in attacking them. Why not? We would do it
if attacked, believe me.'
The Russian government appears to be taking the threat of Chechen terrorism
very seriously. Security outside government buildings and railway stations
in Moscow has been noticeably tightened since the crisis escalated.
Mr Yeltsin said on Tuesday he would crack down hard unless the Chechen
government and opposition forces stopped fighting and freed Russian
prisoners within 48 hours. But the threats have petered out in a welter of
contradictory statements from senior officials including Mr Yeltsin himself.
The first sign he might be rethinking his strategy came on Thursday when a
senior presidential source told Itar-Tass news agency that the Kremlin
leader would not sign a decree imposing a state of emergency on Chechnya in
the very near future.
The suspicions seemed to be confirmed when, in a bizarre move, Mr Yeltsin's
original ultimatum to the two warring sides was reissued without the key
phrase about introducing a state of emergency.
In Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, a delegation of Russian parliamentary
deputies, who are trying to negotiate the release of Russian soldiers
captured during battles last weekend, were humiliated by General Dzhokar
Dudayev, the Chechen president, by being kept waiting all day while a
succession of supporters were ushered into his presence.
But after meeting the president the deputies said they were optimistic that
some of the 21 captured Russian soldiers would be freed. 'In principle the
authorities have no objections. I think they will be freed eventually,' Mr
Anatoly Shabad said. However, Mr Shamsuddin claimed: 'We will never give
back the Russian prisoners, never.'
No bombing raids of the kind which have been a feature of the past three
days and which have destroyed the military and civil airports at Grozny were
made yesterday.
According to Reuters, at least nine people have been killed in air strikes
on Grozny although a lower figure of seven deaths was given by the Interfax
news agency.
The Russian delegation, led by Mr Sergei Yushenkov, chairman of the Duma
defence committee, and composed of deputies who disapprove of the threatened
use of force against Chechnya, appealed to Mr Yeltsin to halt the air
strikes.
'Please do anything possible to stop the bombing of Grozny. If this happens
again while we are here then what happens next?' they said in an appeal
after meeting Gen Dudayev.
Mr Shabad said there was little doubt the aeroplanes were Russian and said
the Kremlin had sent in Russian troops to support the opposition.

Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, yesterday hailed the US Senate vote to ratify the Uruguay Round
world trade accords as showing US commitment to multilateralism and a good
sign for the new World Trade Organisation.
'This is a day for particular celebration,' he said in Geneva. US
ratification was also significant in ensuring a WTO starting date of January
1, due to be endorsed by an implementation conference on December 8.
Meanwhile, President Bill Clinton said yesterday that he hoped he could
'continue the spirit of co-operation with the new Congress that we've seen
on Gatt this week.'
The final margin of victory was much wider in both houses of Congress than
earlier wrangling had suggested. The Gatt bill passed in the House of
Representatives on Tuesday by 288 votes to 146, and in the Senate on
Thursday by 76 votes to 24. Gatt opponents did only slightly better on a
crucial Senate procedural vote, falling nine votes short of blocking the
measure by raising a technical budget point.
Mr Clinton was yesterday afternoon due to meet Senator Robert Dole and
Congressman Newt Gingrich, who will lead the majority Republicans when the
new Congress convenes in January.
Although Mr Dole and Mr Gingrich voiced reservations about Gatt before
throwing their support behind it, conservative analysts say traditional
Republican free trade views will prove stronger than the temptation to
obstruct Mr Clinton.
'I believe that certainly Newt Gingrich has turned the corner on free trade,
and I hope that Bob Dole has as well,' said Mr Kim Holmes, who heads the
foreign policy team at the Heritage Foundation, a right-wing think-tank.
One of the first trade issues to face the new Congress will be the issue of
giving the president a free hand under fast track procedures to negotiate
the admission of Chile to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which
links the US with Canada and Mexico.
Dismissing some fears about loss of US sovereignty to the WTO as 'arrant
nonsense', Mr Sutherland said he was confident that the WTO's disputes
procedures would be 'unimpeachable'. This was a reference to the judicial
review panel insisted on by Mr Dole in return for his endorsement of the
Uruguay Round deal.
Mr Sutherland also welcomed the 'good news from Japan' whose lower
parliamentary chamber - the decisive voice on ratification - approved the
pact just hours after the Senate vote.
This leaves the EU and Canada among the Quad group of leading traders which
have still to ratify. Both have said they are confident of doing so by the
end of the year.
The great majority of Gatt's 124 members are now expected swiftly to follow
the US lead. Over 40 nations had ratified by yesterday and Mr Sutherland
said the target was 'at least 100' by December 30. Only Switzerland, Poland,
Liechtenstein and Cyprus foresee a delay into 1995.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Drugs claim on Gibraltar border
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Spain yesterday countered British claims of harassment at the border with
Gibraltar with allegations that the Rock had become a big drugs smuggling
and money laundering centre. 'Gibraltar's narcotics business is industrially
organised. The situation has degenerated to a very serious level,' official
sources in Madrid said.
Long traffic queues have developed at the border as police conduct searches
and question drivers whether their vehicles are properly equipped. On
Thursday Mr David Davis, the UK's minister for Europe, summoned Spain's
ambassador in London, Mr Albert Aza, to the Foreign Office and expressed the
British government's 'strong concern' over 'intrusive' checks by Spanish
police at the frontier.
The row has surfaced as foreign secretary Mr Douglas Hurd prepares to meet
Mr Javier Solana, Spain's foreign minister, in London this month to discuss
Spanish claims to the British colony and has added an embarrassing new twist
to existing tensions between Whitehall and Mr Joe Bossano, the
independent-minded chief minister of Gibraltar.
Attempts by the UK to supervise the the colony's finances have prompted Mr
Bossano to allege that London is strangling Gibraltar's attempt to achieve
self-sufficiency as an offshore banking base. It is now feared that the
virtual siege on Gibraltar, reminiscent of the blockade imposed by the
Franco dictatorship, could serve to strengthen Mr Bossano as he campaigns
for 'a hands off the Rock' policy and seeks UK counter measures against
Spain.
Gibraltar residents say double checks on vehicles leaving the colony, as two
teams of Spain's paramilitary civil guards corps laboriously conduct
searches and question drivers, have caused queues of up to six hours at the
border.
'It's ludicrous, a never-ending list of things you have to have which
changes at the whim of the police,' said a Gibraltar barrister. 'Apart from
spare fan belts and all that, the car's first aid kit has to include
surgical gloves and if you wear spectacles you have to have a second pair.'
In London, the Spanish ambassador was told the checks 'could not seriously
be presented as a search for drugs and tobacco.'
A Madrid official said the border controls were creating a detailed data
base on those entering Spain. 'We are obtaining very useful information
which is directly linked to illicit activities in Gibraltar. Smuggling is
tolerated by the Gibraltar authorities and London looks the other way.'
Last Monday the civil guard intercepted 43 fast launches based in Gibraltar
trying to land tobacco and drugs on three nearby Spanish beaches.
Officials in Madrid say Gibraltar risks a Mafia-type takeover. There is
certainly little use other than that of illegal activities for the 200-odd
fast launches, painted black to help avoid detection at night, that are
moored in Gibraltar's marina. 'The illegal activities have increased, we
have not seen a serious single effort to curb them, and they have to stop,'
the officials said.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Sighs of relief as Rome pension deal stops strike: Silvio
Berlusconi's U-turn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Berlusconi government yesterday got away with a remarkably benign press
after making big concessions to the unions over pension reform on Thursday.
Only one newspaper headline trumpeted a union victory - L'Unita, the
influential daily of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left. The
rest concentrated on the peaceful end to the 'war of the pensions', allowing
the government ample space to demonstrate that the deal was a triumph of
common sense.
Such a reaction was not surprising because the immediate consequence of
Thursday's wide-ranging agreement between the government and the unions was
to call off yesterday's planned eight-hour general strike, allowing everyone
a sigh of relief.
An increasingly weak premier Silvio Berlusconi could scarce afford to
heighten political tension by being seen as the cause of social unrest. The
union leadership worried that strike action against the government could
backfire and that they would be unable to control the growing militancy of
grass-roots members.
But averting a general strike cannot easily conceal the extent of the
government's retreat or the degree to which the original calculations for
the 1995 budget have been thrown into question.
Mr Berlusconi said on October 14 at the time of the first general strike
against pension reform and cost-cutting measures in the 1995 budget: 'Not
one, nor 10 nor 100 general strikes will alter the budget.'
The unions demanded that cuts in pensions benefits should not be linked to
the budget but treated separately as part of a broader reform of the costly
state pensions system. They also wanted the budget altered to be 'socially
just', with more funds devoted to job creation in the south, professional
training and needy families as well more attention to research and
development.
After two months' argument and protest, Mr Berlusconi has been obliged to
accept these sets of demands - almost in their entirety. Pension reform will
be treated separately from the current 1995 budget law in parliament and the
government has agreed to allow up to June 30 next year to formulate pension
proposals.
The turn-round is all the more extraordinary because the budget has already
been approved by the chamber of deputies. This means the unions have imposed
change even when legislation has been endorsed by one chamber of parliament,
and reinforced their role as interlocutors where reforms are concerned.
The unions are committed to overhauling the pay-as-you-go pensions system
which this year will run a deficit of L84,000bn (Pounds 33bn) - equivalent
to 60 per cent of the total budget deficit. But their views are bound to be
partial and they are likely to resist the two main structural changes which
until this week were part of the budget: penalising early retirement through
reduced benefits and cutting the rate at which pensions accrue annually,
from 2 to 1.75 per cent.
Among the main burdens on Italy's pensions system - and therefore the budget
 -are easy early retirement terms and the exceptionally high rate at which
pensions benefits accrue. Until the reform is clarified, uncertainty will
surround any calculation of future budget deficits and the consequent
borrowing requirements. The uncertainty is the greater because of the weak
state of the right-wing coalition and the fractious nature of parliament.
In the meantime the government has to present a convincing explanation of
how it will fund the estimated L4,000bn extra cost of the unions deal
without affecting the 1995 budget objectives. The objective of holding the
deficit down to L138,000bn (8 per cent of GDP) looks ever more questionable
without additional measures.
At present the budget makes no provision for at least L7,000bn in additional
interest payments on the debt stock because of the 0.5 percentage point rise
in the discount rate in August. Nor does it take account of the
L5,000bn-L10,000bn needed to treat recent flood damage in the north; or more
seriously the L32,000bn cost of a constitutional court sentence ordering the
payment of arrears on certain minimum pensions.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Walesa rebuffed on taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Polish parliament yesterday overrode President Lech Walesa's veto and
refused to cut next year's tax rates. The president, who is running for
re-election at the end of next year, argued that the original tax rates of
20, 30 and 40 per cent should be restored in 1995 as they were pushed up to
21, 33 and 45 per cent this year as a temporary measure. The tax cut would
have cost the government 12,000bn zlotys in budget revenues next year and
widened the planned 87,800bn zlotys deficit - 3.3 per cent of GDP - already
agreed with the International Monetary Fund.
The vote saw the government coalition headed by Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the
Peasant party leader, win the backing of the left wing opposition Labour
Union (UP). The UP had made its support conditional on government promises
that an 18 per cent tax rate would be introduced in 1996 for the lowest
paid. If Mr Walesa successfully vetoes the budget itself when it emerges
from parliament early next year, this would lead to parliamentary elections,
which are not due until 1997.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Italy discusses bringing lira back into ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A growing body of opinion in Italy is urging the government to bring the
lira back inside the European exchange rate mechanism before the end of the
year.
The Berlusconi government has yet to take a position on the issue but is
expected to make informal soundings with its EU partners at Monday's meeting
of European finance ministers.
Under the Maastricht Treaty timetable for the next stage of monetary union,
EU governments must meet at the beginning of 1997 to consider which
currencies have respected their parities over the previous two years. Thus
under the current regime if Italy fails to rejoin by January, it would be
technically excluded.
The issue has been quietly discussed within the government, among the
opposition and by business leaders for some six weeks. But it was
highlighted last weekend by the public call to rejoin the ERM from both Mr
Giovanni Agnelli, the head of Fiat, and Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the head of
Olivetti.
These captains of industry have since been followed by Mr Nino Andreatta,
the economic spokesman for the Popular party and a former treasury and
foreign minister, who put the case at its crudest this week: 'It's not a bad
idea for a country like ours, which has an identity crisis every time
someone talks of Italy ending up in the B league or the slow lane of Europe,
to remind people of obligations undertaken and the need to respect them.'
Yesterday Mr Luigi Grillo, deputy minister charge of the economy in the
prime minister's office, went public and backed Mr Andreatta's logic adding:
'There are the conditions to consider a re-entry of the lira into the
European monetary system.'
The lira was forced to leave the ERM to float during 'black September' of
1992. From being L850 against the D-Mark it has of late come close to
L1,040. With a 15 per cent fluctuation band now permitted, supporters of the
return argue the lira is already under-valued and could seek to have a
parity of L1,000 against the D-Mark.
Until recently the French were strongly against Italy re-entering at such a
parity, having enjoyed the benefits of a competitive devaluation of over 30
per cent. But Paris' resistance is reported to have softened as the French
economy picks up, while in Brussels Mr Jacques Delors, the outgoing EU
president, favours the idea.
Within the government Mr Antonio Martino, the foreign minister, is hostile.
Mr Lamberto Dini, the treasury minister and a key figure in any decision, is
said to be still listening to different points of view. But the treasury is
anxious to latch on to any signal that might encourage the markets to have
more faith in the lira and permit domestic interest rates to fall.

FT  03 DEC 94 / Drop in US jobless fuels pressure for rise in rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Strong job creation last month cut the US unemployment rate to its lowest
level in four years, prompting speculation that the Federal Reserve might
raise interest rates again this month to cool the economy.
The Labour Department said non-farm payroll employment expanded by 350,000
in November, bringing the unemployment rate down to 5.6 per cent from 5.8
per cent in October and 6.7 per cent at the start of the year.
The number of unemployed has fallen by 1.4m since January to 7.3m. Although
comparisons with earlier years are difficult because of a radical change
this year in the way data are collected, an unemployment rate below 5.6 per
cent was last recorded in 1990.
The employment figures gave a fillip to the dollar which broke through the
Y100 level for the first time in two months on speculation of an interest
rate increase.
In late trading in New York last night, the dollar was one yen higher at
Y100.6 and more than half a pfennig up against the D-Mark at DM1.5800. The
stronger dollar also helped the bond market, where prices of long-term
government securities surged.
The benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond ended up more than a point, yielding
7.9 per cent. The rally in bonds prompted some late buying of stocks
yesterday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 44.75 at 3,745.62.
The strength of the employment market in November led some Wall Street
economists to warn that the Fed might decide that last month's
three-quarters of a percentage point increase in short-term interest rates
will not be enough to slow the economy to a pace that can be sustained
without an acceleration of inflation. Even before yesterday's fall, most Fed
governors believed that unemployment was at, or below, the 'natural rate' at
which they could expect wage pressures to build.
Fed officials say they want to slow the economy to a sustainable growth rate
of about 2.5 per cent a year, but the Commerce Department this week said
that the economy grew at a 3.9 per cent pace in the third quarter.
Although the view is now spreading that the Fed could raise rates as early
as December 20, most economists still expect the move next year.
A conflicting signal about the strength of the US economy came from the
index of leading economic indicators, which the Commerce Department said
yesterday had fallen in October for the first time in 15 months.

FT  03 DEC 94 / UBS offers gold bars with a money-back guarantee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Here it is, a product for the gold bug who has become nervous about the
tendency of his favourite metal to lose value - a gold bar with a money-back
guarantee.
Union Bank of Switzerland, one of the leading players in the world gold
bullion market, yesterday launched the bars with a view to putting a bit of
zing back in the retail gold market.
The bars come in weights of 100 grams, 500 grams and one kilogram, and the
rules are simple. The buyer pays today's market price for the gold - about
Dollars 380 per ounce - plus a premium of about 2 per cent, giving a price
of about Dollars 1,245 for the 100g bar, Dollars 6,230 for 500g and Dollars
12,460 for 1kg. UBS guarantees to repay buyers at least Dollars 360 per
ounce at any time up to the year 2000. Meanwhile, the bar is always
negotiable, perhaps at a higher price if the market moves in the right
direction.
The advantage to the bank is obvious. It can shift some non-interest bearing
gold in its coffers and replace it with interest-bearing money. And even if
the gold price does go down - as Mr Andy Smith, UBS gold analyst is
predicting - a simple hedging operation should enable the bank to avoid
losses.
'It is definitely not our intention to lose money,' said Mr Bernhard
Schnellmann, UBS vice-president of precious metals marketing in Zurich.
Who is likely to buy the bars? Mr Schnellmann believes 'there is a certain
indefinable mood in the investor community in favour of buying physical
gold'.
He added: 'It is not the big institutions, but the ordinary man in the
street and some wealthy individuals. It comes with certain fears that they
have.'
UBS research shows that these fears are strongest in western Europe, even
Switzerland. 'People feel that the time is not too bad for buying gold, but
they have all either been hurt or they know someone who has been hurt by the
falls in the gold price in recent years,' he explained. These bars are
designed to overcome that final hesitation.

FT  03 DEC 94 / GEC raises stakes in battle with BAe for VSEL
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEC, which is battling with British Aerospace for control of the submarine
maker VSEL, has sent selected MPs a document damning BAe's record, in spite
of giving the Ministry of Defence an undertaking that it would not enter
into a public war of words with Britain's biggest defence contractor.
The paper, which attacks BAe's record as a prime contractor and complains
that in other respects the company is 'not particularly distinguished', is a
response to a BAe bid document published last week through the Stock
Exchange, which strongly attacked GEC.
GEC's document has been labelled private and confidential and has not been
made available to shareholders, unlike BAe's, though it answers
point-by-point BAe's bid document. The Takeover Panel, which polices
takeover battles, permits private lobbying of MPs but would want any
important financial information to be circulated to shareholders during the
course of the bid.
GEC is convinced it is not in breach of takeover panel rules.
GEC slams BAe's financial record, saying that in the past 3 1/2 years BAe
has had a cash outflow of Pounds 2.5bn, and made Pounds 1.5bn in provisions.
In the same period BAe has had operating profits which are less than 1 per
cent of its Pounds 35bn turnover.
The document also says: 'The effect of BAe's acquisition of VSEL would be
that those resources (VSEL's net cash of Pounds 288m) would be absorbed in
covering the cash outflow arising from the large losses accruing in other
parts of its business.'
It adds that the deal would 'weaken its (VSEL's) financial, and therefore,
competitive position'.
Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, said last night: 'This smacks of hole
in the corner tactics. I'm astounded that if GEC wants to make these claims
they haven't been circulated to VSEL's shareholders.'
GEC also contrasts its own position as 'an international group with
manufacturing businesses throughout the world' with the 'negligible overseas
manufacturing capability' of BAe.
The paper says: 'GEC estimates that half of BAe's total defence business and
some two-thirds of its defence exports are dependent on a single Middle
Eastern customer (Saudi Arabia through the Al Yamamah contract).'
The document counters BAe's assertions that a GEC takeover of VSEL would go
against the MoD's competition policy, and it also denies that shipbuilding
would be left largely in the hands of one company.
The document is part of the behind-the-scenes war of words being conducted
by the two companies in what many observers think is a dry run for a
takeover bid for BAe by GEC.
Before GEC countered BAe's original bid worth Pounds 478m for VSEL with its
own offer worth Pounds 532m, it agreed with the MoD that it would not launch
public attacks on BAe. The MoD is understood to be concerned that open
warfare between the two companies would erode foreign customer confidence in
BAe.
GEC has made no secret of its desire to merge BAe's defence interests with
its own, and covets BAe's position as the prime contracting company
controlling such large projects as the Eurofighter, the four-nation advanced
jet. GEC also says its strong finances make it a more natural leader for
such prime roles.
BAe, however, has privately attacked GEC's record in running large
programmes such as the Nimrod airborne radar and the Spearfish torpedo
programmes, saying that they show GEC is not capable of being a prime
contractor.

IRI, the Italian state holding company, has fixed a deadline of December 12
for potential buyers to present their bids for Ilva Laminati Pianti, the
flat steel subsidiary of Italy's state-owned steel producer.
IRI is attempting to strike a deal for ILP by the end of 1994. If it fails,
Italy will fall foul of the European Commission, which has to enforce an EU
agreement that Ilva should be fully privatised by December 31. Several
companies have expressed interest in ILP, but with the EU deadline
approaching it is still unclear how serious the possible buyers are.
Mr Emilio Riva, the Italian steel magnate, has recently emerged as an ally
of the Tarnofin consortium of entrepreneurs from the region around ILP's
main plants.
Unconfirmed reports in yesterday's Italian newspapers said the Riva group
had replaced G. William Miller, the Washington-based merchant bank, in the
consortium.
Two Italian steel traders, Mr Bruno Bolfo and Mr Vittorio Malacalza, are
trying to rally support for a separate offer.
Their advisers say the traders have the backing of CSN, the Brazilian steel
producer. They have also been seeking to add Usinor Sacilor of France and
Lucchini, the private Italian steel manufacturer, to the consortium, and
could make a formal offer next week.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Arts: 'Elektra' and 'The Carmelites' - Opera in Berlin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Claudio Abbado and his Berlin Philharmonic have been preparing Strauss's
Elektra for recording, and for performance at the next Salzburg Easter
Festival. On Wednesday they unveiled the result for their concert audience
at the Philharmonie, and it was extraordinary.
It is a rare opera recording that gets all the soloists originally planned -
somebody always turns out to have conflicting commitments. This time,
however, it is hard to believe that Abbado could have wanted any other
singers. Deborah Polaski's tall, commanding Elektra displayed not only the
full power of her recent Brunnhilde at Covent Garden, but a dramatic and
expressive range we had only guessed at here.
Cheryl Studer, back in her best voice again, matched her with a Chrysothemis
who was no kind of shrinking maiden, but lusted for a normal domestic life
as passionately as Elektra wanted to wreck it. As Clytemnestra, Marjana
Lipovsek offered a richly subtle study far beyond the usual croaking
monster, and did it in luscious voice. As if these were not enough, we had
Franz Grundheber's superlative Orestes, darkly implacable, and an elegant,
uncaricatured Aegisthus from Reiner Goldberg.
Any lesser voices, exposed thus behind the band, might have been regularly
overwhelmed, for Abbado gave Strauss's score its full head. The Berlin Phil
played superbly; hallucinatory details sprang up from almost every page, and
in the right places the noise was shattering. It was Abbado's relentless
drive, however, that made this a memorable reading: daringly swift as a
whole, but so well paced and long-purposed that it made an unbroken span.
Rivetting, and masterly: book in haste for Easter if you can.
***
At the Deutsche Oper, there was the gentlest of contrasts: Poulenc's
Dialogues des Carmelites, in its first German production in the original
language. As you may remember, it recounts a semi-mythical tale of innocent
Carmelite nuns who were condemned to the guillotine in the last days of the
revolutionary Terror.
In fact the original language was the least of the merits of this staging;
most of the singers sounded well-coached rather than at home in it. The
obvious exception was Rita Gorr, who wields magnificent authority and force
as the dying Prioress; perhaps too John David DeHaan, an intelligent, finely
sung Father-Confessor. Jiri Kout conducted Poulenc's score - a surprising
one to come from him, despite the tender piety he revealed in several
smaller pieces - with impeccable style and sympathy.
Gunter Kramer's production is notable for its starkness and consistency, and
a wealth of interesting, unevenly successful ideas. The stage is almost bare
but for a few chairs and screens, and the cast are in almost-modern dress -
nothing period-picturesque. Mere Marie, the nun who survived to tell the
tale, is constantly present, brooding at the forestage when not involved in
the scene (which she does admirably in the person of Karan Armstrong).
The heroine Blanche de la Force is an aristocratic girl nearly crippled by
pathological fearfulness, who by a cruel irony of fate chooses the Carmelite
order as a safe refuge. In the earlier scenes Kramer lets the pathology
spread to the staging, by way of expressionist emphasis; for a time, we see
the world through Blanche's eyes. Alexandra von der Weth plays her uncannily
well, and sings with touching simplicity and clarity, lacking only the
experience to light up her words. So too with Heidi Person as her best
friend, scatty, charming Constance.
Poulenc's last scene is an outrageous coup, irresistibly harrowing in a
literal production like the Royal Opera's. As they arrive at the scaffold
the sisters sing a long, beautiful Salve Regina - while their voices drop
off one by one as their heads do, just offstage. Kramer makes it painlessly
symbolical: in a close huddle, the singing nuns (twice too many of them)
advance slowly from furthest rear-stage, two or three of them faint dead at
each audible crash of the blade, like flowers dropping from a bouquet. Very
balletic, quite pretty; but our hearts are not wrung.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Arts: Put not your trust in gods - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH HEMMING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Parental neglect, childlessness, rape - these are the themes of the Actors
Touring Company's new production at the Lyric Studio, Hammersmith. Yet this
is not a dour new play by a contemporary playwright, but Euripides' Ion.
Perhaps it is not surprising then that, like its protagonist, Ion is now
suddenly the focus of attention after languishing for aeons. Hard on the
heels of the RSC's production comes this appealing, determinedly playful
staging, which both stands and falls by its rough handling of the play's
modernity.
As well as the striking contemporaneity of the emotional issues it tackles,
Ion has the great appeal of brevity. Euripides dispenses with most of the
story before the play opens, sending Hermes on first to fill us in, so that,
when the action starts, things are just reaching boiling point.
Some years ago, we learn, the god Apollo raped Athens' Queen Kreousa. She,
in shame, left the child to die, but he was rescued by Hermes and allowed to
grow up in Apollo's temple as caretaker. Kreousa, ignorant of her child's
fate, has been unable since to produce an heir for her husband, and so is
eaten away by a double anguish by the time the play opens - just as she and
King Ksouthos arrive at Apollo's temple to appeal for a child. Of course,
they do not know, as we do, that the young man sweeping the steps is in fact
Kreousa's son. And so the stage is set for an evening of ironies and
misunderstandings that nearly, but not quite, end in tragedy.
It has to be said that Apollo comes out of all this pretty badly. In fact,
as absent fathers go, he takes some beating. First he rapes a woman, then he
brings the child up in ignorance as a servant. When he does allow mother and
son to meet again, he introduces such confusion that they almost end up
killing one another. And when all is finally resolved and Kreousa and Ion
beg him to confirm his paternity, he is too much of a coward to show up and
sends his sister Athene instead. As Ion says at one point, if you cannot
trust the gods, who can you trust? But then, perhaps it is the mortals'
haste that throws the god's plan off course; we are left to make up our own
minds.
Nick Philippou's production handles Euripides' scepticism with great relish.
Kenneth McLeish's jaunty, slangy translation keeps the laughs coming and
pinpoints the ironies, while the production is full of funny moments. But
the play's great strength is that its cynicism frames a serious, moving
heart. Euripides writes with raw openness about the pain of childlessness
and his three main characters are driven by yearning. Ion longs for parents,
Ksouthos for a son and Kreousa, through the twists of the plot, suffers both
childlessness and the anguish of having lost a child.
To begin with, Shelley King's elfin faced, passionate Kreousa expresses this
grief well, striding restlessly round the stage and frequently giving vent
to years of suppressed pain. But by the time we reach the central
reconciliation scene between mother and son, she has left herself nowhere to
go. Neither she, nor the production, can change gear fast enough to give
this scene the quiet intensity it deserves and needs to really move you.
This is the price the company pays for its lively production. And there is a
worry too about McLeish's translation: mostly admirably accessible and
witty, it is sometimes so slangy that you feel the production is
unnecessarily intent on convincing you that this is not some dusty old
classic. But it is a staging full of lovely comic touches. Ann Firbank is
delightful as Queen Kreousa's aged nurse, a feisty old party who would
clearly be happier if she could get a transfer to one of the tragedies. 'God
did this. He started it. Burn down his temple,' she says, rubbing her hands
in outrage as she learns of Apollo's shabby behaviour. It is this
affectionately playful tone that is ATC's strongest suit.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Commerzbank yesterday became the first German bank to invest directly in
Poland's financial sector, when it agreed to take a 21 per cent stake in the
Export Development Bank.
The move comes as Dresdner Bank and Banque Nationale de Paris are
establishing a wholly-owned subsidiary in Poland. Deutsche Bank, the other
leading German bank, has a representative office in Warsaw.
The Commerzbank deal, signed in Warsaw by Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, chairman,
represents a DM80m (Dollars 51m) investment and gives the German bank a
local partner to handle its clients in Poland.
Germany accounts for about one-third of Poland's foreign trade. The Export
Development Bank was established in 1986 and handles 9 per cent of the
country's foreign turnover. It reported a 345.1bn zlotys net profit for the
first nine months of this year on a balance sheet worth 12,671bn zlotys
(Dollars 531m). Net profits in the first nine months of last year reached
131.4bn zlotys.
Under the agreement Commerzbank will take up 13.7 per cent of the group's
equity by purchasing a forthcoming new share issue at a minimum price of
425,000 zlotys a share. The remaining equity will be purchased on the Warsaw
bourse, where the bank's stock was trading yesterday at 365,000 zlotys a
share.
Commerzbank has said it will not be increasing its stake in the bank above
the government-imposed 21 per cent ceiling.
Deutsche Bank's bid to enter Poland with a wholly-owned subsidiary is being
delayed by the National Bank of Poland, the central bank, which insists that
newcomers buy into existing banks. The NBP made an exception for Dresdner in
recognition of its role in securing Poland's recent debt reduction
agreement.

Following a board meeting yesterday, IRI said IMI, the bank which is
advising the holding company on the sale, would communicate the December 12
deadline to 'all parties who have expressed concrete interest in the
acquisition'.
Capacity reductions and privatisation were the main conditions imposed on
the Italian industry by EU ministers last year, in exchange for agreeing to
a final injection of state aid for the loss-making producer. IRI has already
agreed the sale of AST, the special steels division of Ilva, for L600bn
(Dollars 37m), to an Italian-German consortium which includes Riva.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Russia in new plea for peace as it masses troops on Chechen
border
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia last night reissued an ultimatum to the
warring factions in Chechnya to stop fighting as Russian troops massed on
the borders of the breakaway Caucasian republic. But he withdrew an earlier
threat to impose a state of emergency in Chechnya, leading to hopes that a
peaceful solution could still be found to the crisis.
A Russian parliamentary delegation, led by Mr Sergei Yushenkov, head of the
defence committee, yesterday held talks with senior Chechen government
officials in the capital, Grozny. Before leaving Moscow, Mr Yushenkov said
his aim was to prove that 'by peaceful means it is possible to attain
greater results than by using force' and to help release up to 70 Russian
fighters who were captured in recent fighting in Chechnya and threatened
with execution.
It is believed that Mr Yushenkov met Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian
prime minister, on Wednesday and received the government's blessing for his
peace mission.
Chechnya, an oil-rich region of 1m on the edge of the Caucasus mountains,
has defied Moscow's will for two centuries, boasting a tradition of fierce
independence.
Despite Mr Yeltsin's ultimatum, fighting continued in Chechnya yesterday
with unidentified aircraft opening fire on a disused airstrip in Grozny
killing at least one person and badly injuring two children. Other aircraft
swooped over the city dropping leaflets urging the Chechen government forces
to lay down their arms.
But President Dzhokhar Dudayev, the Chechen leader, who declared
independence from Moscow three years ago, continued to express defiance
yesterday. Speaking at a press conference in the basement of the
presidential palace, Mr Dudayev read out a letter from demonstrators
demanding that one Russian soldier be killed every time a warplane flew over
Grozny.
According to news agency reports, Mr Shamsedin Yusef, the Chechen foreign
minister, said: 'We will fight until we die. We will go to the grave here.'
Russia has long supported Chechen opposition forces seeking to overthrow Mr
Dudayev but has refrained from direct intervention for fear of becoming
embroiled in a protracted conflict. Chechnya's leaders have promised the
region would become a 'second Afghanistan' if Moscow sent in troops, and
threatened to unleash a terrorist campaign throughout Russia.
Mr Yeltsin has promised decisive measures to resolve the unrest in Chechnya
and ensure the release of the Russian captives, whose plight has touched a
raw public nerve. 'The president shares with all his heart the worries of
the relatives ...of Russian servicemen held in Chechnya,' his press
spokesman said.
Western diplomats in Moscow thought it significant that Mr Yeltsin's
ultimatum omitted the previous threat to declare a state of emergency and
suggested it either signified a toning down of the rhetoric, military
disinformation, or confusion in the president's press department.

FT  02 DEC 94 / US Court ponders congressional term limits: The
constitutional implications of the move to end cosy Washington incumbencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is rarely easy to read the mind and balance of the US Supreme Court. For
90 minutes in a packed court room on Tuesday morning the nine justices were
even more inscrutable as they engaged in oral arguments over what is
probably the most important constitutional case they have agreed to take on
in their current session, and one of the hottest political issues in the
country.
At stake is whether individual states may limit the number of terms their
members of Congress may serve in Washington. The case before the bench
follows an Arkansas referendum in 1992 which voted 60-40 per cent in favour
of ceilings of three two-year terms for members of the House and two
six-year periods for senators.
Term limits are at the top of the conservative populist agenda. Starting
with Colorado in 1990, variations on them have been approved by 22 states,
but no federal law exists and no member of Congress has yet reached the
allotted span. The Republican mid-term election manifesto - the 'Contract
with America' - commits the party to propose a constitutional amendment
making them mandatory. The Clinton administration opposes them.
In agreeing to hear the Arkansas case, the Supreme Court, in effect, took
pre-emptive action. Its final ruling, probably next June, may be based more
on written briefs than oral arguments but, on Tuesday, four lawyers, two
from each side, appeared in front of the bench to make their cases and be
questioned by the justices: in practice they rarely completed more than
three consecutive sentences before finding themselves on the receiving end.
The questioning revealed very little of how the Court might eventually
divide. Every justice except Clarence Thomas spoke. The newest member,
Stephen Breyer, held his fire until towards the end before letting loose a
volley of well-rounded questions. If Antonin Scalia, quick as a cat with his
wit, and John Paul Stevens were the most voluble in their interjections, the
other five, including Chief Justice William Rehnquist, were hardly less
reticent.
A principal duty of the US solicitor general - now the urbane Drew Days - is
to argue cases before the Court and some private lawyers, such as Mr Joel
Klein, currently deputy White House legal counsel, have made careers in this
most daunting of legal environments. This has not been the experience of J
Winston Bryant, the Arkansas attorney general, appearing for term limits. He
seemed a little over-awed by the occasion and the sharp interrogation to
which he was subject.
Much of this centred not on the perceived modern evils of entrenched
incumbent politicians. Instead it focused on what the Founding Fathers -
principally Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, John Adams and Alexander
Hamilton - meant at the constitutional convention of 1787 and subsequently
when they established simple criteria of citizenship, age and residency for
elected officials.
The question most exercising the justices was whether this precluded states
from setting other qualifications. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg
half-suggested that state prerogatives may be limited, in the words of the
constitution, to providing the 'time, place and manner' necessary for fair
elections.
But Justice Breyer, noting one Californian legal precedent, said that if
party membership or a minimum period as a registered independent could be
considered a legitimate qualification for a congressional candidate, then it
logically could follow that term limits were also acceptable.
The term limit lawyers insisted Jefferson envisaged a 'voluntary rotation'
of members of congress. But the other side invoked Madison and Hamilton as
implicitly rejecting term limits because it infringed, in Madison's words,
'the indisputable right of the people to return whom they thought proper'.
The irony of this most important case is that the fault which term limits
are designed to redress - the cosy existence in Washington of incumbent
politicians - has been in good measure remedied by the last two elections.
When the next Congress convenes in January, only about half its membership
will have served six years.
No wonder those that remain, including many Republicans in the Senate, doubt
it is necessary to go further. The Court could settle the matter either way.

FT  02 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Interest rate worries trigger heavy
selling - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The spectre of higher interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic returned
to haunt the UK equity market, almost wiping out the hard won gains in
London that followed the Budget.
Dealers, shocked at the level of selling pressure affecting the market
yesterday, said they expected further weakness if Wall Street showed any
more signs of distress.
Some feared another fall below 3,000 on the FT-SE 100, although strategists
said such a decline would meet strong resistance, pointing out that recent
moves below 3,000 had prompted exceptionally heavy support around 2,980.
The FT-SE 100 retreated 41.8 or 1.3 per cent to 3,039.6. Selling spilled
over into the second liners, depressing the FT-SE Mid 250 Index by 20.2 to
3,477.1.
Much of yesterday's business was linked to another flurry of heavy programme
trades, which tended to exaggerate price changes in many areas. Dealers also
pointed to big shifts as fund manager realigned their sector portfolios in
the wake of the Budget.
Increased fears that UK interest rates may soon increase to choke off
inflationary pressures prompted by excessive economic growth caused the
early damage in London, and these worries were gradually heightened as the
session wore on with the latest economic news from the US. The UK chancellor
is to hold his regular monthly meeting with the Governor of the Bank of
England next Wednesday.
In the US, the National Association of Purchasing Management survey came in
at 61.2 per cent, compared to most forecasts which were below 60 per cent.
US personal incomes also increased sharply.
These figures, following the higher than expected upward revision of US
gross domestic product for the third quarter and a higher than expected
Chicago Purchasing Management index, saw Wall Street lose more than 15
points shortly after it opened. The US market then rallied to 7 down before
falling away again and posting a 25-point loss two hours after London
closed.
All eyes will be sharply focused today on the US employment report. If the
non-farm payroll in the US increases by much more than an expected figure of
around 200,000, dealers fear Wall Street could take another dive. The next
meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee takes place on
December 20, and more evidence of strong growth in the US economy is thought
likely to push the Fed into another rise in rates.
The Footsie opened around two points easier but quickly fell away in the
wake of sustained pressure from the derivatives markets. When a series of
programme trades, some on the sell side and some evenly balanced, hit the
market prices tumbled as marketmakers took evasive action. The biggest of at
least three programmes was said to have been operated by Smith New Court.
There was no let-up in the selling and shares fell to their lowest levels in
mid-afternoon before stabilising in the last hour.
Turnover reached 721.3m shares, the highest for almost two weeks, with
non-Footsie stocks accounting for 54 per cent of the total. Customer
business on Wednesday was worth Pounds 1.38bn.
Only nine of the FT-SE 100 constituents escaped the market sell-off. Hanson
pleased the market with excellent preliminary figures, as did BPB with
interims well above expectations.
Regional electricity stocks outpaced other utilities after Seeboard
fulfilled the market's best expectations in announcing a 21 per cent
increase in the interim dividend.
On the downside, Royal Bank of Scotland came out with sparkling numbers,
including a 25 per cent increase in the dividend, but the shares succumbed
to profit-taking. MEPC disappointed with a rise of only 13 per cent in its
net asset value.

FT  02 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: RBoS profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market appeared to have lost its affection for Royal Bank of Scotland.
Neither a 25 per cent dividend increase nor a doubling of profits was able
to help the share price.
Both the dividend of 13.75p and the profits of Pounds 532m were at the top
of the range of analysts estimates. Nevertheless, the feeling that earnings
from RBoS's insurance arm Direct Line were about to peak saw the shares fall
20 to 400p.
Credit Lyonnais Laing, the leading supporter of the stock, maintained its
comparatively high Pounds 635m profits forecast for the current year and
said 'long term buying from the quality funds' had been offset by short term
trading. It added that, as the stock was the most volatile in the sector, it
was historically the most affected by broad market moves.
Detractors said the bank's premium rating could only be maintained if Direct
Line continued to grow. Mr Rod Barrett of Goldman, who held his current
forecast at Pounds 595m, said: 'Underlying growth out there is not
happening.' Some added that operating profits were disappointing and a large
property revaluation had not been addressed.
The market was disappointed with the net asset valuation from property group
MEPC, which reported full-year profits in line with expectations. The shares
retreated 18 to 385p as analysts downgraded nav figures for the current
year. James Capel cut its nav forecast by 40p to 500p, citing the lack of
significant rental growth and continued high real interest rates. However,
the broker has moved its recommendation to a hold from a sell.
Sentiment in MEPC spread to Hammerson and the shares fell 12 to 314p, and
British Land gave up 8 to 357p. Land Securities tumbled 16 to 576p.
Plumbing specialist Spring Ram was the day's most active stock with 29m
shares - 8 per cent of the equity - traded. The heavy volume rekindled the
inevitable speculation that former chairman Mr Bill Rooney had disposed of
part of his 13.5 per cent stake in the company. The shares remained at 44p
An upbeat interim statement boosted plasterboard specialist BPB Industries
by 2 to 295p and led to a modest amount of profits upgrading by analysts.
UBS edged ahead by Pounds 5m to Pounds 155m for this year and translated
BPB's commitment to a 'progressive' dividend policy into a total 1994-95
payout of 9p, up from 8.1p last time.
Elsewhere among building materials shares, Anglian tumbled 25 to 175p on the
back of weak interim earnings and a warning of lower full-year profits.
There was a mixed reaction to full-year figures from food and drinks group
Grand Metropolitan which brought heavy turnover of 14m as the shares closed
5 lower at 378p.
Rank Organisation was among a handful that managed to resist the poor market
trend. It edged up a half-penny to 412 1/2 p in trade of 4.3m, with a line
of about 1m shares said to have been switched from Granada Group into Rank
as part of programme trading executed on Wednesday evening.
A further boost to sentiment came when Kleinwort Benson reiterated its
positive stance on the stock. Mr Paul Slattery at the securities house
believes: 'The prospects for earnings growth at Rank are double the level
for the market.'
Granada receded 11 1/2 to 510p as uncertainty over the value of its stake in
broadcaster BSkyB continued to overhang sentiment.
Food manufacturer United Biscuits eased only a penny to 316p, after NatWest
Securities advised investors to 'add' to holdings. The securities house
said: 'There are early signs that the measures to improve the group's
competitive position are beginning to pay off.'
Merchant bank Kleinwort Benson improved 8 to 481p in response to its
purchase of a 20 per cent stake in LaSalle Partners, of Chicago.
Singer &amp; Friedlander saw 16m shares traded after institutional investors
bought into the diversified group following the acquisition of broker
Carnegie. Broker BZW argued that the deal was a 'fairly significant
enhancement of earnings'. The shares hardened a penny to 84p.
Health care group AAH fell 48 to 336p after a drop in interim profits and a
projection of a decline in full-year results.
Buyers of utilities continued to chase the regional electricity companies
and water stocks, helping several resist the market slide. Eastern gained 3
at 805p and Scottish Power, which announced a new chief executive, finished
4 ahead at 357p.
The market had discounted the favourable figures and 21 per cent dividend
increase from Seeboard. The shares ended a penny easier at 424p, with
Yamaichi advising investors to switch into Yorkshire, 5 up at 513p, and
Southern, a penny down at 555p.
Engineering group GKN was one of the few Footsie stocks to finish up on the
day, gaining 2 1/2 at 626p in modest 1.2m turnover. There was said to be
switching out of troubled T&amp;N, down a further 6 at 160p.
APV put on 3 at 64p, with the market starting to anticipate the long awaited
restructuring package.
Control Techniques rose 7 to 521p following a bid of 525p a share from US
group Emerson, which moved into the market to boost its stake in the company
to 37.3 per cent.

FT  02 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Buyers move on Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International conglomerate Hanson was one of the few stocks in the Footsie
to hold its head above the waves as optimism over top of the range figures
overcame the pessimism over cyclical stocks. The two-way view on the stock
ensured that it finished the day only 1 3/4 better at 237p, masking
unusually heavy turnover of 20m shares.
Profits of just above Pounds 1bn were boosted by benefits from Quantum, the
chemical arm acquired last year. And Goldman Sachs said the surge in
polyethylene prices would continue to lift earnings. 'Polyethylene has risen
from 28 to 37 cents a pound this year. Every cent adds Dollars 35m to
profits and we expect prices to hit the mid-40s next year,' commented the
house specialist.
The cyclical nature of Hanson's business has been the main drag on the share
price and some long term doubts persist, particularly in the US where
interest rate rise worries are multiplying. But analysts were edging up
forecasts on the back of earnings recovery. Mr Geoff Allum of NatWest
Securities said: 'I would expect the share price to respond to the pick-up
in Hanson's markets following this solid set of figures.' Mr Allum raised
his earnings per share forecast to 18.7p from 17.9p on the basis of company
comments that the tax charge would fall below 25 per cent.

FT  02 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BY JEFFREY BROWN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures came down with a bump, unwinding much of the recent
rally in another session of relatively thin volume, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract stood at 3,041 at the official close, down
52 points. The premium to the cash market was less than two points, or about
half fair value.
Turnover was the same as on Wednesday at 12,828 contracts, so the volume of
selling was not heavy but dealers said sentiment was at times distinctly
negative.
The absence of volume drive was reflected in a wide 48-point trading arc,
with the day's low of 3,036 comparing with the session's peak of 3,086
touched during the early morning.
In late screen-based trading the market took its cue from midsession
weakness on Wall Street, pushing the December contract down to 3,036, with
trading volume rising to in excess of 14,000 lots.
Traded options were active, with turnover reaching 32,365 contracts, against
27,102 on Wednesday, with the bias on the upside and calls outstripping puts
by more than 1,000 lots. FT-SE option trading was 20,557 but with the Euro
FT-SE barely dealt.
HSBC was by far the most active individual stock option with 3,073 lots
transacted. Land Securities and National Power both topped 1,000 contracts
traded.

FT  02 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Further signs of growth
depress Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices fell sharply as interest rate fears resurfaced in the wake
of a week-long barrage of strong economic figures, writes Lisa Bransten in
New York.
Late in the afternoon the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped to show a
48-point loss before picking up to end 38.36 down on the day at 3,700.87.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 4.77 at 448.92, the American SE composite
fell 2.67 to 431.19 and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 9.12 to 740.61. NYSE
volume was 286m shares.
The National Association of Purchasing Managers reported its index of
economic activity for November at 61.2 per cent, the highest level in more
than 10 years. Several other pieces of economic data released yesterday
added to inflation worries. Personal income in October jumped to 1.4 per
cent from 0.6 per cent in September. That was the largest increase in income
since February. Construction spending also rose beyond economists'
expectations, growing 0.9 per cent in October.
Those numbers just added to concern created by a number of indicators out
earlier in the week. Among the most important were an upward revision of
third-quarter gross domestic product and a leap in consumer confidence.
Mr David Shulman, chief equities strategist at securities house Salomon
Brothers, attributed the markets' decline to fears that the Federal Reserve
would tighten monetary policy again. Investors will now place even more
importance on key employment reports due out today, he said.
So far this year the Fed has raised interest rates six times. Ultimately,
the rising rates will erode corporate earnings by deterring borrowing.
The Nasdaq, where high-technology issues make up approximately 10 per cent
of the market capitalisation, was pulled down further than the other indices
by continued market worries about a possible flaw in the Pentium computer
chip designed by Intel. The Nasdaq composite fell 1.2 per cent, compared
with a 1.0 per cent decrease in the Dow.
Dell Computer shed Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 39 3/4 and Gateway 2000 was down
Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 20 1/4 after securities house CS First Boston
lowered its ratings as both companies prepared to deal with consumer
concerns about the Intel chip in some computers. Intel, which also trades on
the Nasdaq, dipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 62 5/8 .
Several NYSE-traded high- technology companies also declined. IBM fell
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 69 5/8 , Digital Equipment was down Dollars 2 3/8
at Dollars 31 5/8 and Compaq Computer receded Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 38
1/4. Hewlett-Packard lost Dollars 3 at Dollars 95 on news that it would
reduce the price of several of its desktop computers.
Chrysler gained ground early in the day after announcing that it would
increase its quarterly dividend by 60 per cent to 40 cents, but was off
Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 47 3/4 by the close. The company's largest
shareholder has been pushing for such a move.
The nation's two largest publicly traded health maintenance organisations
fell after a negative report on a low cost health provider, Kaiser
Permanente, which is not publicly traded. US Healthcare lost Dollars  5/8 at
Dollars 44 1/8 and United Healthcare fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 47.
Canada
Toronto drifted lower in cautious trading amid continu-ing worries about
interest rates and as financial markets awaited today's key US employment
data.
The TSE 300 index closed 11.01 easier at 4,082.40 and falls outpaced rises
by 444 to 254 after volume of 70m shares. Eleven of the 14 sub-group indices
were down, led by communication, real estate, pipeline and conglomerate
stocks. Brazil
Equities in Sao Paulo retreated from the day's peaks to finish a net 0.08
per cent off in moderate trade after prices tested some resistance barriers
but did not find support at higher levels.
Brokers said the afternoon's slide was not related to reports saying that
president-elect Fernando Henrique Cardoso had not confirmed that he had
chosen Pedro Malan, of the central bank, as Brazil's new economy minister.
The Bovespa index, up 2.7 per cent initially, lost 37 points on balance at
46,523. Turnover came to RDollars 261.1m (Dollars 305.4m.
News that the National Development Bank has raised RDollars 33.2m through a
successful sale of Banco do Brasil and Petrobras shares helped early
sentiment.

FT  02 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrage unwinding
reverses Nikkei's recent uptrend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Arbitrage unwinding hurt share prices, and the Nikkei 225 average closed
lower for the first time in four trading days in spite of buying by banks
and dealers, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index was down 62.02 at 19,013.60 after fluctuating between 18,961.79
and 19,111.42. The market fell below the 19,000 level in the morning due to
arbitrage unwinding triggered by a decline in futures. Financial
institutions supported the index, but failed to counter continued
futures-linked selling.
Volume contracted to 270m shares from 335m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks slipped 1.21 to 1,519.20, and the Nikkei 300 edged down 0.34
to 279.74. Losers led gainers by 543 to 482, with 164 issues unchanged. But
in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 2.25 firmer at 1,256.19.
Brokers and corporate investors were also buying in small lots. Overseas
investors, who have been liquidating holdings in steels and shipbuilders,
continued their sales but traders noted that they were purchasing banks and
car shares.
Traders expect arbitrage unwinding to continue through to the December 9
futures settlement. However, the outstanding level of unsettled arbitrage
positions has declined to 690m shares, alleviating fears of a sharp drop in
cash prices ahead of the settlement day.
The steels sector, reflecting the foreign selling, had Nippon Steel, the
day's most active issue, Y10 cheaper at Y374 and NKK Y6 weaker at Y267.
Airlines were lower on profit-taking, All Nippon Airways shedding Y20 to
Y1,090 and Japan Airlines Y10 to Y720.
Banking stocks were higher on position-covering. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank put on
Y40 at Y1,800 and Mitsubishi Bank Y50 at Y2,260.
Toshiba rose Y9 to Y701 on buying by investment trust funds. Other
electricals eased on profit-taking, Sanyo Electric losing Y6 at Y574 and
Hitachi Y2 at Y975.
Privatisation issues were weak, with Japan Tobacco off Y3,000 at Y960,000
and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone losing Y5,000 at Y835,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average was up a slight 0.67 at 21,179.01 in volume of 18m
shares after profit-taking eroded earlier gains. But Nintendo, the video
game maker, ended Y290 stronger at Y5,680 and Ono Pharmaceutical Y120 ahead
at Y4,840.
Roundup
Regional markets moved in divergent directions.
KUALA LUMPUR saw a steady stream of selling triggered by a spate of bearish
market rumours, ranging from programme selling, the redemption of shares by
foreign investors and a private placement of shares. The composite index
closed 27.00 or 2.7 per cent down at 986.13.
Losers included Tenaga and Telekom, which receded 50 cents to MDollars 10.50
and 40 cents to MDollars 18.40 respectively.
Among the day's gainers were shares that were added to the Morgan Stanley
Capital International index. Ekran advanced 25 cents to MDollars 9.15 and
Mycom moved up 22 cents to MDollars 4.80.
SINGAPORE was dragged lower by the fall in Malaysia and on light programme
selling by Hong Kong institutions.
The Straits Times Industrial index lost 12.74 at 2,229.35, off the day's
high of 2,246.21.
Brokers commented that Malaysian shares traded over the counter faced fresh
turbulence, driven by renewed rumours of growing dissent in the ruling Malay
party, UMNO.
MANILA fell 1.7 per cent on the continued weakness of overseas markets and
news that an oil well in the south was not commercially viable.
The composite index slipped 45.83 to 2,645.36 in volume of 5.5m shares worth
1.3bn pesos.
The announcement of 5.9 per cent third-quarter growth came too late to
affect the day's trading.
Selling in oil stocks was brought about by an announcement from the local
division of Occidental Petroleum that it planned to abandon its Bantac-1
well.
SEOUL lost ground in hectic trading after aggressive institutional
profit-taking took its toll, in spite of active foreign buying of blue chips
as the authorities raised the ceiling of foreign ownership of shares by 2
percentage points to 12 per cent. The composite index was finally off 8.20
at 1,066.21.
The Securities Supervisory Board official said foreign investors bought
their traditional favourites - blue chips and shares with low price/earnings
ratios - to their permitted new limit in early trading.
As a result, local investment trusts sought to materialise recent gains in
their holdings of the blue chips.
Both Korea Mobile Telecom and Samsung Electronics went limit down, losing
Won12,000 and Won3,000 to Won499,000 and Won123,400 respectively.
HONG KONG was modestly lower after a solid technical rebound in the morning
evaporated in late trade on declining index futures.
The Hang Seng index fell 35.46 to close at 8,430.80 after jumping to a day's
high of 8,555.26. Turnover dropped to HKDollars 3.0bn from Wednesday's
HKDollars 4.3bn.
Property issues were the hardest hit, with Henderson Land slipping HKDollars
1.10 to HKDollars 40.50, Cheung Kong 40 cents to HKDollars 31.80 and Sun
Hung Kai Properties 20 cents to HKDollars 49.50.
SYDNEY ended higher after recouping earlier losses, led by a recovery in
futures and a gain for BHP. The All Ordinaries index rose 9.7 to 1,900.4,
its best for the day and well off its low of 1,881.2. Trade was moderately
active, with stock valued at ADollars 434m changing hands.
The futures contract was up 14 at 1,904, just below its high for the day of
1,905.
Brokers said that trade was moderate overall, with turnover boosted by a
portfolio transaction of more than ADollars 60m handled by County NatWest
Securities. BHP finished at ADollars 19.06, up 38 cents and well off its low
of ADollars 18.62.
BTR Nylex added 4 cents at ADollars 2.44 following news of a debt for equity
swap and the appointment of a new chief executive.
News Corp weakened 7 cents to ADollars 5.15 on nervousness over possible
moves by the US FCC on a challenge to its ownership of the Fox network.
TAIPEI added 1.3 per cent in modest trade, with rises mainly in state-run
banks boosted by buying from the ruling Nationalist party's investment
divisions ahead of tomorrow's elections.
The weighted index gained 80.33 at 6,444.05, after a 6,471.41 high. Turnover
was TDollars 42.74bn.
Financials, especially state-run banks, led the gains, with Farmers Bank
climbing by its daily 7 per cent limit to TDollars 58.
Textiles moved ahead on polyester filament and nylon filament price rises,
with China Manmade closing limit up at TDollars 37.30 and Hualon 90 cents
higher at TDollars 24.
BANGKOK rose on buying of finance stocks led by local funds. The SET index
was 9.16 ahead at 1,371.60 after touching 1,380.73. Turnover amounted to
Bt7.3bn, compared with Bt3.99bn on Wednesday.
Plastic bag and straw maker Thantawan, which made its debut, closed at
Bt73.50 after peaking at Bt75.
The inflated volume was attributed to trading of the new listing and
large-lot trading in shares of New Imperial Hotel worth a total of Bt2.3bn
because of a change in ownership.
The finance sector was the biggest gainer and the most active, strengthening
2.84 per cent on Bt1.3bn turnover.

FT  02 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (South Africa): Bullion pressures golds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold bullion's late decline past Dollars 380 an ounce sparked further losses
for related Johannesburg shares, and only financial stocks managed to post
significant gains after good results recently and steady prospects for the
sector.
The overall index finished 10.9 lower at 5,745.4, industrials were 8.8
better at 6,907.2 and golds fell 45.6 or 2.3 per cent to 1,928.5.
Some traders said golds were oversold after recent hefty losses, but needed
a spark in the bullion price to bounce from current levels.
A slight easing in the financial rand late in the day offered some support,
with diamond leader De Beers managing to advance over the day for the first
time in a week.
De Beers ended 25 cents firmer at R90, Anglos was R1 weaker at R230 and
Gencor slipped 30 cents to R14.15. Sappi managed a strong R1.25 rise to
R70.75.

FT  02 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Holderbank turns higher after
anti-cartel fines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Further action was seen among cement shares in response to European Union
anti-cartel fines. Switzerland's Holderbank jumped SFr16 to SFr1,045, off a
high of SFr1,070, in reply to a much lower than expected penalty.
The company, which is to appeal, has said the fine would have no bearing on
its forecast for 1994 profits, which calls for a 37 per cent rise to
SFr600m.
In France, Lafarge Coppee dropped FFr14.30 to FFr398.80 amid profit-taking
after Wednesday's 4 per cent advance. The company said the fine would not
change its 1994 outlook. Ciments Francais gave up FFr8.30 to FFr157.90, and
said it would make provision for the fine in its account.
Italy's Italcementi, which has a controlling interest in Ciments Francais
and which tumbled 1.7 per cent on Wednesday, rallied L274 to L10,569.
Italmobiliare, its parent, was L820 higher at L34,500.
MILAN moved ahead 1.2 per cent on the back of the agreement between the
government and unions on pension reform that lifted the threat of a general
strike today. Volume, at below L400bn, remained thin, however, amid worries
that the accord offered no guarantees that promised reforms would be carried
out and that tough decisions had only been postponed. The Comit index rose
7.17 to 632.89.
Credito Italiano appreciated L40 to L1,628 as speculation grew that it would
price its new offer for Credito Romagnolo at around L20,000 a share, below
previous estimates of L21,000 to L23,000. Romagnolo retreated L295 to
L17,369.
AMSTERDAM was slightly weaker, the AEX index slipping 1.22 to 408.18.
In a major review of the market, Smith New Court noted that after two years
of outperformance of cyclicals, the market had been rotating towards
defensive, financial and growth stocks. 'A more selective attitude towards
cyclicals as well as increased emphasis on growth stocks is recommended in
an environment of continued low interest rates.'
Looking forward the broker noted that while there was pressure on cyclicals
it recommended an exposure to those which were least affected by the
inability to pass on raw material and commodity price increases and whose
earnings growth was least likely to surprise on the downside.
These would fall into two categories, said Smith New Court: companies
benefiting from rising commodity prices, such as Hoogovens and DSM, and
those where the large proportion of the expected improvement in earnings was
driven by factors such as cost cutting, for instance Hoogovens, DSM and KLM.
FRANKFURT ended an uninspired session with a slight loss, which widened
fractionally in post-bourse trading. The Dax dipped 1.67 to 2,046.59, and to
2,045.54 in the Ibis.
Turnover reflected the lack of interest, a scant DM4.6bn.
Reviewing the market's performance during November, Mr Eckhard Frahm of
Merck Finck commented that hopes for a year-end rally now looked improbable,
with sentiment getting worse. The Dax index fell just over 1 per cent on the
month and is down nearly 10 per cent since January.
Interest rate-sensitive stocks showed relative strength during both October
and November, he added.
Among those stocks yesterday, Commerzbank was ahead DM2.50 at DM326.30 and
Deutsche Bank DM2.50 higher at DM743.50.
ZURICH was lower in very quiet trade, lacking fresh factors to trade on, and
the SMI index fell 18.9 to 2,576.0.
SMH bearers lost SFr8 at SFr628, after a session's low of SFr612, continuing
a slide prompted by a flurry of downward revisions of earnings forecasts by
analysts who doubted that Christmas sales could compensate for negative
currency effects.
The stock has fallen by 12.3 per cent over the last fortnight, prompting
some analysts to put the shares on hold, viewing the decline as excessive.
PARIS saw slippage and the CAC-40 index ended down 11.99 at 1,963.95.
Turnover was light at just under FFr3.8bn.
It was difficult to discern any particular themes, although the retailing
sector showed a mixed response to disappointing November sales data:
Carrefour rose FFr32 to FFr2,270, while Casino was off FFr5.90 at FFr158.60.
MADRID edged lower as losses elsewhere in Europe brought out sellers. The
general index closed 1.03 easier at 300.53.
Santander Investment commented that Spanish stocks should thrive next year
on expectations of good earnings and relatively stable long-term interest
rates, and forecast that the general index was likely to climb to between
350 and 360 by the end of 1995.
It said smaller cyclical stocks and consumer related shares would outperform
the market in 1995, the former helped by expected strong growth in exports
of goods and services.
ISTANBUL finished at a third consecutive 11-month high in spite of
profit-taking which erased most of the morning gains. Volume of TL6,690bn
was a new record high.
The composite index finished 246.2 or 0.9 per cent stronger at 28,427.24,
taking gains over the last week to 6.5 per cent.
Ms Nur Pekin, Turkish analyst at Schroders, said that the recent strength in
the market, mainly during the past two weeks, had been the result of two
factors: speculation by investors on publicly owned companies which could be
privatised, and a reduction in interest rates which had caused a flight of
capital into equities.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Dollar rises on evidence of strong economic
data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US currency continued its good showing on the foreign exchanges
yesterday, buoyed by the expectation of further interest rate rises, writes
Philip Gawith.
A raft of strong economic data on income, spending and prices lent fuel to
those expecting the Federal Reserve to tighten policy again sooner rather
than later.
The dollar rose to DM1.5770 in European trading, before slipping back to
close in London at DM1.5722, up from DM1.5703 on Wednesday. Against the yen
it finished at Y99.34, from Y98.95. New York trading ended with the dollar
at DM1.5735 and Y99.345.
Sterling also had a good day, with the trade weighted index closing at 80.4,
from 80.2. The pound was little changed against the dollar, at Dollars
1.5672, but ended higher at DM2.4639, from DM2.4578.
Both US and UK interest rate futures have lost ground steadily this week,
discounting ever higher interest rates.
Elsewhere the D-Mark remained fairly weak, with the prospect of a further
cut in interest rates still not ruled out. Mr Helmut Schieber, a Bundesbank
director, said on Wednesday that it was harder to foresee a situation where
German rates could rise than one where they could fall.
The Italian lira firmed to L1,028 against the D-Mark from L1,031 after a
pensions deal between the government and unions saw a planned general strike
called off.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars both continued their recent strength
against the US dollar. The 'Aussie' finished at 76.82 US cents, after
breaking above 77 cents for the first time since March 1992 in Asian
trading. The 'Kiwi' closed at 63 US cents, a level not seen in five years.
The behaviour of Eurodollar contracts in recent days and weeks tells the
story of what markets are expecting for US interest rates. The futures curve
is now discounting three-month rates of 7 per cent in March, 40 basis points
higher than the position at the beginning of the week.
While the prospect of higher interest rates is hitting the bond market, it
appears to be supporting the dollar. For most of the year, the two markets
traded in tandem.
Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan, commented: 'Now
that the interest rate environment is more credible, the dollar is looking
forward to rate hikes.'
Today the focus will be on November US jobs data. A higher than expected
outcome could prompt renewed speculation that the Federal Reserve might
again decide to raise rates after its next policy meeting on December 20.
'Whereas in the past that would have been negative for the dollar, I think
it could be positive now,' added Mr Gunner.
Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS in London, said there
was a lot of interest to buy the dollar, although this was still limited
mostly to short-term interbank traders.
Pointing out that the dollar had risen from DM1.5077 at the end of October,
to around DM1.57 now, he said: 'The market is coming to terms with the fact
that the Fed is prepared to act if the economy is growing at an
unsustainable rate.'
Further evidence of Fed concern about the pace of growth came from Ms Cathy
Minehan, president of the Boston Fed, who said that a tight economy could
prompt price pressures. She added that the economy was 'humming along',
showing 'very strong growth'.
Sterling is also riding higher on the expectation of a rise in interest
rates, buoyed too by the UK's sound economic fundamentals, underlined this
week in the Budget. It has also been helped by the possibility of German
rates falling.
The March short sterling contract settled 10 basis points lower at 92.82.
Analysts said the market remained very nervous about the prospect of higher
interest rates, with speculation that if rates did not rise by 50 basis
points next month, a 75 basis-point increase might be required early in the
new year.
Although Mr John Major's government has shaken off some of its recent woes,
analysts said lingering political uncertainty would make it difficult for
the pound to rise above DM2.47.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 415m of late
assistance, and Pounds 123m at established rates, after forecasting a daily
shortage of Pounds 650m. Three-month LIBOR stayed at 6 1/4 per cent.

FT  02 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices in the main primary markets have often tended to ease this week.
South Africa provides an exception but most Australian and New Zealand wool
sold at lower prices at auctions there. Finer merinos, which led the overall
wool price recovery, have eased more sharply than broader categories.
Clearances were also lower at some Australian sales, and nearly a third of
the Freemantle offering was withdrawn at grower reserves at the final week
of the sale there. Beyond raw wool auctions the major barrier of price
resistances at the retail end remains. There is little business coming
through and company chairmen continue to stress the difficulty in passing on
the considerable wool price rises in an anti-inflationary environment.
Australia's Eastern states market indicator closed at 774c/kg, down from
792c/kg a week before.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Channel Islands company in
Kazakh gold and diamond venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A small company based in the Channel Islands is part of a joint venture that
was yesterday awarded a licence to explore for gold and diamonds in a huge
area of Kazakhstan.
The Moonstone Group, which says it can call on Australian, Bahraini, Swiss
and UK finance and expertise, has joined with Altynalmas, Kazakhstan's gold
and precious stones organisation, to form the Altyn-Tas joint venture. This
has been licenced to explore 56,000 sq km of the Zhambyl region in the
republic's south-western gold belt.
The 50-50 joint venture will also build a gold bullion plant at the Akbakai
mine in the region and introduce bacterial leaching technology into the
country to help treat difficult ores, particularly those containing arsenic.
The joint venturers will start in a modest way. Mr Yannic Mercier, chairman
of Moonstone and who shares chairmanship of the joint venture with Mr
Abdrakhman Begalinov, president of Altynalmas, said the licence agreement
commits A-T to spending a minimum of USDollars 2m annually on exploration
for five years. However, it also gives the joint venturers the right to mine
any gold and diamond reserves they discover. A-T will also provide Dollars
3.7m towards the cost of the gold plant at Akbakai, a facility designed by
the Western Australian company, Signet Engineering, whose founder, Mr Tom
Duckworth, is an A-T director.
Moonstone owns 22 per cent of BacTech (Australia) which uses bioleaching
technology first developed in the chemistry department of King's College,
London. Moonstone has exclusive rights to the use of the BacTech process in
the Commonwealth of Independent States.
The first commercial application of BacTech started recently at Gold Mines
of Australia's Youanmi Deeps mine near Mt Magnet in Western Australia.
Mr Mercier said the Russian Ministry of Geology had spent about USDollars
22m during the past 30 years to map the Zhambyl region so that its its
mineral resources could be evaluated.
Kazkhstan is welcoming foreign capital for its mining industry because it
aims to increase gold output substantially. Altynalmas's Mr Begalinov said
earlier this year that his government wanted to lift annual output from
about 14 tonnes to between 42 and 56 tonnes very quickly to build reserves
to back the country's new currency.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Commodity fund seeks uses for
unwanted support money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Common Fund for Commodities is to draw up proposals for a programme of
technical assistance to aid commodity producers to trade their wares
efficiently. The move follows strong pressure on the Amsterdam-based fund to
find a good use for some Dollars 20m, left untouched because it is earmarked
for commodity price support operations that have never materialised.
Australia, Canada and New Zealand have withdrawn from the fund and others
have threatened to follow suit if a solution is not found soon.
At its annual governing council meeting earlier this week, the fund's 105
members agreed to prepare a technical assistance programme that would enable
commodity producers to take better advantage of new trading opportunities
opened up by the Uruguay Round global trade accords.
Mr Bruno de Vuyst, council secretary, says the focus will be on helping
countries to organise efficient national and regional commodity exchanges,
improving warehousing and advising on relevant legislation.
Fund members also agreed this week to come up with new ideas for employing
the Dollars 71m of capital contributions in the so-called 'first account',
including possible amendment of the 1980 treaty setting up the fund. This
requires the surplus income from the first account (after covering Dollars
3m-a-year administrative costs) to be used for loans to cover buffer stock
operations.
Since the treaty was signed, price stabilisation accords have fallen out of
favour. Only one commodity pact with buffer stock arrangements - on natural
rubber - now remains and its members have shown no interest in using 'first
account' resources.
The fund, which began operations in 1989, has also come under fire for the
slow start of its 'second account' programme, which uses voluntary
contributions from donors to help finance commodity development projects.
However, 27 projects worth Dollars 60m have now been approved (21 of them in
the past two years) with the fund contributing Dollars 23.6m. The remaining
cash has been raised from other national and international organisations.
In a less encouraging development, the governing board failed this week to
elect a new managing director after votes split equally between the two
leading candidates, Mr Dany Ghekiere of Belgium and Mr Ernest Leung of the
Philippines.
The present managing director, Mr Budi Hartantyo of Indonesia, is to serve
for a further year while countries come up with fresh nominations.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Silver price plunges below
Dollars 5 an ounce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Silver yesterday plunged below the psychologically-important Dollars 5 a
troy ounce level, giving a salutary warning about what can happen when
investment funds, having driven metal prices up with a buying spree, decide
to quit the market.
Taking its cue from an overnight slump in New York, silver closed in London
at Dollars 4.90 1/2 , its lowest since January. It had lost 17 cents or more
than 3 per cent of its value in one day.
Analysts suggested that the sudden drop was another phase in the funds'
recent involvement in the market. This started in the early months of 1994
when, encouraged by suggestions that supply and demand for silver was coming
back into balance, speculative funds bought futures and physical silver
heavily.
It was said they were targetting at least Dollars 7 an ounce. In the event
they were not able to breach Dollars 6, but the spot price for silver - used
mainly in photographic papers - averaged Dollars 5.38 an ounce in the first
nine months compared with Dollars 4.19 in the same period of 1993.
The key elements keeping prices down in the face of the funds' splurge were
selling by producers when the price went above Dollars 5.50 and the
price-sensitivity of buyers in India, the biggest silver investment market.
The CRU International consultancy group estimates that in the first nine
months silver imports to India fell from 2,000 tonnes last year to 1,150
tonnes, a drop of 42.5 per cent.
Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at Merrill Lynch, pointed out that the investment
funds had not only been unwinding their paper positions in recent weeks but
also selling physical metal. New York Commodity Exchange stocks had risen by
14 per cent to 265.7m ounces in the third quarter. This made the market
vulnerable to concerted selling, particularly from funds that rely on
computer-based trading.
Mr George Milling-Stanley of Lehman Brothers also said the fundamental
picture suggested silver should not go much lower and a price of Dollars
4.90 was reasonable. However, 'the funds showed when they drove silver up
towards Dollars 6 that they can overcome the fundamentals for a time and if
they continue to sell short they could send it lower'.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian crop loss estimate
raised to 54%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's winter crop production is now expected to fall by 54 per cent
over last year's level as a result of the severe drought in Queensland and
New South Wales. The drought is also forecast to slice ADollars 2.9bn of
national income generally, equivalent to a 0.7 percentage point reduction in
the economic growth rate.
The new estimates, released by Senator Bob Collins, Australia's primary
industries minister, represent yet another increase in the forecast impact
of the weather conditions on the nation's rural production and the overall
economy.
Previously, the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics had
suggested that the drought would clip national income in 1994-95 by ADollars
2bn. It had also forecast that the winter crop yield would be around 17m
tonnes. The new number is 13m tonnes, compared with 28m tonnes in 1993-94.
Senator Collins added that the wheat crop was now expected to fall by 50 per
cent, to its lowest level since 1972. In its last quarterly crop report,
Abare had previously suggested a 38 per cent fall, to 10.4m tonnes. The
minister also said that the Bureau of Meteorology was forecasting that the
drought would persist until the end of the year at least, followed by poor
and late summer rains.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Europe bids farewell to beef
'mountains'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intervention buying of meat by the European Union, which led to the creation
of the infamous beef 'mountains', should virtually disappear in future, Mr
Roelof Bennink, head of the European Commission's beef and sheepmeat
division, said yesterday.
'Intervention will be used in future as little as possible. Its role as a
market support measure has been considerably reduced and support is now
given by premium payments to farmers,' he told a meat policy conference
organised by Agra Europe.
But Mr Bennink also said that EU beef production would have to fall by
between 300,000 and 400,000 tonnes by 2000 to fit in with the requirements
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Gatt limits the amount of
subsidised beef exports from the EU to 817,000 tonnes, compared with
traditional levels of exports of around 1.1m tonnes.
Beef stocks held in intervention stores have fallen dramatically to 100,000
tonnes from just over 1m tonnes a year ago. Mr Bennink said that today marks
the end of a year in which no additional beef has been bought for
intervention.
Intervention buying has traditionally acted as a safety net for farmers by
soaking up excess supply and maintaining internal EU prices at levels higher
than the world market. But reform of the common agricultural policy has
progressively reduced the price at which stocks can be bought, compensating
farmers by direct premium payments.
Mr Bennink said the drop in EU beef production in the past two years
probably had more to do with increases in productivity by dairy cows than
CAP reform. Cow numbers dropped from 33m to 32m as each animal produced more
milk: this led to a reduction in the number of beef calves.
At the same time, imports from eastern Europe had been restricted to 425,000
animals and the absorption of more beef from the reunified of Germany has
been completed.
Mr Bennink believed there would be a rise in beef output of only 1 or 2 per
cent next year; there were not enough cows to produce dramatic increases.
He said it was too soon to determine whether CAP reform would result in the
necessary reduction in beef production to accommodate Gatt but said the
commission would take additional steps if required.
Mr Rene Laporte, chairman of the French meat traders' federation, called on
the commission to re-direct EU beef exports to lucrative markets in
South-east Asia, such as Japan and Korea, and the US, instead of countries
with limited means of payment such as the former Soviet Union, eastern
Europe and north Africa.
'The EU cannot neglect these markets and still call itself an important
player in the world market,' he said.
Mr Brian Revell, senior economist at the Scottish Agricultural College, said
the drop in EU subsidised beef exports would relieve pressure on world
prices under Gatt. But EU poultry prices would fall by more than beef
because of cheaper grain, which would cause a drop in EU beef consumption.
That meant the EU would need to import less beef while maintaining exports.
Mr Bennink said it was important to try to maintain a balance between
different meat prices so that beef would not be allowed to rise to more than
double the poultry price.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Property: Manhattan pick-me-up - Is the construction cycle
turning?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cranes are a rare sight in Manhattan these days. No new office buildings
have been started in several years. None has been completed this year, and
there were only two completions last year. But in 12 months, the long metal
arms may once again begin to claw their way between the towers of midtown.
Is Manhattan ready for new office construction? The first big hole in the
ground could come courtesy of Mr Howard Ronson, cousin of UK businessman Mr
Gerald Ronson, who is proposing to construct an 800,000 sq ft tower on a
site between Madison and Park avenues. After their experience of the 1980s,
lenders are said to be holding back on the project finance until enough
prospective tenants have signed up. Is the construction cycle turning?
After the beating the rental market took in the 1980s, there are signs that
the sector is picking up - in midtown, at least. While the downtown office
market, with a vacancy rate of more than 20 per cent, still faces some acute
problems, the overall vacancy rate in Manhattan's bigger and more active
office market has been edging down since last year, and now stands at about
12 per cent. Also, rents are showing signs of picking up from the bottom
they touched during 1992 and last year.
These turnrounds hardly look significant. As the accompanying charts
indicate, there is plenty of lost ground to make up after the slide in rents
since the start of the decade, and much of the new office space that came on
the market at the end of the 1980s has yet to absorbed. But these overall
figures do not tell the full story.
First, space. 'The headline (vacancy) rate still looks comparatively high,'
says Mr Murray Keith, managing director of Baring Advisors, the real estate
arm of Barings, the investment banking group. 'But quality space of over
50,000 sq ft is getting difficult to find.'
That is a sentiment echoed by most other real estate professionals in New
York this year. Manhattan's archetypal tenant - a bank looking for
high-quality space with ample room for large trading floors - is
experiencing increasing difficulty in finding the right accommodation.
The headline figures on rents also tell only a small part of the story. More
important than changes in basic rent levels in the past 18 months has been a
steep fall in the concessions that landlords have had to offer to attract
tenants, says Mr Josh Kuriloff, a director of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, a New
York real estate company. Rent-free grace periods have fallen from an
average of 12-18 months to 6-12 months, he adds. Also, the money landlords
need to spend on construction or improvements before a tenant moves in has
fallen from about Dollars 50-Dollars 60 a sq ft to Dollars 30-Dollars 40.
It is not difficult to see what lies behind these trends. New York city's
economy is still emerging fitfully from recession. The number of jobs
available, for example, only began to increase this year. The financial
services industry, however, has been enjoying a heady period. Many of the
new tenants of recent months have been banks expanding or shifting part or
all of their operations to new premises as their old leases expire
(including Bear Stearns, S G Warburg) Tenants can often move to superior
quality space in better locations at less rent than under old leases signed
during the boom years in the 1980s.
What of demand for midtown office space in 1995 and beyond? The investment
banking industry, for one, is just entering a period of uncertainty. Few
expect an early return to the soaring financial markets of 1993. That has a
knock-on effect on demand for accountants, lawyers and other associated
services.
At the same time, some financial services businesses - including Swiss Bank
Corp and MasterCard - are planning to move most of their business out of
Manhattan altogether. SBC is drawn by the prospect of purpose-built trading
floors in relatively low-cost Stamford, Connecticut. Such plans stir
memories of the 1980s, when New York lost companies such as Exxon, Mobil and
J C Penney - though some other financial companies which have talked of
leaving in recent years have decided to stay, often after extracting tax
concessions from the city.
All of this suggests that demand is unlikely to soar. And in the background
is the threat that US companies will continue to shrink their overall need
for office space, finding better or more efficient ways of running their
operations (aided by advances in information technology).
With these cautions, it seems that demand is set to remain steady for the
foreseeable future - while supply, in the shape of Mr Ronson's development
and others, will take time to hit the market. That implies a further firming
of rents, though nothing significant.
The investment market, meanwhile, has been gathering its own head of steam.
With few big properties on the market, prices for those that are being sold
have climbed. Bertelsmann, the German publishing group, bought 1540 Broadway
in 1992 for less than Dollars 150 a sq ft, the first big transaction of the
decade. Since then, prices have risen past Dollars 200 a sq ft - the price
paid for an IBM building earlier this year - to touch Dollars 250 (near the
level reached for the Metropolitan Tower and, more recently, a small 80,000
sq ft building on Fifth Avenue owned by the UK's National Westminster bank).
The last time prices hit Dollars 250 a sq ft was in 1989, says Mr Woody
Heller, director of investment sales at surveyor Jones Lang Wooton USA.
The Chase Manhattan building at 410 Park, which is being sold throug JLW, is
probably the only midtown property of any size to have come onto the market
recently. This year, there have been 15 sales, compared with 13 last year
and 12 in 1992, says Mr Heller.
This is a long way from the frenzy of the mid-1980s. And while the real
estate market bubbles with talk of an influx of south-eastern investors  -
mainly from Hong Kong - it is notably less frenetic than the last eastern
invasion, from Japan, during the 1980s. The greatest symbol of that era, the
Rockefeller Centre, 80 per cent of which was bought by Mitsubishi in the
mid-1980s, faces an uncertain future. Mitsubishi warned last month that it
may not pay the interest on the Dollars 1.3bn mortgage on the property. And
if Mitsubishi eventually sells, says one investment manager, then it could
provide an excuse for other Japanese owners to retreat as well.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rebound ahead of employment
report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After posting declines earlier in the session, US Treasury prices rebounded
to opening levels late yesterday as market participants awaited today's key
employment report.
At 4pm the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/32 at 94 9/32 ,
yielding 8.000 per cent, and the two-year note was  1/16 lower at 99 21/32 ,
yielding 7.421 per cent.
Afternoon trading was light as investors held their positions in advance of
today's announcement of November non-farm payroll and employment rates.
Earlier in the day, strong economic signals pushed prices down moderately.
The National Association of Purchasing Managers reported its index up 61.2
per cent for November from 59.7 per cent in October, the highest increase in
more than 10 years. Still, the number was not strikingly out of line with
expectations.
The sub-index of prices paid for manufacturing materials fell slightly in
November, but the decrease was largely attributed to seasonal factors.
The decrease, however, bolstered the dollar, which rallied against both the
Japanese yen and the D-Mark.
A stronger dollar helps bonds by encouraging foreign investors to maintain
their holdings.
The market paid little attention to economic data released earlier showing a
larger than expected increase in personal income and a moderate rise in
construction expenditure.
UK gilts drifted slightly lower as investors searched in vain for a strong
lead from the US. Analysts said the market was waiting for the US non-farm
payroll figure today.
The December long gilt future moved down  1/16 to trade around 103 1/32 .
The yield spread over bunds was around 129.
Mr Nigel Richardson at Yamaichi said gilts were positioned to rise. He said
the issue of tap stock by the Bank of England on Monday had been interpreted
as a signal that the Budget would be good for gilts.
In the event, the Budget had been interpreted cynically by the market, and
investors were worried about future tax cuts, inaccurate growth forecasts
and that the Labour party would be in power during the period covered by
current forecasts of government spending.
However, Mr Richardson thought that even if taxes were cut next year, that
would be unlikely to upset gilts too much. Even if forecasts were incorrect,
the public sector borrowing requirement was likely to remain below 3 per
cent of GDP and a Labour government would be unlikely to take spending above
that level.
German bunds drifted in slow trading. The December bund futures contract on
Liffe ended at 91.23, up 0.01.
Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a Bundesbank council member, said the bank remained
concerned at the rise in producer prices. Ms Jane Berryman at Technical Data
said: 'Evidence continues to mount that German authorities have little if no
scope to loosen monetary policy any further.'
The Italian market out-performed others yesterday as investors took cheer
from agreement on pensions reform. The December bond futures contract on
Liffe ended at 101.87, up 0.27. But Mr Pio de Gregorio at NatWest Markets
said: 'The watering down of the (pensions) reform . . . increases the
likelihood that the government will have to resort to a supplementary
package sometime next year if the deficit target is to be met.'

FT  02 DEC 94 / International Bonds: Short-dated sector sees further
offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continued strong demand for short-dated paper prompted further eurobond
issuance in the three- to five-year area yesterday.
Bayerische Landesbank and Bayerische Vereinsbank Overseas Finance launched
three-and four-year offerings respectively in the US dollar sector. The
Australian dollar sector saw two deals in three- and five-year maturities.
This continues a trend of recent weeks, during which there has been a flood
of short-dated issues as borrowers have moved to exploit a surge in demand
from European retail investors.
Activity has been at its most intense in the dollar sector, with investors -
most notably Swiss - attracted by yields of around 7.8 per cent, which
compare favourably with 10-year yields of around 7.9 per cent.
'With US inflation at around 2.6 per cent, this implies a very attractive
real yield of more than 5 per cent,' said one dealer. 'There is very little
incentive for investors to go further along the yield curve and demand is
high,' he added.
However, 'the supply at the short-end has now started to get to the point
where it is overwhelming demand,' another dealer warned.
Bayerische Landesbank's Dollars 200m offering, priced to yield 15 basis
points over US Treasuries, was prompted by the success of its Dollars 300m
issue of three-year bonds launched last week, book-runner Lehman Brothers
said.
Yesterday's offering drew similar demand from European retail investors and
investors in Asia, it added.
Bayerische Vereinsbank's Dollars 200m offering, similarly priced at 15 basis
points over US Treasuries, will be taken up by Swiss retail investors over
the coming days, in spite of difficult market conditions yesterday, said
lead manager SBC.
In the Australian dollar sector, Commerzbank Overseas Finance launched a
ADollars 125m issue of five-year bonds, offering a coupon of 10.5 per cent,
which met demand from Swiss, German and Benelux retail investors, lead
manager Hambros said.
Caja de Madrid, Spain's second largest savings bank, is to make its debut in
the eurobond markets next week with a Dollars 200m offering of three-year
floating-rate notes, according to JP Morgan.
Pakistan is reported to be close to taking its first step in the
international bond markets with a eurodollar offering of around Dollars
200m. Market sources said Bear Stearns had been mandated to lead the
offering, which could come soon after Pakistan completes a series of
roadshows at the end of next week.

FT  02 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Loan for Sweden more than 60%
oversubscribed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Underwriting for the tightly- priced Dollars 5bn syndicated loan for Sweden
has been oversubscribed by more than 60 per cent.
The Swedish government asked JP Morgan, the investment bank, to arrange a
syndicate of banks to underwrite a total of Dollars 5bn. Pricing on the loan
was set at 8 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor).
The 27 banks in the syndicate offered to underwrite a total of Dollars
8.1bn, JP Morgan announced yesterday.
The lead underwriters are ABN Amro, Bank of Tokyo, Paribas, Barclays,
Bayerische, BBL, BNP, Citibank, Commerzbank, Credit Suisse, Dai-Ichi Kangyo,
Dresdner, Fuji, IBJ, Midland, Mitsubishi, Morgan Guaranty, NatWest,
Nordbanken, Sakura, Enskilda, Societe Generale, Sumitomo, Svenska, Swedbank,
SBC and WestLB.
A FFr2bn syndicated loan for Cerus, which is part of the De Benedetti
empire, has been launched into general syndication. Arrangers for the
revolving credit, priced at 50 basis points over Libor, are BNP, Indo-Suez
and UBS. The loan has a commitment fee of 25 basis points and is secured on
shares in Valeo, the automotive component group.
A DM100m loan arranged by Chemical Bank for Veitsiluoto, the Finnish pulp
and paper group, has been increased to DM150m after being oversubscribed.

FT  02 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Investment grade rating
restored to India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India has regained an investment grade rating on bonds it sells to
international investors, which could widen the pool of potential buyers and
help cut borrowing costs.
Moody's Investors Service, the US rating agency, yesterday raised the debt
rating of India's foreign currency debt to Baa3, the lowest investment
grade, from Ba2.
India's bond ratings were downgraded in 1991 as a result of financial
difficulties.
Standard &amp; Poor's, another leading US credit rating agency, continues to
rate the country's long-term debt at BB plus, just below investment grade
status.
Announcing the increase, Moody's said the move was justified by the success
of the government's structural adjustment programme.
'Basically, the reform process has been developing steadily for a long
time,' explained Mr David Levey, managing director of sovereign risk at
Moody's. 'We are seeing significant benefits for economic growth and
efficiency.
'Reserves have increased and there has been substantial inflows of equity
and direct investment,' he added. 'There has been a turning point in the
psychology of the country.'
The increased rating directly affects eurobonds issued by the Oil and
Natural Gas Corporation, which are fully guaranteed by the republic. In
addition it could indirectly help local companies raise capital on the
international debt markets and could increase the number of institutional
investors prepared to buy Indian company shares.

FT  02 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Russian bank files for ADR
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AvtoVAZbank, a regional Russian bank owned by AvtoVAZ, the country's biggest
motor company, has filed an application to issue American depositary
receipts.
The company is the first from Russia to make such an application, although
two bigger companies - Lukoil, the oil company, and United Energy Systems of
Russia, an electric power company - are expected to follow suit in the next
few months. Other Russian companies, including Gazprom, the big gas company,
are also planning issues.
AvtoVAZbank is filing to issue so-called 'level one' depositary receipts,
which means it has to meet less stringent disclosure standards than those
typically associated with formal US stock listings. In addition, it need not
file accounts according to standard US principles.
The paper does not allow it to raise new capital in the US but the ADRs,
backed by existing shares, can be traded there.
New capital could be raised either through a full listing of shares or
through a private placement of ADRs under the Securities and Exchange
Commission's rule 144a.
'This is very much a first step,' says Mr Christopher Kearns of the Bank of
New York, which will issue the ADRs and hold the Russian stock in its name.
He expects both Lukoil and UES to have ADRs in place in the first quarter of
1995.
'Many companies have ambitious long-term goals. Many have large capital
needs which they see will only be satisfied outside of Russia,' he added.

Bukaka Teknik Utama, an Indonesian engineering company, is to sell 40m
shares at Rp3,500 each in an initial public offering (IPO) this month.
Bukaka said half the capital raised would finance expansion and the rest to
repay debts.
To date, 80 per cent of the company's products and services, which include
power transmission towers, passenger boarding bridges for airports and
coal-handling systems, are sold to Indonesia's public sector.
In 1992 Bukaka exported its first passenger boarding bridge and since then
it has sold bridges to airports in Japan, Thailand and Singapore.
Mr Sadel Muhammad, president and chief executive officer, said that Bukaka
would continue to target Asia-Pacific economies and step up exports of oil
and gas equipment, transmission towers and bulk-handling systems.
Bukaka's net profit last year was Rp9.1bn (Dollars 4.2m) on sales of
Rp151bn.
This year the company expects a net profit of Rp15.4bn.

<TEXT>
Pohang Iron and Steel Co (Posco), South Korea's largest steelmaker, plans to
list on the London and Hong Kong stock exchanges in 1995, following this
year's listing on the New York Stock Exchange, writes Our Financial Staff.
Posco's listing in New York was the first by a South Korean company.
A company spokesman said Psoco's crude steel production was expected to rise
to 22.68m tonnes next year from 22.07m this year.
It expects net profit to rise 13 per cent to Won332.3bn (Dollars 418.2m) in
calendar 1994 from Won294.6bn, and sales to rise to Won7,310bn from Won
6,920bn last year. The spokesman said: 'Our plan for 1995 calls for a net
profit of Won340bn on sales of Won7,350bn.'
The company plans to spend about Won3,000bn next year, about double this
year's amount, to upgrade and expand production facilities.
In October, Korea Electric Power became the country's second company to list
on the New York Stock Exchange, raising about Dollars 300m in a global
equity offering of 14.9m American depositary shares.

equipment maker
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), the Swiss-Swedish power group, has taken a 4.5 per
cent stake in Harbin Power Equipment Company, a former China state-owned
enterprise which is in the process of listing in Hong Kong.
ABB is buying 21.6m shares at HKDollars 2.58 each, for a total of HKDollars
55.73m (USDollars 7.2m). The pricing puts the stock on a price/earnings
multiple of 12.15 times 1995 earnings, according to SG Warburg Securities
(Far East), lead manager of the offering.
In total, Harbin is raising HKDollars 1.24bn by selling off 40 per cent of
its enlarged capital. Of the 480m shares issued, 408m shares are being
placed privately and the remainder will be sold to the public in Hong Kong.
Although a relative latecomer to the China market, ABB has been aggressively
gearing up its mainland expansion plans in the past two years and is
shifting its regional headquarters to Beijing from Hong Kong.
The Chinese government's reluctance to see a pillar industry like power fall
into the hands of foreign companies has made it tougher for such companies
to build China operations than, for example, their consumer goods peers.
Harbin Power Equipment, the biggest manufacturer of power generating sets in
China, is expected to receive a relatively warm reception when trading
starts on December 19.
Compared with the recently-listed Dongfang Electrical, which also makes
generators, Harbin scores a premium on both technology and production. It is
also cheaper, with Dongfang trading on a p/e of 14 times.
However, Harbin comes to market at a time when sentiment is poor and the
power sector remains clouded by uncertainties over the level of return
foreigners will be able to achieve.

FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: Rembrandt hit by mining
write-down
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rembrandt Group, the tobacco-based conglomerate controlled by South Africa's
Rupert family, has reported a fall in net income to R508m (Dollars 143m) for
the six months to September, down from R531m a year ago.
The main reason for the drop was an extraordinary item of R114.3m, which
represents the group's share of the write-down by mining house Gold Fields
in its troubled platinum subsidiary, Northam Platinum.
Its figures were also hurt by the decision not to equity account its
interests in the unbundled components of the Gencor group, Engen, Malbak and
Sappi, and its share of losses due to the start-up costs of cellular phone
network Vodacom. However, dividends from these companies were included as
investment income.
In spite of this, operating income rose to R548m from R533m, while tax paid
dropped to R189m from R212m. However, a rise in debt to R936m from R354m,
led to higher interest paid at R45m, against R24m previously.
Turnover, comprising sales, fees, rental and investment income, rose to
R2.48bn from R2.23bn and an interim dividend of 19.6 cents, up from 17.04
cents, was declared.
The company gave no breakdown of performance by units, but analysts estimate
that the contribution of tobacco, where the company has 60 per cent of the
local market, may have been hit by higher tobacco taxes.

FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: Montedison's rehabilitation
moves a step further - The Italian group is focusing on implementing the
industrial part of its rescue plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month, Mr Stefano Meloni, a senior executive at Montedison, told Les
Echos, the French business newspaper, that the Italian industrial company
and its parent, Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), were destined to rejoin the
Milan stock exchange's small band of blue-chip stocks.
Only a year earlier, the Ferruzzi-Montedison group came within four and a
half hours of a very different fate: a bankruptcy filing, followed by
ignominious break-up and sale.
The team brought in last June to rescue Ferruzzi-Montedison has talked
little, outside shareholder meetings, about how this recovery is being
achieved. When they do talk, it is in clipped understatements. In last
year's annual report for Ferfin, Mr Guido Rossi, now chairman of both
companies, described 1993 simply as 'a year full of events'.
Given the group's recent history, such discretion is understandable. In the
late 1980s, under the flamboyant chairmanship of Mr Raul Gardini, who
committed suicide last year while under investigation for corruption, the
group invested in television, newspapers, yacht-builders, property and
objets d'art, and was often in the headlines.
This extravagance, coupled with corruption and alleged mismanagement, helped
bring Ferfin and Montedison to their knees. By the end of June 1993, the two
companies were labouring under a burden of gross debt which topped L30,000bn
(Dollars 18bn). They have survived the last year due mainly to the
willingness of most of the group's bank creditors to reschedule debt, cancel
1993 interest income and underwrite 'rescue' rights issues, converting debt
into equity.
By June of this year, net debt at Ferruzzi-Montedison had fallen to just
over L18,000bn, following the capital-raising and a continuing asset sales,
which have contributed more than L2,300bn towards a target of L7,000bn for
disposals.
That Ferruzzi-Montedison was saved does not seem so surprising now. It was,
after all, the second largest listed industrial group in the country, and
the political implications of bankruptcy would have been enormous.
It was not clear until the last moment, however, whether Mediobanca, the
Milan merchant bank advising Ferruzzi-Montedison, could cajole enough
creditor banks to sign up to the programme.
Although the debt restructuring has been the focus of attention, staff at
the group's regal Milan headquarters (for sale, like many of the company's
property assets), know Ferruzzi-Montedison must now consolidate its
position. That means implementing the ambitious industrial part of the
rescue plan contained in the four slim green paperbacks - the road-map to
the group's future.
This is the main task of Mr Rossi, a company law expert and former head of
Consob, the Italian stock exchange watchdog, and Mr Enrico Bondi, former
managing director of Gilardini, a Fiat unit, who joined the group as
managing director at the same time.
The industrial part of the plan is founded on three main pillars within
Montedison - the agro-industrial side, represented by Eridania Beghin-Say,
the quoted French subsidiary, chemicals (Montecatini) and energy (Edison).
The plan also envisages Ferfin retaining its 30 per cent stake in Fondiaria,
one of Italy's leading insurers, even if market speculation suggests a sale
is possible.
More than 61 per cent of the L5,900bn of investment envisaged over the four
years of the plan will be spent on developing capacity, 29 per cent on
renewing plant and most of the rest on environmental improvements. As the
biggest contributor to turnover, the agro-industrial business will receive
the largest share of investment.
Agro-industry also provides the stable basis on which to expand the energy
and chemicals arms of the business. Defence against cyclical recession is
one reason why the group says it has stuck together as an unfashionable
multinational conglomerate, rather than splitting into three or four
smaller, more vulnerable units.
In certain areas, the group may even be doing better than the plan's
forecasts. For example, a surge in the price of polypropylene - an area in
which Montedison is the world leader - has helped the chemicals sector. US
regulatory approval for Montell, the polypropylene joint venture with Royal
Dutch/Shell, would provide a further morale boost for the company, and rid
Montedison of more debt.
By 1997, the group also hopes to double turnover at Edison, Italy's biggest
private electricity producer, and may also benefit from the privatisation of
the state company, Enel, which will have to sell off parts of its production
capacity in the next three to four years.
If enough progress is made, the group is also likely to consider further
expansion, by acquisition, and growth in new geographic markets, such as
China.
Analysts admit they are impressed by the new team's work, although they
believe some of the group's forecasts - particularly on Edison's development
 -could be over-ambitious. However, Ferfin and Montedison are showing the
benefits of the work put in by Mr Rossi, Mr Bondi and other new managers.
Both companies returned to pre-tax profit in the first half of this year.
The apparent success of the programme is raising questions about the future
structure of the whole group. Investors have begun to wonder whether the
Ferfin holding company might merge with Montedison once once the main
outstanding asset sales have been achieved.
Ferfin's rights issues at the beginning of the year were almost entirely
underwritten by creditor banks, which have seen the share price tumble from
around L1,800 to about L1,300 now.
Apart from Serafino Ferruzzi, the troubled Ferruzzi family holding company,
the top five shareholders in Ferfin are Italian banks.
Montedison's share register, by contrast, includes a spread of investment
funds which subscribed to the rights issue. Over the same period, Montedison
shares have risen from about L960 to more than L1,160.
Ferfin and Montedison may already answer with one voice, and share the same
chairman and managing director, but in the last month they have formally
denied rumours of an imminent merger. It is not, the companies patiently
explain, in the plan.

FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: Borden to discuss rival suitor's
plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Borden, the troubled US food group that has agreed to a Dollars 2bn takeover
by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street investment firm, yesterday
agreed to discuss an offer from a rival suitor, Mr Paul Kazarian.
The company said it would meet Mr Kazarian on Sunday to hear more about his
plan to arrange a restructuring of Borden that would involve buying back 30
per cent of its stock at Dollars 17 a share. That figure represents a
significant premium to the KKR offer of Dollars 14.25 a share.
Borden, however, said Mr Kazarian's proposal was 'silent' on many important
details, and Wall Street expressed its scepticism about the plan by marking
Borden's shares down Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 13 3/4 .
Mr Kazarian, a former chairman and chief executive of the Sunbeam-Oster
consumer products group, runs a Rhode Island investment firm called Japonica
Partners. He has been trying to present himself as a white knight for
Borden.
In his latest letter to Mr Frank Tasco, Borden's chairman, Mr Kazarian has
offered to help finance a Dollars 430m share buy-back by the company, and
has also suggested spinning off its dairy and packaged food businesses.
However, Borden yesterday appeared to pour cold water on the plan, pointing
to a number of potential weaknesses.

Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.
Baesa's franchise covers Brazil's most lucrative markets of Sao Paulo and
Rio de Janeiro states, and the south-eastern states of Rio Grande do Sul,
Parana and Santa Catarina.
Mr Leon Timothy, a senior vice-president, said that by the end of next year
Dollars 300m will have been invested in the new plants and a further Dollars
100m in advertising and promotion. Pepsi has 7 per cent of the Brazilian
soft drinks market, compared with about 60 per cent for Coca-Cola, he said.
The Brazilian operations will employ about 2,000 people and will be run by a
wholly-owned Baesa subsidiary.

A big cut in interest charges helped Litton Industries, the US defence
group, report a 24 per cent increase in net earnings to Dollars 32.1m from
continuing operations for its first quarter to October.
In the comparable quarter Litton made Dollars 25.9m after tax excluding the
contribution from its non-defence businesses, which were spun off to
shareholders earlier this year.
Earnings per share from continuing operations rose from 55 cents to 68
cents.
Litton has a substantial defence electronics business and builds warships.
But like other defence contractors, it has been suffering the effects of the
global downturn in defence spending.
Sales declined by 6 per cent to Dollars 788m, and although the company
achieved an improvement in operating margins in its advanced electronics
business, total operating profits declined from Dollars 69.6m to Dollars
68.4m.
Net interest paid fell from Dollars 9.6m to Dollars 1.3m, resulting from the
early extinguishment of high-cost debt in July.
Mr John Leonis, chief executive, said Litton's financial position remained
strong, and that the company planned to invest in acquisitions related to
its aerospace and defence businesses as the fiscal year progressed.

FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: IBM changes marketing tactics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines is offering potential customers in Europe up
to Dollars 150,000 in services to move from competitors' systems, in a sharp
departure from the its usual marketing practices.
The move, which applies to IBM's mid-range computer families only, is a
dramatic change for a company which has always assumed leadership of any
market in which it chose to compete.
The growing appeal of low-cost, industry standard systems based on common
operating software is, however, forcing the giant to reconsider marketing
tactics for its AS/400 and ES/9000 mid-range systems, which combine
proprietary hardware and software.
IBM worldwide has returned to profitability after losing money for three
years as customers turned away from proprietary systems. Europe, however,
remains a black spot.
IBM has set up a competitive marketing unit headed by Mr Erwin Staudt,
formerly with IBM Germany, to develop and implement marketing strategies to
win customers from its competitors.
A campaign to run until the end of June 1995 promises customers moving from
competitors' equipment to IBM up to Dollars 150,000 of 'specialised
transition support' to assist in the transfer. 'We are so sure about the
success of this campaign that we will allow customers to return systems
newly leased from IBM six months after installation without further
obligation,' Mr Staudt said.
Dr Jane Doorly, computer analyst with the market consultancy Dataquest, said
it was a dramatic change for IBM. It could, however, be seen either as a
mark of returning confidence or as an indication of desperation.

FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: Demand drives Navistar up 95% at
operating level
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Navistar, the US manufacturer of heavy trucks and diesel engines, reported a
95 per cent increase in operating income in the fourth quarter. However,
per-share earnings dipped because of a dilutive stock issuance since last
year's fourth quarter.
Boosted by strong demand for most of its truck and engine products, Navistar
reported net income of Dollars 23m, or 22 cents a share, compared with
year-ago results of Dollars 22m, or 28 cents. Sales for the quarter rose to
Dollars 1.55bn, from Dollars 1.3bn in 1993.
The jump in operating earnings, to Dollars 43m in the quarter from Dollars
22m a year ago, was offset by Dollars 20m in charges taken for environmental
liabilities at two defunct factories.
For the year, Navistar had net income of Dollars 82m, or 72 cents a share,
turning around last year's loss of Dollars 501m, or Dollars 15.19. Revenues
for the year were Dollars 5.3bn, up from 1993's Dollars 4.7bn. For the
12-month period, Navistar's operating income improved to Dollars 102m, from
last year's loss of Dollars 273m.
The company reported that a total of 134,200 medium trucks and school bus
chassis, and 205,500 heavy trucks were sold industry-wide in North America
during Navistar's fiscal year. 'This was the highest level of heavy truck
demand since 1979,' said Mr James Cotting, chairman.
Based on order trends and other indicators, Navistar is predicting that
North American demand for medium trucks and school bus chassis will rise 12
per cent in 1995, to 151,000 units. Its 1995 forecast for heavy truck demand
is 205,000 units, about the same as in 1994.

FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: N American gold merger fails on
lack of investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The proposed merger of four small North American gold companies into a
medium-sized group has fallen through, partly because of lack of appetite
among investors for gold equities.
The new management team at Denver-based Atlas Corporation had hoped to raise
USDollars 75m from international investors to buy:
37.2 per cent of Granges, a Canadian precious metals producer, for CDollars
50.7m (USDollars 36.9m) from MIM, the Australian resources group;
20 per cent of Dakota Mining, another Denver company formerly known as
MinVen Gold, for between Dollars 15.3m and Dollars 18.4m;
the rest of Grange's 50 per cent-owned Hycroft Resources.
The merger, which Atlas wanted to complete before the end of this year,
would have created a group that might have qualified for inclusion in the
new Financial Times Gold Mines Index.
Mr Steve Manz, president of Atlas, said yesterday the scheme began to look
as if it might face problems when his company was able to raise only Dollars
50m of the Dollars 75m it was seeking, with the help of First Marathon
Securities, in July. 'There was a strike by gold investors. Most junior
companies looking for capital pulled their offerings,' he said.
Subsequently, Atlas acquired the Granges stake but decided not to proceed
with the Dakota acquisition, partly because the terms would have involved it
paying Dollars 4 a share compared with a market price which had dropped to
Dollars 1.50.
Mr Manz says Atlas now has the support of enough other Granges shareholders
to take control of that company's board at the annual meeting, which must be
held before the end of June next year.
The ultimate objective is a full merger of Atlas, Granges and Hycroft, to
produce a group with an annual output in 1996 of at least 150,000 troy
ounces of gold.

FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: Telecoms study Amadeus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some of the world's leading telecommunications companies are vying to take a
25 per cent stake in Amadeus, the European computerised airline reservation
service.
Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK-based telecoms company, confirmed yesterday it was
in talks with the Madrid-based organisation.
Amadeus said yesterday it had been looking for a new shareholder since 1991
when Scandinavian Airlines System, a founder member, pulled out of the
organisation to cut costs.
It confirmed C&amp;W was a potential bidder, but declined to identify the other
telecoms companies. It said an early decision was unlikely, and suggested it
might be three to six months before terms could be agreed with a successful
bidder.
Amadeus was established by a group of airlines including Air France, Iberia
and Lufthansa to create and manage a European airline reservation system in
competition with Sabre of the US. The service is now breaking even at an
operating level, although it says it would not be 'interesting to our
investors until 1995-96'.
It has, however, become interesting to the large telecommunications
operators because it offers the possibility of a direct entry into the
global travel industry.
The big telecoms carriers are battling each other for business from
multinational corporations, and services tailored to specific industries
would give them a competitive edge. C&amp;W, for example, is in talks with
Schlumberger about a possible alliance in the oil business, and to Digital
Equipment, the US computer manufacturer, about custom packages for a number
of industries.

<TEXT>
Hewlett-Packard, the US electronics manufacturer, is cutting the price of
some of its desktop personal computers by up to 26 per cent.
The move is seen as innovative for the company which, as one of the smaller
producers of PCs, has previously taken the lead on price from its larger
competitors.
Hewlett-Packard said it was cutting prices across its Vectra range of PCs,
and claimed it would undercut rivals Compaq and IBM by as much as 40 per
cent for comparable machines. It is also cutting prices on its servers, used
to link office PCs, by up to 22 per cent.
The company said the cuts were made possible by increased manufacturing
volume, distribution efficiencies, lower component prices and newly-expanded
distribution channels.
Last month, Hewlett-Packard announced a 60 per cent jump in fourth-quarter
earnings, to Dollars 476m, on sales up 23 per cent. Chairman Mr Lew Platt
cautioned that this exceptional rate of growth might not continue.
The shares fell Dollars 3 to Dollars 95 yesterday.

Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce has underlined the strong improvement in
Canadian banks' performance by posting record earnings for fiscal 1994, and
lifting its dividend by 12 per cent.
Net earnings climbed to CDollars 890m (USDollars 647.1m), or CDollars 3.52 a
share, in the year to October 31 1994, from CDollars 730m, or CDollars 2.99,
a year earlier.
Return on equity rose to 11.7 per cent from 10.6 per cent. Return on assets
climbed to 0.60 per cent from 0.53 per cent.
The quarterly dividend has been raised by four cents to 37 cents a share.
The bank, Canada's second-biggest financial institution with assets of
CDollars 151bn, said it expected to benefit in the year ahead from stronger
economic growth and significantly lower loan losses.
Non-performing loans shrank to CDollars 1.5bn on October 31 from CDollars
2.4bn a year earlier. Loan losses for the year fell to CDollars 880m from
CDollars 920m.
CIBC is aggressively expanding operations in New York and London in an
attempt to become a leading force in international derivatives markets.
The bank said its revenues were boosted by strong growth in securities,
insurance, mutual funds management and credit businesses. However,
investments in the expanding derivatives operations, and in the fledgling
insurance and trust businesses, contributed to a 10 per cent jump in
non-interest costs.
National Bank of Canada posted a 36 per cent gain in fourth-quarter net
profit to CDollars 57m, or 29 cents a share, bringing return on equity to
10.6 per cent and on assets to 0.51 per cent, reports Robert Gibbens in
Montreal. Interest margins improved, home mortgages and business loans were
up and loan-loss provisions were lower. Higher fee income offset a lower
contribution from the brokerage unit.
Fiscal 1994 net profit was CDollars 217m, or CDollars 1.12, up 24 per cent
from CDollars 175m, or CDollars 1.01, in fiscal 1993. Return on equity was
10.5 per cent against 9.9 per cent, and on assets 0.50 per cent, up from
0.44 per cent.
National, Canada's sixth-largest bank, reported assets at October 31 were
almost CDollars 45bn, up 5 per cent from a year earlier.

FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: Telefonica to divide group into
eight companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The deregulation of the telecommunications sector has prompted Telefonica,
Spain's government-controlled operator, into a far-reaching reorganisation
that will divide the group into eight specialised companies.
The move will also give Telefonica the possibility of floating off parts of
the group, which is 32 per cent owned by the government with a further 20
per cent held by foreign institutions.
The reorganisation, which will be completed before the industry's
liberalisation in 1998, will create separate units dealing with basic
telephones, international communications, data transmission, mobile phones,
public phones, international business, publicity and information, and
multimedia.
The development will lend an increased transparency to Telefonica's
business. It has been designed to prevent units where the group continues to
hold a monopoly, such as basic telephony, subsidising others, such as data
transmission, which has already been liberalised, and mobile telephony,
where Telefonica will soon be competing with a second operator.
The government is reviewing rival bids, one backed by the UK's Vodafone and
the other by AirTouch, a US telecoms group, to develop a second pan-European
GSM (global system of mobile communications) digital network to compete with
one which will be installed by Telefonica. The second licence is to be
awarded before the end of the year.
'As the reorganisation takes root, the Telefonica companies might want to
tap the markets individually,' Mr Pedro Gonzalez Ahijado, chief analyst at
Madrid securities firm AB Asesores said. 'There will be nothing to prevent
the group disposing of part or all of its yellow pages unit, for example, if
it wants to.'
Along with the data transmission and mobile telephony units, one of the
first business areas to be moved into a separate company will be multimedia.
The government has already drafted a cable television law to allow the
private sector into multimedia and, as with the GSM network, one cable
licence has been reserved for Telefonica.

<TEXT>
Chrysler, the smallest of the three big US carmakers, yesterday bowed to
pressure from its biggest shareholder as it announced plans to pay out more
of its growing cash hoard.
The company agreed to lift its dividend by 60 per cent, to an annual Dollars
1.60 a share, a move which will take the total dividend bill to about
Dollars 550m a year.
It also said it would start a Dollars 1bn share buy-back programme in the
first three months of next year.
The moves follow agitation in recent weeks from Mr Kirk Kerkorian, the
billionaire businessman whose stake of more than 9 per cent makes him the
company's biggest shareholder. Mr Kerkorian went public two weeks ago with
his battle to force Chrysler to pay out more of its cash, after his private
approaches to the board were rebuffed.
Chrysler said the steps agreed by its board yesterday had been planned
before Mr Kerkorian's intervention. However, it added: 'His interest and his
attentions may have altered our timetable.'
Chrysler yesterday also amended its 'poison pill' takeover defence, lifting
to 15 per cent from 10 per cent the maximum that any investor can hold
before measures dilute the holding.
This also reflects pressure from Mr Kerkorian, who has filed an application
with the US Federal Trade Commission to raise his stake in the company.
Mr Kerkorian's private investment company, Tracinda, responded to Chrysler's
announcement saying: 'We're very pleased with the programme. We think it's a
significant step for all shareholders.'
Although Chrysler raised its dividend last December and in May, it has been
reluctant until now to distribute more of its cash reserves.
The company, which was kept afloat by a government-guaranteed loan in the
early 1980s and nearly succumbed again to the recession of the early 1990s,
has been attempting to build a strong and liquid balance sheet to see it
through the next downturn.
Chrysler said that paying out more to shareholders would not deflect it from
reaching other financial targets.
It expects to raise its five-year spending plan by Dollars 2bn, to Dollars
22.9bn. It also expects to reach its target cash reserves of Dollars 7.5bn
and a fully-funded pension scheme by the end of this year.

FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: Chemical Banking to axe 3,700
jobs in shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chemical Banking, the fourth-biggest US banking group, announced a range of
cost-cutting and other measures, including 3,700 job losses, in an attempt
to lift its profitability closer to the levels of more successful rivals.
In addition to the job losses, which amount to about 9 per cent of its total
staff, Chemical said it would dispose of two peripheral businesses, sell off
Dollars 1bn of non-performing property loans and extend its share buy-back
programme with a further 6m shares.
The moves signal the first broad-ranging restructuring at the bank since its
merger with Manufacturers Hanover at the end of 1991. They reflect the
generally lacklustre outlook for bank earnings in the US after the
interest-rate rises of this year, and went some way yesterday to meeting
market concerns that Chemical had failed to cut costs aggressively enough at
the time of the merger.
Mr Walter Shipley, chairman, denied that the bank was acting belatedly to
deal with the Manufacturers Hanover transaction. However, he called the
latest restructuring 'the second phase' in the process of absorbing the
bank, following an eight-month review to find ways to make all operations
more efficient.
At the time of the merger, Chemical said it planned to lift its return on
equity to 16 per cent by 1994. 'Clearly, at 14 per cent, we're not where we
should be,' Mr Shipley said. He added that the failure to hit the target was
caused by the US interest rate rises and the fall-off in trading revenues
this year, rather than a failure to meet internal cost targets.
The moves, which will result in restructuring and write-down costs of
Dollars 410m, are intended to enable Chemical to hold costs steady in the
next two years, while growing its revenues at 4-6 per cent a year. This
should result in earnings per share growth of 15 per cent in each of the
next two years, the bank said - a return on equity of 16 per cent.
Chemical said it would sell 60 per cent of its banking business in the state
of New Jersey, retaining only those operations close to New York city. The
New Jersey bank, acquired in 1989, has assets of Dollars 5.7bn and 140
branches.
Chemical is also to sell its 40 per cent stake in CIT, an asset-based
lending business. The remaining 60 per cent was sold to Dai-Ichi Kangyo, the
Japanese bank, in 1989.
Among moves to make the bank's international network more profitable, Mr
Bill Harrison, vice-chairman in charge of wholesale banking, said Chemical
planned significant reductions in its German business, which employs 300
people in capital markets, leasing, export finance and general corporate
banking. It will also reduce its presence in Chile.
Signs that Chemical was taking a more aggressive stance on improving its
earnings have sustained the company's share price in recent weeks. The
shares rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 36 7/8 in early trading yesterday.

Fortis, the Dutch-Belgian financial services group, increased nine-month
profits 15 per cent to Ecu411m (Dollars 338m) from Ecu357m for the same
period of 1993.
Fortis, jointly owned by Amev of the Netherlands and AG of Belgium, said
full-year net profit would also be about 15 per cent higher than in 1993.
The group said insurance companies in Europe and US life insurance
activities were strong contributors to the results, which were also boosted
by the banking and insurance activities of ASLK-CGER, the Belgian savings
bank group.
Nine-month pre-tax banking results rose to Ecu207.4m from Ecu56m, helped by
acquiring control of ASLK-CGER bank. Insurance profits rose 11 per cent to
Ecu469.7m.

FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: SmithKline awaits results of
expansion trial - Whether the UK group has the winning strategy is the big
question
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham, the world's sixth biggest drugs company, seems to be
hooked on change. Last week, it announced yet another Dollars 1bn-plus deal.
That made four - almost Dollars 8bn-worth - in six months.
But perhaps it is about to kick the habit. Mr Jan Leschly, the group's
energetic chief executive, wearily declared last week that the corporate
hyperactivity was probably over for the moment.
'We have got the components in place we need to do what we want to do,' said
Mr Leschly. 'What's next is to make sure the investments in synergy and
restructuring work.'
His approach had won the approval of his peers across UK industry.
SmithKline Beecham was this week voted the fourth most admired company in
the US, up from ninth two years ago.
But in the context of the international pharmaceutical business, its
strategy is more questionable.
The sector has exploded into corporate action this year. More than Dollars
25bn has been spent since January, with many deals bigger than anything
SmithKline has done. American Home Products paid almost Dollars 10bn for its
American Cyanamid acquisition. Switzerland's Roche forked out Dollars 5.3bn
for Syntex, a Californian drugs manufacturer.
But SmithKline has now declared that the pieces are in place for it to
achieve its goal of becoming an integrated healthcare company as opposed to
a specialised drug maker.
The plan was formulated in 1993. A team of executives prepared a
'10-three-one' strategy. This involved forecasting the business environment
a decade from now and devising three and one-year plans to position the
company for that future.
The review was prompted by the growing strength of the drugs industry's
customers. The gap between those who delivered healthcare - doctors and
hospitals - from those who paid for it - governments and payers of health
insurance premiums - appeared to be closing.
For example, governments in Germany, Italy and the UK are seeking to limit
the range of drugs that can be prescribed.
The trend is clearer in the US, where healthcare spending may hit Dollars
1,000bn this year. Much of the cost burden falls on companies which pay
insurance premiums for employees. They increasingly use specialist companies
called health management organisations (HMOs) to drive tough bargains with
hospital chains, doctors' practices and drug companies.
A favoured technique is to tell doctors they can prescribe drugs only from
an approved list. The SmithKline team determined the industry's winners
would be those which could deal directly with the real customers, the
payers.
SmithKline therefore had to offer disease prevention, diagnosis and
treatment, and advise on the best way to deliver these to patients.
To do that companies would have to be much bigger, leaving room for between
six and 10 'mega global players', says one SmithKline executive.
Each of the four transactions this year is designed to create a broadly
based company able to offer products to the payers.
In May SmithKline spent Dollars 2.3bn on Diversified Pharmaceuticals
Services. Nominally a drug distributor, DPS is a pharmacy benefit manager
(PBM) which manages lists of approved drugs for 300,000 US doctors looking
after almost 11m health insurance policy holders.
SmithKline also signed a minimum six-year collaboration with the former
owner of DPS, United Healthcare, one of the largest HMO chains in the US.
In August, it paid Eastman Kodak of the US Dollars 2.9bn for Sterling
Health, a specialist in branded medicines sold over-the-counter (OTC)
without a prescription. Governments are encouraging the use of OTC drugs
because patients pay for them directly.
In September, SmithKline sold Sterling's US brands to Bayer of Germany for
Dollars 1bn. This was partly to help cut SmithKline's Dollars 3.5bn debt and
partly because it was already strong in US OTC. Getting stronger might have
attracted the attention of the US anti-trust authorities.
Finally came last week's Dollars 1.45bn sale of the company's animal health
business to US rival Pfizer. Debt was pushed down further and animal health
was seen as disposable in a plan to become a health management company.
In addition, SB's research and development operations on both sides of the
Atlantic have been transformed since Dr George Poste succeeded Dr Keith
Mansford as head of R&amp;D in 1992.
The company has dropped several research programmes - including
gastro-intestinal medicine, the field that had produced Tagamet, its
best-seller of the 1980s. It now concentrates on drug discovery in five
areas: the central nervous system, heart and lungs, anti-infectives,
inflammation and tissue repair, and vaccines.
And, since announcing a Dollars 125m link-up in May 1993 with Human Genome
Sciences, it has become a leader in gene discovery.
Since SmithKline also has a diagnostics equipment arm, the company can claim
to offer an integrated healthcare service from diagnosis through drug
development, manufacture and sales to the management of the patients.
But there are question marks over the plan. Mr Ian Smith, pharmaceuticals
analyst at stock broker Lehman Brothers, says the fashion for buying PBMs -
Eli Lilly paid Dollars 4bn for another, called PCS, in July - is fading. He
says they may have cost too much. SmithKline paid 57 times annual earnings
for DPS, which will hurt the company's earnings per share for at least two
years.
Nor can SmithKline take maximum advantage of the PBM links because of a
ruling made by the US Federal Trade Commission in Lilly's deal. The FTC was
concerned that PCS had commercially sensitive data on drugs it distributed
that were manufactured by Lilly's rivals.
Last month, Lilly was forced to erect Chinese walls between the PBM and the
rest of the company to block the flow of sensitive information. SmithKline
quickly said it already had such Chinese walls in place. Nevertheless, says
Mr Smith, access to such information was one of the planks on which
SmithKline justified the high price it paid for DPS.
The success of its chosen strategy will easily be measured. Glaxo, Europe's
biggest drugs market, has made no acquisitions yet. Only one is like to have
picked the right road.

Barlo, the Dublin-based radiators and packaging group, blamed lower margins
in its plastics business for a fall in pre-tax profits for the six months to
September 30 from IPounds 2.42m to IPounds 1.81m (Pounds 1.78m).
Turnover rose to IPounds 55.5m (IPounds 43.4m) reflecting continued organic
growth and the contribution from Veha Radiators.
Earnings per share were 1.02p (1.76p) and the interim dividend is unchanged
at 0.4p.

FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Sharp rise to Pounds 4.6m at Metro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Metro Radio Group, the Newcastle-based radio station
operator, almost doubled to Pounds 4.63m in the year to September 30, as
advertising revenue advanced 23 per cent to a record Pounds 17.7m.
The pre-tax rise from Pounds 2.37m was struck on turnover up 22 per cent to
Pounds 21.6m (Pounds 17.7m) and included a Pounds 320,000 profit on the sale
and leaseback of a property in Stockton. The shares only rose 2p to 406p,
but Mr John Josephs, managing director, said the upturn in radio advertising
had been well documented and was already in the share price.
In calendar 1993, radion, the fastest growing advertising medium, took 3.4
per cent of the total UK advertising expenditure, and in 1994 was expected
to approach 4 per cent. The Radio Advertising Bureau has said the figure
should rise to 6 per cent in 1995. Part of these rises are because the
business has got bigger, said Mr Josephs, but he reckoned that Metro was
currently taking between 7 and 8 per cent in the north-east.
Earnings grew to 18.6p (9.4p) per share and a final dividend of 5.15p lifts
the total to 7.4p (5.5p).

FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Gibbon slips to Pounds 973,000 midway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Falling prices meant Gibbon Group, the printing inks concern, reported a
marginal drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 980,000 to Pounds 973,000 for
the six months to September 30, despite a rise in turnover from Pounds 12.7m
to Pounds 13.6m.
Mr Michael Gibbon, chairman, said he believed that the industry could no
longer suffer price restraint, though he added that a 5 per cent increase
was now imminent.
Profits were struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 137,000 (Pounds
89,000). Mr Gibbon said unbudgeted costs had arisen from the reorganisation
of the group's Colorcentres into Supacentres, together with computerisation
of all its sales outlets.
With earnings per share at 6.4p (6.3p) the interim dividend has been held at
2.2p.

FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Job cuts end revamp at AA Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AA Insurance yesterday more than halved its headquarters staff, completing
an eight-month reorganisation which has cost 1,500 jobs and has been
prompted by fierce competition in the UK insurance sector.
Staff numbers at the Basingstoke headquarters of AA Insurance, which sells
policies on behalf of insurance companies by telephone and in 257 shops,
have been cut by 59 to 42. AA Insurance is 25 per cent owned by Eagle Star,
the insurance company.
Mr Mark Wood, managing director, said efforts would be made to find
alternative jobs within the AA motorist organisation. 'The actions that we
have taken are essential to make us more competitive with brokers and direct
writers alike,' he said.
Over the past year AA Insurance has lost about 300,000 motor policies,
though it still has about 1.1m policyholders on its books and 2.5m general
insurance policies in issue.
Mr Wood was appointed in March with the brief to counter the threat posed by
'direct' insurance writers - which cut out brokers and their commissions.
In September, AA Insurance announced the closure of a processing office in
Cheadle, Cheshire, with its work being transferred to Newcastle and Cardiff.
In total, the staff numbers have fallen to 3,700 from 5,200 in May.
Mr Wood is attempting to match the operating efficiency of direct writers by
improving electronic links with AA Insurance's panel of 40 insurers and by
cutting overheads, particularly on claims handling. UK motor premiums have
fallen by at least 5 per cent this year.
It also hopes to work more closely with other parts of the organisation and
is attempting to compete on quality - offering, for example, courtesy cars
and transport home for motorists involved in accidents.
Mr Wood said that by using a panel of insurers, AA Insurance was able to
offer better prices for a wider range of customers than the direct writers.

FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: MEPC assets rise misses mark - Short-term
prospects for portfolio difficult to judge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON PROPERTY CORRESPONDENT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares fell across the property sector as MEPC, the UK's second largest
property company, disappointed analysts with a lower than expected rise in
net assets per share.
Over the year, nav increased 14 per cent from 416p to 473p - analysts were
expecting between 490p and 500p.
Pre-tax profits grew 37 per cent from Pounds 81m to Pounds 111m, including
Pounds 10m from the sale of properties and the use of provisions.
Mr James Tuckey, chief executive, said MEPC's UK properties had increased in
value by 9 per cent during the 12 months to September 30. Analysts had
forecast an increase of between 13 and 14 per cent.
Mr Tuckey added that most of the valuation gains had come in the first half,
since when values had been flat.
Lord Blakenham, chairman, commented: 'The short to medium term prospects for
our UK portfolio are not easy to judge. Rental increases for prime
properties are on the cards, but there is still considerable over-rented
property around.'
Net income from properties rose to Pounds 234m (Pounds 213m). After
administrative expenses of Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 13m), operating profits were
Pounds 221.6m (Pounds 199.6m).
Finance costs increased from Pounds 119.2m to Pounds 123.6m, reflecting
higher interest charges. Interest capitalised amounted to Pounds 10.1m, down
from Pounds 13m.
Some Pounds 446m was spent on acquisitions, including the purchase of two
shopping centres in the US, a shopping centre and office buildings in
Australia, shopping centres in Derby and Belfast and a portfolio of office
and industrial premises in the west midlands.
The Northridge Fashion Centre, which suffered damage during the Los Angeles
earthquake in January, is expected to reopen next summer. MEPC has received
insurance proceeds of Pounds 13m and said the cash effect of the earthquake
would not be material.
Gearing at the year end was 62 per cent. Mr James Beveridge, finance
director, said that gearing could rise to 75 per cent if suitable
acquisition opportunities were identified.
Earnings increased from 15.5p to 20.1p. The final dividend of 14.75p makes
an unchanged total of 20p.
COMMENT
MEPC yesterday added to the cloud of gloom which has hung over the property
sector in recent months. While profits were in line with expectations, it is
clear that property values have risen by less than anticipated and that the
outlook for further growth is uncertain. The main comfort for MEPC is that
after yesterday's 4 per cent fall from 403p to 385p, the share price now
reflects this uncertainty. On a secure yield of 6.5 per cent and a 25 per
cent discount to prospective net assets per share, the downside for the
shares is limited.

FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Retail decline leaves Anglian Gp lower at
Pounds 10m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Anglian Group, the double glazing company, fell 25p to 175p
yesterday, after the group revealed a sharp decline in interim profits and
stated that 'it is likely that the result for the full year will be lower
than last year'.
A marked decline in retail revenues was the main factor in a fall in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds 10.1m for the six months ended October
1.
Mr Ron Swift, chief executive, admitted the figures were disappointing, but
said retail orders in the pipeline were up 6 per cent from 1993, which would
feed through into profits for the second half.
Retail sales account for more than 75 per cent of Anglian's annual revenues,
and command the highest margins.
Turnover rose by 6.4 per cent to Pounds 89.4m (Pounds 84m), while operating
profits fell from Pounds 11.9m to Pounds 9.9m, reflecting price cutting by
Anglian in order to win public sector orders, following the privatisation of
the Property Services Agency.
Anglian has also expanded direct sales to the building trade, which reap
substantially lower margins.
Trade sales, while expanding rapidly, had an adverse impact on cash flow, as
debtors increased from Pounds 17.4m to Pounds 23.7m, reflecting slow
payment. However, Anglian retains Pounds 8.36m of cash and no bank debt.
The company warned of an acceleration in the rise of raw material prices,
particularly polymer, which rose by 20 per cent in October.
Mr David Herman, finance director, said: 'We are competing against a lot of
people who are not making any money. In the long run, they will have to pass
on cost increases to the customer.'
Mr Swift was confident of a pick-up in the second half, reflecting Anglian's
fuller order book, and the dividend has been maintained at 4.1p. Earnings
per share fell from 9.1p to 7.9p.

FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: BT signs deal to shift Asia-Pacific office
to Sydney
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and ALAN CANE

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications, the UK's dominant telephone operator, is moving
its Asia-Pacific headquarters to Sydney, Australia, from Singapore and will
purchase equipment worth ADollars 440m (Pounds 199m) from Australian
manufacturers during the next seven years.
The moves, part of BT's strategy to develop its international business, are
detailed in a partnership agreement signed this week between the company and
the Australian federal government.
As a result, BT is expected to be in a good position to secure a public
telecommunications operator's licence when, as expected, the Australian
telecoms market is opened fully to competition in the middle of 1997. It has
not made an application for a licence to date.
Senator Peter Cook, Australia's industry minister, said the agreement
provided for the establishment in Sydney of BT's Asia-Pacific engineering
centre, and a university research programme to fund collaboration between
Australian universities and the company's R&amp;D laboratories in the UK.
Australia has a good reputation for research in a number of important
telecoms technologies.
BT has operated in Australia since 1987 and provides private services
primarily to international organisations and government departments. Sydney
is already a hub for 'Concert', a joint venture between BT and MCI which
offers multinational companies cut-price international networks.
Agreements already exist between the UK and Australian governments for
'international simple resale' between the two countries, which allows
telecoms operators to offer large customers low-cost international telephone
lines.
Two years ago, BT won the contract to design, install and manage the
internal telephone network for the New South Wales government. A BT
spokesman said yesterday that that contract meant large numbers of BT
engineers were working in Australia and the company was already buying
equipment from local manufacturers.
Australia is committed to the de-regulation of telecoms. Public telephone
services are provided by a duopoly comprising the state-owned Telstra
Corporation, the largest integrated carrier in the Asia-Pacific region, and
Optus, a new company in which Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK and Bell South of
the US have stakes.

FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Borthwicks dips
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 212,000 cost of developing its Hong Kong operation caused pre-tax
profits of Borthwicks, the natural flavours concern, to dip from Pounds
1.13m to Pounds 924,000 in the six months to October 1.
Sales were unchanged at Pounds 14.9m, though there was a 2.6 per cent rise
excluding last year's Pounds 362,000 from discontinued businesses. Earnings
per share were down from 1.6p to 1.3p, but the interim dividend has been
held at 0.5p.

Pre-tax profits at Mid Kent Holdings were static in the first half to
September 30, due to difficult trading conditions in its subsidiary.
Turnover at the group, which supplies water to Kent and Sussex and provides
consultancy services to the water supply industry, rose 11 per cent to
Pounds 18.2m (Pounds 16.4m).
However, despite progress in the water company's performance, difficult
trading conditions experienced by Cyfas-Restbury, acquired last year, held
group pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.83m (Pounds 3.8m).
The interim dividend has been raised to 5.3p (5p) from earnings per share of
16.3p (16.7p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Rowlinson Securities, the Cheshire-based property group,
advanced from Pounds 1.11m to Pounds 1.21m in the six months to the end of
September.
The result was helped by increased profit on property sales of Pounds
228,000 (Pounds 41,000) and lower finance charges of Pounds 542,000 (Pounds
617,000).
Gross rental income was unchanged at Pounds 1.87m and contracting almost
doubled to Pounds 4.39m (Pounds 2.39m). However, the company said it had
taken a prudent approach to the recognition of profits on unfinished
contracts and operating profits were lower at Pounds 1.52m (Pounds 1.69m).
Earnings were 4.27p (5.96p) and the interim dividend is raised to 0.31p
(0.24p).

FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: GRT climbs 24% to Pounds 2.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRT, the smallest of the listed bus and coach operators, yesterday announced
a 24 per cent increase in profits, aided by contributions from its
aggressive acquisitions policy.
Pre-tax profits rose from a pro-forma Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 2.85m in the 24
weeks to September 10 on turnover up 67 per cent at Pounds 25.5m (Pounds
15.3m), including Pounds 2.73m from acquisitions.
The company said that following recent purchases, it now controlled annual
revenues estimated at Pounds 92.4m, compared with the Pounds 39.9m achieved
in the year to March 31 1993.
Since its flotation in May, the group has participated in the rapid
consolidation of the British bus industry through acquisitions of Eastern
Counties, in East Anglia, and Reiver Ventures and SMT in Scotland. It
remains keen to make further acquisitions.
Operating profits rose from Pounds 2.12m to Pounds 2.98m, with acquisitions
providing Pounds 170,000. The contribution from acquisitions will accelerate
in the second half.
On a like-for-like basis, GRT said it achieved a slight improvement in
operating profit margins on existing businesses from 14.5 to 14.8 per cent.
It added that it was rapidly turning around the performance of its recent
acquisitions.
During 1994 and 1995, it is buying 100 new buses at a cost of Pounds 10m.
This should help counter the 3 to 4 per cent annual decline in passenger
numbers, and would also improve margins through lower maintenance costs.
It is paying a maiden dividend of 1.4p per share from earnings of 5.5p
(4.5p).

FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: AAH shares tumble on warning - Fleet of
refuse trucks played part in healthcare group's setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A setback in its environmental services division contributed to a 14 per
cent fall in interim profits at AAH, the pharmaceuticals distribution and
retailing group. The shares fell 48p to close at 336p.
Mr John Padovan, chairman, warned that profits for the full year would be
below last year's levels as pre-tax figure for the six months to the end of
September fell from Pounds 19.1m to Pounds 16.4m.
Operating profits at the environmental services division, which supplies
services and equipment to local authorities, fell from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds
800,000 on sales of Pounds 37.5m (Pounds 36.6m).
Mr Bill Revell, chief executive, blamed the setback mainly on the
performance of the hire fleet of rubbish and street-sweeping trucks. This
had now been chopped by two-thirds to 110 vehicles.
The second half is traditionally poorer for the division, so a recovery is
not expected. While the business is not up for sale, 'we are not wedded to
any part of it if we don't see a long-term future', Mr Revell said.
Group sales moved ahead from Pounds 773.1m to Pounds 798.6m. The latest
figure includes Pounds 5.9m from acquisitions and Pounds 1.5m from
discontinued operations, while the previous figure includes Pounds 47.6m
from the building supplies operation sold to Travis Perkins in March.
Mr Revell said the absence of profits from the building supplies business
had also contributed to the first-half setback. In addition lower gains on
property disposals and increased pension contributions had cost Pounds 1m.
Operating profits from the healthcare division, which accounts for more than
91 per cent of total sales, improved from Pounds 16.6m to Pounds 17.1m,
although net margins eased from 2.6 to 2.4 per cent. Sales were Pounds
717.9m (Pounds 642.7m).
Mr Revell said the group had 'no problem with sales - the key is to get the
cost of handling sales down'. The group is in the middle of a
rationalisation programme in its wholesale distribution business, for which
a Pounds 5m provision was made last year. So far Pounds 1.4m has been spent,
and the number of branches cut by six to 18. By March 1996, the group plans
to have 15 branches, of which seven will be fully automated.
The group has acquired 17 further pharmacies since March, taking the total
to 305.
Earnings per share fell to 12.2p (14.7p). The interim dividend is unchanged
at 6p.
COMMENT
The extent of the problems at AAH is reflected in the sharp downward
revision of City forecasts for the full year from around Pounds 42m to
Pounds 36m. Any reasons for being in the environmental services sector have
disappeared, and in any case the pressures on local authorities are unlikely
to go away. The management, quite right to sell the building supplies
operation, should ask itself why it is in any business outside the
healthcare division, which accounts for more than 91 per cent of sales. Even
here, the rationalisation and modernisation taking place is affecting
performance while the group catches up with the competition. However, the
healthcare business is performing reasonably well in a growth market. On a
prospective multiple of around 12, this might prove enough of a lure to hold
on for better times.

FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Cost cuts help Seeboard advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seeboard set a strong pace for the new regional electricity results season
yesterday by disclosing a 28 per cent increase in underlying half-year
pre-tax profits, and a 21 per cent rise in the interim dividend.
And the Crawley-based company linked the results to further benefits for its
customers, which it valued at Pounds 22m.
Seeboard, which serves south-east England, reported profits for the six
months to September 30 of Pounds 33.5m (Pounds 36.3m) after a Pounds 12.8m
charge for a premium paid to redeem Pounds 54m of government debt ahead of
time.
Turnover was Pounds 509.3m (Pounds 534.3m). The interim dividend is raised
to 4p (3.3p) from earnings per share of 9.1p (10.15p).
Sir Keith Stuart, chairman, said the results reflected the cost reductions
which Seeboard had achieved over the last 18 months through job cuts and
greater efficiency. The dividend increase was 'generous, but we can afford
to pay it, and we're doing the customers proud too'.
Seeboard will be reducing its quarterly standing charge by Pounds 2.50 or 20
per cent from next February. It will also pay each customer a special rebate
of Pounds 1 out of the interest earned on the Pounds 70m received in VAT
prepayments earlier this year. Other improvements include an increase in the
direct debit discount from Pounds 3 to Pounds 4, and a free bill-paying
service through the post office.
Although Seeboard is obliged by the new price regulations to cut prices for
its customers next year, Sir Keith said these measures would deliver the
benefits 'ahead of time'. Since privatisation in 1989, he said Seeboard
customers had seen a 16 per cent reduction in electricity bills in real
terms.
Among the divisional operations, the distribution business made an operating
profit of Pounds 43.6m (Pounds 39.3m). The supply business reported a
reduced loss of Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 6.7m), while in the retail, contracting
and gas sales businesses, improved trading margins led to better results.

FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: GrandMet details Pounds 280m charge -
Directors seek to calm investors' fears of possible third pill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We've really swallowed a pill two years running and I do not intend to
swallow another,' Mr George Bull, Grand Metropolitan's chief executive, said
yesterday, explaining the latest restructuring charge.
He and other senior executives of the food and drinks group went to great
lengths to reassure investors that there was not a third pill on the
horizon.
GrandMet announced a Pounds 175m charge in September 1993 to reorganise its
US foods business and a Pounds 280m charge this autumn for its global drinks
and European food businesses.
'We can't see a darned thing left' which warranted a third big charge, said
Mr Dave Rickard, group controller. The door had been left open, however, for
small items as they arose.
Analysts remained cautious given the group's fondness for such accounting
practices. Moreover, they were puzzled by the reason for the long shopping
list of projects wrapped up in the latest charge and spelt out in detail for
the first time yesterday.
'It looks like a lot of soft capital expenditure, which should have been
paid for along the way,' one analyst said.
Mr Bull said: 'We knew we had a number of very specific jobs to do, so we
did a complete review world-wide.'
The bulk of the charge, Pounds 143m, covers IDV, the drinks business. About
40 per cent of that represents asset writedowns and the rest a string of
projects costing a few million pounds each to rationalise offices, plants
and distribution in various countries, particularly in Europe.
The European foods charge of Pounds 55m is split in three equal tranches for
restructuring production, rationalising support services and closing some
shops and sales offices of Haagen-Dazs, its ice cream business.
Burger King, the fast-food restaurant chain, took a further Pounds 31m
charge to, for example, move more of its headquarters staff in Miami out
into the field.
The balance consists of a plethora of small items, such as closing some
shops in the Pearle opticians chain.
Although the programme will cut costs and bring a better focus to the
businesses, analysts remain concerned about the direction of the European
food business. It is small, lacks strong brands, has struggled to transfer
to Europe successful products from abroad and faces further investment in
Haagen-Dazs.
The best asset is a German company involved in canned ready meals and soups,
which accounts for about one-third of European food sales. It has growth
potential in eastern Europe.
European sales of Haagen-Dazs grew by 35 per cent last year to Dollars 170m
(Pounds 104m) but it is still unprofitable. Significant progress is needed
to help justify expensive distribution.
Management acknowledged yesterday that all but small European food
acquisitions were unlikely and the division's recovery lay in cost cutting
and organic growth. Their real ambitions lie in the US and Far East.
Thus, the City is betting that the division will be refocused around the
German canning business and Haagen-Dazs. The rest will be put up for sale,
leading perhaps to further writedowns.

FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Celltech poised to sign another
collaboration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Celltech, the biotechnology company, is likely to sign another large
collaborative deal with a pharmaceuticals company during 1995.
Mr Peter Fellner, chief executive, said several companies were interested
but would not say which of Celltech's potential products was involved. Any
new partnership is likely to include the company's promising cancer-treating
matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors.
The company has already received Pounds 13.6m from its partnerships and is
set to earn up to another Pounds 47m by 1998, depending on the progress of
drugs in development.
Celltech shares rose 2p to a new high of 239p.
The company also announced a pre-tax loss for the year to September 30 of
Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 5.9m), largely as a result of higher research and
development spending. Losses per share were 11p (10.3p).
Cash outflow increased from Pounds 6.9m to Pounds 9.7m after higher capital
spending on a new plant. The company had Pounds 36.4m (Pounds 17.9m) cash at
the year end. It raised Pounds 27.3m in a rights issue in December 1993.
Mr Fellner said that 1995 would see results from small- scale but
statistically significant clinical trials on its product CDP 571 in Type II
for diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease.
Turnover was unchanged at Pounds 14.2m, entirely from the company's
Biologics manufacturing division.
Mr Peter Allen, finance director, said that disruption caused by the
construction of a bigger plant had hit the Biologics division in the second
half and would continue to do so into the first half of this year.
COMMENT
A comparison between Celltech and British Biotech, which announced interims
this week, is instructive. Celltech is about a year behind in terms of
progress in clinical trials. The trials are slower. It takes longer to see
whether a drug helps an arthritis sufferer than a cancer patient close to
death. On the other hand, Celltech is conducting statistically significant
studies at an earlier stage. It has more potential drugs in its pipeline,
thus spreading risk. Most importantly, Celltech has collaborations with big
name drugs companies, and their expert assessment is worth more than a City
analyst's report. Where companies such as Merck, Bayer and Schering-Plough
invest, others follow. The shares beat February's all-time high this week
and should rise further.

Harborne Tenants, the property investment company, yesterday recommended an

The deal, which offers the alternatives or loan notes or shares, values

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Crabtree Group, the metal decorating press manufacturer, saw pre-tax profits
leap from Pounds 1.07m to Pounds 4.11m in the year to September 30, on a
turnover of Pounds 28.8m, against Pounds 7.7m.
The result was boosted by the first full contribution from the group's
principal subsidiary, Crabtree of Gateshead, against only 10 weeks
previously.
Earnings per share came to 18.6p (10.7p) and the dividend has been lifted to
8p (2p) with a recommended final of 5p.
Mr Richard Oury is replacing Mr Karl Watkin as chairman, who is stepping
down to devote more time to his public and private interests. Mr Matthew
Cooper has become chief executive, while Mr John Holmes has been appointed
an executive director.

FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: 3i increases net asset value by 6.7% to
334p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
3i, the recently floated venture capital group, yesterday reported a 6.7 per
cent increase in net asset value per share to 334p in the six months to
September 30.
Mr Ewen Macpherson, chief executive, said that the group, which came to the
market in July, had continued to concentrate on its core business activity
of investment in small and medium-sized companies in the UK and continental
Europe. 'Our business in these areas has been very active compared to the
same period last year,' he said.
3i is paying an interim dividend of 2.8p. Sir George Russell, chairman, said
this represented an increase of 7 per cent on last year's interim - paid
prior to flotation - together with bringing forward 0.75p of the final in
order to reduce disparity between the interim and final dividends.
The total return - a combination of dividend revenue less costs and net
interest, realised investment profits and the appreciation of the unrealised
portfolio - was Pounds 140m compared with Pounds 151m, representing a six
months return on shareholders' funds of 7.6 per cent.
Mr Macpherson noted that the total return to shareholders had been achieved
in a business climate, 'that has been satisfactory for investment and
disinvestment, but which has seen declines in most UK stock market indices,
and some evidence in recent months of a levelling off in the rate of
improvement in confidence amongst businessmen, compared to the steady
improvement which we saw during the previous year.'
Pre-tax revenue rose by 12 per cent from Pounds 37.6m to Pounds 42.2m. This
was helped by a surge in fees and commissions, which jumped from Pounds 7.3m
to Pounds 13m mainly reflecting the much higher levels of gross investment
and a first time contribution from the management of a fund for continental
European investments.
Gross dividends from equity investments rose from Pounds 34.8m to Pounds
35.4m, despite the reduction in ACT credit from 22.5 per cent to 20 per
cent.
Within the total return, after-tax revenue rose by 17 per cent from Pounds
28.2m to Pounds 33m. The group made realised capital profits, after losses
and provisions, of Pounds 61.5m compared with Pounds 30.6m a year earlier.
However unrealised growth in the value of investments appreciation was lower
at Pounds 88.9m, against Pounds 136.3m.
3i invested Pounds 246.2m during the first six months, compared with Pounds
132.9m. Investment in the UK was particularly high and the group invested
Pounds 230m in 321 businesses in the six months, compared with Pounds 116m
in 245 businesses in the 1993 period. Much of this was in management
buy-outs and buy-ins.

FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Ushers is latest to withdraw flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ushers, the Wiltshire-based brewer and pub chain, yesterday pulled its
flotation.
Mr Roger North, chief executive, said the response from institutions had
been good. But while more than 30 institutions had been interested, they had
promised 'only three-quarters of the money we needed'.
Unless the shares were fully placed ahead of the public offer, the group
would be running the risk of a bad after market - 'and I would rather wait',
Mr North said.
The group was expected to be valued on flotation at more than Pounds 100m.
It was planning a placing and open offer to raise around Pounds 50m of new
money in order to clear senior debt of Pounds 35m, redeem preference shares
and accelerate expansion.
The withdrawal of the offer follows a warning earlier this week from
Marston, Thompson &amp; Evershed, the Burton-based brewer. The shares fell after
it reported a rise in both beer sales and interim profits, but spoke of
volatile trading and caution about second-half prospects.
The beer market is widely seen as being in decline. While Ushers' brewery is
making 300,000 barrels of beer a year, using 24-hour shifts working to meet
demand, 200,000 barrels are under contract to Courage - a figure that will
fall by two-thirds in 1996.
Mr North said the Courage contract was not an issue - the float was a victim
of the
state of the new issues
market.
'We thought we could prevail against the market, but we did not,' he said.
The Ushers brewery in Trowbridge dates back to 1824 but the current company
was formed only in 1991 after the Beer Orders, which obliged the industry to
reduce the number of their tied houses.
The brewery and an unrelated estate of 433 pubs in south-west England and
South Wales were acquired through a Pounds 71m management buy-in from
Courage.
In the past three years the group has paid off Pounds 15m of debt and
invested Pounds 13m in taking the number of pubs to 470, as well as
modernising the brewery.
The pathfinder document showed pre-tax profits for the year to October ahead
from Pounds 7.76m to Pounds 10.4m on sales of Pounds 39.1m (Pounds 38.9m).
The main shareholders are Schroder Ventures and Swiss Bank Corporation.

FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Royal Bank at Pounds 532m and staff gets
Pounds 25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Staff of Royal Bank of Scotland are to receive an average of Pounds 1,100
from a profit-sharing scheme after the bank yesterday disclosed more than
doubled pre-tax profits of Pounds 532m in the year to September 30.
The bank's shares closed 20p down at 400p on concern at growth in expenses
in the UK bank because of investment in technology. There were also
continuing worries about slower growth at Direct Line, its insurance arm.
The bank is to distribute Pounds 25m, or 8.2 per cent of basic salaries,
among 23,000 eligible staff. Lord Younger, chairman, said it was 'a
demonstration of gratitude to staff for a very positive year of hard work.'
The proposed final dividend of 9.75p gives a 25 per cent rise in the total
for the year from 11p to 13.75p. Earnings per share rose from 15.8p to
41.4p, and pre-tax return on equity rose from 17.3 per cent to 35.6 per
cent.
Acquisitions by US subsidiary Citizens helped to lower the overall ratio of
capital to risk-weighted assets from 12.2 per cent to 10.6 per cent, while
the core tier 1 capital ratio fell from 6.9 per cent to 6.4 per cent.
Mr George Mathewson, chief executive, said capital ratios could be lower
because improved risk management had made its loan portfolio less volatile,
and it had diversified income. There was adequate capital for ongoing
businesses.
But Mr Mathewson indicated that the bank might raise capital from
shareholders if it wanted to grow by acquisition, reiterating that the bank
was interested in buying a UK building society if it was 'the right society
at the right price.'
He said it would not make a counter-bid for the Leeds Permanent Building
Society to disrupt its proposed merger with Halifax, but there were few
incentives for managers of other profitable societies to seek acquisition by
a bank.
Provisions for bad debts fell from Pounds 293m to Pounds 187m. Pre-tax
profits included an exceptional items of Pounds 52m profit on the sale of a
holding in the venture capital group 3i, and Pounds 21m paid to Mr Peter
Wood, chief executive of Direct Line.
Non-interest income grew by 27 per cent from Pounds 677m to Pounds 862m
because of higher tariffs on current accounts, commitment and facility fees
and insurance commissions. But treasury income fell because of difficulty in
volatile markets.
COMMENT
Royal Bank's plea that its investments in infrastructure and technology will
bear fruit in future income, while Direct Line can avoid the trap of
cyclicality in general insurance, have fallen on deaf ears. The market has
started to mark down the premium in its earnings multiple, believing that 25
per cent dividend growth cannot be sustained. The fall in shares this week
has brought it back to a prospective multiple of about 8.8 times earnings
per share of 45p. Income pressure make it unlikely that a higher multiple is
justified.

FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Cater Allen edges up to Pounds 10.1m at
midway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Cater Allen Holdings, the discount house and banking
group, edged ahead from Pounds 9.85m to Pounds 10.1m in the six months to
October 31, partly because money market banking did not match the
'exceptionally high profit of the same period of 1993.'
Profits from this area declined to Pounds 2.99m (Pounds 5.27m), while stock
lending activities grew to Pounds 5.83m (Pounds 3.75m). Offshore trust and
banking business made Pounds 1.96m (Pounds 1.86m) and losses from Lloyd's
agencies were reduced to Pounds 546,000 (Pounds 1.12m). Financial futures
brought in Pounds 295,000 (Pounds 440,000).
In June the group launched a Pounds 32.3m rights issue and in August it
acquired the banking operations of Jupiter Tyndall, the asset management
group, and Compass Trust Group, a Jersey-based trust. Cater said the latter
deal would extend its trust business, which is part of its private banking
business on the island. Sheppards Moneybrokers also received some of the
rights money.
Cater said the investment of the rights proceeds had earned a return of 15
per cent a year before tax.
Profits at Cater Allen Ltd, the money market bank and discount house, were
satisfactory, the group said, at a time when interest rates generally rose.
Cater said that, as an operator at the centre of the secured money market,
Cater Allen Ltd approved of the development of an open gilt repo market
after June 1995 to increase liquidity, efficiency and broaden investor
participation in the gilt-edged market.
Earnings per share declined to 24p (28p) and the interim dividend is held at
8p.

FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Conglomerate's Dollars 3.2bn gamble pays
off - How the Quantum deal has proved to be a smart Hanson move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Hanson acquired Quantum Chemical in a Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 1.95bn)
agreed deal last year most analysts on both sides of the Atlantic gave it a
cautious welcome.
Some described it as a risky Dollars 3.2bn punt on the chemicals cycle,
which only underlined the challenge Hanson faced in finding good
acquisitions.
A year later, even those who dismissed it as a punt now admit it has paid
off handsomely. Supporters point to it as evidence that Hanson can still
strike deals big and cheap enough to make a real difference.
Quantum is the biggest US deal Hanson has done, including the Dollars 2.5bn
of debt which came with the company.
While the returns are unlikely to match those generated by SCM, the
chemicals group bought by Hanson in 1985 and subsequently broken up, Quantum
is already paying off. Some analysts say it could rank as one of Hanson's
most successful.
The timing of some of Hanson's recent deals has been far from perfect. With
Quantum, however, it was spot on. It bought the company just as it had
completed a heavy investment programme and was planning to rationalise.
More important, it pounced just as the price cycle for Quantum's products
had bottomed. 'It was miraculous,' says Mr David Clarke, chief executive of
the US arm, Hanson Industries. 'Almost on the day we completed prices of
Quantum's products began picking up.'
Five price rises later Quantum is making good money out of polyethylene, the
plastic used in a wide range of packaging. Operating profits in the
chemicals business soared toPounds 122m with Suburban Propane, the gas
distributor that came with the deal, adding a further Pounds 54m. In 1993
the two combined made just Pounds 35m.
By refinancing Quantum's expensive junk debt Hanson almost halved its
interest bill, leaving a Pounds 100m contribution to pre-tax profits. After
allowing for the shares issued in exchange for Quantum's equity, the deal
enhanced Hanson's earnings per share by 3 per cent, more than expected at
the time of the deal.
Apart from the price recovery and debt refinancing Quantum appears to have
responded to a process of 'Hansonisation'. It has strengthened the
management while retaining most of the principal executives, advanced the
rationalisation programme already in train, and identified new cost savings.
In line with the new emphasis on internally generated growth, Hanson has
turned on the capital spending tap. Mr Clarke last month announced a Dollars
438m investment programme for the chemicals division, of which Dollars 289m
is earmarked for Quantum. This will increase polyethylene capacity by almost
a fifth and ethylene capacity by nearly a quarter.
Mr Clarke believes that, with a lower cost base and higher capacity, Quantum
can surpass its previous record profits of Dollars 711m in 1988. Mr David
Ireland, analyst at Hanson's brokers Hoare Govett, thinks the chemical
business could make Dollars 750m in 1997.
Other observers are not as bullish and point to the likelihood of prices
softening in the middle of next year as new capacity comes on stream. But
with demand for polypropylene increasing at twice the rate of economic
growth that capacity should be absorbed quickly.
Mr Clarke says he is 'very optimistic' about the long-term prospects for
Quantum and is convinced there will be similar deals. 'They are there. It is
just a question of finding them,' he says.

FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hanson shows accelerating growth -
Underlying profits increase gathers pace to 19% in second half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson saw an accelerating improvement in operating profits in the year to
September 30, with an underlying increase of 8 per cent in the first half,
rising to 19 per cent in the second.
UK profit growth of 14 per cent slightly outpaced Hanson
Industries in the US, which showed a 12 per cent improvement excluding
Quantum.
Profits at the Peabody coal business in the US more than doubled to Pounds
144m (Pounds 70m) following the settlement of its costly strike, which cost
Pounds 76m (Pounds 125m).
Last month, Peabody paid Exxon Pounds 230m for two low-sulphur coal mines in
Wyoming, which will help boost production by 50 per cent this year.
Three-quarters of its production is now low-sulphur coal, where prices are
expected to firm over the next few years. Because of new clean air
legislation Hanson expects the price of high-sulphur coal to decline gently,
falling by between Dollars 1 and Dollars 2 a tonne this year.
There was strong growth from the Beazer US aggregates business, where
profits jumped 59 per cent to Pounds 48m, and a third record year at
Cavenham forest products, with profits up 9 per cent to Pounds 116m.
However, average timber prices tailed off in the second half, partly due to
slower housing starts, and Cavenham is expecting slightly lower profits this
year.
The main downturn in the US was at SCM Chemicals, the world's largest
producer of titanium dioxide pigment. Although sales were up 5 per cent to
Pounds 615m, profits fell 18 per cent to Pounds 71m as prices slid 2 per
cent. This reflects new capacity at Du Pont and SCM itself, together with
the lingering effect of recession. But prices appear to have bottomed with
Du Pont, the market leader, posting an increase from January.
With the industry still operating at under 90 per cent capacity, a sharp
recovery is not expected, but SCM is predicting steady improvement for the
rest of the 1990s.
Most of the smaller US businesses performed well. Ertl, the toy maker whose
planned flotation has been shelved, increased its contribution by 39 per
cent to Pounds 20m, but profits at Grove Crane nearly halved to Pounds 12m.
In the UK, profits growth was driven largely by ARC aggregates, which was up
by nearly two-thirds to Pounds 69m thanks to a sharp increase in margins;
and Hanson Brick where profits rose more than 40 per cent to Pounds 23.5m.
With shortages appearing in certain areas, the company is taking some brick
kilns out of mothballs.
After a flat first half, Imperial Tobacco turned in profits up 7 per cent to
Pounds 328m despite an estimated 3.8 per cent decline in the market.
Imperial increased its market share by 1.3 points to 36.8 per cent and
pushed through a price increase in April. It believes that price and duty
rises are now having less impact on volumes because the market has 'hit the
hard core smokers'.
Hanson raised more than Pounds 945m from disposals in the year helping to
reduce debt from Pounds 3.4bn to Pounds 2.3bn.
Gearing was cut from 86 per cent to 51 per cent, but has since risen to 58
per cent following the purchase of the US mines and Scholes in the UK.

FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Leeds Group makes 5% improvement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite a 'fragile' UK market, Leeds Group, the textile dyer and printer,
reported a 5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.23m to
Pounds 7.62m for the year to September 30.
The group also said it was close to selling its 23.1 per cent stake in the
West Yorkshire Insurance Company.
Turnover was up 12 per cent to Pounds 52.9m (Pounds 47.1m). Earnings per
share edged up to 19.3p (19p). The final dividend is 4.2p making a total of
6.3p (5.7p).

FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: BFI set for victory in Attwoods bid battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for Attwoods was all but over last night with hostile predator
Browning-Ferris Industries of the US believed to have acceptances for
substantially more than 55 per cent of the UK company.
The Pounds 391m cash bid needed acceptances of just 50.1 per cent to go
unconditional. Earlier this week, BFI revealed it had won almost 43 per
cent.
BFI refused to comment, but did say it was 'very confident of success'.
However, it is believed that Attwoods' two largest shareholders, Fidelity
and Templeton Investments, had either accepted by last night or were in the
process of doing so.
Fidelity holds 11 per cent of Attwoods and Templeton about 13 per cent. This
would give BFI 54 per cent, after allowing for the 29.8 per cent stake held
by Laidlaw of Canada. Laidlaw agreed to sell its shares to BFI under the
original lower offer of 109p per ordinary and 85p per preference share.
Last month, BFI raised the bid to 116.75p per ordinary and 92p per
preference share, and promised to pay the proposed 3.25p final dividend.
Attwoods' shares closed steady yesterday at 117p.
The Attwoods camp was last night reluctant to concede defeat before today's
deadline. Nevertheless, it appears that shareholders have rejected the waste
company's promise to return greater value through a break-up plan, in spite
of interest from both Waste Management Inter-
national and Cleanaway in the UK businesses.
Analysts in London said the break-up had offered 'too little, too late' to
tempt shareholders away from BFI's cash offer.
Meanwhile, BFI announced it had won government approval for the takeover of
Attwoods' businesses, which include substantial operations in Florida and
the mid-Atlantic states. But it will have to sell a number of routes in four
states.

FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Emerson agrees bid for Control - Offer of
525p a share values electronic drives group at 204m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emerson Electric of the US yesterday made a recommended cash offer of 525p a
share for Control Techniques, valuing the electronic drives group at Pounds
204m.
The shares, which jumped sharply last month after the Powys-based group
announced that it was in takeover talks with Emerson, closed 7p up at 521p.
Following the bid announcement Emerson, which already held 11.4m shares in
Control Techniques, equivalent to a 29.4 per cent stake, snapped up a
further 3.07m shares at 525p in the market. Directors and their families
have agreed to sell their 15.2 per cent holding.
As a result the US group now holds, has agreed to purchase or has received
irrevocable acceptances covering a total of 20.4m shares, representing 52.5
per cent of the target's equity. Analysts viewed the deal as 'cut and
dried'.
Emerson, advised by Goldman Sachs, said its offer represented a premium of
36.4 per cent over the middle market closing price of 385p on November 4,
immediately before the announcement of the takeover discussions.
Control Techniques also announced results yesterday for the year to
September 30. Based on its earnings per share of 19.7p (15.3p), the offer
represents a historic multiple of 26.6. There is a full loan note
alternative to the cash offer.
Despite a weak first half, Control pushed up annual pre-tax profits by 36
per cent to Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 9.1m). Sales rose 10 per cent to Pounds
116m (Pounds 105.3m).
A second interim dividend of 7p a share, makes a total of 9.6p (7.5p).
Mr Trevor Wheatley, chairman, said the outlook had changed dramatically in
the space of one year. 'We are witnessing significant increases in activity
levels as a result of greatly increased orders from all around the world.'
Control Techniques was set up as a specialised manufacturer of drives or
controllers for electric motors in 1973 and has become one of the top three
in Europe in its market niche, competing with companies such as Asea Brown
Boveri, Toshiba and Mitsubishi.
The relationship between the two companies dates back to 1991 when Control
acquired 80 per cent of ICD Drives, a New York subsidiary of Emerson, in
exchange for 7.6m Control shares. ICD Drives was later renamed CT Drives.

FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Siebe paying Pounds 22.7m for two
lossmakers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Siebe, the international controls group, yesterday unveiled its second
acquisition in as many weeks with the announcement of plans to pay Pounds
22.7m in cash for two lossmaking appliance controls companies.
Siebe is buying Appliance Controls Technology, with operations in the UK and
US, for Pounds 13m and 75 per cent of Eliwell of Italy for Pounds 9.7m. Last
month it paid Dollars 90m for Triconex of the US, which makes shutdown
systems for the oil and gas industries.
Mr Allen Yurko, Siebe's chief executive, said the purchases would strengthen
the group's product range. 'They particularly expand our presence in the
laundry, dishwasher and refrigeration segments of the market.'
Both companies bring some debt, although Siebe would not specify the level.
ACT incurred a loss last year of Pounds 700,000 on sales of Pounds 23.1m.
Eliwell's losses in the last 12 months were Pounds 500,000 on sales of
Pounds 17.1m.
Siebe said the losses were largely due to heavy spending by both companies
on research and development.
The UK company also has the option to purchase the outstanding 25 per cent
of Eliwell within three years.

Alba, the consumer electronics group, reported a 25 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.63m to Pounds 2.03m for the six months to
September 30 on turnover up 27 per cent to Pounds 63.5m, against Pounds
50.1m.
Goodmans, the consumer electronics group acquired in May for Pounds 3.6m,
contributed Pounds 8.74m in sales but returned a loss of Pounds 23,000. Mr
Daniel Harris, chief executive, said that Goodmans, which had been expected
to break even, would be profitable by the year end.
Mr Harris said that all divisions had raised profits. The Hinari domestic
appliance division increased sales by 25 per cent. Sales at both the UK
brown goods companies, Alba Radio and Bush Radio, were also up.
Earnings per share increased 32 per cent to 3.46p (2.63p) and the interim
dividend is 1.1p (1p).

FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: BPB shrugs off price war reports with 73%
jump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BPB Industries, Europe's biggest plasterboard manufacturer, yesterday
shrugged off reports that a price war had restarted in Germany by announcing
a 73 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 44m to Pounds 76.1m in the
six months to September 30.
Mr Jean-Pierre Cuny, chief executive, said that prices on average had fallen
by 9 per cent in Germany during the previous 12 months.
Knauf, the largest German producer, however, had just announced rises of
between 10 and 15 per cent in Germany and 6.5 per cent in the UK to take
effect early next year. There was every indication that these price rises
would stick, said Mr Cuny.
He expected prices to rise by about 4 per cent in France.
Group profits in the first half, in the absence of further price recovery,
had grown strongly on the back of record plasterboard sales as construction
markets, particularly for housing, had begun to pick up in many European
countries.
Group turnover had risen by 9 per cent to Pounds 625m (Pounds 574.3m).
Earnings per share rose from 6p to 10.4p with an increased interim dividend
of 3.1p (2.8p).
Operating profits rose by 49 per cent to Pounds 76.6m (Pounds 51.3m), while
a much reduced interest bill of Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 11.8m) further enhanced
the pre-tax rise.
Mr Cuny said operating profits were significantly higher in the UK and
France, while German profits were also higher because of increased sales,
particularly in eastern Germany, underpinned by high demand for housing.
Mr Cuny said plasterboard profits in Canada and South Africa had also risen
sharply. The two regions regions account for about 18 per cent of BPB sales.
Elsewhere paper and packaging improved from a Pounds 0.3m loss to Pounds
6.8m profits due to sharply reduced restructuring costs, which offset a 49
per cent average rise in waste paper prices. Operating profits would have
fallen by 4 per cent if reorganisation costs were excluded.
A strong cash flow meant that group net borrowings fell to Pounds 116m
(Pounds 141.2m at March 31), reducing gearing from 29.6 per cent to 15.5 per
cent since September 1993.
COMMENT
A 2p rise in BPB's share price to 295p on a day when the market fell sharply
reflects well on the group. The economic tide is now moving in its favour in
most of its markets promising further sales increases. BPB, provided the
price skirmish in Germany is ended and does not spill over into other
markets, should enjoy further increases in plasterboard operating margins
already approaching 13 per cent. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 160m puts the
group on a prospective PE of 13 1/2 this year reducing to 11 the following
year on profits of Pounds 205m; still good value.

FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Leeds' staff told of merger impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Substantial closures in the branch network of the Leeds Permanent Building
Society are unlikely for a year at least, despite the plans to merge with
Halifax Building Society, Leeds' staff representatives have been told by the
society's management.
The national council of the Leeds' staff association met yesterday for the
first time since the proposed merger between two of the UK's largest
societies was announced.
Its members approved 11 general principles to be followed in discussions
with the Leeds' managers, including full disclosure of information about the
merger, a commitment to no redundancies and the introduction of a voluntary
early retirement plan.
In March the 10m members who own the two societies will have the chance to
vote on the merger plans. Their consent is needed for the move to go ahead.
There is considerable overlap in the 1,100 branches operated by the two
societies, so some branches are likely to close and some jobs to be lost.
Staff representatives are emphasising that where branches do close, most
employees should be able to transfer to other offices locally. Going through
the full consultation procedures before branch closures would take about a
year.
Mr Jon Foulds, Halifax chairman, said last week that where branches were too
close together, the idea of using some of them as financial services advice
centres would be carefully examined.
Though neither society has ruled out compulsory redundancies, it is clear
they would prefer jobs to go voluntarily.

FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Brothers triumph at Barr
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rebel shareholders at Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust yesterday claimed a
costly victory in the family feud over the motor and leisure group, writes
Richard Wolffe.
The rebels, led by brothers Nicholas and Robert Barr, succeeded in their
attempts to join the board in place of both the chief executive and finance
director.
The Barr brothers now share the boardroom with their uncle, Mr Malcolm Barr,
whom they had earlier asked to stand down as chairman.
At an extraordinary general meeting held in Leeds yesterday, the brothers
voted to unseat Mr John Parker, chief executive, and Mr Brian Small, the
finance director.
However, the board said the rebels' campaign had cost the company about
Pounds 1m in severance payments and extraordinary meetings - equivalent to
more than 20 per cent of pre-tax profits last year.
The Barr brothers, who speak for almost 30 per cent of ordinary voting
shares, reaffirmed their intention to demerge the two divisions, and
enfranchise the non-voting A shares.
They also appointed their leisure industry adviser, Mr Helmut Schweimler, to
the board.
The boardroom coup follows the collapse of a compromise deal between the
board and the rebels last weekend.

FT  02 DEC 94 / RJB Mining gets pits price cut by Pounds 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RJB Mining, the coal company bidding for the English mines of British Coal,
is expected to tell investors today it has agreed with the government that
it will pay nearly Pounds 100m less than the Pounds 914m it originally
offered.
The company's pathfinder prospectus is understood to show that the 'due
diligence' exercise, involving detailed inspection of the regions's assets,
has reduced the agreed price to between Pounds 815m and Pounds 820m.
The pathfinder, due to be published today, is also expected to disclose that
RJB has negotiated to pay only Pounds 700m initially, with the balance to be
settled in staged payments over two to three years.
As a result of the changes, RJB is seeking to raise about Pounds 900m in
debt and equity. It had previously told institutional investors that it
would need Pounds 1.05bn. Neither RJB nor the government would yesterday
comment on the deal. RJB was unable to confirm the details in the
pathfinder.
The Pounds 100m reduction in the deal price is less than some of RJB's rival
bidders had been expecting. However the Pounds 815m to Pounds 820m final
price, if confirmed, will be considerably higher than the next highest
offer.
Only one other company, English Coal, a management buy-out team led by Mr
Bob Siddall, put in a bid for all three regions and it is thought to have
offered considerably less than Pounds 600m. Mr Malcolm Edwards's Coal
Investments tendered about Pounds 510m for the two central regions where
most of the assets are located.
RJB's bid has caused considerable controversy, as it was based on
projections for future markets which are considerably more optimistic than
other bidders believe likely.
RJB, floated on the stock exchange only last year, has a market
capitalisation of less than Pounds 160m. However, the reduction in the final
price is likely to ease its task in raising funds. The company will tell
investors it no longer needs to raise Pounds 100m through a corporate bond
issue which it and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, its adviser, had planned.
The planned bank debt of Pounds 528m is thought to have been reduced to
about Pounds 500m. RJB also needs to raise about Pounds 400m through an
issue of shares, against a previous Pounds 425m.
Today's pathfinder is expected to be followed by a full prospectus in the
next two weeks in which the price of the shares on offer will be revealed.
BZW is then expected to announce that the deal has been underwritten.
Although the share offer will be aimed at institutions, private investors
will be offered at least 5 per cent of the equity.
The English regions comprise 15 of British Coal's 16 deep mines which remain
in operation and 14 opencast sites.

FT  02 DEC 94 / VW and Ford to end joint venture in Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY and KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen and Ford are to break up their partnership in Autolatina, Latin
America's biggest carmaker and one of the biggest joint ventures in the
world auto industry. The two companies announced yesterday that they had
agreed on 'a gradual separation process leading toward dissolution' within a
year of the Autolatina joint venture in Brazil and Argentina.
The joint venture, which was formed in 1987, is owned 51 per cent by
Germany's VW, Europe's biggest carmaker, and 49 per cent by Ford of the US,
the world's second-largest vehicle maker.
Mr Wayne Booker, executive vice-president for Ford's international
automotive operations, said Ford believed that it would 'be better able to
compete effectively in these two markets by operating on its own'. In the
second half of the 1980s, 'difficult market and economic conditions' had
made the co-operation a good strategy, but conditions were now
'significantly different in both countries'. Autolatina Brasil was the
country's largest private-sector company last year with sales of Dollars
7.2bn (Pounds 4.4bn) and production of 612,000 vehicles.
The separation had been expected for some time. In August, Autolatina
Brasil, which has 47,000 workers in Brazil, said it would no longer launch
new hybrid models built on shared production platforms, but instead use the
world platforms supplied by the parent companies.
The decision was partly triggered by pressure from VW car dealers, who were
reluctant to turn over the platform for the new model of Brazil's
best-selling Gol car to Ford, and by a realisation that consumer brand
awareness was suffering. The companies had been concerned that Autolatina's
structure was holding back their growth in Brazil's booming car market.
Since 1990, Ford's market share has slumped from 18.8 to 12 per cent while
VW is down from 37.4 to 33.6 per cent. During the same period Fiat's
subsidiary has nearly doubled its market share to 26.2 per cent.
Autolatina executives say the dissolution was the result of Brazil's move
from a closed economy to an increasingly open one as well as the increased
globalisation of the car industry.
When the holding company was created in 1987, Brazil's economy was generally
closed to international competition and car sales were depressed. Joining
forces allowed Ford and VW to pool investment and production costs.
But since 1990 the economy has been gradually opened, leading to growing
competition from imports, and in the last two years Brazil's car market has
boomed thanks to lower prices sparked by falling taxes and higher
productivity. Brazilian vehicle production soared from 1.07m vehicles in
1992 to a probable 1.6m this year.
Disentangling VW and Ford from Autolatina is likely to be a long and
complicated process.
In Brazil they jointly operate seven plants, six of which are in the state
of Sao Paulo, making engines, transmission systems and other parts. They
also operate jointly in areas such as purchasing, administration, finance
and legal services.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Advisers to be appointed for National Grid float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is about to appoint financial advisers on the forthcoming
flotation of the National Grid Company, Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister,
said yesterday.
National Grid is owned by the 12 regional electricity companies in England
and Wales, but the government holds a golden share and wants to ensure that
electricity customers as well as shareholders benefit from the Pounds 4bn
sell-off.
The decision to appoint advisers underlines the political sensitivity of the
flotation, even though it involves companies privatised five years ago.
Earlier this week, Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, and Mr Eggar
held discussions with the regional companies about their plans, providing a
further indication of the close interest that the government will be taking
in the flotation.
Mr Eggar said his department had not yet formed a view about the proposals.
'There are clearly issues about the split between shareholder and customer
and taxman. But we are at a very preliminary stage.' He expected advisers to
be appointed 'very quickly'.
Under plans being circulated for discussion, the regional companies would
inject Pounds 750m to Pounds 1bn of debt into National Grid to enable it to
pay them a large dividend. The companies would use this money to pay capital
gains tax of about Pounds 1bn on the sale of their National Grid shares, and
make a payout of about Pounds 10 to all domestic electricity consumers.
Yesterday Seeboard, the regional company serving the south-east, said it
would demerge its holding in National Grid by transferring its shares to its
own shareholders. It would also pass some of the benefits of the flotation
to its customers, though it declined to say how much. This was the first
time a regional company had formally indicated its preferred method for
handling the flotation. Each company will choose its own way. Although the
majority are expected to use the Seeboard route, some may keep the value
from the flotation within the company rather than give it to shareholders.
Sir Keith Stuart, the chairman of Seeboard, said that by the time his
company had paid capital gains tax on National Grid shares and paid its
customers, it expected to be 'modestly' out of pocket. However, he believed
this was the best way of maximising value for his shareholders.

FT  02 DEC 94 / GrandMet chief calls shake-up complete
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grand Metropolitan, the drinks and food group, yesterday unveiled details of
its second large restructuring charge in two years, costing Pounds 280m and
2,600 jobs, and said there would be no need for a third. 'We have completed,
or have provided for, all major restructuring projects for the foreseeable
future,' said Lord Sheppard, chairman, announcing a 5 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 654m for the year to September 30.
Pre-tax profits before charges and other exceptional items rose 3.7 per cent
to Pounds 945m on flat turnover from continuing opera-tions of Pounds
7.63bn. Pillsbury foods in the US and Burger King were the strongest
performers. Drinks profits worldwide were down as were food profits in
Europe.
Most of the money saved by cost-cutting is being spent on increased
marketing. The budget rose 3 per cent last year to Pounds 900m with most of
the increase spent on North American food. It will rise modestly this year
with drinks getting most of the increase. IDV, GrandMet's drinks division,
will lose 1,500 jobs and European foods 900 in the latest two-year
restructuring. In total, 500 UK jobs will go and 1,000 in continental
Europe.
Operating profits from IDV fell 8 per cent in the latest year to Pounds 520m
with Europe and the rest of the world suffering more than North America.
Volumes were flat overall but margins suffered from a change in product mix
and destocking, particularly in the US where volume was down 2.9 per cent.
The UK was the only market to show growth but GrandMet said continental
countries were beginning to show encouraging growth signs.
Operating profits from food rose 24 per cent to Pounds 497m despite a 20 per
cent fall in Europe to Pounds 12m. Acquisitions, cost-cutting, new products
and a rebound in Green Giant's canned vegetables boosted Pillsbury. Burger
King's like-for-like store sales were up more than 6 per cent.
Net debt fell by Pounds 866m to Pounds 2.16bn thanks to disposals and a 26
per cent rise in free cash flow to Pounds 642m. Gearing dropped to 60 per
cent from 81 per cent.
The board recommended a final dividend of 8.8p to make 13.95p for the year,
up 7.3 per cent. Earnings per share were 21.6p (19.9p) after charges, and
32.2p (29.6p) before.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Hanson shops around after rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson shares continued their recent recovery yesterday as the Anglo-US
conglomerate reported a 26 per cent increase in annual operating profits to
Pounds 1.23bn and said it was ready to take on another big acquisition.
The shares have lagged the market this year on worries that the group was
running out of steam. But Lord Hanson, chairman, declared yesterday that its
future 'remains exciting'.
'The economic resurgence has provided a stimulus to improve trading profits
still further, while seeking strategic opportunities to enhance shareholder
value,' he said.
Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive, said the group had excellent opportunities
for organic growth but was also ready to take on another big deal. 'The
balance sheet is in a position to make another major step forward if we find
the opportunity. That is certainly what we are looking for.'
Last year's operating profits, of which 54 per cent (against 43 per cent)
were generated in the US, were boosted by the acquisition of Quantum
Chemical in a Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 1.95bn) deal in September 1993, which
contributed Pounds 100m after interest. Gearing, which rose to 86 per cent
on completion, has now been reduced to 58 per cent, after Pounds 945m of
disposals.
Including disposal gains, group pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 1.35bn, from
Pounds 1.02bn, on sales of Pounds 11.2bn (Pounds 9.76bn). Excluding
exceptional items, profits were little changed at Pounds 1.01bn (Pounds
992m) and earnings per share, on the same basis, were 14.7p (14.4p). As
previously signalled, the quarterly dividend is 3p (2.85p) for a total of
11.7p (11.4p).
Mr Bonham said that Hanson wanted to combine dividend growth with a gradual
reduction in cover from 1.25 times to about 1.5.
The figures were accompanied by an upbeat assessment of prospects for the
next two years. Mr David Clarke, chief executive of the US arm, Hanson
Industries, said: 'We are very much on a roll, particularly with Quantum. We
are even more enthusiastic about prospects for 1995 despite recent interest
rate hikes.'
Most of Hanson's cyclical chemicals and constructionrelated businesses are
recovering strongly on both sides of the Atlantic, while profits at Peabody,
the largest US coal producer, bounced to Pounds 144m (Pounds 70m) following
the end of the long and expensive strike.
The improvement in operating profit was largely offset by an interest bill
of Pounds 223m (compared with income of Pounds 14m the previous year). This
reflected higher borrowings but also the reduced spread between US and UK
interest rates which Hanson has arbitraged very successfully.
Mr William Landuyt, finance director, warned that the interest bill was
likely to rise again this year.
The shares added 2p to 237p.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Berlusconi averts strike with retreat on pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government yesterday averted a damaging general strike due today
by making concessions to the country's trade unions over pension reform and
cuts in welfare payments.
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, insisted that the concessions did
not alter the overall aim of the 1995 budget to find an extra L50,000bn
(Pounds 2.8bn) in spending cuts and fresh revenues.
The agreement will now ensure the approval of the 1995 budget in parliament,
but it has underlined the weaknesses of Mr Berlusconi's coalition and does
nothing to remove the threat of the Northern League, his most troublesome
coalition partner, leaving the government.
The financial markets reacted cautiously but positively, with the lira
strengthening against the D-Mark to L1,027 against Wednesday's L1,029.
Analysts said the markets were relieved that the destabilising consequences
of a serious confrontation between government and the unions had been headed
off. But they reserved judgment until the government detailed how it would
cover the L4,000bn cost of the deal with the unions.
The agreement was reached against the threat of an eight-hour general strike
in a marathon 22-hour negotiating session.
Cuts in Italy's costly state pension system were an integral part of the
money-saving measures proposed in the 1995 budget. The unions had carried
out a four-hour general strike on October 14 and on November 12 mobilised
1.5m people at a protest in Rome against the cuts. The unions argued that
pension reform had to be considered more carefully and should not be linked
directly to next year's budget.
The government refused to accept that argument, afraid the budget would be
diluted and pension reform postponed. However, the populist Northern League
had increasingly sided with the unions against its rightwing coalition
partners, and the government faced a tough battle in the senate where it
lacked a clear majority.
Mr Berlusconi agreed yesterday to allow until June for the preparation of
pension reform and made the unions leading partners in the discussions. This
means dropping two key proposals - penalising early retirement and a
reduction in the rate at which pensions entitlements accrue.
In return the unions have agreed to a freeze on new people eligible to start
taking up their pension entitlements actually doing so until June.
The rightwing coalition also took on board union requests to earmark more
funds to boost employment in the south, raise investment in research and
development and training, as well as provide more help for low income
families. The government will also return some L1,000bn during 1995 lost to
wage earners through fiscal drag.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Foreign investors increase holdings of UK shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign ownership of shares in British companies rose significantly last
year for the fourth successive year, official figures yesterday showed.
With most of the growth coming from US investors, the figures provide a
further indication that the movement of US money abroad is having a
significant effect on the UK market.
The Central Statistical Office said overseas investors were estimated to
have held 16.3 per cent of the total number of shares on the UK stock market
last year. Those holdings were worth about Pounds 130.2bn at end-1993, a
rise of 49.6 per cent on the previous year.
The figures show that US investors accounted for almost half of all overseas
investment in the UK market at the end of 1993. The shift abroad was part of
a trend towards greater asset diversification. Total US investment rose to
at least Pounds 49.2bn in 1993, up from Pounds 37.1bn in 1992.
The figures also suggest that foreign investors are buying the UK shares
with the highest market capitalisation.
Mr Jim Waterman, senior vice-president at InterSec Research, a US-based
consulting firm that tracks pension fund investment, suggested that was
because US fund managers are building portfolios modelled on stock indices.
Those are made up mostly of the biggest shares.
Foreign interest in the UK has risen sharply from 1992, when overseas
investors owned Pounds 80.7bn worth of stock, 13.2 per cent of the total
number of shares.
UK pension funds continued to be the largest owners of UK shares last year,
although their holdings, about a third of total equity, fell slightly.
The holdings of individual British investors fell in 1993 to 17.7 per cent
of total equity, down from 20.4 per cent in 1992.
The CSO said unit trusts, which also represent individual shareholders, held
6.6 per cent of all equities. However, the downward trend in individual
shareholding, means that overseas investors now hold almost as much stock in
percentage terms as UK insurance companies and individuals.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Moscow masses troops on borders of rebel Chechnya
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOZDOK ON THE CHECHEN BORDER, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian military's impatience to crack down on the rebel republic of
Chechnya was evident last night in the Interior Ministry's border garrison
at Mozdok, where armour and troops were massing.
'(President Boris) Yeltsin should have done this two years ago,' said Lt-Col
Vladimir Mozhaev, commander of the garrison. 'Chechnya is a banana republic,
forcing us Russians to run about at its will.'
The large-scale preparations appeared to point to an imminent invasion of
the rebel republic. Military action aimed at replacing the regime of Gen
Dzhokar Dudayev, the Chechen president, would be the first serious conflict
under Mr Yeltsin's presidency.
The crisis has been building since Chechnya declared independence from
Russia in 1991, and an attack would have incalculable repercussions
throughout the troubled former Soviet republics of the Caucasus region. It
would also boost nationalist sentiment within Russia.
Mr Yeltsin last night reissued an ultimatum to the warring factions in
Chechnya to stop fighting. But he withdrew an earlier threat to impose a
state of emergency in Chechnya, leading to hopes that a peaceful solution
could still be found to the crisis.
A Russian parliamentary delegation, led by Mr Sergei Yushenkov, head of the
defence committee, yesterday held talks with senior Chechen government
officials in the capital, Grozny.
As the Russian military build-up went on, transport aircraft flew in troops
and equipment to Mozdok last night. The roads around the base were choked
with tanks, armoured personnel carriers, engineering equipment and lorries
crammed with soldiers, automatic rifles in their hands.
At Vladikavkaz, the nearby North Ossetian capital, a battalion of
paratroopers arrived early yesterday with more tanks and armour. Mozdok and
Vladikavkaz are only 30 minutes' drive from the Chechen frontier.
Aircraft meanwhile carried out a third round of bombing raids on Grozny.
According to Russian reports, the raid from Mozdok smashed aircraft and
bombed fuel dumps in the military and civilian airfields near Grozny,
destroying all of the republic's small and antiquated air force of a dozen
or so aircraft.
Amid pictures of Soviet military heroes and communist slogans, Col Mozhaev
and his staff were frank in their hatred of the nationalist pretensions of
Chechnya and confident they could end Gen Dudayev's rule.
'Gen (Pavel) Grachev (Russian defence minister) said we could take Grozny in
two hours with a battalion of paratroopers. I think it would be quicker. We
need to act like the Americans in Haiti - quickly take it, and that's it.'

FT  02 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: 3i
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
3i's flotation in July was launched in less than ideal market conditions.
But since then the shares have outperformed the FT-SE 100 Index by 16 per
cent. Europe's largest investor in unquoted companies is now priced at net
asset value, compared with a 13.5 per cent discount when floated. With one
exception, it is the highest rated investment trust on the London market.
So far, the stock's performance is justified. 3i is unusually conservative
when valuing its assets and making provisions for businesses that might go
under. That means that when divesting equity stakes, the sums it receives
are on average considerably higher than book value. Such capital gains might
have been undermined by the current disenchantment with flotations, but
trade sales are more than compensating.
The shares have also been buoyed by its businesses' growth prospects. Small
companies are expected by some to post earnings growth three times that of
Footsie stocks next year and twice as great in 1996. In the long term, the
group's development is underpinned by its ambition to repeat its UK success
elsewhere in Europe. 3i has forged ahead with plans to set up a fund
management scheme for several continental markets.
Concerns remain, however. The recovery may already have been anticipated in
the price. Moreover, a shadow is likely to be cast over the stock by fears
that the banks, which still control 50 per cent of 3i's equity, will be
tempted to sell their remaining stake when they can next June.

FT  02 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Grand Metropolitan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was nothing sinister about the revelation that Grand Metropolitan
earned Pounds 64m in operating profits from the sale of Burger King
restaurants to franchisees last year. But the figure was higher than
expected and arguably should have been taken below the line as the profits
did not arise from normal trading. It raised a question-mark about the
quality of the group's profits from food - otherwise one of the highlights
of yesterday's figures.
Strong cash-flow was another plus point, but this was outweighed by the poor
performance from drinks. Here, operating profits dropped 8 per cent overall,
with a fall of 4 per cent in the US. Special factors, such as a major
destocking, help explain this. But the data underscored just how difficult
conditions are in the international drinks markets. The pick-up in the US
economy has not led to any corresponding increase in prices. They rose by a
modest 1 per cent worldwide, denying the group the benefits of
inflation-driven operational gearing. High marketing expenditure could not
fend off the pricing pressure. The group plans to step up its marketing
expenditure but so great are the competitive pressures that this cannot be
expected to trigger a surge in prices.
Under the circumstances, GrandMet's lowly rating compared to Allied Domecq
or Guinness is not a compelling argument for buying GrandMet's shares. A
narrowing of the differential is as likely to come from a de-rating of the
other companies' shares as from a revaluation of GrandMet.

Seeboard deserves two cheers for advancing shareholder interests. The first
cheer is for yesterday's 21 per cent increase in its interim dividend per
share. Such an increase may not have been hard to finance, given its cash
pile. The temptation could have been to raise the dividend by the 17 per
cent which prevailed last year. The total sum paid out has, in fact, gone up
17 per cent; but because the company also recently bought back 5 per cent of
its equity, dividends per share rose more. Where Seeboard has shown the way,
other electricity companies would do well to follow.
The second cheer is for Seeboard's statement that it plans to distribute all
its stock in the National Grid direct to its shareholders. That is despite
the fact that it will experience a 'modest' cash outflow, because the
special dividend to be paid to the recs from the Grid will not quite cover
capital gains tax and rebates to customers. The temptation might have been
to keep a few Grid shares and then sell them in the market to cover any cash
shortfall. Again, all recs are so overcapitalised that they should follow
Seeboard's practice. Where Seeboard was disappointing was in refusing to
promise future share buy-backs or special dividends. Seeboard and other recs
could easily live with gearing over 50 per cent, which would imply returning
cash to shareholders much more aggressively than hitherto. One hopes the
management's coyness merely reflects a desire to keep a third cheer up its
sleeve for the moment.

FT  02 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Quantum leaps
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rebound in profits at Quantum Chemical Corporation has proved stronger
than Hanson anticipated when it made the acquisition last year. After
appearing to lose its touch with other recent transactions, Hanson has once
again timed a deal to perfection. The purchase looks set to sustain annual
earnings growth for the group at well over 20 per cent for the next two
years.
The problem is that the Quantum deal has brought not just short-term
dynamism to Hanson's earnings. It has also turned Hanson into a more
cyclical company than it was. Profits which are rising sharply will one day
drop just as rapidly, if not more so. This fear has driven Hanson's shares
down by 17 per cent against the market in the past year, forcing the yield
to a significant premium. If earnings growth enabled Hanson to pay higher
dividend increases than the market, the historic yield of more than 6 per
cent would be a strong signal to buy the shares. But earnings growth is
unlikely to prove sustainable beyond a peak in two to three years' time.
Moreover, post-tax operating cash-flow was only Pounds 323m - less than the
dividend payment of Pounds 568m. The second half showed an improvement over
the first and that is set to continue. But it is unlikely to do so strongly
enough to allow Hanson to increase its dividends aggressively at the same
time as rebuilding cover. Hanson's shares have outperformed over the last
month and were resilient yesterday as the market fell. This is appropriate,
given the group's success with Quantum. But a more far-reaching re-rating
will be hard to achieve.

FT  02 DEC 94 / The man is the message: A look at a change of corporate
culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the first things Mr Soren Gyll ordered at Volvo after the sudden
departure of Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar as chairman was the opening of the big
double doors that lead from the lobby at Volvo's hilltop headquarters
outside Gothenburg into the inner sanctum of executive management offices.
The opening of the doors, previously closed to all but a chosen few granted
a coded key card, was intended to symbolise a more accessible style of
management in a company dominated by Mr Gyllenhammar for more than two
decades. 'Such things are small details,' says Mr Gyll, Volvo's chief
executive. 'But they send signals.'
Mr Gyll is seeking a change of culture at Volvo to match the wholesale
change of strategy undertaken since the breakdown of the merger with
Renault. The emphasis is on openness and dialogue. Under Mr Gyllenhammar,
whose authoritarian style earned him the nickname 'the Kaiser', strategy and
orders came from only one quarter, the top.
Since the merger fiasco, Mr Gyll has consolidated his position at the head
of a senior management team that has undergone remarkably few changes, given
the trauma the company underwent.
Most of the present Volvo executive management team were closely involved in
the merger plan, and two of its members were to have been top-level
executives in the merged Renault-Volvo. Like Mr Gyll, they took part in the
public battle to win approval for the merger, advocating its merits.
Yet in the end several top managers joined an internal revolt which, once
endorsed by Mr Gyll, delivered the coup de grace to the merger. The way some
team members quickly embraced a strategy entirely at odds with the one to
which they had previously been committed might have strained their
credibility, but they have retained the confidence of investors and of the
new board headed by Mr Bert-Olof Svanholm, chief executive of the Swedish
arm of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group.
The main reason for this may lie with the burly, shirt-sleeved Mr Gyll. He
was hired by Mr Gyllenhammar in May 1992 from Procordia, a food and drugs
conglomerate then jointly controlled by Volvo and the Swedish state.
Under Mr Gyllenhammar's active executive chairmanship, Volvo had run through
four chief executives in eight years. But by the time the Renault merger was
announced in September 1993, Mr Gyll had managed to assert a strong
authority over Volvo's senior managers, who responded to his
straight-talking, open style.
'The management team had become Soren's team,' says Mr Mats Ringesten, now
head of Volvo group strategy after being brought by Mr Gyll from Procordia.
'It was a Volvo team, but with Soren at the helm - and it was that total
team that transformed its opinion (of the merger).'
Shareholders worried by the deep slide into losses Volvo had experienced in
the early 1990s were also reassured by Mr Gyll's firm approach. When it
emerged last year that Mr Gyll and his senior colleagues shared their
opposition to the merger, the shareholders were happy to see them continue
to manage the company.
Mr Gyll, 54, has quickly emerged as the new dominant figure at Volvo.
Although his only previous experience of the motor industry was a short
spell as a car salesman in his youth, his record of restructuring Procordia
is said by his supporters to equip him well for the task of refocusing Volvo
on its core vehicle operations and shedding its non-core interests.
Mr Gyll has been careful to avoid direct criticisms of a man who was 'Mr
Volvo' for 22 years. But he has no hesitation in agreeing that Volvo is
undergoing a change in culture. 'I hope so,' he says. 'At the moment we are
working hard on that. A company doesn't work if it doesn't have open
communication between people.'

Headhunters' delight on the Mexican job market these days is Pedro Aspe,
Mexico's long-standing finance minister left out of Ernesto Zedillo's new
cabinet, seemingly at his own behest.
Aspe, who had aspired to Zedillo's job himself, is apparently being courted,
for a lucrative 10-year contract, by Mexican plutocrat Roberto Hernandez,
who runs the Banamex financial group. Aspe's availability is also
engendering a certain amount of excitement on Wall Street - though it is not
known if he would condescend to work for the gringos.
In any event, Aspe has not, unlike many of his predecessors, left office
fabulously wealthy. So a few years on a chunky salary would presumably be
welcome - allowing him, for instance, to trade up from the holiday time
share he has in Puerto Vallarta.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At long last a British union boss is hot favourite to take up a full-time
post in an international organisation. Bill Jordan, current president of the
AEEU electrical and engineering union, appears to have secured the necessary
votes to become general secretary of the Brussels-based International
Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
This will come as a relief to the TUC which has been been lobbying hard to
get a Brit into the job. The ICFTU was born out of the cold war in 1949
originally as an anti-Communist front for trade unions from the western
world and for a long time it was concerned mainly in battling for free trade
unions in the Soviet Union. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the ICFTU has
been trying to find a new role championing trade union rights around the
world. The 58-year-old Jordan loves globe-trotting - he was in India
recently on a British trade mission. But the ICFTU is more than just a
source of junkets for ageing union bosses. He believes it has a vital role
to play, particularly in pushing for union freedoms in the developing
countries. Jordan's departure will trigger a bitter power struggle in the
AEEU. The first candidate to declare an interest in the presidency is
executive member John Weakley, but leftwinger Jimmy Airlie is also getting
in trim for the battle ahead.

Normally bankers just love an excuse to celebrate. The Bank of England has
been having heaps of fun celebrating its 300th birthday this year.
Yesterday, the supposedly canny folk at the Bank of Scotland went one better
by announcing plans to spend a whopping Pounds 3m on the bank's 300th
anniversary next year.
Apart from organising all sorts of good deeds in the community, the Bank of
Scotland has bought a tercentenary tapestry, commissioned two special
histories and organised a competition to find a new pipe tune, the Bank of
Scotland Tercentenary March.
It should not be too difficult for the Scots to come up with a more
memorable tune than the Geoffrey Burgon number specially commissioned by the
Bank of England for its 300th bash.
All this jollity from north of the border raises the question as to what
exactly happened to Barclays Bank's 300th birthday party. Depending on who
you talk to, Barclays was founded in 1690 or 1692.
However, its tercentenary seems to have come and gone unnoticed, and it has
crept back into its brand new headquarters at 54 Lombard Street without so
much as a whiff of a cocktail party.
Not the sort of thing that would have happened once upon a time, when
Barclays took pride in itself.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Up to speed once again: Volvo, the Swedish vehicle
manufacturer, is thriving after the collapse of its alliance plans with
Renault
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year after the spectacular collapse of its planned merger with Renault,
Volvo, the flagship of Swedish industry, appears to be in rude health.
Last December, a revolt by Volvo shareholders and senior management over the
merger plans led to the abrupt departure of Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the man at
the top of the company for more than two decades. The company looked
isolated with its strategy in tatters and its future unsure.
Yet within days, the Volvo share price began to climb and - despite
fluctuations - it still stands more than 60 per cent above the level of a
year ago. The company has been buoyed by a spectacular recovery in profits,
with operating income jumping to SKr6.6bn (Pounds 660m) in the first nine
months of 1994, compared with only SKr445m a year ago.
It is an unlikely change of fortune for Volvo. The company had spent
three-and-a-half years explaining that pressures in the world auto industry
 -such as rising development costs, globalisation and overcapacity - meant
that it could not survive alone. It needed a partner, said Mr Gyllenhammar,
and Renault, the French state-owned carmaker, fitted the bill.
The merger plans collapsed because shareholders and managers were concerned
that Volvo had been undervalued in the deal, and that the partnership was
turning into a takeover by Renault, a company that would still be under
French state control.
Mr Gyllenhammar condemned the critics of his vision as guilty of 'turning
their backs on Europe and the world'. They had 'reduced the probability of
Volvo's long-term survival', crushed the organisation and wounded the
company, he said.
A year on, Mr Gyllenhammar's condemnation of the failure of the merger looks
hollow. Volvo has bounced back, energised by what many in Sweden see as an
escape from Renault's clutches.
The company is setting the pace as the European truck industry emerges
unsteadily from recession. Its order book for trucks has doubled in the past
12 months and production of its Volvo brand trucks is running at a level 60
per cent higher than in the depth of the recession in mid-1993.
Volvo car sales worldwide were 18 per cent higher in the first nine months
of this year, and it has increased both sales and share in most of its
markets from Europe to Japan and the US.
The Gyllenhammar era was dominated by repeated attempts at diversification
and alliances aimed at spreading the risks of operating in as cyclical a
sector as the automotive industry. This included ventures into such
disparate sectors as oil, food, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals.
Now the focus is almost exclusively automotive, and the decks are being
cleared of other interests.
Deprived of the Renault option, 'it was not difficult to know that this was
the best strategy for Volvo', says Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo's chief executive.
He is, ironically, the man brought in to Volvo in 1992 to head its
non-automotive businesses while Mr Gyllenhammar concentrated on the alliance
with Renault.
Earlier this year, shareholders approved a programme that will:
Concentrate on cars and commercial vehicles (it will also retain aero and
marine engine activities).
Strengthen the balance sheet.
Regain control over the strategic operations in cars and trucks.
Pursue an aggressive new product development programme, while raising its
cost effectiveness and exploiting more fully the strength of the Volvo brand
name.
Swift progress has already been made on some of these aims. The group's
non-automotive interests have been placed in a separate unit, called Fortos,
with a divestment programme that should be complete by the end of 1996.
Volvo's 44 per cent stake in Cardo, the Swedish investment company, 26 per
cent stake in Hertz, the car rental group, and some other activities have
already been sold off, raising SKr9.3bn this year. Divestment proceeds could
quadruple once the sell-off of other non-core interests is completed. These
include BCP, its food and drinks subsidiary, Alfred Berg, the investment
bank, and a 28 per cent stake in Pharmacia, one of the world's top 20
pharmaceutical companies.
The group's balance sheet is improving rapidly. Net debt was driven down
from SKr14.5bn at the end of last year to SKr700m at the end of September.
The group's equity-to-assets ratio has risen from 21 per cent to 30 per
cent.
Financial strength is crucial, if Volvo is to stand aloof from big alliances
and mergers. The formidable cost of developing new vehicles alone has
threatened before to be the group's undoing.
'We want to be sure we have the finances available for product programmes
with all the options open,' says Mr Gyll. 'And if we want to do joint
ventures or deals, financial strength is extremely important.'
Over the year Volvo has regained full control of its car and commercial
operations. The recent partial privatisation of Renault allowed Volvo to buy
back the 45 per cent stake in its truck operations held by the French group.
But while dissolving the alliance and launching the divestment programme
have gone smoothly, Volvo is only gradually piecing together its new
industrial strategy.
To prepare its next moves, Volvo has undertaken one of the most ambitious
benchmarking studies ever done in the auto industry. This will compare the
company's practices with the most efficient among its competitors to bring
its standards up to the level of the best.
'We have the challenge of plotting the position we want to be in in the year
2000,' says Mr Mats Ringesten, Volvo senior vice-president for corporate
strategy and business development. 'We are going through the business from A
to Z'
The studies have shown that Volvo's average profitability has been 'OK' over
the past two decades, says Mr Ringesten, but its performance has been
erratic. The vulnerability has come from the sharp swings in sales volumes
in the car business and from the impact of ill-timed and inefficient new
product development programmes.
For the short term, the outlook is positive. Volvo is benefiting from the
tough cost-cutting programmes it was forced to implement during the
recession, as well as from an upturn in its main markets and the favourable
response to new car and truck products launched in the past two years.
For the longer term, the strategies to reduce the vulnerability caused by
its size and independence will not be finalised for several months. But a
more aggressive direction is becoming clear - particularly in the truck
sector, where Volvo has its main strength.
The truck operations are poised to embark on a far-reaching expansion in
Europe and Asia. The ambitious plans include a new range of trucks to allow
Volvo to enter the European light truck market for the first time.
The company is planning to establish a joint venture in China, that would
add an Asian production centre to its three regional truck manufacturing
operations in Europe and North and South America. Asia is Volvo's 'number
one priority' in the geographic expansion of truck operations, says Mr
Karl-Erling Trogen, chief executive of Volvo Truck.
The way forward is more tricky in car manufacturing, where Volvo is one of
the smallest producers in the mainstream car industry.
'We have a strong brand name,' says Mr Per-Erik Mohlin, president of Volvo
Car, 'and the values of tomorrow are coming closer to Volvo in terms of
safety and environmental concerns.'
Volvo is strong in the 'family market', he says, but it must broaden its
customer base to gain more 'pre-family' and 'post-family' buyers. Mr Mohlin
believes this can be done by developing a wider range of products, based on
two basic chassis platforms, rather than the three currently in use.
'We know it is possible to develop more cars from a single platform,' he
says. 'The trick is to utilise common components but to differentiate the
products.'
According to Mr Ringesten, Volvo will still seek low-level collaboration
with other companies, but without the 'corporate alliances with share swaps'
involved in the Renault alliance.
There is already one important partnership, a joint venture in the
Netherlands with Mitsubishi Motors, to provide Volvo with a replacement for
its current 400 medium car range in 1996.
Mr Mohlin's task is to plot a cost-effective way of replacing the rest of
the Volvo car range towards the end of the decade. It is the key to the
group's future success as a focused automotive group - and it has eluded
Volvo in the past.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Mr Zedillo starts well
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Modern Mexican presidents are accustomed to taking office in the midst of
economic crisis. Unlike his predecessors, Mr Ernesto Zedillo, who assumed
the presidency yesterday, has the luxury of inheriting an economy which,
while not without problems, is in reasonable shape. Unfortunately, the same
cannot be said for Mexico's political system.
This year two political assassinations, repeated allegations about the
involvement of drug traffickers in politics, and a peasant revolt in the
southern state of Chiapas have undermined confidence in the Mexican
political system. The year has shown that authoritarian methods of political
manipulation used by presidents in the past are less effective than they
were. Yet Mexico is a long way from replacing this creaky old political
system with reliable government institutions.
Reform of the political system is the most urgent task of Mr Zedillo's
six-year term. It is needed because political shocks upset foreign
investors, who will be necessary to sustain Mexican economic growth until
the low rate of domestic savings rises.
It is needed because what it would secure - the rule of law - is essential
to a well-functioning market economy. It is needed to improve the lives of
ordinary Mexicans, who suffer daily the arbitrary actions of those supposed
to enforce the law.
In his inauguration speech, Mr Zedillo started well. His task is to place
the institutions of government - in particular its corrupt judiciary, its
police and its electoral system - above political controversy. Yesterday, he
committed himself to 'profound reform' of the judiciary, electoral reform,
continued tight control over public finances and a peaceful solution in
Chiapas.
Opposition figure
In choosing his cabinet, he resisted the temptation to reach into the ranks
of the political old guard in an attempt to repress political opposition.
His decision to appoint an opposition figure - Mr Antonio Lozano of the
National Action party - as attorney-general sends an important signal that
he is serious about the long-overdue separation of the judiciary from
politics.
The appointment of one man, of course, cannot guarantee the rule of law. It
remains to be seen if the new attorney-general can function effectively
within a political system dominated by the same party for 65 years. But an
important signal will be sent if he can effect progress in the investigation
into the assassination in September of the PRI secretary-general, Mr Jose
Francisco Ruiz Massieu.
Public confidence
To build public confidence in justice, much more needs to be done, including
an overhaul of the judiciary from the supreme court down and reform of the
police.
Mr Zedillo should also resist directly intervening in the affairs of
Mexico's states. Too often his predecessor, Mr Carlos Salinas, used
extra-constitutional powers to replace elected state governors of the ruling
party in efforts to calm opposition protests at apparently fraudulent state
elections. Although electoral fraud has been a serious symptom of Mexico's
political ills, the president's arbitrary actions merely compounded the
problem.
The answer instead is to build public confidence in the electoral system -
by ensuring, as he has promised, it is run by independent officials and by
stopping the ruling party's egregious outspending of its rivals and the
parties' unequal access to the media. Mr Zedillo will face the first test of
his attitude in Chiapas, where the guerrillas who fomented the new year
revolt are threatening violence if Mr Eduardo Robledo takes office as
governor next week.
The new president has appointed a cabinet largely of technocrats, educated
in the US, hugely capable technically but lacking obvious support from
within the ruling party. His only nod in the direction of the party's old
guard was his appointment as energy minister of Mr Ignacio Pichardo, who has
been accused, and denies, obstructing the investigation into Mr Ruiz's
murder.
The president clearly believes first that a group of relative political
novices can guide political reform; and second that there will be no
backlash from the traditionalists. It is a risk, but one worth taking. Mr
Zedillo has got off to a good start. Now he must make his words count.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Insuring the uninsurable
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The safety net which insurance hangs under the risks of running a business
is looking pretty ragged across much of the world. As insurance and
reinsurance for next year are negotiated, many businesses are finding that
the cost of securing cover is rising steeply. The upwards pressure on rates
has been restrained by competition; reinsurance markets are currently flush
with funds, partly because there have been relatively few natural disasters
in the past two years. Nonetheless, some categories of risk are beginning to
seem uninsurable, even where cover is a legal requirement. In others, only
partial cover is obtainable.
The areas proving most troublesome to price are those where the costs are
potentially huge, even if the probability of the event is low. Such cases
crop up most frequently under legislation for environmental protection, and
health and safety. Yesterday UK government officials and insurers met to
discuss the industry's plans to limit the coverage they will offer companies
against the risk of death or injury to employees, even though this could put
companies in breach of employment laws.
These issues are not new. But they have grown more pressing, partly because
of the size and unpredictability of damages awarded by the courts against
companies. The problem is particularly acute in the US, where punitive
damages are frequently awarded, and where the size of those damages can be
determined by juries. In September a federal jury awarded Dollars 5bn in
punitive damages against Exxon, the US oil group, for the sinking of its
tanker off Alaska in 1989, even though Exxon had already spent Dollars 3bn
cleaning up the coast.
Contaminated land
The spectacle of such awards has itself inflamed the trend towards
litigiousness, in the US and beyond. Meanwhile, proposals for new regulation
 -such as the UK's plans for allocating responsibility for contaminated
land, which could greatly increase companies' liabilities - have further
stirred the anxiety of insurers.
The industry may well be guilty of exaggerating its grounds for concern. In
particular, international reinsurers have tended to project their fears
about US risk on to business in other countries, while some insurers have
used the unproven theory of global warming to justify higher rates for storm
cover.
Whether or not the insurers are guilty of exaggeration, these trends mean
that an increasing amount of business activity could end up uninsured. One
consequence is that companies which have huge damages awarded against them
will more frequently go bankrupt. Another is that some businesses may be
abandoned altogether.
Uncertain solution
What can be done to stitch up the holes in the insurance net? The likely
liabilities may become more predictable and insurance easier to price, as
courts establish a longer record of precedents. But that is a lengthy and
uncertain solution. An alternative route would be for courts or legislators
to limit potential punitive damages, and restrict any charges to the costs
of repairing or compensating for the harm done.
Even then, some liabilities may be uninsurable - accidents involving nuclear
reactors, for example. Equally, companies may find themselves unable to
secure adequate insurance against certain risks - terrorism being an obvious
case. The UK government picked up the difference between insurance cover and
the cost of damage inflicted by terrorist bombs on City of London
skyscrapers. It did so, albeit reluctantly, because of concern for the
City's future. In this way, governments may be obliged to accept the role of
co-insurer where the insurance industry will not accept the full risk.
The most practical conclusion, however, is that governments should give more
thought to the costs of compliance when they draft legislation. US
environmental and asbestos claims have, for example, already wiped out many
syndicates at Lloyd's of London. If the Superfund legislation of the US on
contaminated land were fully enforced, many companies, insurers and possibly
even banks would shut down. The safety net provided by the world's insurance
industry cannot be expanded without limit if it is not to tear.

FT  02 DEC 94 / The FT Interview: Game player of the right - Gianfranco Fini
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It takes a chess player to en-hance his reputation during political
turbulence. And with a game in progress on a large chess board by his office
desk, Mr Gianfranco Fini is as dedicated a player as one is likely to find
in the Berlusconi government.
The 42-year-old leader of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, a key
partner in Italy's rightwing coalition government, is playing the long game:
cleverly, strategically and with a cool nerve.
He plans to be the leader of the Italian right. His immediate mission is to
gain respectability for the MSI, long treated as the pariah of Italian
politics because of its identification with the fascism of Mussolini.
Always affable and immaculately neat, Mr Fini thrives on politics. He came
to prominence last year, when he narrowly lost the fight to be mayor of
Rome. His party has since moved into the mainstream thanks to its alliance
with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and his Forza Italia movement.
It has also begun working on a new identity. In January it will drop its
Italian Social Movement (MSI) label, and retain only the less emotive
National Alliance (AN) adopted earlier this year.
'The right in Italy has always been linked to fascism, which itself is an
Italian phenomenon. The MSI grew out of fascism,' he says. But he describes
himself as a post-fascist, and says: 'I'm trying to reposition the party to
be the new right, but certainly not by linking it to fascism.'
Nevertheless, Mr Fini faces serious problems in marginalising the hardliners
who control much of the party organisation, especially in the south. Several
still use the fascist salute, and have made no efforts to distance
themselves from the hooliganism of nazi skinheads.
He has been urged to force these elements out, rather like the former
communists who created the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) and left the
hardline rump to establish its own party, Reconstructed Communism. But Mr
Fini takes a more pragmatic view.
'Some activists will certainly leave' when AN is formally inaugurated, he
says. 'But I don't think they would form another parliamentary party . . .
If the proportional voting system had remained, this might have happened,
but I think the new majority voting system forces the formation of large
groupings - rassemblements - that contain often widely differing views.'
Mr Fini claims it was the need to transform his party and explain it to the
electorate that led him to refuse a ministerial position in the government.
'It may sound presumptuous but, if I hadn't decided to dedicate many hours
of the day to this problem, it would be more difficult to end the existence
of the MSI and give birth to the AN.' He omits to mention this also allows
him to keep his hands clean and plot from outside.
Mr Fini and his party, with 12 per cent of the national vote, have become an
essential prop for Mr Berlusconi, providing much of the government's
political knowhow. The MSI has also been astute in occupying key
administrative positions in government, state entities and state companies.
In so doing, the coalition has been pulled away from the centre to the
right.
With his support base in the south, where the MSI picks up as much as 20 per
cent of the vote, Mr Fini is concerned that the government's policies 'must
not have a negative social impact' on the region.
He insists he does not share Mussolini's corporatist view of the state, and
endorses privatisation and the winding up of IRI, the giant state holding
company created in the 1930s. But he is concerned that jobs are not lost in
the south.
'Voters don't want state hand-outs; but they want the state to put in the
essential infrastructure and services, and ensure that business can compete
on the same conditions as in the north. This means combating organised
crime, ensuring the cost of borrowing is the same and that the transport
system works.'
Mr Fini recognises that he could extend his support if Mr Berlusconi falls,
by inheriting a slice of the Forza Italia electorate. But the situation is
double-edged. With Mr Berlusconi gone, no one else might consider Mr Fini an
acceptable ally, and he could be marginalised.
He wants the embattled coalition with its five MSI ministers to survive.
'This is the only viable government: if it falls we will either have to find
another government within the existing parliamentary majority or hold fresh
elections.'
He thinks it unlikely the coalition can be enlarged. 'It can only move
towards the Popular party (which contains the bulk of the former Christian
Democrats) - but this is split between those ready to ally with the right
and those who want to go to the left.'
Mr Fini does not mince his words about the third partner in the coalition
government, the populist Northern League, which he describes as 'an
indispensable but at times impossible ally'.
'Either the League reaches an agreement that allows the government to
govern, or it leaves the coalition and there is a crisis.' He reckons Mr
Umberto Bossi, the League's leader, may seek to leave the coalition in
January once the 1995 budget is approved.
He sees the fact that Mr Berlusconi is under investigation for corruption as
a lesser issue. 'The threat of him being under investigation has been there
since the first day of the government; now that this has happened, the
negative impact has already been absorbed.
'Besides, the main flank on which he has been attacked was his dual role as
businessman and prime minister. This he is now resolving and the high point
of the polemic has passed.'
Whatever the fate of the government, Mr Fini sees a period of political
instability ahead. 'Italy is on its journey from the first to the second
republic. We are in the middle of the river . . . I hope there are no
piranhas,' he says with a laugh, knowing that he may be one of them.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Aid terms endanger Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEORGE SOROS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ukraine is poised on the verge of radical economic reform. Until
recently it has had no coherent economic policy: the budget deficit ran out
of control, reaching 30 per cent of the gross domestic product. After a
period of hyperinflation of more than 10,000 per cent in 1993, the central
bank made a valiant attempt to control the money supply, but the effect was
merely to leave wages and other obligations unpaid. Regulations impeded
economic activity and the official economy was largely incapacitated. The
GDP fell by no less than 39 per cent in the three years 1991-93 and a
further 24 per cent in the first half of 1994. Energy supplies became
intermittent while Ukraine accumulated an unpaid debt of some Dollars 6bn
against Russia and Turkmenistan. The shadow economy flourished but, even so,
the decline in living standards was much more severe than in Russia.
The previous president, Leonid Kravchuk, realised that the problems were
bigger than his ability to cope with them and therefore did not even try.
The new president, Leonid Kuchma, elected by a narrow majority on July 10,
is made of sterner stuff. He is aware that Ukraine cannot survive as an
independent country without firm direction and is ready to take tough
decisions.
Fortunately, the G7 heads of state threw a lifeline to Ukraine at their
Naples summit by promising Dollars 4bn in aid if Ukraine undertakes economic
reforms. President Kuchma is determined to seize that lifeline. Ukraine
signed a structural transformation facility agreement worth Dollars 371m as
early as September 23 and is working with the International Monetary Fund to
reach a stand-by agreement before Christmas, which should eventually provide
a further Dollars 1.2bn.
The donor organisations held a pledging session in Winnipeg on October 27,
and subsequently the US committed Dollars 70m for immediate balance of
payments support to be increased to Dollars 100m if the European Union
provided matching funds. The funds are needed before the end of 1994 in
order to assure continuing gas supplies from Russia and Turkmenistan. But
within the EU, the UK, supported by France, resisted German pressure to
provide matching funds. Its argument was that this would create an
undesirable precedent because in the past the EU chipped in only after a
stand-by agreement had been agreed with the IMF.
The issue will come up again at the Ecofin meeting of the EU on December 5.
The net amount to be provided by the EU before the end of 1994 is only
Dollars 20m, because Dollars 80m of the Dollars 100m is to be withheld to
settle outstanding liabilities. This Dollars 20m barely exceeds the amount I
provided in aid to Ukraine through my foundations during 1994. Japan has
made its contribution conditional on action by the European Union and so did
the US to the tune of Dollars 30m.
I find it inconceivable that the UK would allow the aid package to unravel
and endanger the survival of Ukraine as an independent, democratic and
reform-minded country. The disintegration of Ukraine would have consequences
too horrendous to contemplate.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Electricity dividends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor S C LITTLECHILD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Smith reported ('Power regulator defends his record', December
1) my comment that regional electricity companies could raise dividends by 6
to 9 per cent annually in the next few years. Taken out of context, this is
misleading.
I was commenting on the distribution price control proposals which I put
forward in the summer, and on the predictions of some analysts that the RECs
would be able to increase dividends significantly over the next five years.
Some people have said that these predictions mean that the price control is
not tight enough. I argued, however,that future dividends will be influenced
by profits from businesses other than distribution, as well as by the
potential for companies to reduce dividend cover and to draw down cash
surpluses which derive from profits under the existing control.
In broad terms, these factors could by themselves sustain real dividend
growth of 6 to 9 per cent per year. This was not a prediction of future
dividends. Decisions on dividends are, of course, entirely for the companies
themselves.

<TEXT>
Sir, I find it fascinating that Mr Giordano sees it as important carefully
to construct a long letter to defend his chief executive's increase in
salary to the financial community. What a shame that no member of British
Gas's board saw it as equally important to appear on the BBC's Watchdog to
explain to its ordinary customers why it is also planning to penalise those
who pay it on time but not in the manner that British Gas dictates.
But then, as Mr Giordano refutes that British Gas is an arrogant
out-of-touch privatised monopoly with overpaid executives, he will no doubt
be able to advise me where I can buy my gas elsewhere.

Sir, Clive of India defended himself from charges of greed by comparing
himself with other, greedier Nabobs. Mr Giordano mounts the same defence for
the directors of British Gas, but at much greater length. The principles of
personnel and salary administration stop at the boardroom door, because
remuneration is set by equally overpaid non-executive directors and
institutional shareholders.
There are many people better qualified and at least as able receiving a
tenth of the salary and few other benefits. If directors feel underpaid,
they should put themselves on the open market, and make room for new blood.

Sir, The chairman of British Gas gives a cogent explanation (Letters,

That is largely the fault of the government's taxation policy which has not
only widened the gap between the better off and the worse off, but has also
depressed the living standards of the latter. This I believe to be

FT  02 DEC 94 / A star yet to shine: A look at plans to boost the UK's
private finance initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government's private finance initiative has yet to become the talk of
the town, even in business circles. But Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
gave it star billing in this week's Budget, signalling ministerial
determination that the private sector take over a large slice of the
government's investment and service delivery responsibilities.
'Privatisation and private finance are rapidly becoming the chosen method
for raising the quality of public services,' declared Mr Clarke. The Tory
vision is for central and local government to become essentially the
regulator and standard-setter for private providers of public services, from
roads and prisons to hospitals and swimming pools.
Private operators may recover revenue directly from consumers, as with the
Channel tunnel link, or in the form of grants from government departments or
public-sector institutions such as universities. Hybrid schemes are also
envisaged, notably public/private consortia at local council level.
When launched two years ago, the private finance initiative (PFI) was
greeted with a large dose of scepticism by private industry. With good
reason. So far, most departments have launched only a handful of projects.
Even the Pounds 5bn programme of projects for 1995 announced by Mr Clarke
this week is not as significant as it seems, against a backdrop of overall
cuts in state infrastructure spending. More than half that figure is
accounted for by one project: the Channel tunnel rail link, not due to be
finished until 2002.
However, privatisation started small in the early 1980s, not gathering
critical momentum until the sale of British Telecommunications in 1984. The
PFI could follow the same pattern.
Sir George Young, the Treasury minister directly responsible for PFI, told a
packed conference of industrialists and public-sector executives last week
that the 'build-up period' was now drawing to a close, with take-off
imminent. He and a succession of cabinet ministers stressed 'imagination' as
a central theme.
However, imagination is not enough. The crucial test is the readiness of
private companies to tender for projects on the government's terms.
Ministers believe that the transfer of risk to the private sector has to be
'genuine'. However, as Mr Stan Webster, a partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
accountancy firm, told last week's conference, 'transfer of controllable
risks will improve value for money, notably where they relate to design,
construction and operation. But transfer of risks outside the direct control
of the private sector - which could include planning and market risk - is
likely to damage value for money. And in extreme cases an unrealistic
approach could make projects unbankable, damaging the credibility of the
exercise in the eyes of potential operators and funders.'
Another problem has been defining the scope of the PFI, said Mr Douglas
Hogg, a member of the private finance panel established last year to act as
a catalyst for new projects. Over the next year, private finance will cover
almost all sectors, with only areas such as weapons systems and real tolling
projects, where the motorist pays directly, excluded. Even schools may now
be eligible, following recent changes which have made it easier for councils
to engage in joint venture projects.
The principal of a further education college told last week's conference
there was a 'vast market' for projects in education infrastructure, but that
agreement with government officials about the distribution of risk was
holding up progress.
Transport projects offer the largest immediate field for private industry,
and so a test of the imagination and enthusiasm of companies for the PFI.
Headed by the Channel tunnel rail link costing an estimated Pounds 2.7bn,
transport accounts for more than 80 per cent of the Pounds 5.26bn-Pounds
5.49bn worth of contracts which the government hopes to award in 1995.
No fewer than 11 consortia comprising construction companies, banks and
civil engineering consultancies put in bids for the four road schemes -
valued at Pounds 380m - to be built under the 'design, build, finance,
operate' programme. The winning bidder will build the road and manage it for
up to 25 years, in return for 'shadow tolls' paid by the government
reflecting traffic volumes and the efficiency of the maintenance and
management.
The attraction of these schemes is that they allow construction companies to
even out the fluctuations of the building cycle with relatively steady
revenues from the roads they manage. Dragados, a Spanish member of one of
the five winning consortia, currently makes 15 per cent of its profits from
road management in Spain and Latin America, but expects this figure to rise
to 30 per cent within a few years.
Rail schemes such as the Channel tunnel rail link, for which four bidding
consortia have been shortlisted, also offer the opportunity to break into a
sector with good growth prospects. With increasing environmental pressures
on road building programmes, the prospects of an upsurge in railway
construction appear good.
If there was an aspect of the chancellor's Budget remarks on the PFI which
disappointed the City and the civil engineering industry, it was his failure
to announce any new schemes - though these may come in ministerial
announcements over the next few weeks.
'Progress has been slow and there is no guarantee that any of the schemes
being included in the PFI will be built within a reasonable timescale,' said
the Institution of Civil Engineers. Sir George Young attributed these delays
to 'the problems of marrying two diverse cultures: the public sector with
its emphasis on accountability for taxpayers' money and the fleet-footed
private sector'.
Companies bidding for contracts are undoubtedly driven by declining
public-sector investment in infrastructure projects. That pressure can only
intensify.
However, none of the transport schemes under consideration has yet reached
the stage of detailed contract agreement, which leaves unresolved the
question of whether contracts can be fashioned to provide private-sector
returns commensurate with the transfer of risk involved.

Sir, Henry Meakin says of ownership of radio stations (Letters, November
26): 'It should be the duty of the Radio Authority and the national heritage
secretary to take urgent steps to eliminate such restrictive ownership
anomalies.' The power to submit amendments to broadcasting legislation rests
with the national heritage secretary. The authority has made representations
to government and first submitted proposals to amend the ownership rules in
January 1994. The problem appears to lie in finding parliamentary time for
amendments to the law.

Friday night is comedy night when Channel 4 brings out its big guns.
American guns of course - Ellen, Cheers, Roseanne, proceeding from 9pm
nose-to-tail like number 12 buses. Not to be outdone, BBC 2 fields The Larry
Sanders Show, at 11.45pm as befits an often very rude if funny sitcom.
Tonight's Machiavellian morality play concerns the real Hugh Hefner and the
ethics of posing for Playboy.
What of our own contribution to the genre? At his best Harry Enfield is
brilliantly observant, as witness tonight's Harry Enfield and Chums (9.30pm,
BBC1). If English comedy depends on quirkiness and eccentricity, English
satire relies on smirking sledge-hammer subtlety. Have I Got News for You
(10pm, BBC2) has descended from its civilised radio origins into smug
schoolboy snook-cocking. The self-satisfaction hovering above my television
set like a miasma is not entirely dispelled by switching over to Clive
Anderson Talks Back (10.30pm, C4).

FT  02 DEC 94 / Arts: An orchestral success story - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts (ABSA) is a two time
winner from the Budget. The funding for the Business Sponsorship Incentive
Scheme (BSIS), which ABSA administers, was increased by Pounds 750,000 to
Pounds 5.6m. This is a sprat to catch the mackerel of corporate sponsorship
and should add another Pounds 1.5m to the arts in 1995-96.
In addition ABSA will operate a new scheme which extends the BSIS to
historic buildings. There is only Pounds 200,000 of government money
available at the start, but any company that fancies backing Stonehenge, or
a royal palace, or a stately home, or a cathedral - their structure as well
as events held there - will now get a top-up incentive.
***
There is one place where arts organisations and sponsors happily embrace -
abroad. It is virtually impossible for an orchestra or a theatre company to
plan an overseas tour without sponsorship.
The British Council does its bit, but these days the council almost always
draws in business money as well - Pounds 3.6m from sponsors in 1993-94. It
recently raised an impressive Pounds 400,000 from 30 companies to take arts
groups like Cheek by Jowl and the Westminster Abbey Choir to Russia during
the Queen's tour.
For companies, helping to present a prestigious British arts event overseas
offers unrivalled opportunities to offer key foreign contacts an evening's
pleasure which could lead to contracts. The recent tour of the BBC National
Orchestra of Wales to New York and Baltimore was a classic example of
sponsorship in action.
The orchestra had been invited to perform the annual United Nations Day
concert in the chamber of the General Assembly in New York, There was,
however, no fee and the orchestra had to pay a facility charge for recording
the concert and converting the chamber into a performance space.
S4C, the Welsh language television channel, stepped in to sponsor the event.
It is not easy selling programmes in Welsh to foreign TV stations but such a
celebrated event, plus party, gave its efforts the necessary lift. The fact
the Prince of Wales has presented one of the company's animation projects
was also a helped.
With one concert underwritten, the orchestra looked for more dates. Next
year Swansea is UK City of Literature and the Welsh Tourist Board jumped at
the chance to support a Lincoln Centre concert. A trip down to Baltimore was
inevitable: Cardiff Bay's regeneration plans, built around the proposed
Opera House, are modelled on Baltimore, which used the arts to help revive
an ailing sea port.
There is something worrying when the arts become the plum in the pudding
rather than a dish in their own right, but the enthusiastic response to the
music justified pre-concert and post-concert receptions, at which Baltimore
industrialists were introduced to the commercial opportunities in Cardiff
Bay and New York travel agents were sold Swansea as the new Athens. The
first American tourists are already booked.
The S4C-backed tour should have delighted the heritage minister, Stephen
Dorrell, since it was built around the promotion of tourism and business
investment, the twin pillars of his focus for arts funding.
As the BBC and the Arts Council pursue their delicate strategy of spreading
orchestral music more fairly throughout the country while saving money and
avoiding rows, the BBC National Orchestra of Wales is becoming something of
a role model.
By broadening its revenue base it has forged the path which vulnerable
orchestras like the BBC Philharmonic and the Bournemouth Symphony will be
encouraged to follow. The BBC still provides the bulk of its funding  -
Pounds 3m; but the Welsh Arts Council, S4C, and sponsors also contribute to
the pot.
It became the first BBC band to attract substantial sponsorship - Pounds
300,000 from Hitachi, which took it to Japan. This winter the orchestra is
pitching dozens of Japanese companies based in Wales in the expectation that
they will fund the proposed return trip to Japan next year.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Arts: Festival director drops the baton - The
Schleswig-Holstein dream has turned to nightmare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a dream come true - a festival for ordinary people, set in
picturesque north European landscape, mixing international stars and
homespun atmosphere. But the dream has suddenly become a nightmare.
The Schleswig-Holstein music festival, one of Germany's most successful
cultural events, caught everyone by surprise last week when it announced a
deficit of DM3.75m (Pounds 1.5m). The state government in Kiel - the
festival's biggest single backer - pinned the blame on its founder and
artistic director, Justus Frantz. As pressure mounted for his dismissal,
Frantz resigned.
Frantz then began a public slanging match with the Schleswig-Holstein
economics minister, Peer Steinbruck, who chairs the festival board. Frantz
said he would sue the state government for defamation, and claimed he had
had no responsibility for festival finances since 1992. Steinbruck accused
Frantz of trying to bring the whole festival edifice down around him.
Supporters of the festival are now asking if it can survive without Frantz,
whose energy, international contacts and fund-raising ability fuelled its
whirlwind growth. Yehudi Menuhin and other prominent artists have voiced
solidarity with Frantz, and several say they will boycott future events.
Sponsors - who contributed a quarter of the DM16m budget - have also begun
to withdraw. 'Justus Frantz is the Schleswig-Holstein festival', said one.
Meanwhile, the state government has named a British concert agent, Jasper
Parrott, as chairman of a new artistic advisory committee. The appointment
has been criticised by representatives of the German music industry, who say
Parrott cannot offer independent advice while he has his own artists to
promote.
Although the festival always projected itself well to the outside world,
insiders say problems had been building up for years. The festival was
Frantz's child. Inaugurated in 1986, it thrived on his friendship with
prominent musicians and politicians, including the former German chancellor
Helmut Schmidt. By 1989, it was attracting 300,000 visitors, and had a
budget of more than DM16m. Leonard Bernstein was its local hero, Sergiu
Celibidache gave conducting classes, and quiet towns like Kiel, Lubeck and
Salzau found themselves on the tourist map.
The idea was to provide a new kind of festival - one which attracted the
young and concert-shy as well as the rich and knowledgeable. Concerts were
given in local halls, castles and barns. The atmosphere was informal: Jessye
Norman, Anne-Sophie Mutter and other big-name soloists came within reach of
rural audiences. The state government was only too happy to pump money into
an event which promoted Schleswig-Holstein in the wider world.
As the festival expanded, Frantz's role and controversial operating methods
came under scrutiny. Frantz, 50, is a concert pianist, but his ambitions
have always gone further. The festival enabled him to start a career as a
conductor and music manager. He became known as a wheeler-dealer, charming
businessmen into giving money, negotiating contracts from his home in the
Canary Islands and hosting his own show on German television.
Frantz's critics say he increasingly used the festival to push his own
career. Leading ensembles were invited on the assumption that Frantz would
conduct some performances - for which he was often paid an additional fee.
He began to channel sponsorship towards projects outside the festival. Last
year, some members of the festival orchestra walked out. They questioned his
competence as a conductor and said he was too busy juggling other affairs to
devote time to music.
But the current crisis stems equally from the state government's failure to
build a ladder of responsibility which would serve the festival's long-term
interests. 'How could such a deficit pile up without them knowing?', asked a
disillusioned local volunteer this week in Lubeck. 'Where was the
book-keeping? Why was no-one checking the takings and matching them to the
costs? It's a mystery.'
In 1992 the government installed a finance ministry official as the
festival's business manager. Resentful of political and bureaucratic
interference, Frantz went ahead regardless. In February this year, for
example, the board ordered Frantz to cancel the Kirov Opera visit - but when
he pledged to find the necessary sponsorship, the contract was approved. In
the end, he raised only 10 per cent of the cost, and this summer's Kirov
performances lost DM440,000.
The question now is whether the state government can find a new artistic
director who can stop the festival degenerating into a provincial
Burgerfest. Steinbruck says he would prefer a full-time manager in the mould
of Gerard Mortier at Salzburg, 'someone who can gather leading artistic
personalities around him, without being distracted by his own ambitions as
entertainer, conductor, media star and whatever else.'
The new artistic advisory committee will not meet till mid-January, and will
have no executive function. According to Parrott, any suggestion that the
festival cannot survive without Frantz is 'complete nonsense'. He says there
is a natural period in which artistic projects flourish before losing steam,
and that the festival had reached the point when review and reform were
necessary. 'There is so much basic energy and potential there, far beyond
any single personality. These resources need to be gathered together,
rethought and properly harnessed.'

FT  02 DEC 94 / Technology: Music on the cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEC, the Japanese electronics company, yesterday announced that it had
developed a portable music player that reproduces sound from data stored on
a credit-card sized semiconductor memory card.
The device, called Silicon Audio, is light and produces sound quality
comparable to a compact disc. It is a solid state device with no moving
parts, which eliminates problems such as unwanted vibrations or skipping
passages of music. 'You can jump up and down with it or drop it and it will
still keep playing,' said NEC.
The company believes it could take a decade before the Silicon Audio reaches
the market. The cost of the cards needs to fall sharply from their current
price of about Pounds 100 and the playback time needs to increase
substantially from its present limit of 24 minutes before it is viable.
NEC believes that the ultimate success of the Silicon Audio will depend on
the availability of music suitable for the format. 'It is difficult for us
to claim that it will overtake other formats,' said an executive. 'It is the
software that really counts.'
The Silicon Audio is the latest of a number of new hi-fi formats to be
developed, such as the digital compact cassette, a high-quality tape player
which was launched by Philips, the Dutch electronics company.
The Silicon Audio system works by recording audio signals after they have
been encoded and compressed onto semiconductor chips housed on a memory
card. The prototype compresses a 20MHz, 770Kbit signal to one-eighth of its
original size, which allows 24 minutes of recording from a 32Mbyte card.
The cards use a data retrieval and storage system called 'flash memory',
which works like a standard dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chip except
it does not require a power supply to keep the data. The prototype player
measures 127mm by 93mm by 33mm and weights 217g with batteries.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scientists are experimenting with infra-red light absorption as a method of
measuring the oxygen reaching the brains of newborn babies, which crucially
affects their risk of death or disability.
The oxygen present in the brain is related to the amount of light absorbed
by bone and brain tissue when a pulse of infra-red light is fired from a
laser placed at one temple to a photo-detector at the other temple.
A computer model to determine the relationship between the distance
travelled by the light and the absorption coefficients of the brain has been
developed by researchers at the Centre for Research in Biomechanics and
Biomedical Engineering at the University of Wales Swansea.
The model is based on digitised anatomical studies of adult brains, which
have been scaled down to the size of infant brains. The researchers say
refinements to the model will result in highly accurate measurements of
brain oxygenation.

Military research into uncooled thermal imaging is set to be transferred
into civilian applications, according to an agreement this week by
GEC-Marconi and the Defence Research Agency.
Until recently, thermal imaging equipment, which is used to create pictures
from the heat radiated by objects, needed to be cooled to very low
temperatures of minus 200`C. However, GEC-Marconi and the DRA have developed
a detector capable of operating at room temperature, which is cheap enough
for civilian use.
Applications being explored include cameras to help the rescue services work
in poor weather conditions.

Israeli scientists have unravelled a sun-protection mechanism in algae which
could offer a new approach to the cultivation of crops in drought-ridden
areas.
The Weizmann Institute of Science studied a salt-water alga that is capable
of thriving in scorching sunlight. Under intense light, the alga produces a
protein, known as CBr, and a carotenoid pigment called zeaxanthin. The
researchers have cloned the gene for the CBr protein using genetic
engineering techniques.
The scientists concluded that the protein binds with the pigment to form a
light protective antenna which diverts excessive light from the sensitive
components of the photosynthetic machinery. The researchers believe it may
be possible to manipulate a similar mechanism in higher plants, including
crops, to enhance their sun resistance.

Nippon Soda of Japan says it has jointly developed a glass that cleans
itself by dissolving dirt and contamination using ultra violet rays as a
catalyst, writes Emiko Terazono. Research was carried out with the
University of Tokyo and a science and technology group backed by the
Kanagawa municipal government.
The process uses titanium dioxide which deodorises and sterilises material
when placed under ultra violet rays from the sun or from a regular
fluorescent room light. A colourless transparent titanium dioxide film on
glass decomposes bacteria and odorous gases. The glass is coated with
silicon film before the titanium dioxide is applied to prevent reaction with
sodium in the glass. Nippon Soda hopes the glass will be used for windows in
buildings and cars.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Technology: Tobacco's holy grail - A look at the lure of the
smokeless cigarette
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are two big problems with cigarette smoking: it damages the smoker's
health and it annoys those who dislike passive smoking. Could a smokeless
cigarette be the answer?
In 1988 RJ Reynolds Tobacco, US maker of Camel and other cigarette brands,
came up with a smokeless cigarette called Premier. RJ Reynolds test-marketed
it for several months before resigning itself to the fact that it had
unleashed one of the biggest new product flops in US corporate history.
Yet RJ Reynolds - like so many smokers - does not give up easily. Last
weekend, it emerged that the company had been experimenting with another
non-smoking cigarette, this time called Eclipse. According to one report, RJ
Reynolds was planning to launch the brand next year.
The commercial logic for such a product has bewitched cigarette makers for
years. Clearly, if a cigarette could be invented that satisfied users
without threatening their health or irritating other people, it would have
vast money-making potential. With that in mind, RJ Reynolds spent Dollars
325m (Pounds 210m) developing and marketing its earlier non-smoking
cigarette, only to see it fail.
In its new incarnation, RJ Reynolds's smokeless cigarette looks and feels
much the same as an ordinary cigarette; it even contains tobacco. But at the
lighted end, the first half inch or so of the cigarette consists of a piece
of carbon in a fibreglass shell.
When the cigarette is lit, the charcoal burns at around the same temperature
as an ordinary cigarette. But because the charcoal is separated from the
rest of the cigarette by a heat barrier, the tobacco does not ignite. Air
heated by the charcoal is drawn through into the body of the cigarette and
mingles with the tobacco without burning it.
All cigarette tobacco contains small amounts of glycerine to keep it moist,
but in Eclipse, the proportion of glycerine has been lifted to more than 50
per cent. As a result, when the hot air passes through the tobacco and
glycerine mixture, the glycerine gradually vaporises and carries tobacco
flavours, nicotine and tar to the smoker.
Apart from its construction, Eclipse has several quirks. One is that it does
not burn down: instead, it lasts as long as the carbon tip keeps burning,
which is about the same amount of time as a conventional cigarette. It does
not produce ash, does not give off any smoke from the lit end and does not
stain fingers, teeth or furnishings.
From a health point of view, RJ Reynolds says each Eclipse cigarette
produces between 1mg and 3mg of tar and between 0.1mg and 0.2mg of nicotine,
compared with up to 20mg of tar and up to 1.7mg of nicotine for a full
flavour cigarette. Significantly, however, there are several brands of ultra
light cigarette already on the market with tar and nicotine yields at least
as low as this, so Eclipse has little new to offer on this score. Its
stronger selling point seems to be the lack of smoke.
RJ Reynolds says the vapour given off by the cigarettes is almost, but not
completely, odourless. When exhaled, it looks like someone's breath in cool
air and disappears almost instantly. Someone walking into a room where
people were smoking Eclipse would probably be able to detect only a faint
aroma.
The trouble is, most of this could have been said of the Premier cigarette
too. Like Eclipse, Premier worked by emitting a vapour instead of smoke. Air
drawn through the cigarette passed through a burning carbon tip at the
lighted end, then went through an aluminium capsule in the body of the
cigarette containing beads of glycerine impregnated with tobacco
flavourings. The glycerine beads vaporised and carried the tobacco flavour
through cooling filters to the smoker.
Premier flopped because smokers thought it lacked flavour, and what they
could taste, they did not like. There was also a strong resistance to the
look and feel of the cigarette: smokers said it burned too hot and they did
not like the fact that it did not burn down.
RJ Reynolds says it is still not 100 per cent cent happy with Eclipse and is
not even certain it will launch it. However, it says it is getting good
enough feedback from marketing tests to indicate that smokers would welcome
a reduced second-hand smoke cigarette if it tasted at least as good as their
existing brand.
Many industry analysts are sceptical. 'Part of the allure of smoking is the
smoke,' says one. 'If the product doesn't taste good and you don't get that
smoking sensation, it isn't going to work.'
Yet times have changed since the ill-fated launch of Premier. Second-hand
smoke is a much bigger issue than five years ago. In the US, pressure on
smokers is mounting by the day: smoking is increasingly outlawed in public
places, and there are many situations where it is not tolerated even where
it is lawful.
A smokeless cigarette could not be lit in an area where smoking was banned,
but it could prove acceptable at, for example, a dinner table surrounded by
non-smokers. So a cigarette like Eclipse might at least hope to find a
market niche among smokers who found themselves faced with lighting up a
smokeless cigarette or nothing at all.
RJ Reynolds says: 'It is not for everybody. No cigarette is for everybody:
that is why there are some 400 brands of cigarette in the US now. But the
reduced second-hand smoke cigarette is an option, and no other manufacturer
has got anything on the market like it.'

FT  02 DEC 94 / Management: TNT time for quality - A look at an award which
aims to create TQM role models
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Large lorries trundled down the ramp at Wapping, Rupert Murdoch's east
London printing site and cradle of a Fleet Street revolution nine years ago.
Cameras whirred, pickets shouted night after night.
For many people in Britain the image of TNT Express (UK) - the
Australian-owned group which operated those vehicles - is still defined by
those events. This week, however, the logistics and supply-chain management
company earned a new and less controversial reputation as a paragon of
British quality.
Along with Rover Group, TNT was announced joint winner on Wednesday night of
the UK's first Quality Award, launched earlier this year to recognise
outstanding business performance through the application of Total Quality
Management principles. Avis Rent A Car, BT Northern Ireland and ICL's
Customer Service division were also shortlisted.
The prize's objective is identical to the European Quality Awards and the US
Baldridge Awards which have both sought in recent years to create TQM role
models.
The UK competition, and the more than 800 business people who packed a
central London hotel for the award ceremony, bear witness to the continuing
appeal of TQM more than 40 years after its 'invention' by two American
lecturers working in Japan. TQM may be less fashionable than business
process re-engineering but it is still widely considered to have high
potential to transform organisations by putting the spotlight on customer
and employee satisfaction.
Over the next few months TNT chief executive Alan Jones and John Towers, his
opposite number at Rover, will find themselves at Quality conferences and
seminars up and down the country explaining why their programmes have
produced results, thus inspiring others who have been less successful.
TNT, which delivers 60 per cent of Britain's national newspaper tonnage from
a standing start in 1985, began its Total Quality initiative in 1989. 'Our
whole philosophy is that we want to help our customers sell more of their
products: in doing that so we sell more of our freight,' explains Jones. He
cites as an example TNT's suggestion that newspapers discontinue the age-old
practice of individually labelling each newsagent's package - a change which
helped cut transit times by one hour.
Rover believes it has demonstrated the value of TQ in the way it has bucked
the recession in the European motor industry. Product quality improvements,
for instance, have substantially reduced warranty costs while external
surveys have tracked an improving trend in customer satisfaction.
Towers says TQM is 'not like a package of pills you pull off the shelf, and
take with a glass of water three times a week'. He cites the importance of
top-level leadership, the establishment of a vision which individuals can
identify with across the company, and the creation of what he calls a
'compelling need'. He suggests British companies are good at 'pulling
themselves back from the brink' but less inspired when times are good.
Rover's answer in 1990 was to paint a picture of what the car industry might
look like by 1995 - based on research of events in North America: 'It was
not so much a Sword of Damocles as simply saying to people this is what is
likely to change, you might as well get on and make sure that's what we do
rather than take the risk that we are overpowered by rivals'.
Towers talks about 'getting the drum going' but not changing the beat.
Changing the metaphor, he adds: 'One of the things about the Japanese is
that they don't have to have a new flag every year, even if its colour may
alter a bit'.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ScottishPower has selected Ian Robinson, chairman and md of Trafalgar
House's engineering division, as its new ceo to succeed Ian Preston.
Robinson, 52, will move from running the biggest division of Trafalgar
House, with sales of Pounds 2.3bn and 20,000 employees, to a utility which
turned over Pounds 1.5bn last year and has fewer than 8,000 people.
Robinson has run Trafalgar House's engineering division since 1992, having
joined the group through its subsidiary John Brown. He graduated in chemical
engineering at Leeds University before working for the engineers Kellogg and
later Ralph M. Parsons. At Trafalgar House's engineering division, he
rationalised John Brown, Davy and Trafalgar House Offshore. The company
yesterday indicated that it was sorry to see him go but that his wish to run
a plc in the FT-SE top 100 was understandable.
Robinson, who is from the north east of England but married a Scot, will
join ScottishPower early next year. Preston, 61, will become deputy chairman
until he retires next July. His departure removes the company's last
executive director to have spent substantial parts of his career with the
company when it was in the public sector as the South of Scotland
Electricity Board.
ScottishPower chose Robinson in preference to the main internal candidate,
Duncan Whyte, chief operating officer and former finance director. Another
contender for the post of ceo, Michael Smith, left in August to run a new
utility business being set up by Fletcher Challenge, one of New Zealand's
largest conglomerates.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Management: 'World-class' delusion of multinationals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of the surest signs of a well-managed company are its awareness of its
shortcomings and readiness to be open about them. Witness, for instance, the
degree of self-criticism that frequently emanates from 3M, Canon, Federal
Express and other organisations that actually practise the fashionable creed
of constant corporate renewal.
At the other extreme are organisations that, by failing to make adequate use
of competitive 'benchmarking' - or by refusing to believe its damning
results - delude themselves that they are at the 'leading edge', when the
truth is very different.
An IBM-London Business School study published last week* found that only one
in 50 manufacturing sites in four European countries is genuinely 'world
class', although three-quarters believe they can compete with the best of
their international rivals. Such myopia is more than dangerous - it can be
positively suicidal.
Between these two extremes lies a sizeable body of companies that have some
sense of their competitive deficiencies but do not realise their full
dimensions, and are not doing enough to rectify them.
This is all too evident from a broader study of 'international competitive
capabilities' in 12 leading multinationals around the world, which is about
to be published**. It concludes, among many other things, that most
multinationals are far less globally-minded than they think they are - their
rhetoric is dangerously ahead of reality. They are also much less
customer-focused and organisationally flexible than is necessary to win in
global markets. Not all of them have yet realised that operational
excellence in total quality and customer service is no longer a source of
sustainable advantage, but merely a qualification for competing.
To make matters worse, many of their attempts to create continuous corporate
regeneration and 'transformation' are being hampered by a 'trust gap'
between leaders and employees.
The survey covered nearly 1,500 managers of two dozen nationalities working
around the world for American, Asian and European multinationals such as
AT&amp;T, British Airways, BHP, Daimler-Benz, Electricite de France, Fiat, Kao
of Japan, Siemens and Ssangyong, a Korean conglomerate.
The survey, called Champions of Change, was carried out by the
Massachusetts-based International Consortium for Executive Development
Research, a multinational think-tank. Its findings are to be published
jointly with Gemini Consulting, which sponsored the research. But the
trenchant conclusions are very much those of the consortium's executive
director, Douglas Ready.
Respondents were given a list of 34 'organisational capabilities' and 45
'leadership competences', and asked to rank them in two ways: in order of
their importance to competitiveness; and in terms of organisation's current
performance in those areas. This enabled the researchers to identify
performance gaps, as well as discrepancies in managerial attitudes.
Ready's report is most scathing about the discrepancies that surround the
issue of globalisation. The senior executives in the survey all emphasised,
in what he calls a 'relentless, almost numbing' fashion, that change and
uncertainty are being caused primarily by the increasingly global
competitive environment. Yet they rated their company's effectiveness at
developing a 'global orientation or mindset' last out of the 34
organisational capabilities.
Ready is equally concerned that no globally-related factor was ranked by the
respondents as one of the five most important organisational capabilities or
leadership competences; these were all more general. The importance and
effectiveness of items such as managing a culturally diverse workforce,
alliance management, living outside one's home country, and managing
transnational teams, were all rated relatively low.
As Ready asks, if these particular companies, already in the thick of the
global battle, are so 'conflicted about the implications of being global',
as he puts it, what does that imply for those just embarking on
globalisation?
One probable cause of the problem is what Ready calls a 'cavernous gap'
between what chief executives say is important and what they actually value
and reward. In other respects, too, the survey found that most organisations
are doing a poor job of linking performance to a range of their own
strategic priorities.
However, middle managers of most nationalities rated a global mindset as
more important than did senior managers. So there may be hope for the next
generation of leaders, although for some companies this will come too late.
On many other aspects in the survey, Ready says its ratings of importance
versus effectiveness identified not just the usual performance gap but a
yawning gulf. Particularly alarming, he says, was the perceived lack of
effectiveness in the two items cited by respondents as most critical to
competitiveness: organisational adaptability and customer focus.
On the 'trust gap' that bedevils many companies, the study found that one in
five respondents said that 'instilling trust between our leaders and our
workers' was one of the top five requirements for creating organisational
effectiveness. Yet it was rated 33rd in terms of actual effectiveness.
As on so many other counts in the survey, wish and reality were miles apart.
But at least the companies' openness to outside scrutiny has helped them
face that fact.

FT  02 DEC 94 / People: Gavin Laird joins EIT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 105-year-old Edinburgh Investment Trust has made a bit of history by
becoming the first big investment trust to put a trade unionist on its board
of directors.
Gavin Laird, 61, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union, will pick up around Pounds 7,500 for attending six board
meetings a year of Scotland's biggest investment trust. The Earl of Eglinton
and Winton, EIT's old Etonian chairman, says that Laird will provide 'an
additional perspective on developing trends within the UK economy'.
Earlier this year Laird was involved in a controversy when the government
refused to extend his appointment as a director of the Bank of England. He
had been appointed to the Bank's governing body in 1986 by Lady Thatcher,
the prime minister of the day. Although Eddie George, the governor of the
Bank of England, had pressed for his re-appointment, the government decided
against giving him a third term - thus breaking the tradition of having a
trade unionist on the Bank's board.
However, Laird's appointment to the board of EIT suggests that in Scotland,
at least, he is now regarded as an establishment figure. He is already on
the boards of Scottish Television, GEC Scotland and Britannia Life and Laird
now joins a board which until recently boasted one Earl, a Lord, a couple of
knights, and four commoners.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Management: An approach to non-execs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month's announcement that DHL chairman and chief executive Patrick Lupo
has joined the board of WH Smith was routine in many ways. But the
heartsearching which preceded his appointment as non-executive director of
the British retailing group illustrates how leading British companies are
adopting more professional and objective boardroom selection procedures.
Interest in non-execs was fuelled by successive corporate scandals and by
publication in 1992 of the Cadbury report, which laid down guidelines for
best practice in corporate governance. Smith chairman Jeremy Hardie, though,
is not alone in thinking that the 'regulatory' issues raised by Cadbury have
overshadowed the often more challenging and significant role for boards of
determining company strategy.
'In many businesses,' observes Hardie, 'the directors turn up once a month,
receive a lot of (predominantly financial) information, find out what the
profits are likely to be, and generally keep tabs on what is going on.
Inevitably many of the decisions to be taken are cut and dried as the board
is primarily there as a check.'
The Smith chairman, who led the 15-month hunt to replace Edward Elson, and
who is also a director of John Swire &amp; Sons, is careful not to knock that
model. His ideal, though, is of a group of experienced outsiders
contributing ideas and insights helpful to the company's day-to-day
managers. 'In extremis the board has got an authoritative function because
directors are trustees of the assets. Most of the time the function should
be a collegial one supporting and working together.'
Hardie says the people running companies 'are often short of certain
insights', and there is a fear inside most organisations about 'making
mistakes' - but with non execs, he says, 'it doesn't matter, every now and
then it even helps'.
Hardie insists non-execs are there 'to draw on their experience across a
wide range of issues' and believes it is wrong to use vacancies to fill a
resource need. 'If you're thinking of moving into Spain you can hire a
consultant, get someone in the corporate planning department to look at
Europe, or find a director with Spanish experience. I'm against this last
idea.'
Smith used the headhunting firm Spencer Stuart as part of a process which
also resulted in the appoint-ment of Marjorie Scardino, chief executive of
the Economist Group.

<TEXT>
While AA insurance continues its job-shedding exercise, its companion
operation - AA Financial Services - is gearing up to expand and improve its
services and products. To oversee this task, Geoff Bruce has been headhunted
from Visa International, the card payment organisation, to become director
of AA Financial Services.
Bruce, 43, had been at Visa since 1990, with responsibility for developing
products in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and sounds pleased to have
escaped to more direct contact with customers.
'Visa is a membership organisation, its members are banks and you're dealing
with them on a bank-to-bank footing,' he says. 'Here, you're dealing with
people; it's more on the frontline.'
Having become an AA member himself on taking up his post last month, his
mission now is to extend the financial services operation's reach further
into the 4m personal members of the AA, and to develop further the
instalment credit schemes, Visa cards and loan accounts AA already offers.
Both he and Mark Wood, who runs AA's insurance, financial services and
retail arms, plan to extend operations into new areas, such as motor
finance. 'So long as we always recognise that the core of the relationship
with the AA member is the road service, and associate other activities very
closely to that, then I think the member will see an integrated value in the
services we provide,' he says. Alison Smith

The Royal National Institute for Deaf People, one of Britain's leading
welfare charities, yesterday gained its first deaf chief executive.
Doug Alker, 54, the RNID's research and development director, was appointed
following a powerful campaign mounted within the charity for the top post to
go to someone suffering from deafness. The new chief executive is profoundly
deaf - British sign language is his first language.
Alker went to the RNID in 1987 following a career in industry. He was for
nearly 20 years an experimental officer at ICI, and before that an
analytical chemist with Pilkington. Other activities have included being a
semi-professional football manager.
There are 7.5m deaf, deaf-blind and hard of hearing people in the UK, and
Alker says his vision for the millennium is 'a country where deaf people are
no longer treated as second class citizens, have full access and are able to
participate fully in society'.
The RNID chief executive post became vacant with the appointment of Stuart
Etherington to be director of the National Council of Voluntary
Organisations. Alker and Etherington share the distinction, still relatively
rare among voluntary sector managers, of holding MBAs.

The growth of the 'unelected state' - the network of quangos operating on
the fringes of government - represents a direct threat to Britain's
democratic system, says a newly-published report.
The research shows that important decisions about the expenditure of
taxpayers' money are being taken behind closed doors by government
appointees.
It says the accountability of quangos - quasi-autonomous non-governmental
organisations - to parliament is often tenuous, while their accountability
to local communities is negligible. However, they are in charge of about a
fifth of public expenditure.
It adds: 'It is a system wide open to charges of party political influence
and corruption.'
The report, commissioned by the public service union Unison from Durham
University's Department of Sociology and Social Policy, demands that quangos
be reformed.
It proposes a review by government of quangos, the publication of details of
how members are chosen, an annually published register of quangos and board
members including occupation details and remuneration, and the publication
by each quango of a register of members' interests.
Unison also intends to develop a 'Quangowatch' network to monitor quangos
throughout Britain.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Westminster housing chief defended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROB EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The director of housing at Westminster City Council had nothing to gain from
vote-rigging, his barrister told the public inquiry yesterday.
Mr Graham England, director of the council's housing department since 1985,
is one of the 10 Conservative councillors and officials accused of
vote-rigging by the district auditor, Mr John Magill. Mr Jeremy McMullen QC,
for Mr England, said: 'For him there was no advantage, no promotion, no
money, no greater influence and no difference to his job security.'
He said Westminster councillors had put great pressure on officials during
the leadership of Dame Shirley Porter in the 1980s. 'Others may have felt
the climate at Westminster required them to comply in matters with which
they had professional disagreements. That is not the case with Graham
England. He has not tried to hide behind the threat of dismissal, duress or
pressure of work to excuse himself.'
In his provisional report the district auditor said that the 10 individuals
had aimed to use the designated sales policy to attract likely Tory voters
into eight marginal 'key' wards.
Mr McMullen argued that the aim of targeting the wards disappeared on June
17 1987 when councillor Peter Hartley, was made chairman of the housing
committee. Mr Hartley - one of the 10 accused - was motivated by a new and
radical policy of selling as many council homes as possible within the law,
said Mr McMullen.
The inquiry continues.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Railway inspector numbers increased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Health and Safety Executive has increased the number of railway
inspectors to 46 in response to the proposed privatisation of British Rail.
The addition of eight inspectors comes in a year in which the number of
crashes involving passenger trains doubled, although the number of
passengers and staff killed on the railways in 1993-94 was the lowest on
record, the executive's railway inspectorate said in its annual report.
Mr Stanley Robertson, the chief railways inspector said the extra inspectors
were required because companies 'with little or no previous experience of
operating on the railway and managers with limited experience of safety
issues may enter the railway industry as the BR monopoly is broken.
'Unless considerable care is taken, there can be no confidence that risk
will be effectively controlled right from the start and that important
matters will not fall between the safety arrangements of the various
parties.'
New regulations had been introduced and companies involved in railway
operations were required to present 'safety cases' explaining their
procedures. Even so, 'co-operation and safety interaction between operators
will be an important element in safety cases,' the report said.
Railtrack, which has taken over BR's track and stations, has had its safety
case accepted by the inspectorate. But others have not been sufficiently
detailed.
The number of 'significant' train accidents - those potentially the most
dangerous to passengers - increased from 133 to 142 in the year to March.
Passenger deaths fell to 17 from 28 the year before.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Parcelforce to axe 1,000 jobs after losing 8% of business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Post Office yesterday announced that 1,000 temporary jobs are to go at
Parcelforce early next year after the loss of a 50-year-old major contract
with Readers Digest magazine to White Arrow Express, part of the Great
Universal home shopping group. The contract accounted for 8 per cent of
Parcelforce's entire business operations.
The Post Office also announced sweeping changes in working practices to
return the Parcelforce business to profitability and improve the efficiency
of its 13,000 full-time staff.
Mr Bill Cockburn, Post Office chief executive, blamed two and a half years'
uncertainty about the corporation's future for the job cuts. Parcelforce
lost Pounds 19m in the last financial year, its fourth consecutive loss.
He said last night: 'This has resulted in Parcelforce's inability to invest
in its infrastructure at the same pace as our competitors which have been
able to exploit commercial freedoms we do not have.'
Mr Kevin Williams, Parcelforce managing director said the business had to
'move very quickly back on the road to profitability'. This will require a
huge improvement in efficiency and productivity. Details have not yet been
provided of what it will mean to the staff.
Parcelforce stressed last night it would not mean compulsory redundancies
among its full-time employees as long as they co-operated fully with the
proposed streamlining of operations but it did not rule out voluntary
reductions in the size of the workforce.
Mr Williams said there were 'already some encouraging signs' with a rise in
efficiency levels and contract gains worth Pounds 12.5m including the
distribution of national lottery stationery.
Mr Alan Johnson, UCW communications union general secretary said that the
business would 'fight back and be successful'. He made clear the union would
oppose compulsory redundancies in the Post Office. He said: 'The losses can
be managed by reducing casual and agency staff.' The staff would 'contribute
to the success' of returning Parcelforce to viability by 'continuing to
provide a parcels service that delivers at a uniform rate anywhere in the UK
 -a commitment no private carrier would ever be able to fulfil'.
Mr Johnson said the government could help to ensure the business flourished
by granting the Post Office greater commercial freedom in the public sector.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Guilty verdicts for 33 in fraud trials: Birmingham mortgage
swindle raised Pounds 35m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
West Midlands police have secured the conviction of 33 people in a series of
cases involving the fraudulent deception of building societies and banks to
obtain Pounds 35m.
Cases against 43 people were heard in a series of trials at the Birmingham
Crown Court. The trials, which were subject to reporting restrictions,
started in January and finished this week.
The court hearings followed some of the most elaborate police investigations
into mortgage fraud in the UK. Police operations, code-named Operation
Trooper, started in November 1990 and involved 23 officers.
'Operation Trooper is certainly the longest and most complex fraud
investigation ever conducted by us,' said Det Supt Tim Salt, head of West
Midlands Fraud Squad.
Police examined the buying and selling of 200 properties and identified 70
in the Sutton Coldfield and Erdington areas of north Birmingham as subject
to mortgage fraud. The transactions took place at the peak of the
residential property market, in and around 1988.
The fraud system worked on the basis of inflating the value of a particular
property. A member of the fraud ring would purchase a property legitimately
with the idea of selling it on to another member of the ring.
Once acquired, the property in question would have its value inflated and,
with the assistance of a spurious valuation, an application would be made
for a mortgage.
The members of the ring covered their tracks by using false names and
addresses on their mortgage applications. Once the mortgage funds were paid,
they disappeared as far as the lender was concerned: the members of the
fraud ring made no repayments.
Funds by this system of fraud were obtained from some of the leading housing
market lenders, including Abbey National, Birmingham Midshires, Bradford &amp;
Bingley, Coventry and Leeds Permanent building societies, the Bank of
Scotland and Barclays, Midland and National Westminster banks.
Their losses, although covered by indemnity policies, go further than the
amounts by which they were defrauded. The properties subject to the
fraudulent mortgages were repossessed, but their values have declined in
line with the downturn of the housing market.
Police explained that the channel to the lenders was through The Mortgage
Shop, Priory Queensway, Birmingham, whose principal was Mr Paul Fewtrell.
The property valuations came from Mr Ian Bain and the conveyancing was done
by Mr Stephen Hyde, a legal executive at Roger Lloyd and Company, a
Birmingham firm of solicitors now defunct.
The ringleader was Mr David William Harris of Monmouth Drive, Sutton
Coldfield. He was sentenced to six years' imprisonment for conspiracy to
defraud. His sentence, the most severe of the penalties given to the 33
guilty, was later reduced to five years.
At the first trial of the series, both Mr Bain and Mr Fewtrell were
acquitted.
However, two members of The Mortgage Shop management, Mr Dean Taylor and Mr
Phillip Kieley, were found guilty and sentenced respectively to 12 months'
imprisonment and 250 hours' community service.
So far 30 of the 33 guilty have received sentences ranging from community
service orders to spells of imprisonment. The remaining three will be
sentenced next month.
Meanwhile, West Midlands Fraud Squad has filed with the Crown Prosecution
Service evidence which may lead to two prosecutions for commercial property
fraud, this time involving trading estates in the Black Country.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Mawhinney warned of gridlock at London's airports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A powerful group of aviation, business and tourism bodies today urged Mr
Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, to increase capacity at airports
in the London area before the region reaches 'gridlock'.
Demand at airports in the south-east will exceed the capacity of existing
and proposed airport development early in the next century, according to a
letter sent to Mr Mawhinney yesterday.
The letter is the most co-ordinated attempt by organisations lobbying for
increased capacity and comes shortly before the government joins the debate
over a recent Department of Transport working group report, Runway Capacity
to Serve the South East (Rucatse).
The letter is from the chairman and other senior executives of the British
Air Transport Association, the Chartered Institute of Transport, the Air
Transport Users Council, the Confederation of British Industry, the British
Chambers of Commerce, the London Chamber of Commerce, the British American
Chamber of Commerce and the Association of British Travel Agents.
It warns that traffic lost to the UK will be to the gain of 'our near
European neighbours,' such as Charles de Gaulle in Paris, or Schipol in
Amsterdam.
The letter counsels the government to assess the economic consequences of
failing to meet future demand, especially the loss of potential inward
investment and tourism revenues.
It says the government should consider alternatives to Rucatse. The Rucatse
report argued that more use could be made of existing airport capacity in
the south-east than had been assumed. Greater use of regional airports would
delay the need for expansion in London.
The options, according to the letter, would include 'complementary
facilities' - which are understood to mean satellite feeder airports close
to Gatwick or Heathrow - and 'close parallel runways', meaning second
runways next to existing ones.
The Bata said figures last month from BAA, the airports operator, showed
passenger numbers up 7 per cent at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted in the
first nine months of 1994, compared with a year ago.
The association said the figures were higher than earlier BAA and Department
of Transport projections which had suggested that London's airports would be
able to accommodate demand until 2015.

FT  02 DEC 94 / US investors find strength in diversity: A sluggish New York
market has made larger UK stocks an attractive option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's official figures on share ownership provide the first glimpse of
how dramatic the shift of US money abroad has been for the UK market, which
has traditionally looked eastward first for new capital, rather than across
the Atlantic.
It should come as no surprise that US investors are buying foreign stocks.
UK fund managers have been opening offices from Atlanta, Georgia to Chicago,
Illinois for the better part of the 1990s, hoping to capitalise on the
growing trend for portfolio diversification.
Mr Jim Waterman, senior vice president at InterSec, a US-based pension fund
research company, said yesterday: 'Most plan sponsors now accept the
diversification rationale - that an internationally diversified portfolio
lowers overall risk.'
The fact that US markets have moved sideways and downwards over the past
year has emphasised the merits of diversification, as have a weak dollar and
a slump in US government bond markets.
Also, retail investors in the US have suddenly woken up to the merits of
asset diversification. Data from the Investment Company Institute, the trade
association for mutual fund companies, shows that at the end of October
1994, holdings of US mutual funds investing in foreign equities soared to
Dollars 106.76bn (Pounds 65m), up from Dollars 71.0bn at the end of 1993 and
Dollars 14.3bn at the end of 1990.
Ms Malin Jennings, director of communications at the institute, said: 'As
the stock and bond markets in this country have tapered off, people are
looking for growth elsewhere.'
The CSO statistics show foreign investors as the single biggest category of
UK share buyer in the past year - owning 16.3 per cent of all equity on the
UK stock market by the end of 1993, up from 13.1 per cent at the end of 1992
and 3.6 per cent at the end of 1981.
The statistics confirm the anecdotal evidence that it is US investors which
form the largest single foreign presence, accounting for 54.2 per cent of
all foreign money in the UK stock market, with an aggregate value of Pounds
49.2bn.
Investors based in the European Union hold a paltry-by-comparison 19.5 per
cent of all foreign-owned shares in Britain.
Investment by pension funds, by contrast, slipped slightly at the end of
1993 to 34.2 per cent of the market from 35.1 per cent the year before.
Measured by value, foreign investors are an even more significant force in
the market. Their holdings jumped 49.6 per cent to Pounds 130.2bn at the end
of 1993 from Pounds 80.7bn the year before. The figures suggest that US
investors are buying the highest-value shares.
Mr Waterman suggests that this is explained by the nature of the mandate US
pension schemes give their foreign stock managers. The vast majority of such
mandates are for EAFE - Europe, Australia and Far East, an index compiled by
Morgan Stanley Capital Index.
Managers tracking this index will have weightings of shares in each country
equal to that country's weighting in the index. Within each country, the
manager will buy shares which account for a disproportionate part of the
domestic stock index. Tracking this index will naturally tilt US funds
towards the larger capitalised stocks.
Some fund managers note a growing trend towards 'specialised' mandates, a
move which could encourage US investors into UK mid and small capitalisation
stocks. Mr Michael Bullock, managing director at Morgan Grenfell Investment
Managers, which manages money for US clients, said it had taken on an
increasing number of such accounts in the past year. Dunedin Fund Managers,
in Edinburgh, has attracted about Dollars 2bn of US pension fund money by
capitalising on its skill as a world-wide investor in smaller company
stocks.
Meanwhile, the growing presence of US investors in Britain is beginning to
have an effect on the way shares are bought and sold and on the relationship
between companies and shareholders. Mr Bullock said: 'Big American
(investors) are used to the very competitive commission rates they get in
their own country. They don't understand why these shouldn't be as
competitive elsewhere.'

FT  02 DEC 94 / Pension schemes win concession on bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is preparing to accede to pleas from the UK's largest
occupational pension schemes not to saddle them with a disproportionate
share of financing a new pensions regulator.
It is understood that the forthcoming bill for the reform of occupational
pensions will call for a flat per-member levy across the industry to help
finance a compensation scheme for benefits lost through fraud or
misappropriation.
However, the cost of the new regulator, estimated in a June white paper at
Pounds 10m a year, will be spread differently.
The government is expected to propose a 'weighted' levy which will ease the
contribution required of schemes with the most members.
Department of Social Security officials made clear this week that the main
provisions would be included in a bill that is expected to run to around 140
clauses and be published before the end of the year.
It is expected that the bill will be introduced in the House of Lords,
probably in mid to late December.
'The vast majority of our provisions will be in the bill and everything will
be debatable,' DSS officials said. 'There may be some secondary regulations
but these will not inhibit debate.'
DSS officials say the main provisions of the bill are little changed from
those stipulated in the government's white paper on occupational pensions
which was published this summer.
It is understood that there will be no change in the proposed powers of the
Occupational Pensions Regulator.
However, ministers have been engaged in last-minute consultations with the
industry on a number of important aspects of the bill.
In particular, there has been fierce debate over how a proposed minimum
solvency requirement on pension schemes will be set.
While employers' groups have been lobbying heavily to allow their equity
holdings to count more heavily towards the solvency calculation, actuaries -
the profession that must certify scheme solvency - have resisted. Equities
offer too little certainty of return to be held against liabilities for
pensions currently in payment.
Actuaries have told the government they will only use the looser standard if
a political decision is made by the DSS.
The bill will also clarify some aspects relating to the election of trustees
to pension schemes.
Labour MPs and many parts of the pensions industry have become concerned
that some of the most contentious clauses of the bill will not be contained
in the initial legislation, but will appear in secondary legislation or in
guidance notes issued by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.
However, DSS officials have been anxious to stress that public debate will
be held on all aspects of the bill.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Service sector figures plug information gap: Advertising,
accountancy and consultancy growing fastest; Architects and estate agencies
stagnant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Advertising agencies, accountants, business consultants and sanitary
services have been among the fastest-growing areas of the service sector
this year.
Architects and estate agents have been stagnant, while turnover at
hairdressers remains barely changed on the levels seen in 1992, in the depth
of the recession.
These are some of the details to have emerged from a new publication by the
Central Statistical Office on the service sector.
The publication marks an attempt by the CSO to expand coverage of this
sector, with senior officials increasingly acknowledging that it is one of
the largest statistical weaknesses.
Although the service sector employs 15m people and accounts for about 60 per
cent of gross domestic product, official government information on it has
been patchier and appeared later than other economic information.
By contrast, data on manufacturing, which accounts for only about a fifth of
GDP and employs only 4.2m, has been considerably more extensive and appears
more rapidly.
CSO officials point out that one reason for the relative weakness of the
data is that information on the sector is extremely difficult to collect,
particularly for areas such as business services.
Many City economists believe this lack of timely service-sector information
represents one of the biggest shortcomings of British statistics, not least
because it implies that the government statistical base is failing to adjust
sufficiently rapidly to the broader change in the nature of the economy.
As Mr David Mackie, economist at US investment bank JP Morgan points out,
the service sector component of the GDP figures has been more prone to
revision than many other elements of the GDP data in recent years.
But Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of
Commerce said the problem was not simply confined to government statistics.
In spite of the fact that groups such as like the Confederation of British
Industry provide detailed surveys on the manufacturing sector, comparable
surveys on the service sector remain fairly limited, with the chambers of
commerce providing one of the few surveys on the area.
The latest service sector data, published by the CSO yesterday, remains
distinctly patchy, with some information only available after a two-year
time lag.
Nevertheless the figures reveal some interesting trends.
Business and financial services, for example, has been one of the fastest
growing areas this year.
The quarterly turnover of computer service groups rose from Pounds 2.9bn in
the second quarter of last year to Pounds 3.4bn, at current prices, in the
second quarter of this year.
Employment agencies have also seen a rapid rise in business, with turnover
rising from Pounds 1bn in the second quarter of last year to Pounds 1.4bn in
the second quarter this year. The turnover of management consultants rose to
Pounds 874m in the second quarter of this year, compared with Pounds 793m in
the second quarter of last year.
Advertisers and market researchers have also seen fast growth, with turnover
rising from Pounds 671m in the second quarter of last year to Pounds 770m in
the second quarter of this year.
Accountancy service turnover was Pounds 1.7bn in the third quarter of this
year , compared with Pounds 1.6bn in the third quarter last year, and Pounds
1.4bn in the same period in 1991.
Legal services have seen their turnover rise from Pounds 1.9bn in the third
quarter of last year to Pounds 2.1bn in the third quarter of this year.
Growth in financial and business services, however, has been offset by a
decline in other areas.
Although distribution, hotels and catering is the largest component of the
service sector, many retailing and catering sectors have seen little growth
this year.
The turnover of architects in the third quarter of this year was
significantly lower than in 1991, while hairdressers, funeral directors and
photographers saw little change in business levels over this period.
Sanitary services have expanded rapidly, almost doubling in business over
the last three years. However the turnover of research chemists and
consulting engineers fell over the last year.
The data suggests that the number of employees employed by the service
sector has remained relatively constant in recent years.
Employment has dropped sharply in the last three years in the postal and
communications sector and railways, falling to 361,000 and 119,000
respectively. Meanwhile, the number of people employed by estate agents has
dropped from 112,000 in 1989 to 101,000 now.
The recreational, sport and cultural sectors have seen a rapid rise in
employment levels and business services and banking areas have also grown
significantly, with about 1.6m people now employed in business services.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Channel 4 faces complaint request
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Channel 4 is to be asked to broadcast an adjudication of the Broadcasting
Complaints Commission criticising aspects of one of its programmes - Close
to Home: A Tale of Two Cities - about the Edinburgh 'Fettesgate' affair.
Fettesgate involved the theft of documents from an Edinburgh police station
detailing alleged offences by gay lawyers.
The BCC ruled the programme's linking of Mr Derek Donaldson to the events
concerned involved significant unfairness to him.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Lloyd's to press for early trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London has decided to press for an early trial of issues raised
by a Court of Appeal ruling last month which could undermine efforts by the
insurance market to collect more than Pounds 1bn owed by loss-making Names,
Ralph Atkins writes.
Lloyd's had wanted to appeal to the House of Lords over the ruling that the
insurance market might have contravened European Union law, in particular by
asking Names to contribute to a 'central fund' while underwriting.
But Lloyd's decided it had a better chance of an early resolution by
applying for a trial in the commercial court next spring.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Overseas holdings rise to 16.3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Overseas ownership of UK shares grew faster than any other sector of
shareholders last year, official figures show.
The Central Statistical Office yesterday said the survey showed that
overseas owners accounted for 16.3 per cent of share ownership, compared
with 13.1 per cent in 1992.
The survey covered 79 companies, including many of the largest, representing
53 per cent of the total capitalisation of the London Stock Exchange.
The US accounted for 41.8 per cent of this overseas investment. If this
percentage is extrapolated to cover the total amount of stock market equity,
this implies that US investors held Pounds 49.2bn of shares in 1993, up from
Pounds 37.1bn in 1992.
Overseas investors tended to have much larger holdings than other groups,
the survey suggests.
A total of Pounds 43.5bn out of Pounds 117.6bn of the shares held by
overseas investors in 1993 were in holdings worth more than Pounds 100m,
with most of the rest accounted for by holdings of more than Pounds 10m.
The largest single group of holdings by pension funds, by contrast, occurred
in the category of between Pounds 1m and Pounds 10m - with Pounds 95.7bn
worth of shares held there.
Most of the unit trusts holdings occurred in the Pounds 1m to Pounds 10m
holdings band. For individuals, the majority of shares were in holdings of
between Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 100,000.
The fastest expanding area in overseas investment was in the
non-manufacturing sector.
Overseas share ownership in manufacturing companies rose from an
extrapolated Pounds 38bn in 1992 to Pounds 49.5bn in 1993. Overseas
ownership of non-manufacturing shares, however, rose further to Pounds
51.2bn in 1993, up from Pounds 31.3bn in 1992.
Overseas ownership of shares in financial companies roughly doubled in this
period to Pounds 16.9bn.
UK individuals held Pounds 33.1bn worth of shares in financial companies in
1993, Pounds 61.5bn in non-manufacturing companies and Pounds 41.8bn in
manufacturing groups.
Pension fund holdings were also more heavily concentrated in
non-manufacturing companies - with Pounds 108.3bn worth of shares. This was
considerably larger than 1992's figure of Pounds 86bn.
Their ownership of manufacturing shares changed less in this period, with
Pounds 87.1bn worth of shares held in 1992 and Pounds 96.4bn in 1993.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Investment watchdog may broaden scope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Complaints about term assurance and permanent health insurance are likely to
be transferred to the ombudsman scheme linked to the Personal Investment
Authority (PIA), the watchdog to protect the private investor, even though
these policies are outside its scope.
The prospect of such a move increases the probability that the PIA itself
will seek to extend its remit to these areas.
Its board has already commissioned some work on taking responsibility for
regulating the marketing of term assurance - protection-only policies which
do not carry an element of investment as other life policies do - and is due
to discuss the issue again early in the new year.
Since neither term assurance nor permanent health insurance are strictly
investments, they do not come within the Financial Services Act. This means
the PIA could extend its powers only with the agreement of those it
regulates.
The regulation of term assurance is the less contentious issue of the two,
since the policies are relatively straightforward and commissions to sales
agents are generally lower than those for life insurance policies. Permanent
health insurance is more complex, and is an area of the market that is
growing fast.
But the PIA's lack of power to regulate term assurance has already meant
that plans to require sales agents to disclose commission and more product
information on this type of business have had to be postponed. The new
requirements will apply to life insurance policies from the start of next
month.
At present, disputes about term assurance or permanent health insurance
which cannot be resolved between customer and insurer are handled by the
Insurance Ombudsman Bureau. The bureau has already lost responsibility for
complaints about the marketing of life insurance and investments, following
the setting up of the PIA ombudsman scheme in the summer.
Insurance companies have been consulted by the bureau about how to split the
areas of complaints, which do not have to be transferred to the PIA
ombudsman, between the two watchdogs.
The plan which is said to have been generally agreed by the insurers is that
all complaints about long-term policies should be dealt with by the PIA
ombudsman, and all complaints about general insurance should continue to be
handled by the IOB.
A few companies which specialise in permanent health insurance have
expressed opposition to this split. A compromise may be agreed allowing the
IOB to continue to deal with complaints about these businesses.
Arrangements have yet to be discussed fully with Mr Stephen Edell, the PIA
ombudsman. The changes are not expected to be finalised until some time in
the first half of next year.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Accountants claim tax breakthrough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, yesterday claimed a landmark victory
for a client, Uniholdings, in a High Court case against the Inland Revenue.
The case concerned a transaction by Uniholdings, a UK company, in which it
borrowed foreign currency in order to invest in shares.
Because of currency movements Uniholdings made a loss on borrowings in
dollars but a gain on a forward purchase of dollars designed to hedge
against foreign exchange exposure.
The Inland Revenue, said Price Waterhouse, claimed the gain was liable to
tax but that no relief was available for the loss.
'The judge rejected the Revenue's claim because as the borrowing and the
forward purchase of dollars was a composite transaction there was absolutely
no possibility of our client making a gain,' said Mr Guy Madewell, a Price
Waterhouse tax partner.
Price Waterhouse said the decision was the first in which a taxpayer company
had claimed the benefit of composite transactions law.
The judgment is open to appeal.

FT  02 DEC 94 / MP calls for water supply reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A large difference between water charges paid by families living on two
sides of the same street last night prompted a Tory MP to call for changes
in regulations governing the industry.
Mr Richard Ottaway, MP for Croydon South, wants the government to change
regulations under the Water Industry Act to make it easier for companies to
supply residents beyond their borders.
In a Commons adjournment debate, Mr Ottaway said his interest in the issue
had been triggered when a constituent discovered that her bill from East
Surrey Water was more than Pounds 100 a year more than the one received by
families on the other side of the road.
She asked the local council to lobby for supplies to be received from Thames
Water, which was providing the cheaper water. However, the council
discovered that Thames Water was prevented from doing this because of a
threshold imposed by Ofwat, the industry regulator.
Mr Ottaway said Thames Water would have to prove it could supply 250
megalitres a year to the area, but average family consumption was 0.15
megalitres. He called for the threshold to be reduced.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Portillo forecasts rosy work prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sustained fall in unemployment was forecast by Mr Michael Portillo, the
employment secretary, when the Commons resumed the Budget debate yesterday.
He said there would be job opportunities as business created prosperity and
foreign investment was attracted by the framework established by government
policies.
Mr Portillo clashed with Ms Harriet Harman, shadow employment secretary, who
described him as the 'enemy of measures to put people back to work and the
enemy of the unemployed'.
He maintained that Labour's support for the introduction of a minimum wage
and other measures imposing additional costs on employers would result in
higher unemployment.
Mr Portillo defended the cut in spending on the training-for-work programme.
He said that only about a third of the participants had succeeded in getting
a job even after months of training. Predicting better results from a
smaller budget, he said: 'We will raise the proportion getting jobs to 50
per cent.'
Ms Harman accused Mr Portillo of being opposed to a statutory minimum wage
because of 'dogma and not because of economic analysis'.
Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, told Tory
backbenchers opposed to the increase in VAT on domestic fuel to 17.5 per
cent that it was an essential part of Budget arithmetic.
Mr Nelson suggested that the review of debt management could lead to the
introduction of certain new types of bonds. 'Exotic bonds may be on the
menu,' he said.
The budget debate was adjourned until Monday.

because of BT's accounting methods it had proved impossible to determine
whether the group had been unfairly subsidising services offered by BT
Managed Network Services, a division with turnover of Pounds 60m a year.
A number of telecommunications companies had complained that BT was

FT  02 DEC 94 / Gridlock fear for London's airports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of aviation, business and tourism bodies are urging Mr Brian
Mawhinney, the transport secretary, to increase capacity at airports in the
London area before the region reaches gridlock, Andrew Baxter writes.
Demand at airports in the south-east will exceed the capacity of existing
and proposed airport development early in the next century, says a letter
sent to Mr Mawhinney.
The letter is from the chairman and other senior executives of the British
Air Transport Association, the Chartered Institute of Transport, the Air
Transport Users Council, the Confederation of British Industry, the British
Chambers of Commerce, the London Chamber of Commerce, the British American
Chamber of Commerce and the Association of British Travel Agents.
They warn that traffic lost to the UK would be to the gain of 'our near
European neighbours'.
The options they propose include 'complementary facilities' - which are
understood to mean satellite feeder airports close to Gatwick or Heathrow -
and second runways next to existing ones.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Army set to privatise its support vehicle fleet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The armed forces' fleet of 95,000 support vehicles is to be operated by the
private sector, with the military paying for the vehicles by the hour.
Mr Roger Freeman, the defence procurement minister, said yesterday that he
was committed to early action to move the fleet of non-combat Land Rovers,
trucks, vans and cars into the private sector with a pilot study being
conducted next year 'as a minimum'.
The fleet will probably be sold to a private company and then leased back to
the Ministry of Defence with the private contractor responsible for
maintenance and replacement. The ministry had expected to spend about Pounds
450m replacing the fleet over the next 10 years, but this will now be done
by the private sector with the MoD paying an annual fee to use the vehicles.
However, Mr Freeman was lukewarm about a similar recent proposal from
British Aerospace to refurbish and operate the Royal Air Force's ageing
Hercules transport aircraft fleet and to charge the MoD for its use by the
hour. He said: 'Leasing military aircraft is more difficult and there are
many other factors to take into account.'
Leasing of non-combat vehicles has been championed by the RAF which has been
accused of dragging its heels over previous 'market-testing' initiatives
involving the private sector. However, the idea has been opposed by the
army, which has a much larger vehicle fleet.
Mr Freeman said that once the pilot was completed 'it would be natural for
the support fleet to be managed on a tri-service basis'.
The minister was speaking after a seminar in London yesterday to promote
privatesector involvement in defence operations. The 'Competing for Quality'
initiative is designed to get a minimum of Pounds 2.3bn, or about 10 per
cent, of the MoD's current work done by private companies before the year
2000.
Private involvement will range from joint ventures and management contracts
to fullscale privatisation. Mr Freeman said: 'I don't see why we shouldn't
get well beyond the Pounds 2.3bn target. Pushing on with vehicle leasing is
one way of demonstrating clearly that we are serious about this.'
Already on the list for market testing is the operation of the Royal Navy's
tug and tanker fleet, the provision of logistics information systems to the
army's quartermaster general, and engineering support for the RAF's Hawk jet
trainers.
The private ownership and operation of training aircraft could also be added
to the market-testing list.
So far companies have been reluctant to become involved, partly because they
feel commercially sensitive information could be used against them. Mr
Freeman said the MoD was designing more flexible ways for companies to make
bids or suggestions without sacrificing secrecy.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Companies 'cut cash for Tories'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party has suffered a big fall in cash gifts from companies,
says a survey published today by the Labour Research Department, a research
organisation funded mainly by unions.
Labour Research could find only 168 companies that had made donations in the
year to March to the Conservative party, the lowest such figure produced by
the research group.
The companies in the survey donated a total of Pounds 2.51m, which is the
third lowest sum reported by the annual survey since 1979.
The total was down substantially from Pounds 7.76m in 1991 - the last
comparable year because gifts for 1992 and 1993 were boosted by the
closeness of the last general election.
The annual survey by Labour Research is considered a good guide to how much
companies are donating to the Conservatives, although it cannot be regarded
as completely authoritative. It covers about 5,000 UK companies and is
thought to capture most of the large donations made by big public companies.
The survey does not include cash donated by individuals or amounts donated
by companies not listed in the UK.
The Pounds 2.51m traced by Labour Research accounts for just over a quarter
of the Pounds 9.37m which was donated to the Conservatives in the year to
the end of March from companies and individuals.
In the past two years several big companies have cut back or stopped
donations either because of reductions in profits during the recession or
because they have not wanted to be seen publicly to be diverting large sums
to the Conservatives.
Among the companies cutting back have been food manufacturer United
Biscuits, construction company Taylor Woodrow, the Argyll supermarket group
and drinks company Allied Domecq.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Ministers bullish on VAT vote win
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior ministers were increasingly confident yesterday that the government
would be able to beat off a Labour attempt to force a vote on the second
stage of the imposition of value added tax on heating fuel.
But the vote appears likely to be close after confirmation that the nine
Ulster Unionist MPs, who supported the government in Monday's confidence
vote on Europe, will vote with the opposition.
But Tory whips are hopeful that no more than half of the dozen Tory VAT
rebels will go through with threats to defy the party whip - suggesting that
the government will have a majority of between two and eight votes.
Two Conservative backbenchers announced in the Commons last night that they
would not back the government next week in the vote. Mr Nicholas Winterton,
Conservative MP for Macclesfield, said there was 'little to celebrate in the
Budget'. He added: 'The decision to proceed bull-headed with the imposition
of the second tranche of VAT on domestic fuel bills will be widely
resented.'
Mr Phil Gallie, the Conservative MP for Ayr and another critic of the
decision to impose 17.5 per cent VAT on domestic fuel, said he would abstain
when Labour's procedural motion was put to the vote on Tuesday night.
However, senior ministers think that much of the steam has gone out of the
rebellion since the failure of rightwing attempts to raise sufficient
support for a challenge to Mr John Major's leadership. Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, was breezily confident that the government would defeat the
Labour motion.
The motion amounts to a procedural device that would pave the way for a
further vote on the implementation of the second tranche of VAT during the
passage of the finance bill.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Experts attack insolvency laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Urgent reform of the insolvency laws to correct serious injustices was
called for yesterday by Justice, the civil liberties pressure group.
A committee chaired by Mr David Graham QC and including Mrs Justice Arden
and Mr Philip Pink, former deputy inspector-general of the government's
insolvency service, concluded there was 'a serious imbalance' in the system
which operated overwhelmingly to the prejudice of small businesses and
individuals.
The system introduced by the 1986 Insolvency Act produced 'minimal financial
benefits' for unsecured creditors, and a lack of alternative procedures
forced far too many small consumer debtors into bankruptcy. Bankruptcies
have risen from about 4,000 a year at the time of the Cork committee's
review of insolvency law at the end of the 1970s to 40,000 in 1993.
The committee says that if the injustice to ordinary creditors is not
remedied soon it will result in the 'bankruptcy of bankruptcy'.
By contrast the government has done extremely well out of the present
regime. In 1992-93 it earned more than Pounds 50m from holding funds of
insolvent estates, Pounds 9m more than it costs to run the insolvency
service.
Insolvency practitioners and large secured creditors such as banks have also
benefited.
The committee recommends:
The appointment of an insolvency ombudsman. More advice for small debtors
provided by the government and insolvency practitioners on a 'pro bono'
basis.
The creation of a two-tier bankruptcy system to separate serious or
fraudulent cases from ordinary small debtors.
A creditors' charter to ensure creditors' concerns are adequately met by
insolvency practitioners.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Blair's school choice starts row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair's political honeymoon as Labour leader ended yesterday in a
blaze of controversy over his decision to send his son to a grant-
maintained school outside local authority control.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, education secretary, said Mr Blair's choice of the
Roman Catholic London Oratory school for his son Euan, 10, marked a U-turn
for Labour.
Mr John Major seized on the issue in the Commons, accusing Mr Blair of using
the grant maintained system while planning 'to remove the same privileges
from everyone else'.
The decision also worried the National Union of Teachers, which said the
school had opted out of centralised salary agreements as well as local
authority financing.
Mr Blair, campaigning in the west Midlands for this month's Dudley
by-election, said he hoped the issue would not be 'a political football to
be kicked across the political divide'.
Mr Blair said he and his wife Cherie had chosen the London Oratory because
it was a Roman Catholic school that regularly took pupils from his son's
present school, the Joan of Arc primary in Islington, London, where the
family lives.
'The Labour party is in favour of choice for people and decent schools for
people,' Mr Blair told BBC television. 'I am not going to make a choice for
my child on the basis of what is the politically correct thing to do.'
Labour officials said there was no conflict between Mr Blair's choice of
school and the party's education policy, which is being reviewed by Mr David
Blunkett, appointed shadow education secretary in a shadow cabinet reshuffle
last month.
Mr Blunkett has dropped plans to force grant maintained schools back into
the local authority system, but remains committed to ending further opt-outs
and to changing the funding system.
Mrs Shephard said there were two local authority-run Roman Catholic
comprehensive schools in Islington which Euan could have attended.
'Mr and Mrs Blair's decision will cause huge embarrassment to his Labour
colleagues, who will face the impossible task of squaring this decision with
the party's words,' she said.
Mr Graham Lane, education committee chairman of the Labour-controlled
Association of Metropolitan Authorities, said Mr Blair's decision was 'not
helpful to the party position'.
Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, said Mr and Mrs Blair were
'exercising a choice provided by Conservative legislation few other parents
could contemplate.
'The Oratory School has not only opted out of local authority control - it
is also the only school to have opted out of the statutory arrangements
governing teachers' pay and conditions of service,' he said.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Customs chief insists job cuts are in the line of duty:
Battlelines drawn up as unions attack the plan to shed 4,000 staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER and RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Valerie Strachan, chairman of Customs and Excise, has denied union
claims that the shedding of 4,000 jobs over the next five years is driven
solely by the government's need to find scope for tax cuts before the next
election.
She said the plan - attacked by unions as risking increased drug smuggling
and a loss of VAT revenue - 'does not represent for us a fundamental change
in direction. It is a further pretty big step down the road we were already
travelling.'
The Customs and Excise service has already seen changes in recent years, not
least through the opening of European border controls under the single
market. Its 25,000 staff is split between 12,000 doing value added tax work;
9,000 in customs (looking for drugs, firearms and pornography); 2,000 in
excise (responsible for duty collection from brewers and distillers) and
inland customs, and 3,000 support staff.
In the year to March, the service gathered revenue of Pounds 66.7bn - 45 per
cent of the total government tax yield. Nearly 60 per cent of the
department's revenue comes from VAT and only 3 per cent from Customs duties.
Customs officers no longer limit the amount of duty-paid drink and
cigarettes individuals can bring into the country from the rest of Europe -
so long as they are for private consumption. But 240 plain-clothes excise
verification officers monitor pubs and off-licences to check that goods
imported in this way are not being sold on.
The NUCPS and the CPSA, the main civil service unions involved, had been
campaigning for an increase in anti-smuggling staff. They said: 'The
incentive to potential smugglers is all too clear if you consider the
potential profits involved. A single lorry load of smuggled cigarettes would
result in a loss of tax revenue of over Pounds 600,000, most of which would
end up as pure profit to the smuggler.'
The Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association said that, if customs staff
were to be weakened, 'it can only be good news for bootleggers and the
French chancellor'.
Mrs Strachan said that 'adding back' customs staff into intelligence work
would maintain, or even improve, effectiveness. She added: 'We will be
placing a greater emphasis on high-risk and complex work, and give less
priority to routine activity where the risks are lower and results have been
less.'
The unions argue that cutting 550 front-line anti-smuggling officers risks
increased drug smuggling. They point out that two of the UK's biggest drug
hauls - cannabis worth Pounds 35m last month at Felixstowe and Pounds 9m
worth of heroin at Sheerness, Kent, in October  - were the result of routine
checks, not specific intelligence. Mr John Amos, of NUCPS, said: 'Smugglers
aren't idiots - if they see there are gaps, they will exploit them.'
However, police officers welcomed the shift in anti-smuggling work towards
operations against trafficking. Mr Keith Hellawell, the chief constable of
West Yorkshire who chairs the drugs committee of the Association of Chief
Police Officers, said: 'The fight against crime will not be affected by the
changes because our work is already intelligence-led.'
Most attention has focused on the dangers of increased drug smuggling, but
the biggest single group of jobs to go from the department will be 2,000 VAT
officials. Mrs Strachan said a large part of this reduction was due to
'rethinking our approach to VAT control'.
She added: 'Many businesses are either very small or very compliant or
possibly both.' They did not need to be visited as often as they were.
Mr Dave Morris, NUCPS assistant general secretary, said that all businesses
are guaranteed a visit by a Customs inspector within three years of
registering for VAT under the Citizen's Charter. 'We will have to tear up
that commitment - we simply cannot do it with these proposals,' he said.
The department's most recent annual report, for the year to March, admitted
that only 80.5 per cent of newly registered businesses were being visited
within three years.
Mr Ian Hanford, policy chairman for the National Federation of Small
Businesses, said: 'If you are given bad tax advice and it is five or six
years before the VAT officers come in, there could be horrendous penalties
which could wipe the business out.
'Where VAT officers are looked on as protection, fewer inspections could be
bad news.'

FT  02 DEC 94 / Councils stretched over funds gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Tuesday, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced a 2.2 per cent rise
in local government funding in the Budget. Yesterday, the Association of
County Councils denounced it as a cut of 3.3 per cut in cash terms.
The dispute perfectly illustrates the growing gap between central and local
government, which appears to have widened this year with bitter attacks on
both the chancellor and the environment secretary, Mr John Gummer, from
councillors of all parties.
Mr Clarke was referring to an increase in 'total standard spending' - the
government's estimate of what local government should spend. This is used as
the basis for grants to local government, which are topped up by council
tax, levied by councils. It will increase from Pounds 42.58bn this year to
Pounds 43.51bn in 1995-96.
The counties, in common with the other English local authority associations,
were talking about the amount they actually spend. This year, they spent
Pounds 44.42bn. Next year, if spending on all services is frozen but extra
responsibilities are taken on for community care at the expected cost, they
predict this will rise to Pounds 45bn.
The crucial point, as far as the councils are concerned, is that the
government is budgeting for them to spend around Pounds 1bn less than they
are already spending - before inflation, pay rises or any changes in
responsibilities are taken into account.
Central and local government have been out of kilter ever since the poll tax
was introduced in 1990-91. This was almost redressed by the generous
settlement negotiated for 1991-92 in an attempt to dampen the unpopular
effects of the poll tax, but since then the gap has widened again, limited
only by the government's policy of 'capping' local authority budgets to
thwart excessive rises in local taxation.
Councils say unrepeatable technical factors enabled them to avoid serious
cuts in services this year. They made an unprecedented Pounds 775m draw on
reserves. They also underestimated how much council tax they would collect
in 1993-94 - its first year of operation - which effectively gave them a
windfall for 1994-95.
Next year, they claim additional factors will come into effect. These
include a rise of 110,000, or approximately 1 per cent, in the number of
school pupils, and a rise in the number of elderly requiring care.
Local government finance experts suggest Mr Clarke's 2.2 per cent figure for
the estimated total standard spending is in any case misleading.
An analysis by Mr Edward Dimbylow for the Local Government Chronicle points
out that Mr Clarke's figure included the new responsibilities for community
care, which require extra funding. It also included the 3 per cent increase
in the budget for police authorities, which is paid to local authorities,
but is ring-fenced so that it can only be spent on police services. The
chancellor had also included funding for local government reorganisation,
which starts next year.
Once these items are stripped from the equation, says the Local Government
Chronicle, the increase in total standard spending 'hovers around 0.18 per
cent, or a virtual cash freeze'.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Brokers believe in Santa George
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new entry in this week's box office charts is the animated film The
Nightmare before Christmas.
In the movie, Halloween figures take over the role of Santa Claus and ruin
the Yuletide cheer. But in the nightmares of retailers and some stock market
investors, the figure of Christmas terror is personified in the more
down-to-earth form of Mr Eddie George.
Many fear that the governor of the Bank of England will press for a further
rise in base rates when he meets Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, on
December 7. That might deliver a heavy blow to consumers in the
all-important Christmas shopping season.
Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International bank (Europe),
said: 'A lot of shops do a quarter of their turnover in the run-up to
Christmas. To hit consumers with the psychological shock of a rate rise
would be supremely bad timing.'
The Bank of England has already warned that rates will have to rise at some
point over the next few months if the government is to achieve its aim of
getting underlying inflation within the lower half of its 1 per cent to 4
per cent target range by the end of this parliament.
Mr Adam Cole, UK economist at brokers James Capel, said there was a strong
case for an early rate rise: 'If you look at the Bank's list of inflation
concerns, almost every one has deteriorated. The pace of growth has been
revised up further, and lead indicators such as the CBI survey suggest the
economy is not losing momentum in the fourth quarter.'
However, Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, the
stockbrockers, noted that October's economic data, such as retail sales and
the M4 measure for broad money supply, had been weak. He thought there had
been insufficient evidence since Mr Clarke and Mr George last met on
November 2 to persuade the two to act.
Certainly Mr Clarke might be able to put a compelling case for delay. This
week's Budget confirmed the previously announced tax rises and imposed
further controls on public spending. Both should be expected to slow
economic growth. Indeed, the Treasury is forecasting that the UK's gross
domestic product, having grown at 4 per cent in 1994, will rise by only 3.25
per cent next year.
Furthermore, in the red book which accompanied the Budget, the Treasury took
an optimistic line on the size of the 'output gap', one of the key measures
used by economists for assessing the scope for inflationary pressure.
'There is almost certainly a sizeable (output) gap,' it said. 'In other
words, there is still spare capacity in the economy as a whole. This should
allow the economy to continue growing faster than trend without any
significant upward pressure upon prices.'
There are also one or two technical details that might make the timing of a
December rate rise difficult. On the day of the meeting, the Bank of England
will hold a gilt auction. Back in January 1993, an interest rate cut held
just before an auction upset many marketmakers.
While a interest rate rise this time might not disrupt the market - gilt
prices might benefit from evidence of the government's anti-inflationary
commitment - the timing would still look awkward. Mr Cole said: 'Were the
auction to go badly and traders end up with a lot of stock, the Bank
wouldn't want to clobber traders with a rate rise as well.'
Another timing problem for the governor is that he is giving evidence on the
Budget to the Commons' Treasury and civil service committee on December 8.
That would mean that, if he received the go-ahead from Mr Clarke to raise
rates, he would have to raise them before he addressed the committee to
avoid prevarication and possible deceit.
On balance, then, analysts think a rate rise will be delayed, if only until
January. Mr Shepperd said: 'Waiting a month until January probably won't
make that much difference to the economy. And Eddie George may find Kenneth
Clarke more receptive.'
When a rise is announced, Mr Cole thinks it will be of half a percentage
point. 'More than half a point would seem like panic, and a quarter of a
point is not enough.'
So even if Mr George does allow retailers to enjoy a merry Christmas, he
could still deny them a happy new year.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Victory against Revenue claimed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, yesterday claimed a landmark victory
for a client, Uniholdings, in a High Court case against the Inland Revenue.
The case concerned a transaction by Uniholdings, a UK company, in which it
borrowed foreign currency in order to make investments in shares.
Because of currency movements Uniholdings made a loss on borrowings in
dollars but a gain on a forward purchase of dollars designed to hedge
against foreign exchange exposure.
The Inland Revenue, said Price Waterhouse, claimed the gain was liable to
tax but that no relief was available for the loss.
Mr Guy Madewell, a tax partner at Price Waterhouse, said: 'The judge
rejected the Revenue's claim because as the borrowing and the forward
purchase of dollars was a composite transaction there was absolutely no
possibility of our client making a gain.'
Price Waterhouse said the decision was the first in which a taxpayer company
had claimed the benefit of composite transactions law.
The judgment is open to appeal.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Tax document seizures face strict controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There will be strict controls on new Inland Revenue powers to demand
documents from accountants suspected of being involved in tax evasion.
The Ely Report - commissioned by the government after an outcry over
sweeping seizure powers proposed earlier this year - contains a series of
radical restraints on the Revenue.
Mr Philip Ely, the author of the report and a former president of the Law
Society, said he had decided that the powers recommended by the government
in March were 'far too wide'.
However, he agreed that the Revenue did face problems when there was no way
of getting hold of documentary evidence that an accountant was involved in
evasion.
Mr Ely's report, which has been backed by the government and may be included
in this year's finance bill, recommends that:
Action should only be taken where there are reasonable grounds to believe
that an accountant intended to evade tax liability.
The request for an order for documents by an officer of the Revenue should
be made on oath.
The evidence must point to a named client or clients. An appeal can be made
by the accountant.
An independent special commissioner should oversee the action.
The right of access extends only to the named individual client of an
accountant, not to the partnership's clients as a whole.
A strict time limit should run from the time the disputed documents were
filed to the Revenue.
During the consultation period on the Ely Report, a system should be sought
to allow agreed settlements to be made with the accountant concerned.
In spite of the restrictions on the new powers, the right of the Revenue to
acquire documents after an accountant has suffered a penalty or conviction
will remain.
Mr Richard Rees-Pulley, of accountants Ernst &amp; Young, which ran a campaign
against the extension of powers, said: 'We are desperately disappointed.
Obviously Mr Ely has done a very diligent job.
'However, the Revenue has too many powers already.'
Ernst &amp; Young polled more than 6,000 small accountancy firms on the earlier
proposals to extend Revenue powers. This found that 97.3 per cent thought
existing powers were sufficient.

FT  02 DEC 94 / World Service wins managerial independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBC World Service has won its managerial independence from government after
more than 50 years and will in future be able to decide in what languages to
broadcast and for how many hours.
The World Service, which now broadcasts its radio programmes in 41 languages
to more than 130m regular listeners, has always guarded its editorial
independence. But since 1938, when the Foreign Office began funding the
service, the government has had the right to specify the languages broadcast
and the relative importance given to particular language groups.
In the early 1980s there were confrontations when the government wanted the
BBC to give up its Italian, Spanish and Maltese services and in the late
1980s the government insisted the BBC should stop its Japanese and Malay
language services.
After more than a year of negotiations the government has agreed to give up
its 'prescription' rights in return for greater accountability.
The freedom could lead to a shake-up at the service with Mr Sam Younger, the
managing director, having to set priorities with a grant that is declining
in real terms. The annual grant is about Pounds 170m and over the current
three-year funding period the BBC has estimated it will lose about 8 per
cent in real terms.
The languages change, due to be announced soon, is set out in a corporate
plan already endorsed by the BBC board of governors and Foreign Office
ministers.
In return for the changes, the service will try to increase its audience
size to 140m by 1996-97. New value-for-money targets will aim to increase
staff output and programme minutes for every Pounds 1,000 spent.
On Wednesday the BBC began broadcasting in two new languages - Azeri and
Uzbek - languages spoken in eight former Soviet republics in central Asia.
The BBC is undertaking a review of what its new priorities will be with
emphasis on countries where there is an 'information need'.
Executives warn privately however that high priority will not necessarily
mean more money and low priority may simply mean that those countries can be
better addressed by BBC Worldwide Television, the BBC's international
television operations.
The Arab world, Israel, China, Russia and the Ukraine and south Asia are
likely to be high priority. Medium-priority areas will range from Iran and
Afghanistan to most of Africa, the Balkans and south-east Asia. Low priority
is expected to be given to the countries of the European Union, the
Caribbean, north America, central and south America and Japan and Korea.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Clinton's man seeks dividend: A look at the fresh faces in
Northern Ireland's peace process
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday named the retiring senator Mr George
Mitchell as his special adviser for economic initiatives in Northern
Ireland.
'There must be a peace dividend in Ireland for peace to succeed,' Mr Clinton
said in a White House ceremony to announce the appointment.
Although the appointment marks to some degree a larger US role in the search
for peace in Northern Ireland, US officials insisted that they were not
directly involved in the peace process and were concentrating only on the
economic aspects. Mr Clinton's election campaign promise to appoint a peace
envoy caused considerable friction with the British government before it was
shelved.
Mr Mitchell, who did not run for re-election in last month's congressional
elections, will step down as leader of the Senate Democratic majority when
the new Congress is installed in January. His appointment will take effect
on January 10.
Although Mr Mitchell's father was the son of Irish immigrants, his more
publicised root has generally been his mother's Lebanese origins.
A former judge with a keen legal mind, studiously even-tempered manner and
unrelenting tenacity, Mr Mitchell has been wooed for a wide range of far
more prominent jobs. Mr Clinton tried to persuade him to accept a seat on
the Supreme Court earlier this year but Mr Mitchell preferred to press for
health care reform before he stepped down from the Senate. He remains a
popular choice to become commissioner of baseball.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Coats Viyella to get works council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coats Viyella, Britain's largest clothing and textiles group, has agreed, in
principle, to the creation of a works council for its 34,000 employees
inside the European Union.
The company and the British unions involved hope to announce a formal
agreement by next March. This follows the announcement two weeks ago that
United Biscuits had decided to establish a works council under a new EU
directive, the first British-owned company to do so.
The move by Coats Viyella is a further sign that a growing number of large
British companies with widespread European business activities intend to
ignore the UK's opt-out from the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty,
achieved by Mr John Major, the prime minister, nearly three years ago.
This would have allowed them to exclude their UK employees from the
consultation and information arrangements which will be required under
European law for their employees outside the UK.
Coats Viyella has proposed the creation of a two-tier system of councils for
its employees. A group forum will meet once a year under the chairmanship of
the company's chief executive, Mr Neville Bain.
This would include key managers of the group and around 50 employee
representatives from the company's European plants.
Consultation and information committees are also to be established for each
of the company's six divisions.
The proposed committees of managers and workers would discuss a wide range
of areas including economic performance, financial issues, the environment,
human resource management and health and safety.
Coats Viyella has 27,000 employees in the UK and 7,000 in other EU
countries.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Mandarin views Ulster as puzzle: A look at the fresh faces
in Northern Ireland's peace process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Quentin Thomas, who will lead the government's team in next week's talks
with Sinn Fein, is a 50-year-old career civil servant who is said to
approach the Northern Ireland peace process like an intellectual puzzle.
Deputy secretary at the Northern Ireland Office since 1991, Mr Thomas has
been a prominent and influential presence in behind-the-scenes negotiations
in recent years.
Deeply knowledgeable about the province's affairs, his solid track record
has won him the confidence of Tory backbenchers and interested observers.
A Cambridge man, educated at Perse School and Gonville and Caius College,
his career began in the Home Office in 1966. He served on the crime policy
planning unit between 1974 and 1976 and as secretary to the Royal Commission
on gambling between 1976 and 1978. He was head of the Home Office's
broadcasting department for four years from 1984 and moved to the Northern
Ireland Office in 1988.
He is married to the daughter of a former Treasury solicitor and his brother
is a Bristol university professor. The European Investment Bank aims to more
than treble its lending to Northern Ireland over the next three years, James
Whittington writes.
Sir Brian Unwin, the bank's president and chairman, said in London yesterday
that he hoped loans of about Ecu30m (Pounds 24m) would be raised to at least
Ecu100m by 1997 as part of the European Union's bid to bolster the peace
plan.
He said the bank would focus on long-term credit for small and medium-sized
enterprises.

Job growth in Latin America and the Caribbean cannot absorb the rapidly
expanding labour supply in the region and unemployment is expected to rise
slightly this year, the International Labour Organisation says. An ILO study
on the impact of economic adjustment programmes from 1990 to 1993 in the
region says unemployment is expected to reach 6.5 per cent this year,
compared with 6 per cent in the period studied. Growth in the labour supply
is estimated at 3.3 per cent this year because of a rise in the urban
workforce, while jobs are projected to grow by 2.7 per cent.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Tough Canadian gun controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's Liberal government plans to require all gun owners to register
their weapons as part of proposed gun-control legislation which it claims
would be among the strictest in the world. The proposals have provoked an
outcry from hunters and the well-organised gun lobby. They also include an
outright ban on most types of military-style rifles and short-barrelled hand
guns. Sentences for crimes involving guns would be significantly stiffened.
The authorities would also gain extra powers to curb weapons smuggled into
Canada from the US.
Public opinion is strongly in favour of tighter controls, following several
well-publicised murders which have dented Canada's reputation as a
non-violent society. Mr Allan Rock, justice minister, said Canada should not
become a US-style society where many people own guns for self-defence.

<TEXT>
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's president-elect, has chosen central
bank governor Mr Pedro Malan to become finance minister when he takes office
on January 1. The choice of Mr Malan suggests the economic team which
oversaw this year's launch of Brazil's new currency, the Real, will remain
largely intact, although in different posts, following the change of
government.
Before taking over the central bank, Mr Malan was Brazil's foreign debt
negotiator and oversaw much of the detailed discussion for this year's
Dollars 49bn foreign debt restructuring. A cautious man who weighs every
word, Mr Malan is a strong advocate of the Real and is known to favour a
more independent role for the central bank.
Mr Cardoso is thought to want Mr Persio Arida, one of the main economists
who planned the Real, to take over at the central bank.

US manufacturing activity continued to expand rapidly in November with
production hitting its highest level for 11 years, the National Association
of Purchasing Managers reported yesterday. The NAPM index rose to 61.2 per
cent from 59.7 per cent in October, while the association's production index
climbed to 66.7 per cent from 64.2 per cent in October.
Mr Ralph Kauffman, manager of procurement at Oryx Energy and chairman of the
association's business survey committee, said the advance was spread across
all but three of the 20 industrial sectors. The strongest growth was in
printing and publishing, paper, furniture, leather, petroleum, plastics and
rubber and transportation equipment industries.
The NAPM index of prices paid to suppliers fell in November, but this was a
result of seasonal adjustment factors. Mr Kauffman said all 20 sectors were
still reporting higher prices.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Clinton to boost defence budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US President Bill Clinton yesterday announced a boost in defence spending
intended to maintain the readiness of the US armed forces.
Countering criticism from the Republicans who will take control of Congress
next month, Mr Clinton promised an additional Dollars 25bn (Pounds 15.2bn)
in defence spending over the next six years for US forces to ensure they
'remain the best trained, the best equipped, the best prepared fighting
force on earth'.
The Defence Department budget will still dip from Dollars 252bn in the
current financial year, which started in October, to Dollars 246bn next year
and Dollars 243bn in fiscal 1997, but it will then climb to Dollars 277bn in
fiscal 2001, compared with an earlier target of Dollars 268bn.
US defence spending has fallen in real terms in every year since 1986, but
Mr Clinton promised that it would increase faster than inflation in
2000-2001.
In addition, Mr Clinton promised not to try to cut the pay increases
Congress has called for the armed forces over the next four years, and to
'spend what is required' on programmes such as housing and childcare to
improve the quality of life of the military and their dependants.
'Our number one commitment is to the readiness and welfare of our armed
forces,' Mr Clinton said.
Mr Clinton's appearance in the Rose Garden of the White House yesterday to
announce the plan represented a pre-emptive strike against Republicans who
criticised the administration for creating a 'hollow force' through
excessive defence cuts.
A Dollars 40bn gap had emerged between the money allocated to defence by the
administration's five-year budget plan and the Pentagon's own assessment of
what it needed to meet the US's overall strategic aim of being able to fight
two nearly simultaneous big regional wars. This was largely because of the
knock-on effects of a military pay increase Congress ordered last year, when
the administration had expected to include the armed forces in a pay freeze
for all government employees.
Mr Clinton will also ask Congress to approve around Dollars 2bn as emergency
funding to pay for military missions in Haiti, the Adriatic and Kuwait.
When Congress delayed approval of a similar request to fund the US troops
who returned ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to Haiti this autumn,
the Pentagon had to cut training in other areas to meet the unexpected cost.
As a result, readiness at three army divisions dropped to a point where they
could not be considered immediately available for action.
This drew howls from Republicans, but some senior members of Congress have
also complained that by spending whatever extra money it has on readiness
and by scrimping on the development of new weapons, the Clinton
administration is creating problems for the future.
Even with the additional money Mr Clinton said yesterday he would allocate
to defence, the Pentagon will still have to cancel or delay some new
equipment programmes.
But the list of cancellations may not be as long as originally expected when
Mr John Deutch, deputy defence secretary, ordered the services in August to
prepare plans to cut or stretch out procurement of a long list of their most
cherished weapons systems, including the F-22 fighter, the Comanche
helicopter and the Aegis destroyer.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Orange County loses Dollars 1.5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The fall in US bond prices this year has cost Orange County, one of the most
prosperous regions of Southern California, around Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds
960m) on paper in investment losses, county treasurer Robert Citron said
yesterday.
The 68-year-old Mr Citron has been an active user of derivative financial
instruments in recent years to increase the county's returns from
investments, a practice that has made him a controversial figure in the
financial markets.
The extent to which derivatives - financial instruments whose value is based
in part on some underlying market factor such as an interest rate or stock -
may have caused or exacerbated Orange county's losses remained unclear
yesterday.
Mr Citron put the losses at around 7 per cent of Orange County's total
investment portfolio, which he said had fallen in value from Dollars 20bn at
the start of the year to Dollars 18.5bn. Earlier this year an official
valued the fund as of the end of March at Dollars 21.7bn.
The county's statement was prompted by feverish rumours of big losses which
swept the US financial markets during yesterday afternoon.
Merrill Lynch, the US's biggest broking firm, was forced to issue a
statement denying it had suffered losses on its dealings with Orange County.
The company confirmed that it had dealings with the local authority, but
said that it hadn't called on the county to make any new cash payments to
cover losses.
Mr Citron, an elected official who fought off a challenge to his position
earlier this year over his use of derivatives, said that his fund's losses
were smaller than those suffered by many big private bond funds this year.
Provided a restructuring plan for the investment fund was completed, 'the
fund will not have to sell securities prematurely at a loss,' he said.

Similarly, the association's index of supplier deliveries - which can
indicate industry bottlenecks where inflationary pressures may build -
improved slightly, but Mr Kauffman said most purchasing managers remained
concerned about slow deliveries.

FT  02 DEC 94 / World Trade News: EU to amend origin rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After a long internal battle, the European Commission has approved modest
proposals for changes in rules of origin as part of its effort to boost
trade and investment in central and eastern Europe.
EU leaders are expected to adopt the proposals at next week's European
Council summit in Essen as part of a more generous market access package for
the six associate EU members: Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia,
Bulgaria and Romania. Rules of origin determine whether products receive
preferential tariff treatment, and are viewed as a test of the EU's
commitment to integrating eastern European countries as full members.
The rules are particularly important in industries such as textiles,
electronics and motor vehicles which involve processing or transforming
materials and goods imported from outside the preferential trade zone.
The battle within the commission centred on how far free traders led by Sir
Leon Brittan would overcome resistance from, among others, French and
Portuguese lobbies worried about likely job losses resulting from
progressive harmonisation of rules of origin.
Some estimates ran as high as 100,000 jobs at risk in the textile industry
alone, said a senior commission official.
The specific issue at stake was the degree of 'cumulation' of origin,
whereby products originating in partner countries such as Hungary or Poland
could be used in another partner country such as Bulgaria to yield a
finished product in that country eligible for preferential tariff treatment.
After more than a year's debate, the Commission adopted a step-by-step
approach covering the EU, the European Free Trade Association and the six
eastern European countries.
The first stage would streamline and simplify rules of origin in existing
agreements with Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia; extend
these rules to Bulgaria and Romania; and consider extending full cumulation
to Switzerland.
Shortly thereafter, it would introduce 'diagonal' cumulation between the
EU/Efta countries and the six east Europeans. This would would create a
common European area of origin, but it would not cover Asian and US assembly
plants in eastern Europe seeking preferential trade access to the EU. Full
cumulation. The commission failed, however, to set a date and made this
stage conditional on a 'thorough evaluation' of the impact on employment in
the EU. It could also lead to limited sectoral exceptions, according to a
commission paper to be sent to EU ministers.

Latin American indigenous leaders have denounced free trade as a scourge for
their land and people, as government officials from the 34 countries
scheduled to attend next week's Summit of the Americas negotiate last-minute
agreements on trade issues. Signed by representatives of more than 8m
indigenous people in South and Central America, the letter said free trade
would benefit multinational corporations at their expense and 'reinforce the
economic dominion' of the US.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Zedillo promises fresh drive for peace: Foreign-trained
economists extend grip in Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE and DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the new president of Mexico, yesterday promised to open
new negotiations with armed rebels in the troubled southern state of Chiapas
and pledged the armed forces would maintain their unilateral ceasefire in
the conflict.
'There will be no violence from the government and I trust there will be
none from those who have dissented,' said Mr Zedillo in his inauguration
speech after he received the traditional red, white and green presidential
sash and a big bear hug from outgoing president Carlos Salinas.
Mr Zedillo also announced he would introduce constitutional amendments 'as
the first step to deeply reforming' Mexico's 'very deficient' judicial
system. The president dedicated much of his 45-minute speech to attacking
corruption and impunity from prosecution. He promised to lead a government
whose guiding principle would be 'the rule of law.'
One of the government's first judicial commitments would be to 'fully
clarify' the assassinations this year of the ruling party's first
presidential candidate Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio and party secretary general
Mr Francisco Ruiz Massieu.
While economic growth and income redistribution would be a priority, Mr
Zedillo stressed he would maintain 'strict discipline on prices,' arguing
that growth with inflation would 'destroy' the successful structural changes
undertaken under Mr Salinas.
Nevertheless, Mr Salinas was indirectly criticised, as Mr Zedillo painted a
stark picture of the political, economic and social problems he was
inheriting. On political reform, Mr Zedillo said he would work to make the
1997 mid-term elections unquestionable by working for a 'definitive'
political reform, including party financing and spending, media access and
autonomy of the electoral authorities.
Mr Zedillo's cabinet, announced on Wednesday, shows foreign-trained
economists who rose to prominence under Mr Salinas extending their grip.
Overall 13 of the 19 principal cabinet ministers have post-graduate degrees
from foreign universities. Many, including Mr Guillermo Ortiz at
communications and transport and the president's chief of staff Mr Luis
Tellez, have economics PhDs from leading US universities. So do two
prominent non-cabinet members, Mr Carlos Ruiz and Mr Rogelio Gasca, new
heads of Petroleos Mexicanos and the Federal Electricity Commission
respectively. The proliferation of technocrats, committed to free market
economic reforms, has led to criticism that the cabinet lacks political
experience, and is too narrow in its background. Some observers predicted
that old-guard politicians left out of the government by Mr Zedillo, who
himself has an economics PhD from Yale University, may cause trouble down
the road.
The decision to break with tradition and select Mr Antonio Lozano, a member
of the opposition, as Attorney-General, and to appoint two ministers
(environment and health) with no party affiliation, was well received
yesterday. However, the incorporation of Mr Ignacio Pichardo, the former
president of the ruling party, who is alleged to have blocked the
investigation into the assassination of Mr Ruiz Massieu was sharply
criticised by the opposition.
Another official allegedly involved in blocking the investigation, Ms Maria
de los Angeles Moreno, was expected to be named president of the PRI
tomorrow. Both officials vigorously deny the charges.
Mr Ortiz, the former deputy finance minister, is likely to loosen further
rules limiting private investment in public infrastructure in his new post.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The growth of smuggling by organised crime has led the International Road
Transport Union (IRU), which groups road haulier associations in Europe and
elsewhere, to suspend the issue of TIR 'carnets' for cross-border
consignments of tobacco and alcohol from yesterday. The IRU said insurers
were now refusing to cover the cost of tax and duty payments for goods which
'disappear' en route. Under the TIR scheme, which covers about 50 countries
worldwide, trucks are sealed and the TIR carnet allows them to pass with the
minimum of red tape to their destination. The suspension of TIR carnets
means drivers transporting alcohol and tobacco will have to complete
formalities at every frontier they cross, leading to considerable delays and
extra cost.

A Japanese parliamentary committee yesterday approved a package of trade and
farm bills linked to the Uruguay Round global trade accord. The package,
which includes legislation concerning the World Trade Organisation and a new
law governing distribution and retailing of rice, is likely to pass the
lower house today. Although the ordinary parliamentary session ends on
Sunday, the government is seeking an extension of about five days in order
for the package to be approved by the upper house.
Politicians representing the farm lobby had threatened to oppose the package
unless substantial compensation was made to the agricultural sector. Under
the Uruguay Round agreement, Japan will open its rice market, importing 4 to
8 per cent of domestic rice consumption over the next six years. Heavy
lobbying by politicians, backed by the rural vote, forced the government to
agree to fund a rural support package with a supplementary budget separate
to the annual agricultural budget.

FT  02 DEC 94 / World Trade News: China venture will expand VW operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Volkswagen group of Germany, the leading European carmaker, is expanding
its operations in China with the development of its joint venture with First
Automobile Works.
Audi, the group's executive car division, is to take a direct stake in
FAW-Volkswagen Automotive Company, the joint venture currently owned 60 per
cent by FAW and 40 per cent by VW. A modernised version of the Audi 100 will
enter production at the joint venture plant in Changchun, north-east China,
in 1996 with an eventual capacity for 30,000 cars a year, the company said.
The Audi stake was aimed at ensuring the long-term future for the brand in
the Chinese market.
VW said it would also begin making V6 engines at Changchun in 1996 with the
aim of reaching a production capacity of 100,000 a year by 2001.
The production capacity for Audi cars at the joint venture would be raised
to 60,000 a year from 1999, when the company plans to introduce the
successor to its current Audi A6, which has recently replaced the Audi 100
in Europe.
The Audi 100 has been produced under licence by First Automobile Works since
1988, and is the car widely used by middle-ranking officials in China.
This car will continue to be made by FAW itself, after the modernised
version goes into production at the FAW/Volkswagen joint venture plant, and
will be sold under the name 'Yellow Flag'. FAW previously made the 'Red
Flag' limousine used by top Chinese officials.
Local content for the FAW-produced Audi 100 has already been built up to
around 60 per cent. Audi will continue to supply kit parts from Germany for
assembly by FAW.
The Volkswagen group, already the leading western carmaker in China, is
engaged in an ambitious expansion in what promises to be one of the world's
fastest growing car markets during the next two decades.
In an effort to stay ahead of rivals, it is planning to install a production
capacity in China which would rival in volume the scale of operations built
by individual Japanese carmakers in North America during the last decade.
It plans to have a capacity to build 660,000 cars a year as well as engines
and gearboxes by 2000. The FAW/VW joint venture in Changchun will have a
capacity for 360,000 cars and 500,000 engines a year, including 60,000 Audi
cars and 100,000 V6 engines.
The group's second joint venture, Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive, in which
VW holds a 50 per cent stake and which currently builds the previous
generation VW Santana, is planned to have a capacity for 300,000 cars and
330,000 engines a year. VW has added this year to its existing range (the
Santana, Jetta and Audi 100) by starting assembly by FAW, at its plant at
Chunde, of the Seat Cordoba small car from kits supplied by Seat, the
group's Spanish subsidiary. The car is being sold in China as the VW City
Golf, and VW plans to assemble around 10,000 in 1995.
In the decade since it began its first low volume assembly in Shanghai, VW
will have produced more than 500,000 cars in China by the end of 1994
including 453,000 cars built by the two joint venture companies and 71,000
Audis built under licence by FAW. It is seeking to increase co-operation
between the two joint ventures, in particular in engine production, with the
exchange of key components between the two plants. Camshafts and crankshafts
are to be made by Shanghai Volkswagen, while the Changchun plant will
produce connecting rods and crank cases.
VW claims that around 100 components licensing and know-how agreements and
40 joint ventures have been established in China, since it began local
production, and that another 30 joint ventures are now under negotiation.

FT  02 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Europe and Japan win Dollars 1.2bn steel
deal from Norway

<TEXT>
Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, yesterday announced that it had
placed steel orders worth NKr8bn (Dollars 1.2bn) with producers in Europe
and Japan to be used in natural gas pipelines in the North Sea.
The steel will be used in five pipeline projects, one of which is under way.
These new pipelines will accommodate the country's rapidly expanding gas
exports - deliveries to Europe will rise to 60bn cubic metres by the turn of
the century from 28bn cubic metres in 1994. When the projects are completed
Norway's pipeline network will span more than 5,500km.
Statoil said the deal was one of the world's largest steel orders this
decade and the biggest ever from the Norwegian offshore sector. The order
comprises 1.5m tonnes of steel pipe to be supplied by producers in England,
Italy, France, Germany and Japan between 1996 and 2000. European steel
producers have won about NKr5bn worth of orders and Japanese producers an
estimated NKr3bn worth.
Mr John Ove Lindoe, a Statoil executive, said as few as seven steel
producers in the world could meet the required specifications for the
quality, 40-inch diameter pipe.
The first consignment is for the Zeepipe II-B pipeline project comprising
210,000 tonnes of steel pipe worth NKr1bn for which the contracts have been
placed with Mitsui/Sumitomo in Japan and Mannesmann Handel of Germany. The
pipes will be produced by Nippon Steel, Sumitomo Metal and the Europipe
group, made up of Usinor Sacilor of France and Mannesmann.
Several other gas transport projects are planned, including a new line to
Germany, another to Belgium or France and a possible link between the Halten
Bank off the coast of Norway and the North Sea.
Saga Petroleum said it has withdrawn from a multi-billion dollar project to
build a new oil pipeline and terminal in the Russian Arctic, but Norsk Hydro
said it had no plans to pull out.
Saga has withdrawn from the so-called Northern Gates project until the
Russian government offers stable conditions and sufficient legal protection
to foreign investors.
Royal/Dutch Shell group also announced its withdrawal from the project.

of the most prominent figures in Australia's mining industry, and Mr Thomas
Meiklejohn, a former Normandy employee, were yesterday dismissed in the
Melbourne courts.
The charges, brought by the ASC a year ago, centred on allegations that Mr

respectively of Brunswick, a small mining company, that took over Bendigo
Gold, had failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that a statement to
shareholders did not contain misleading information. At the heart of the

The Philippines' gross national product rose by 5.9 per cent in the third
quarter of the year on sharply higher farm output and accelerated growth in
industrial activity, the government announced yesterday. The growth rate was
the highest since the third quarter of 1990 and brought growth in the first
three quarters to 5.5 per cent, compared to 2.2 per cent in the period last
year, said the National Economic and Development Authority. Gross domestic
product, which excludes capital inflows and remittances from Filipinos
employed abroad, grew in the third quarter by 5.1 per cent, up from 2.7 per
cent a year ago. The improved performance bolstered government hopes for
full-year 1994 growth of up to 6 per cent, from last year's 2.3 per cent.

Israel completed the transfer of power in the West Bank to Palestinians
yesterday, handing over direct taxation and health following previous
transfers of education, tourism and welfare. Economists said transfer of
taxation, excluding customs duties, was vital to Palestinian public finances
and to achieving the targets of an agreement this week between international
aid donors and Palestinian officials to plug a Dollars 125m (Pounds 80m)
budget deficit until March 31.
Israel collected an estimated Dollars 90m in income and value added taxes
from the West Bank's 1.1m Palestinian population last yea,r although Israeli
officials estimated this represented only 20 per cent of taxes owed. Donors
have warned they expect the Palestinian self-rule authority to balance its
budget by the end of next March and say they will not fund recurrent
expenses beyond that date. Mr Atef Alawneh, Palestinian finance
director-general, urged Palestinians to end their practice of tax avoidance,
which had been seen as a legitimate resistance to Israeli occupation. 'Taxes
are the bride-price of independence and the key to democracy and
participation. . . Now delay in paying means a delay in building the
Palestinian state.'
Israel is assisting Palestinians with tax collection in the West Bank and
has trained several tax officials and translated tax records into Arabic.
The International Monetary Fund and World Bank are also providing technical
assistance. Both Israel and Palestinians say the transfer of West Bank power
has been considerably smoother that the transition earlier in the year in
the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile Norway yesterday signed a Dollars 22m grant to
upgrade electricity networks in Gaza and said it was immediately handing
over Dollars 2m.

It seemed the very model of a modern multinational. In 1984, releasing that
statement of safety principles, Union Carbide of the US was celebrating its
golden jubilee in India, where it produced pesticides and Eveready
batteries.
But 10 years ago tonight a tank ruptured, and with it the faith of hundreds
of millions of Indians in the superiority of western technology. From its
facility in the central city Bhopal, a cloud of poison gas enveloped
citizens asleep in the surrounding slums, killing thousands in the world's
worst industrial disaster.
A decade on, with the flow of foreign direct investment into the country
doubling year by year, that faith is being rebuilt. The mothballed Union
Carbide pesticide plant is meanwhile being dismantled. After years of
wrangling, progress is starting to be made in compensating the victims.
Special courts are hearing applications from those injured and who now
suffer lung, eye or nerve disorders or a form of cancer, and from families
who lost their breadwinner. Union Carbide's sequestered 51 per cent stake in
its local offshoot, which has continued to operate from its other Indian
sites, was last month sold to a local business house, and from the funds a
hospital is to be built in Bhopal.
But few are happy. Campaigning groups argue among themselves for the right
to represent the afflicted. Allegations abound of corruption among medical
and legal workers, who are said routinely to charge a percentage of any
award for processing the documents which claimants need. Research to monitor
patients with long-term ailments has been neither systematic nor
co-ordinated. In the absence of postmortem examination reports, the death
toll for the disaster remains in dispute, with estimates ranging from 1,800
in its earliest days to one unofficial total of 25,000.
Mr Alok Pratap Singh of the Poisonous Gas Episode Struggle Front, who was a
volunteer relief worker that night, says 7,000 coffins were supplied by
Bhopal businesses, with more bodies cremated in shrouds or cast into the
river. He says the effects of the leak of methyl isocyanate, an intermediate
product which erupted when it came into contact with water, were 'like
Hiroshima'.
'But that was war, not an economic interest. Here a multinational
corporation was involved. Now many multinationals are seeking a future in
India.' The private sector is too protected against actions in the Indian
courts, he maintains.
In 1989 Carbide paid Dollars 470m, (Pounds 287m) less than expected, to
settle all the civil suits it faced. Criminal proceedings remain in
abeyance. Mr Justice A G Qureshi, the high court judge who is overseeing the
600,000 compensation hearings which started three years later and are taking
place at more than 30 courts, says he proposes to finish in another three
years, although he adds: 'Nobody believes it.'
About 150 people a day form a huddle outside his windowless office to stake
their claim. Women in faded floral saris help grizzled old men down the
steps after police with rifles turn them away. Campaigners say the judge has
established a needlessly legalistic and adversarial procedure; inside, he
counters that 'it's a messy job' with many spurious applications. He has
already approved more than 110,000 awards totalling Rs3bn-plus (Pounds 60m).
Compensation ranges from Rs25,000 to Rs400,000 per case - large sums for
those who until now have been receiving just Rs200 a month in government
allowances.
The sale of the shareholding in Union Carbide India to McLeod Russel, part
of a Calcutta tea empire, will raise Rs2.9bn. Among a small number of other
potential buyers was thought to have been Ralston Purina, the US food-based
group which in 1986 took over Union Carbide's battery operations elsewhere
in the world.
What went wrong that night has never been established. The Connecticut-based
company still maintains that the cause was sabotage by a disgruntled
employee who put water in the tank unaware of what the full consequences
would be, but it stops short of naming him. Many Bhopal residents allege
that Carbide cut corners, storing an unstable compound rather than
converting it directly into a less toxic final product. Similar plants
elsewhere in the world have been adapted to minimise the risk of exposure to
water.
India has meanwhile enacted an environmental protection law, but concerns
remain that it is inadequately enforced. New sites, particularly investments
from abroad, receive close scrutiny, but older domestic plants release waste
daily into the Ganges.
Bhopal, capital of Madhya Pradesh state, is itself now a relatively
prosperous city by Indian standards, in part because of compensation
payments but also because the state government has for the past few years
striven to attract inward investment.
Mr Digvijay Singh, chief minister, says money can never fully recompense
lost lives but adds: 'Union Carbide is a multinational operating all over
the world. One shouldn't judge its performance because of one accident.'
That degree of magnanimity will go down well among potential investors as
well as at Union Carbide's Danbury headquarters, which will fly its flags at
half mast tomorrow.
Mr Robert Berzok, a Carbide director, says the tragedy 'served as a catalyst
for enormous change' at the company, which no longer makes agrichemicals.
The main lessons he offers for the chemicals industry worldwide: better
dialogue with local communities, and continued improvements to operational
procedures.
If nothing else, Bhopal showed that a safety manifesto, however nobly
phrased, is not enough.

FT  02 DEC 94 / UN chief urges world-wide mobilisation against Aids
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, yesterday called for
'world-wide mobilisation' against Aids at a Paris summit where France
invited other rich states to follow its lead in pledging more money to fight
the epidemic.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, UK health secretary, expressed her government's
support for 'this important event', and said the UK would give an extra
Pounds 2m over the next three years to international research into Aids and
the HIV virus. Total British HIV/Aids spending will reach Pounds 230m next
year.
The one-day summit ended with representatives of 42 rich and poor countries,
including 13 prime ministers, signing a 'Paris declaration' designed to give
higher political profile to an international fight against Aids that is
often left to specialists.
Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, said the four general goals of
the declaration were to 'highlight the degree to which the Aids epidemic
threatens all of humanity'; to 'stress the responsibility of states to every
man and woman affected by Aids'; to 'commit our states to do everything to
treat the sick and guarantee their fundamental rights', and 'undertake to
help developing countries improve their campaign against Aids'.
Mr Balladur said France, which co-hosted the summit with the UN's World
Health Organisation, would contribute an extra FFr132m (Pounds 15.7m) to
carry out the declaration's recommendations, such as improved safety of
blood transfusions.
Some speakers from non-governmental organisations said yesterday's meeting
was only 'a tiny step forward', and it was time for politicians 'to start
moving from intentions to concrete action'. One, MRAP, called for France to
stop expelling HIV-positive people to third world countries, saying such
expulsions amounted 'to a death sentence'.
Demonstrations by Aids campaigning organisations were held near by. The
Eiffel Tower was lit up with red lights, representing the red ribbon symbol
of World Aids Day.

<TEXT>
China said a record inflow of foreign capital had fuelled inflation and
admitted to poorly managing the influx. 'This year we did not sufficiently
prepare for managing this huge inflow of foreign capital,' Mr Xie Ping,
deputy director of the policy and research department of the People's Bank
of China, wrote in an analysis in the Financial News.
China's net inflow of capital amounted to Dollars 23bn in the first 10
months of 1994, with foreign investment comprising Dollars 22.7bn, Mr Xie
said.
Chinese leaders repeatedly cite foreign investment figures as proof of the
success of their socialist market reforms, and boast of their aim to
overtake the US as the world's top destination for inward investment. China
says it now ranks second only to the US as a target for such investment.
Much of the foreign money flowed into real estate and capital construction,
whose 40.4 per cent annual growth in the first 10 months was a main cause of
inflation, Mr Xie said.

FT  02 DEC 94 / South Korea cashes in on overseas investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korean financial institutions cashed in yesterday as overseas
investors responded to the raising of foreign shareholding ceilings by
buying their highest one-day total of shares in the country's leading
blue-chip companies.
Foreign investors purchased 19.4m shares, far higher than their daily
average of 140,000, or the 270,000 shares purchased on the first day the
market opened on January 13, 1992. However, the Seoul general index fell 8.2
points to 1066.21 as Korean institutional investors unloaded large numbers
of stocks acquired in anticipation of the increase in the foreign investment
limit to 12 from 10 per cent.
Western securities houses in Seoul have claimed the government's
announcement in early October that the foreign shareholding ceiling would be
raised on December 1 had given some domestic investors plenty of time to
raise share prices, some by up to 30 per cent.
The move provided an opportunity for Korea's troubled financial institutions
to reap large capital gains. Banks have been relying on income from
securities to increase profits threatened by growing provisions for
non-performing loans.
Investment trust companies are also relying on big gains on the bourse to
pay back government loans. Analysts in Seoul have been debating for weeks
whether foreign investors would accept the higher prices for blue-chip
shares or wait until the market stabilised.
The answer came within minutes of yesterday's opening as the expanded
foreign shareholding quota for some of the nation's most favoured stocks
were quickly filled. Among stocks favoured were the bourse's star performer
Korea Mobile Telecom, the electronics companies Samsung and Goldstar,
Hyundai Motor, Hyundai Engineering and Construction, and Daewoo Securities.
By the end of the day, the foreign ceiling for 58 of the most attractive
issues had been reached.
'If foreign investors have been smart, they would have waited. But it was a
question of too much foreign capital chasing too few stocks. Investors
decided it would be better to be in them rather than be shut out and pay
premiums later' on the unofficial over-the-counter market, a senior official
at a British securities house said.
South Korea is considered one of the most attractive markets in Asia because
of its generally moderate price-to-earnings ratios and a booming economy,
which is expected to grow by at least 8 per cent this year.
Foreign investors have been preparing for the latest opening during the past
few weeks by restructuring their portfolios, including selling less
attractive shares.
Analysts now expect a decline in the stock market as foreign investors bide
their time in purchasing other stocks. Korean investors will have another
chance to take advantage of overseas interest next year when the foreign
shareholding limit is raised to 15 per cent.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Vietnam boat people back under spotlight: Repatriation issue
could raise tensions between UK and China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concern is growing in Hong Kong and London that time is running short for
Britain to fulfil its commitment to repatriate Vietnamese boat people from
the colony by the end of next year.
The pace of voluntary repatriation has slowed to a trickle and the so-called
'orderly repatriation' (forced repatriation by another name) has only
recently been restarted after suspension from March until September. This
year the government will be lucky if 6,000 Vietnamese return to Vietnam,
half as many as returned in each of 1993 and 1992.
As the rate of repatriation is stepped up, the issue again risks becoming
the focus of international controversy, possibly of fresh tensions between
the UK and China.
This week, Ta Kung Pao, a Beijing-controlled daily, warned Britain it should
stand by its undertaking to see all Vietnamese in Hong Kong returned to
Vietnam by the end of 1995. 'If not, the British government should be
responsible for this,' the paper said. In a sentence few Vietnamese would
recognise, Ta Kung Pao added: 'Hong Kong has become a paradise for the
Vietnamese people.'
The Vietnamese have few friends in Hong Kong, outside a band of civil rights
activists. Caught between the apparent indifference of Britain and the
hostility of China, they face an uncertain future.
Yet they command the attention of both London and Beijing. Violence, or the
threat of violent protest, is never far from the surface in the camps.
A worry of the Hong Kong authorities is that a putative 'hard core' of
Vietnamese may do something dramatic, such as group suicide, to protest
against the hopelessness of their situation.
In the spring of this year, the plight of the refugees grabbed international
attention when 1,500 inmates at the Whitehead prison camp rioted in
opposition to the government's policy of forced repatriation. The riot was
put down with force, resulting in 270 casualties; one young mother of two
may be crippled for life.
More recently, Hong Kong's passions have been inflamed by the release of 125
Vietnamese after the government found they could no longer be lawfully
detained.
Hong Kong is unsympathetic to the plight of the Vietnamese, even though it
has been a refugee colony for most of its 150-year history.
In response to the release of the 125, the local press has been full of
articles warning of potential law-and-order problems if Vietnamese are let
into society; some civic leaders have pointed to the depressive effect on
wage levels an influx of cheap labour might have.
Since June 1988, the basis for detaining almost all Vietnamese in Hong Kong
is that they are illegal immigrants awaiting return to Vietnam.
In the case of 125 who volunteered to return, Hanoi rejected the Hong Kong
government's contention that they were Vietnamese nationals. Unable to
return them to Vietnam, the government had little option but to release them
into an open camp.
There are nearly 26,000 Vietnamese people housed in eight 'refugee' and
'detention' centres in Hong Kong. The government classifies only 1,699 of
these as refugees: people with a well founded fear of persecution and
therefore deserving of settlement in third countries. These lucky few are
preparing for a life in the West.
The rest, numbering some 23,700 and having endured a questionable screening
process, are classified as illegal immigrants and detained in closed prison
camps pending their return to Vietnam.
The problem for Hong Kong, Britain and China is that there may not be enough
time left for these people to be humanely persuaded that their future
prospects are brighter in Vietnam than they are in post-1997 Hong Kong.
Mr Brian Bresnihan, Hong Kong's refugee co-ordinator, says the outlook may
not be as gloomy as it appears. The reintroduction of 'orderly' repatriation
should have the effect of stimulating large numbers of other Vietnamese to
return voluntarily, he adds.
The scheme had a powerful effect on voluntary repatriation in the past; he
sees no reason why it will not in the future. 'In 1991, orderly repatriation
was introduced, not to effect the repatriation of migrants back to Vietnam
but to show our intention to repatriate in a mandatory way those who did not
return voluntarily,' he said.
Fighting Mr Bresnihan is Ms Pam Baker, a former government solicitor who
resigned in 1992 so she could spend time defending the Vietnamese. This
week, Ms Baker, who also heads Refugee Concern, a pressure group, has called
on the government to release up to 700 refugees whom she claims will be not
allowed back to Vietnam and so are being detained illegally. She has
threatened to issue writs of habeas corpus.
The Hong Kong government will vigorously contest any action Ms Baker brings
in the colony's courts. Mr Bresnihan denies the government will have to
release any more Vietnamese: 'We firmly believe no one in our camps is
illegally detained,' he says.
Meanwhile, the inmates of the camps are restive and the clock is ticking.

FT  02 DEC 94 / US Taipei trip may irk China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Federico Pena, US secretary of transportation, will visit Taipei early
next week to address a bilateral forum and meet top Taiwan officials in a
move which risks incurring the wrath of Beijing.
Mr Pena's trip will be the highest-level visit to the island by a US
official since a 1992 trip by Ms Carla Hills, who was then the US trade
representative. He was invited to attend an annual meeting of the US-Taiwan
Economic Council, a private, non-profit organisation of US and Taiwan
business interests. Former US president George Bush will also attend.
The nominally private American Institute in Taiwan, which acts as the de
facto US Embassy, said the visit reflected the growing importance of
Washington's commercial relationship with Taiwan, the US's sixth largest
trading partner.
There are also expectations that the newly elected Republican Congress in
the US will be more sympathetic to Taiwan, which on Saturday will hold the
most important elections since democratisation began in the mid-1980s.
Mr Pena is likely to promote bids by US companies for big infrastructure
projects under Taiwan's national development plan. These include a nuclear
power plant, a high-speed railway, freeways and urban mass transit systems.
His visit closely follows a stern warning from China to President Bill
Clinton against treating Taiwan as a separate government. Mr Jiang Zemin,
China's president, delivered the warning during the Asia Pacific Economic
Co-operation forum earlier this month in Bogor, Indonesia.
The US severed diplomatic ties with Taipei in 1979 in favour of Beijing,
which regards Taiwan as a renegade province and tries to suppress the
Kuomintang-led government's efforts to scramble on to the world stage. Just
29 mostly small states maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taipei and
visits by cabinet officials from industrialised countries are rare.
High-level bilateral exchanges were formally banned in deference to Beijing
until the Clinton administration subtly upgraded relations in September, the
first changes in US policy toward the island in 15 years.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Japanese banks go for lotteries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's financial institutions are in the grip of lottery fever. Yesterday
two more banks announced the launch of deposits that give savers a chance to
win cash prizes. The new accounts seem certain to intensify the competition
among banks in an unfamiliar liberated environment, despite the explicit
fury of their self-regulatory associations and the implicit disquiet of the
Finance Ministry.
Kono Shinkin Bank, a regional credit bank, said it would introduce a lottery
account next week. Anyone opening a time deposit of at least Y100,000
(Pounds 650) will be entered into the annual raffle for prizes up to
Y50,000.
Depositors at Sabae Shinkin Bank will receive a ticket to a local authority
lottery with even bigger potential returns.
The moves follow the launch last month of the first lottery account by
Johnan Shinkin Bank, the country's largest credit bank.
The National Association of Shinkin (credit) Banks, the self-regulatory
body, condemned the account for breaching voluntary rules on the type of
cash bonuses its members would offer their customers. The Finance Ministry
raised a regulatory eyebrow and announced an investigation into the new
account, but stopped short of outlawing it.
Johnan Shinkin accused the other banks and their association of operating a
cartel, and of failing to pass on benefits of last month's interest rate
liberalisation to customers.
On Wednesday, Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, stepped into
the row, saying it was important for each bank to work out original ideas on
interest rates and give-aways to meet customers' needs in a deregulated
financial environment.
But the regulators have also acknowledged the unease felt by some in
financial circles about the propriety of banks' offering straight gambling
products as part of their normal banking business.
However, the concern now for the authorities is that the accounts have
proved extremely popular. It is probably the desire not to incur the wrath
of a disgruntled public that has stayed the hand of the Finance Ministry so
far. That decision not to rule against the account now seems to have been
taken as a signal by other banks that they have the go-ahead to follow
Johnan's course, and yesterday's imitations by Kono and Sabae are expected
to be followed by many more.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Russian returns with few gifts: Kuriles row blocks
large-scale aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Oleg Soskovets, the Russian first deputy prime minister, set off back to
Moscow from a five-day visit to Japan yesterday bearing gifts.
The Japanese government considers it discourteous to let official visitors
depart without a hand-out, even if they rarely obtain everything they want.
At the same time, Mr Soskovets' ears will be ringing with his host's
politely couched refusal to be more generous.
Mr Soskovets, the most senior Russian to stage an official visit to Tokyo
for just over a year, returns with a mixed bag of useful trade and economic
accords, marking slight progress in the two sides' efforts to set their
strained relations on a more normal footing.
Yet the Japanese government continued to hold back large-scale bilateral
aid, pending resolution of the big outstanding dispute between them:
ownership of four islands in the Russian-controlled Kurile group just off
northern Japan, seized by Russian troops at the end of the second world war.
Foreign Minister Yohei Kono turned down out of hand the Russian request for
aid for the Kuriles. It would have been politically unwise for him to do
otherwise, given the passions the islands arouse both in government and
opposition.
Russia was equally firm on a Kuriles-related row over the right of Japanese
vessels to fish the surrounding waters. Over the past year, 18 Japanese
boats have been seized there by Russian patrols, in clashes in which four
fishermen have been wounded. Mr Soskovets said he would do his best to avoid
a repeat of such events, but warned Japanese fishermen to be careful.
At the previous official Russian visit, by president Boris Yeltsin in
October last year, Tokyo was prepared to relax, but not lift, aid
restrictions in exchange for talks about the islands. Mr Soskovets said he
was ready to talk about the Kuriles, as was Mr Yeltsin, but offered nothing
new.
The Japanese package he obtained in return reflects this - a small advance
but nothing spectacular. It includes restructuring Dollars 280m (Pounds
180m) of debt to Japanese trading companies and state-controlled Export
Import Bank; a small part of Japan's Dollars 5bn private and state credit to
Russia.
The delegations agreed to keep talking about another Dollars 1.1bn owed by
Russia to Japanese exporters. They will also restart blocked negotiations on
a Russian request for official Japanese export credit guarantees for
Japanese suppliers of equipment to Lukoil, Russia's largest oil group.
Lukoil already has a Japanese aid package to buy equipment for a field in
west Siberia, but the Japanese suppliers want to be sure of being paid.
On top of this comes a series of political accords, for Japan to support
Russian membership of the World Trade Organisation, and for establishment of
a joint committee to talk about bilateral problems.

FT  02 DEC 94 / 'Cracks are appearing in the alliance's cohesion'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF Germany's most senior diplomats, Baron Hermann von Richthofen,
ambassador to Nato and a former ambassador in London, sent a sharp message
to his government last week warning that the political ties that bind the
allies in Nato were breaking. The message was sent after the US decided to
stop policing the UN arms embargo on the warring parties in Bosnia, but
before criticism of the French and British role in Bosnia by Mr Robert Dole,
incoming majority leader of the US Senate. Extracts from the ambassador's
message, printed here in full, first appeared yesterday in the Suddeutsche
Zeitung newspaper, and reflect particular concern in Europe about perceived
new policy priorities in the US
Cracks are appearing in the cohesion of the alliance. The most recent
example concerns the last few days' irritation - scarcely possible to play
down even to the outside world - over the unilateral US decision to modify
its participation in the joint Nato-WEU operation 'Sharp Guard'.
Relations between UN allies and Nato in the Bosnia and Hercegovina conflict,
already complicated and tense, have become definitely problematic as a
result of national decisions of the US in its capacity as the leading power
in both organisations.
The real strain for (Nato) cohesion must be expected in the event of
unilateral US support for the Bosnian military or a lifting of the arms
embargo, either through US action to force a decision in the UN Security
Council, or through unilateral action.
Such measures would lead to escalation of the conflict and raise the
question in a concrete fashion of the protection or withdrawal of the UN
peacekeeping troops deployed by alliance countries. This would demand from
the alliance an engagement of a completely new form, to which precisely the
US up to now has been unable to commit itself.
During the last decades the cohesion of the transatlantic alliance has been
imperative and undisputed. It also held its ground during the political
changes of the last years. Today, individual alliance partners or groups
have greater freedom to push through their interests, and Nato is
instrumentalised for this purpose. (Here we should not forget that the issue
which keeps the US and its European alliance partners apart, namely the
Bosnia conflict, also binds them in another context, above all through the
contact group). As a result we see a blurring of the partners' stance that
was previously held and determined jointly. A joint effort from all partners
is needed to tackle this task, for no partner can be interested in weakening
the alliance.
Individual problems:
1. It has proved impossible to sweep away, even for outside observers, the
irritation in the last week over the unilateral US decision concerning the
Nato-WEU Mediterranean operation Sharp Guard. Internally, the US action has
left clear traces which have been particularly durable in the case of
France, but have also caused mistrust and concern among other partners.
France is accusing the US of de facto non-enforcement of surveillance of the
arms embargo, and is demanding a comprehensive evaluation of all embargo
infringements at sea, on land and in the air, in the apparent expectation
that this will show the unreliability of the US. The speedily held foreign
ministers meeting of France, Britain, and Russia - in other words without
the contact group partners US and Germany - may be seen as direct reaction
to the recent US action.
Moreover, the US government has been apparently consulting in the meantime
with Congress over massive support for Bosnian government troops and a
unilateral lifting of the arms embargo. It is above all the possible lifting
of the arms embargo, which would have far-reaching political and military
consequences, that would bring the cohesion of the alliance to its limits.
The US, as a country without ground troops in Bosnia, stands along with
Turkey for more robust action by the alliance (ie air strikes against the
Serbian side), in spite of the doubts this would raise for withdrawal of
Unprofor. Those countries that supply ground troops go along with this idea
on paper, but naturally stress the priority of safeguarding their
peacekeepers on the ground. They also underline in this regard the
principles of dual decision-making and the need to keep action appropriate
to objectives - whereby they stress the importance of keeping political
control in the hands of the United Nations.
This dilemma of the alliance would break out into the open should, as a
result of a lifting of the embargo, a worsening of the situation force
peacekeepers to be withdrawn and fighting troops to be sent from Nato
members for their protection.
2. In addition to this, unilateral changes in US policies towards the
ex-Soviet Union and eastern Europe since the Nato summit in January directly
affect the alliance. There was an abandonment at short notice, without any
consultation, of the 'Russia First' concept. The same happened to the
question of treating the expansion of Nato as a process and as part and
parcel of development of European security.
This need not per se be regretted. However, if the US on the one hand
promotes a robust continuation of Partnership for Peace, but if on the other
hand the concept is described by parts of the administration as 'inadequate'
and 'oversold' after a few months, then this part of alliance policy ends up
being discredited. The programme is in danger of being obsolete already,
especially for the countries it is meant to help. Now the US is applying
political pressure for more speed in the expansion question, without paying
attention to how this affects internal alliance positions on eastern
policies as well as the military and financial consequences.
The US administration sees itself under pressure as a result of the
(mid-term) elections. It appears almost as if it is looking at presenting a
new Nato in the US as an alternative to not being able to hold Nato at all.
Pressure for rapid Russian expansion appears to be in tune with the
anti-Russian line of the Republican right; it is doubtful whether this is
compatible with (US) attitudes that are increasingly inward-orientated and
isolationist. The US appears to want to force its way past hesitant alliance
partners ('My way or no way'.)
It is not clear to what extent US pressure is being motivated by a let-up in
defence efforts of Nato member countries and expectations of a build-up of
Nato potential through new members. Equally, it cannot be ascertained
whether 'hurdles' are being erected by means of criteria for (new members')
acceptance into Nato. Latest US security policy consultations in some
central and east European states are likely to have included the question of
Nato expansion. This leaves us to conclude that a backdoor method is being
used to present the alliance with a fait accompli in the form of
predetermined agreements, non-compliance with which is bound to cause
political damage.
If such consultations were to be carried out before each Nato-level
agreement, then the partners in the alliance would no longer be free in
their decisions. Should this method however be chosen, it should encompass
in a transparent manner all the Partnership for Peace members of the North
Atlantic Co-operation Council, and not imply selective decisions concerning
future accession candidates. This is another manner in which the cohesion of
the alliance is being put under strain - even if it is possible to find a
more or less procedural passage in the foreign ministers' communique of
December 1 that all 16 states can accept. The expansion question is of such
fundamental importance that we must avoid a rapid US success (in this
matter) turning into a Pyrrhic victory for the alliance.
3. France, which in the last few years has moved pragmatically toward the US
within the alliance, is bound to be disappointed by these unilateral
American decisions. The threshold of tolerance may be in sight and
fundamental rethinking cannot be excluded.
France mistrusts US policy on Bosnia. Foreign minister Juppe alleges that
the US 'favours a logic of war'. A demand is possible for a change in
leadership of the operation Sharp Guard, ie through the WEU. Thoughts about
restructuring the alliance - a division between traditonal tasks and new
tasks - are also well known.
4. Other member states are also contributing to these divisions and to a
weakening of alliance cohesion. Canada has left Europe militarily; also, it
has only one political goal with one interest, however understandable: the
security and well-being of its peacekeepers in Bosnia. Canada intends not
only drastically to reduce its financial contribution to the infrastructure
budget of the alliance, but also its Nato participation.
The Bosnia conflict has also made the divergence between Greece and Turkey
more evident. Turkey demands an entirely new Nato commitment to protect the
Moslem population, Greece warns against the use of Turkish peacekeeping
troops in the conflict. It distanced itself also from the alliance air
strike decision. Greece considers the Christian Serbs not to be the main
cause of the conflict.
In the light of the alliance's active eastern policies of the last few
years, and the northern expansion (Finland and Sweden) of the EU-WEU, the
Mediterranean countries, especially Spain and Italy, are calling for a
counter-balance - a kind of 'southern outreach' of the alliance in the
Mediterranean. This underlines how different security interests are being
increasingly regionalised. As understandable as this is, in the medium term
it will demand more resources, which are hardly likely to be available. As a
result, Spain and Italy, as well as Greece and Turkey, will face new
frustrations.
5. There are other examples of disunity ... as well as current problems, in
particular in the financial area concerning a joint defence effort after the
end of the east-west conflict.
6. It is a matter of weighty consequence that the 16 countries lack
convincing concepts and perspectives. In the past, the alliance has overcome
divisions and crises - like after the Nato double-track decision in December
79 - as a result of the clear threat from the Soviet Union and the Warsaw
Pact. This external pressure in the direction of cohesion and solidarity
does not exist today, at least not outside the contact group for Bosnia.
Since solidarity no longer is imposed from the outside, it must be
accomplished through vision and conviction, through common ideas and
concepts. This difficult task must be taken on quickly before the cracks in
the alliance get larger and possibly more difficult to repair. The general
secretary's talks with Congress during the last days in Washington were
particularly important.

<TEXT>
Western and Russian officials often use a catchphrase to describe the
relations they would like to see between Moscow and the Atlantic alliance:
no vetoes, no surprises.
In other words, neither side will claim the right to dictate how the other
should behave, but each will avoid giving the other unpleasant shocks.
Last night, both Russian and Nato officials were accusing one another of
committing precisely that sin.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, came to Brussels for a
set-piece event intended to symbolise a new co-operative relationship
between Moscow and the western alliance which was founded as a counterweight
to the Soviet bloc.
The launch of a military co-operation programme was also envisaged by the
west as part of a 'charm offensive' supposedly to blunt Moscow's
determination to frustrate Nato enlargement.
Both Mr Kozyrev's visit and other aspects of the western blandishments to
Russia had been carefully prepared. But the expectations of a happy and
essentially ceremonial encounter were dashed.
The soft-spoken minister arrived from Paris - where he made a bold proposal
for closer relations between Moscow and the European Union's defence
institutions - in a mood of apparent bonhomie. He recalled jocularly that
Brussels was his birthplace and that Mr Willy Claes, Nato's new
secretary-general, was an old acquaintance.
He then brandished before the television cameras a weighty document, which
Russian and Nato officials had been quietly drafting for months, and which
was intended to map out future links between Moscow and the alliance.
The document details Russia's activities within the Partnership for Peace, a
military co-operation programme which Nato has offered to all its former
enemies. It also spells out a broader Russia-Nato relationship which Moscow
has successfully demanded.
Only after ministers went into closed session did word leak out that Mr
Kozyrev was holding back from depositing his copy of the document at Nato -
and hence refusing to launch the programme.
The reason he gave for this piece of high drama was that Russia objected to
the document agreed a few hours earlier by Nato foreign ministers, which
spells out an accelerated programme for integrating ex-communist countries
into the alliance.
'At first reading this document raises more questions than answers,' Mr
Kozyrev said of the Nato text, adding that he had discussed it with
President Boris Yeltsin. He still hoped the Russia-Nato programme would go
ahead, but the alliance would have to provide some clarifications.
Nato officials said the western reaction was one of 'shock and
disappointment', adding
that they had been at pains to keep Russia informed over the past few weeks
on their ideas for an accelerated enlargement programme.
The Russian gesture confirms what western governments have earnestly wanted
not to believe: Moscow still objects strongly to incorporation of Poland,
Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia into the western defence system, as
long as it is excluded.
Nato has for the past year been engaged in a bizarre sort of mating dance
with its former central European adversaries which desperately yearn for
protection from Russia which is unhappy about seeing its former satellites
engulfed by the western security system.
Hours before Mr Kozyrev's arrival yesterday, western officials were
congratulating themselves on having 'squared' Russian concerns. But it is
now clear that Russia will spring plenty more surprises as it tries to
exercise an effective veto on over-hasty Nato expansion.

FT  02 DEC 94 / The men who invest in Soviet dinosaurs: A look at the
buccaneers of Ukraine's richly endowed Donbass region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Hughes, a Welsh blacksmith, opened the first big steel plant in
Donetsk, then called Yuzovka, in 1872. More than a century later, amid
rusting Soviet industrial giants, the entrepreneurial spirit is alive again
in the heart of Ukraine's Donbass region.
White Mercedes Benz cars, covered in a thin film of black dust from 50 coal
mines, career down grey, muddy streets. Smartly dressed young men stand out
among the pensioners.
The explanation for this sharp contrast is that, although it was hard hit by
the Soviet Union's collapse, there are many ways to make money in the
Donbass.
It is estimated that a quarter of Ukraine's economic potential lies with the
Donbass's steel mills, coal pits, farms, sea ports, factories and coal,
manganese and iron ore deposits - all that prompted Dmitry Medeleyev, the
Russian scientist famous for the periodic table, to marvel at its
'inexhaustible richness'.
'It's a rough diamond, uncut, unpolished,' says Mr Fredric Kerulis, a US
mining engineer who has worked with western investors in Donetsk for two
years. He notes that both small traders and large companies, such as General
Electric, are keenly interested.
Yet the local business elite is the driving force behind economic and
political change in eastern Ukraine.
The summer elections brought into the governor's seat Donetsk's retail shop
magnate, Mr Volodymyr Sherban, a 41-year-old with no Communist party
background whose electoral success was matched by other young progressives
gaining the mayor's office in Mariupol, the Donbass's leading port, and in
neighbouring Lugansk.
Mr Sherban's goal is to bring in private capital, rebuild industry and
commerce, and develop metal, raw material and coal exchanges. Last week he
hosted Israeli juice producers who, with emigre ties to the area, want to
set up a joint venture in the region. 'I'm temporarily governor,' Mr Sherban
says, 'but forever in business.'
'We support whatever works,' says Mr Oleg Rybak, the mayor, citing special
land auctions for filling stations, hotels and shops contracts open to
foreign companies.
The plans are in infancy. The World Bank and the UK consultancy Bain &amp;
Company also worry that privatisation is stalled, although progress is
visible on small-scale enterprises.
The climate, at least, has changed. African and European traders invariably
follow steel, but direct investment by former Soviet, Middle East, east
European and west European partners is picking up after a drop off during
last winter's economic chaos in Ukraine.
The popular Mr Rybak, an unassuming former apparatchik who does not belong
to any party, keeps an open door. At his sparse office last week guests
included the city's favourite son, Mr Sergei Bubka, the pole vaulter and now
local entrepreneur.
'I divide my time between Monte Carlo, Berlin and Donetsk,' says Mr Bubka,
who has opened a sports club, several shops and a slot machine business in
his home town. Once dutifully criticising capitalism in US television
interviews, Mr Bubka says: 'We survive in a different way now: everyone buys
and sells everything.'
Mr Aleksander Mahmudov typifies this diversity. A stocky middle-aged
engineer, he was mayor before starting, with two partners and little
capital, a financial concern in 1991.
Dikon Invest, now publicly owned with 48 offices in Ukraine, Russia and
Bulgaria, works in securities, banking, insurance and pension funds. With a
sixth share issue coming up, Dikon in 1993 paid dividends of up to 30,000
per cent, albeit skewed by hyperinflation.
But rarely for Ukraine, where financial groups mostly shuffle hard currency
for short-term gain, the bulk of Dikon's business is with the large
enterprises prominent in the Donbass that are considered white elephants by
most experts.
'Our motto is: take advantage of the negatives,' Mr Mahmudov proclaims,
between answering his portable or satellite phones in an office cluttered
with western gadgets.
The Dikon portfolio includes stakes in 20 companies with more than 35,000
employees - such as Nord, Ukraine's famed refrigerator concern that this
week opened a plant in Jordan, and Azovmash, a machine-building giant in
Mariupol. Despite stuttering nationwide privatisation, Dikon also drew up
plans to first corporatise, and soon after privatise, the Soviet dinosaurs.
'When we see large enterprises need financial help,' Mr Mahmudov said, 'we
invest in them to keep them afloat.'
The optimists hope Donbass mirrors the post-war fate of Germany's Ruhr
region or Pittsburgh in the 1980s: an industrial swathe restructured, then
revitalised. 'In the west it took 15 years,' Mr Mahmudov said. 'There are
energetic people here, but in Donetsk, it'll take longer.'
Outside capital is desperately needed to rebuild inefficient and subsidised
industries and mines.
Gas de France last week explored coal mines to consider a venture to trap
and sell methane gas, a resource currently wasted. But such visits are rare.
Even compared with Russia, Mr Kerulis said, Ukraine's Donbass looks risky.
Companies fear the government's 'moving target' tax policies and the mob.
Just across the border from Rostov, an organised crime centre, Donetsk sees
more than a share of grenade attacks, car burning, and murder.
Politics is a hurdle, too. Donetsk is a communist stronghold with a large
constituency in miners and pensioners, underpaid and unhappy.
Miners' strikes scuttled government plans to cut subsidies. Last week a
walkout was called off when Kiev raised wages. But a showdown is imminent:
Ukraine's efforts to shape up mining are central to new-found respect for
fiscal austerity but the government may be ill prepared to face the social
unrest and economic consequences of mass strikes.
The other, but exaggerated, threat to stability lies with deep nostalgia for
the Soviet Union among the region's almost exclusively Russian speakers.
Nationalists also worry about the local elite's strong CIS-Moscow
orientation.
The Donbass is now very strong in Kiev. President Leonid Kuchma is an
eastern industrialist. His strong ally Mr Sherban, also an MP, chairs the
parliament's budget committee with wide power over purse strings and
investment contracts.
The east no longer seems Ukraine's weak spot. Quite the opposite, the
Donbass is at the vanguard of change. Bread prices this month were freed
first in Donetsk - and the region's efforts at improving ties with Russia,
Mr Rybak says, are not an attempt at separatism but greater autonomy
spreading across the country.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Gaullists reject early play-off: French conservatives have
abandoned the idea of holding primaries to choose a presidential candidate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France's conservative coalition yesterday buried the idea of holding
US-style primary elections to choose a single right-wing presidential
candidate.
Representatives of the RPR Gaullists and the centre-right UDF federation
yesterday pronounced primaries 'impossible' and said a victory for the right
next year would depend on rival conservatives having 'the will' to rally
together in time for the final round of voting on May 7.
The possibility of the French right reaching across the Atlantic for a
device to settle their differences always seemed a long shot, though the
RPR-UDF agreement in 1991 that called for staggered, regional primary
elections ending at least three months before the presidential vote was
modelled on US lines. The first round of voting in France constitutes a kind
of a primary, in that only two candidates go to the final vote and they are
usually of the right and of the left; but the bare fortnight between the two
votes gives no time for party wounds to heal.
The primaries idea mainly failed because by the time it started to get
serious consideration this autumn - as Mr Jacques Delors, the European
Commission president and possible Socialist presidential contender, began to
profit in the opinion polls from the rivalry of Gaullists Mr Jacques Chirac
and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur - the same opinion polls showed that Mr
Chirac would lose to Mr Balladur in primaries.
With primaries therefore seen as a partisan device by Balladur supporters to
squeeze Mr Chirac out of the race, their formal demise yesterday was greeted
with relief by the Chirac camp and irritation by Mr Balladur's.
But the prime minister clearly intends to play on the fact that - unlike Mr
Chirac - he has wide support within his UDF coalition partnership. 'A unity
candidacy remains as necessary as ever,' he said yesterday, though he does
not intend to go public with his Elysee campaign until early January.
Recent polls have shown that Socialist European Commission President Jacques
Delors has overtaken Mr Balladur as frontrunner in the presidential race. Mr
Delors has yet to announce whether he will run. Mr Chirac, the only
significant declared contender, trails a distant third.

A UN investigator yesterday urged Russia to release 71,000 people awaiting
trial in what he called inhuman and overcrowded conditions. Mr Nigel Rodley,
UN special rapporteur on torture, said many of the detainees were young,
first-time, non-violent offenders swept up in a 'law and order' campaign to
clear the streets. Mr Rodley, who has visited 'infernal' detention centres
in Moscow and St Petersburg, said that while the 160 remand centres in
Russia had an official capacity of 167,000, about 238,000 were crammed into
squalid, inhuman cells. 'The special rapporteur appeals to the government of
the Russian Federation to remove from confinement in centres of detention on
remand all 71,000 detained in excess of the officially proclaimed capacity
of existing institutions,' he said in his his report to the UN Commission on
Human Rights. Some detainees were petty criminals as young as 14, Mr Rodley
said.

Poland's long delayed mass privatisation programme took a significant step
forward yesterday when Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister and Peasant
party leader, approved the board members for 15 investment funds. The funds
are to be handed equity in 444 state companies due to be privatised under
the plan. Shares in the funds, which are to be run by mixed foreign and
local managers, are to distributed to the population at a nominal fee. The
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development recently allocated Dollars
54m in loans to the programme to cover the funds' initial costs.
Mr Pawlak has misgivings about the scheme, which he thinks gives too great a
role to foreign managers, and long delays in approving successive steps in
the programme have served to demonstrate his doubts. These are not shared by
the former communist SLD party, the other member of the governing coalition.
The latest decision means the funds can now be formally registered and talks
with 19 shortlisted fund managers can start in January.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Greece leads EU food stakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greeks spend more on food, drink and tobacco than anyone else in the
European Union, according to Eurostat, the EU's statistical office. The
French, reputedly connoisseurs of food and drink, actually spend less on
these pleasures than the British. And the Irish spend more than other
Europeans on having fun.
Eurostat says spending on food, beverages and tobacco fell to 19.1 per cent
of total EU household consumption in 1992 from 20.8 per cent during the late
1980s. The Greeks spent 36.7 per cent, followed by the Irish on 34.8 per
cent, the Portuguese on 33.6 per cent and the British on 21.6 per cent. The
French spent 18.6 per cent - lower than the EU average. The Dutch spent less
than anyone else in the Union: 14.9 per cent. As far as recreation,
entertainment, education and culture are concerned, the Irish expended 12.1
per cent of household consumption. The British, Danes and Dutch all spent
about 10 per cent. Luxembourg spent least at 4.1 per cent.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Iberia's pilots reject pay cut

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to salvage Iberia, Spain's loss-making national airline, were thrown
into disarray yesterday when the company's pilots refused to accept pay cuts
demanded by the management. Iberia's chairman Mr Javier Salas said the
decision by Sepla - the union representing the carrier's 1,100 pilots -
after all-night negotiations was 'profoundly depressing' and threatened the
company's future.
After a 24-hour wildcat strike on Monday that closed domestic airports,
unions representing cabin crews and ground staff agreed to salary reductions
averaging 8 per cent in place of the 15 per cent originally sought. The
pilots, who held separate talks with the management, balked when they were
asked to carry the main burden of the cost-cutting measures with salary
reductions of up to 20 per cent. Mr Salas, who plans to meet ground staff
unions again today, said the breakdown of negotiations with the pilots meant
that the company could be forced to sell business units and subsidiaries in
order to avert bankruptcy.

<TEXT>
West German industrial output rose 1.6 per cent in October according to
preliminary, seasonally adjusted data. The renewed advance took year-on-year
growth to 5.1 per cent, above many economists' forecasts. According to
latest predictions from the authoritative Ifo institute, industrial
production in the region will grow by 5 per cent next year. A new study
predicts lively recovery after 4 per cent output growth this year.
Machinery-makers should see output rise 9 per cent after 3 per cent this
year as domestic demand picks up to complement export sales which have led
the recovery. Passenger car output is forecast to rise 7 per cent after 8
per cent this year. Production of commercial vehicles, up 6 per cent this
year, is expected to expand 12 per cent in 1995.
Denmark's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 11.4 per cent in
October from 11.7 per cent in September and from 12.4 per cent in October
last year.
Norwegian unemployment fell to 4.4 per cent in November from 4.5 per cent in
October and 4.9 per cent a year ago.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Five groups seek Dutch mobile phone deal

Five international consortiums submitted bids yesterday to set up a second
Dutch mobile communications network to compete with the one established by
KPN, the country's partially privatised telecommunications operator.
The government will decide by April 1 which of the competing consortia -
grouped around the Netherlands' three biggest banks, Deutsche Telekom of
Germany and Telecom Finland - will win the right to challenge KPN's monopoly
in providing pan-European GSM (global system of mobile communications)
services.
The long-awaited second licence is designed to inject competition in mobile
communications in the Netherlands, which until recently had lagged behind
its European neighbours in embracing the new digital standard.
It is also seen as a dress rehearsal for next year, when the government
hopes to issue a licence to the country's electricity companies, other
utilities and Dutch Rail, the state-owned railway, to start building a fixed
telecommunications infrastructure. This proposed domestic rival to KPN,
which will initially be restricted to offering data communication services
to business customers, is widely expected to seek a partnership with a
foreign telecommunications group.
The deadline for submitting GSM business plans of up to 500 pages was
yesterday afternoon. The public works ministry declined to identify the
bidders by name, but industry sources identified the consortium leaders as
ABN Amro Bank, ING Bank, Rabobank, Deutsche Telekom and Southwestern Bell.
ABN Amro's partners include Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK, while ING's main
partner is Britain's Vodafone. Rabobank's consortium consists, among others,
of Schiphol Airport and Getronics, the Dutch computer services company.
Deutsche Telekom's partners in the 'GSM Nederland NV' consortium include the
newspaper group De Telegraaf and RCC, the Netherlands' former national
computer centre. Telecom Finland has teamed up with Visa Nederland.
The winning consortium will have to scramble to catch up with KPN, which
launched its GSM network on July 1 and which has already signed up more than
50,000 subscribers.
The 'GSM Nederland' consortium has previously said it could have its network
up and running within three months, suggesting that KPN could start to face
competition from mid-1995. KPN has already invested more than Fl 500m
(Pounds 183m) in building its network, with future investments expected to
take the total cost of its network to Fl 1.2bn.
Despite the head start given to KPN, the second GSM operator is virtually
certain to benefit from high profit margins in the early years of its
licence.

FT  02 DEC 94 / How the cement cartel came unstuck: A look at the European
Commission investigation of price-fixing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fat file sitting on European commissioner Karel Van Miert's desk is, he
says, as good a read in places as a roman policier.
Unfortunately for the curious, Mr Van Miert is not publishing his file but
he could probably be forgiven the hyperbole given that it took three of the
Commission's staff against 'an army of lawyers' five years to come up with
its contents.
The file's contents relate to the alleged illegal manoeuvrings of 33
European cement producers, plus one international cement association and
eight national ones that over a period of 10 years colluded to rig Europe's
cement market.
On Wednesday, a triumphant Mr Van Miert, competition commissioner, announced
the imposition of record fines totalling Ecu248m (Pounds 193m) on the
producers but warned that industry was getting better and better at hiding
evidence of collusive behaviour.
'There are still cartels in some sectors and they will do anything they can
to avoid us finding any evidence,' he said.
The chairman of one leading cement producer is alleged to have said at the
end of a collusive get-together that no minutes of the meeting would be
'necessary'. The participants were, however, not careful enough. A series of
raids on the headquarters of all the leading EU cement companies towards the
beginning of the investigation produced enough evidence to satisfy the
Commission that a powerful cartel was operating.
It alleges that the European Cement Association - Cembureau - established
what was known as the 'Cembureau agreement or principle of not transhipping
to internal European markets'.
Through the exchange of information on prices the principle allowed
producers to reduce price differences between countries so as to remove any
temptation to export and to get those producers who did export to align
their prices with those of local producers.
In effect, the system allowed the producers to maintain artificial frontiers
on the basis of domestic markets. As Mr Van Miert said yesterday: 'If a
German business wanted to buy cement from a French producer, just 20km
inside the frontier, it was not allowed to do so.'
Conclusions to one Cembureau meeting on intra-community trade said:
'Pressure from inter-member trade had slackened considerably through
improved bilateral contacts. Exports had tended to shrink, but there was
still a threat from outsiders'.
According to the Commission, exchanges of notes between French and Italian
producers, for instance, reveal their decision to share the Cote d'Azur
market. And at several meetings, the Portuguese and Spanish producers,
represented by their associations, monitored cement exports between the two
countries so as to ensure that markets were shared.
One note from a meeting between the Spanish and Portuguese stated that: 'The
parties present, who may be regarded as the repres-entatives of Spanish and
Portuguese cement producers, expressed their clear support for the principle
that there should be no cement movements from Spain to Portugal or from
Portugal to Spain.'
In 1986, after the loss of key Middle East markets, Greek producers started
to threaten other markets with cheap exports. Cembureau reacted swiftly. It
set up a joint trading company, called Interciment, to absorb Greek cement
and prevent it from being exported to other markets.
Using heavy-arm tactics the Italian cement producers also took action,
ensuring that a big contract between an Italian buyer and Greek suppliers
was broken. Meanwhile, other European cement producers ended contracts with
Greek producers to curb exports.
These practices continued right up until last year, according to the
Commission. The companies - most of which are appealing - have three months
to pay fines that in some cases amount to 4 per cent of their annual
turnover in cement.
The Commission hopes its action will introduce competition into Europe's
cement market. It has pointed out that cement can be supplied profitably
even over long distances.
'Cement supplies are possible from Germany and Spain to the UK and Ireland,
while Italian producers are able to cross the Alps and supply cement in
Switzerland,' it said yesterday.
The relevant market is therefore Europe, it concluded. 'If the markets were
sealed off by distance, there would be no reason for the behaviour of the
firms as described in the infringement.'

FT  02 DEC 94 / An industry prone to price-fixing and cartels: Why cement?
Andrew Taylor points to high costs and a low value product in a cyclical
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The record fines announced on Wednesday by the European Commission on 33
cement companies for operating an illegal cartel are not the first penalties
European cement manufacturers have had imposed on them for allegedly trying
to fix their markets.
The German Cartel Office in 1989 announced fines totalling DM244m (Pounds
100m) against domestic manufacturers accused of operating a price-fixing
ring. In July 1992 the Italian anti-trust authority fined cement producers
L5bn (Pounds 2m) in the so-called Procal cartel in southern Italy.
Not all cartels have been illegal. A 50-year-old legal common pricing
agreement in Britain was ended by manufacturers in 1987. Another legal
cement cartel in Switzerland established since 1911 is to be dismantled at
the end of this year.
It will be replaced by a transport pooling arrangement to ensure that at
least 51 per cent of cement is transported by rail to protect the
environment. Rail traffic will be subsidised by a voluntary duty imposed on
cement carried on roads.
In most cases however, such agreements are illegal.
What is it that makes cement manufacturers so prone to operating market
sharing and price-fixing cartels?
The huge capital investment required to build a modern cement works - a
medium-sized plant costs about Pounds 100m - means that national markets
increasingly have become dominated by a small number of large companies.
Cement is a relatively low value product, sold to a highly cyclical
construction industry, making it even more tempting for producers to try to
ensure price stability by making clandestine agreements.
Annual cement sales in the European Union, according to the European Cement
Association (Cembureau), rose by 22 per cent during the five years between
1985 and 1990 only to fall by a tenth over the next three years.
Attempts to sell cement across borders to offset big falls in domestic
demand nonetheless have remained few. Imports as a proportion of total EU
consumption have risen only from 5.8 per cent to 12.7 per cent between 1987
and 1993, according to Cembureau.
'Companies may be reluctant to sell substantial surplus volume in
neighbouring countries as it could provoke retaliation and lead to a
devastating regional price war,' says Mr Lawrence Amboldt, construction
analyst with MP London Wall Equities.
For this reason few observers expect to see a dramatic change in the way in
which large European cement producers operate in spite of the Commission's
verdict. 'There may be some narrowing of price differentials between markets
but I do not expect to see a great upsurge in cross border trade,' says Mr
Amboldt.
According to London Wall, seven large suppliers account for about half total
European sales, excluding Turkey, the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS), Albania and former Yugoslavia.
The largest European supplier is Italcementi of Italy, although Holderbank
of Switzerland is bigger worldwide. Italcementi, which has a European market
share of more than 11 per cent, also has a controlling interest in Ciments
Francais, the second-largest French producer.
Other members of the big seven are: Heidelberger of Germany, which has a
controlling interest in CBR, the largest Belgian producer, and has about 10
per cent of the European market; Holderbank with almost 9 per cent; Lafarge
Coppee the largest French producer, almost 8 per cent; Blue Circle of
Britain, 4 per cent; Dyckerhoff of Germany, 4 per cent; and Euroc/Aker a
Scandinavian joint venture with 3.5 per cent.
Many of these companies control subsidiaries based in other EU markets but
in most cases these make very modest cross-border sales.
Concentration of power is even greater in individual markets. Three
companies, Blue Circle, Rugby and Castle, supply over 90 per cent of cement
sold in Britain while four companies, Lafarge, Ciments Francais, Vicat and
Holderbank supply over 90 per cent of the French market.
The biggest threat to the large European producers comes from eastern
European countries, such as Poland, which under communist rule established
large cement manufacturing capacity now searching for foreign currency
alternative markets to sell surplus production.
Manufacturers in response have sought to gain control of eastern European
producers as these have been privatised. 'Between them Holderbank,
Heidelberger/CBR, Lafarge and Italcementi/Ciments Francais effectively have
bought up the cement industry in the Czech Republic,' says Mr Amboldt.

FT  02 DEC 94 / PDS goes on hunger strike in tax row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of east Germany's reformed communists, the Party of Democratic
Socialism, have gone on hunger strike in protest against plans by the Berlin
tax authorities to seize their property in part payment for alleged
outstanding taxes.
PDS leaders claim the action by the tax authorities is a politically
orchestrated attempt to force the party into bankruptcy. In city elections
next year the PDS is expected to win several seats in the east of the city.
'We will keep up the strike until this claim is dropped,' said Mr Gregor
Gysi, parliamentary leader of the PDS and one of seven PDS members who are
on hunger strike in Berlin's state parliament. The party won 30
parliamentary seats in last month's federal election, and 4.4 per cent of
the federal vote.
The tax authorities are claiming that the PDS owes DM67m (Pounds 27.3m) in
property tax due for the first six months of 1990. But Mr Gysi said the
authorities had a poor legal case for claiming that tax since two separate
Germanies existed at that time.
He added: 'The authorities have never asked the other east German political
parties to pay tax for this period. This is an attempt to politically kill
us by making us bankrupt.'
The other parties, which had been sanctioned by east Germany's communist
party were merged with west Germany's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), led
by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the
governing coalition.
Their property, like that of the PDS, is held in trust by the Treuhand
privatisation agency, while separately an independent commission is
assessing who has the legal right to inherit any of these properties.
The tax office, which is headed by Mr Elmar Pieroth, the CDU senator
responsible for Berlin's finances, said it would seize the PDS's property if
the party did not pay. Most of the PDS's property had belonged to east
Germany's former communist party.
However, the legality of such an action was last month challenged by a
Berlin court, which, by way of a compromise, proposed that the PDS hand over
as a guarantee to the tax authorities the DM6.6m due to the party from the
federal state for expenses incurred during the recent election campaign.
But Mr Lothar Bisky, chairman of the PDS who is also on hunger strike,
yesterday said if the party was forced to part with the DM6.6m, it would
face bankruptcy, 'which is exactly what some of the political parties want,'
he said. The PDS has outstanding debts of over DM5.5m, of which DM2m is owed
to east German enterprise managers and supporters who helped finance the
PDS's election campaign.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Council tax bills likely to rise after government cuts
funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday imposed the toughest financial settlement on local
authorities since the 1970s, with a cash cut in the funding they will
receive from central government and a projected rise in council tax bills of
twice the rate of inflation.
Councillors of all parties reacted angrily, predicting job losses, a
reduction in services and larger school class sizes.
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, announced that aggregate external
finance for local authorities - from specific grants and business rates -
will be reduced by 0.4 per cent in 1995-96, to Pounds 34.672bn.
He told the Commons the settlement was 'tough' but said it was clear many
authorities had 'considerable scope to increase their efficiency'.
Environment Department officials said the move meant a shift in the tax
burden from centrally raised taxation to the council tax. The government
estimates that councils which meet its standard spending guidelines should
raise bills for properties in the council tax band C - valued at between
Pounds 52,000 and Pounds 68,000 - by about 4.6 per cent next year, from
Pounds 467 to Pounds 491. Under the same measure, Band D (Pounds 68,000 to
Pounds 88,000) bills would rise from Pounds 525 to Pounds 551.
Councils predicted an average rise of 6 per cent.
Strict 'capping' of council budgets by the government is intended to prevent
excessive rises.
Councils outside inner London will have their budgets cut if they spend more
than the government's assessment for them, and if they raise spending by 0.5
per cent or more compared with this year. Inner London councils will be
allowed a 2 per cent rise.
There will also be a cut in the transitional relief paid to authorities
which lost out after the council tax replaced the old community charge or
poll tax. This will lead to additional increases varying from Pounds 67 a
year to Pounds 137, according to which band the property is in, on top of
the so-called standard spending council tax.
In a joint statement, the three English local authority associations said:
'Councils will suffer a very difficult year, and the public - in particular
the elderly, the infirm and children - face losing vital services because
the government will not let local authorities spend enough to give their
communities what they need.'
Several Tory backbenchers also registered concern. Sir Peter Fry, MP for
Wellingborough, protested that Northamptonshire would have a 'very
disappointing' settlement for the second year running, requiring many
teachers to be made redundant.
Mrs Rita Taylor, a Tory district councillor for Bromsgrove and a member of
the Association of District Councils' finance panel, said: 'Conservatives in
local government are not a happy lot. The initial reaction of many will be
despair.'

FT  02 DEC 94 / US Senate backs Uruguay Round world trade deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Senate last night overwhelmingly approved the Uruguay Round
agreement, paving the way for the most ambitious trade liberalisation deal
in history and the setting up of the World Trade Organisation.
The Senate vote - delayed by months - is expected to trigger speedy
ratification by other countries, in time to set up the WTO by January 1.
Many have held back, awaiting the crucial vote of the US Congress.
The lower house of the Japanese Diet is expected to act today, and the
European Union is on course to complete ratification by December 20. The US
House of Representatives approved the Uruguay Round legislation by a wide
margin on Tuesday. But only a week ago, Senate approval seemed doubtful.
The Senate had to find 60 votes out of 100 to waive budget rules to bring
the implementing legislation to the Senate floor. But supporters mustered 68
votes to 32 against, before then going on to vote 76-24 for the pact.
Opposition to the WTO - portrayed as a supranational body which would
impinge upon US sovereignty - has been whipped up by populists in both
political parties and by Mr Ross Perot, the billionaire presidential
candidate. Foes stoked indignation over the fact that the US gets only one
vote like the rest of the 124 members.
Opponents argued that the previous seven rounds of tariff cuts in the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade had contributed to the chronic US
trade deficit. They insisted that in textiles and apparel alone, the US
would lose 1m jobs.
Although recent polls showed only 51 per cent of US voters against the deal,
radio and television talk shows have been flooded with anti-Gatt phone
calls.
Agreement between the Clinton administration and Senator Robert Dole, the
Republican Senate leader, last week brought many wavering Republicans on
board. Tireless lobbying by administration officials and business groups
with much to gain in the round also brought others around.
As debate dragged on in the Senate on Wednesday and yesterday, the 'lame
duck' session, devoted only to the trade pact, took on something of a
carnival air. Accompanied by a costumed 'lame duck,' opponents yesterday
morning picketed the White House, meeting undecided senators who had been
invited for talks with the president.
Lobbyists, administration officials and senators mingled in the 'war room'
set up to control the action on Capitol Hill. The rumour spread that
previously opposed senators were switching to Yes votes in the hope that a
large affirmative vote would give everyone political 'cover'. But
administration officials continued to insist that they not let up on the
pressure.
Several senators who opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta)
 -Democrats Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Donald Riegle of Michigan -
declared themselves supporters of the Uruguay Round.
Even before the vote, the US Council for International Business faxed press
releases congratulating President Clinton and hailing the result as 'the
most important vote on a trade policy that Congress has been asked to take'
since 1934.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Sinn Fein talks to start next week: Offer to negotiate comes
three months after IRA ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, GEORGE GRAHAM and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to begin talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing,
in five days' time on December 7. The move will start an important phase of
the Northern Ireland peace process.
The announcement - made in a letter to Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein
president, from a senior Downing Street official - came three months to the
day after the IRA's ceasefire.
Decommissioning of paramilitary arsenals will be top of the agenda in the
talks, which are intended to start bringing Sinn Fein into the political
mainstream.
The Sinn Fein team is to be led by Mr Martin McGuinness, a vice-president in
the organisation. Mr Quentin Thomas, the Number Two civil servant in the
Northern Ireland Office, will lead the government's team.
The talks will be held in Belfast, probably at Stormont.
Yesterday's announcement of an earlier-than-expected date for the talks came
as the government appeared to bow to US pressure over whether Sinn Fein
members would be invited to an important Belfast investment conference this
month.
Several US institutions and corporations had threatened to boycott the
conference unless Sinn Fein was included.
They included Mr Alan Hevesi, New York City controller, who earlier this
year signalled a plan to channel institutional funds towards Ulster in the
form of 'Irish peace bonds', and Mr William Flyn, chairman of Mutual
America, one of the biggest American insurance companies, who has helped to
co-ordinate private investor interest in Ulster.
Congressional supporters of the Irish Republicans urged the US
administration not to allow Mr Ron Brown, US Commerce Secretary, to attend
the conference unless the British government invited Mr Adams.
Yesterday the government said a handful of Sinn Fein councillors would after
all be invited in their capacity as members of two local council committees.
The decision is thought to have had an important bearing on the starting
date of preliminary talks with Sinn Fein, in effect entailing that they had
to get under way before the conference on December 13 and 14.
Ulster Unionists and some senior Conservatives were under the impression
until very recently that the talks would begin only just before Christmas.
Reaction to yesterday's announcement was mixed. The Rev Ian Paisley, leader
of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, said the decision to hold talks
with the 'men of blood' was 'highly resented'. But the move was welcomed by
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow Northern Ireland secretary.
Mr Adams also responded positively: 'The opportunity to realise a lasting
peace which will benefit all of the people of Ireland has never been
greater.'
In Washington, President Bill Clinton welcomed the announcement, saying that
a just and lasting settlement in Northern Ireland was 'finally within
reach'.
Separately, he announced the appointment of Senator George Mitchell, the
retiring leader of the Democratic Senate majority, to be his special adviser
on Ulster economic initiatives.
The Commerce Department said Mr Brown definitely planned to attend the
conference. Mr Mitchell will consider attending.
The issue became entangled with negotiations over Mr Adams's visit to
Washington next week. Although the British government has not sought to
dissuade the US from granting Mr Adams another visa, it has argued
successfully that he must still not be allowed to raise funds in the US.

FT  02 DEC 94 / Russia warns Nato on rapid move eastwards: Moscow holds back
launch of military co-operation programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, last night warned Nato not
to draw new dividing lines in Europe by expanding eastwards too rapidly.
In protest at the expansion plans, Russia unexpectedly refused to hand over
a document which would have launched a military co-operation programme with
Nato. The move shocked western officials, who had seen the agreement as a
symbol of improving relations between Moscow and the west.
Mr Kozyrev still hoped to launch the co-operation programme, which includes
military information-sharing and joint exercises, but insisted it would only
happen when Russia had answers to its fears about the rapid expansion of
Nato.
Mr Kozyrev's comments came after a meeting of Nato foreign ministers, which
had broadly accepted a US proposal to speed up enlargement to include
ex-communist countries in central and eastern Europe.
The foreign ministers' meeting took place in the shadow of a bitter
transatlantic row over Bosnia, a dispute highlighted yesterday by a leak to
the German press of a telegram from Baron Hermann von Richthofen, the
country's ambassador to Nato.
The telegram, intended for the German foreign ministry, was written last
week, just before the latest row between the US and its European allies. It
warned that the possible lifting of the Bosnian arms embargo, sought by the
US Congress, would 'bring the cohesion of the alliance to its limits'.
It also emerged yesterday that Nato's military command had asked Germany if
it could provide Tornado fighters to help police the skies over Bosnia.
German officials said the request, controversial because of the Nazi record
in the Balkans, would have to be considered cautiously.
In an attempt to revive the Bosnian peace process, Mr Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary, and Mr Alain Juppe, his French counterpart, will go to
Belgrade on Sunday to meet President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia.
After snubbing Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, on
Wednesday, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, is scheduled today
to meet Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy, in Pale, the Serb-held
stronghold above Sarajevo.
Today, foreign ministers from Britain, France, Germany, the US and Russia -
making up the contact group on Bosnia - will meet in Brussels to relaunch
the peace initiative begun in the summer.
Despite the intense diplomatic efforts, UN officials privately fear
prospects for peace are slim. The Nato ministers agreed that existing
members would agree procedures for incorporating newcomers, and present
conclusions to candidate members next year.
Russian officials have repeatedly warned against the incorporation of
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia - widely seen as the prime
candidates for Nato membership - if Russia is excluded.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (19): Catalyst for
change - Integrated packages / Lift-truck maker Lansing Linde has moved its
operations on to a single system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lansing Linde seems to be on an endless quest for perfection in its
manufacturing systems and the business organisation and procedures that
surround them.
The UK arm of this international manufacturer of lift-trucks was moving from
bespoke systems on ICL and Data General computers to a single ICL mainframe
package when it was taken over by the German Linde group in 1989. The UK
company has factories in Basingstoke, Wigan and Newport.
But after reviewing business and systems strategies, Linde decided to move
its German, French and UK manufacturing operations from different computers
and software to the same system. It chose the R/2 mainframe package from
SAP, running on IBM-type central computers.
Paul Goode, leading the UK project as manufacturing systems manager, says
R/2 was chosen because it integrated many business functions, thus allowing
data sharing and eliminating duplication. In addition it handles different
currencies and languages and can accommodate individual companies' needs
through the use of tables of options.
In the next six to nine months, the UK operation will complete the
installation of R/2 modules running everything from sales order processing
to scheduling, product costing, capacity planning and manufacturing control.
But Mr Goode believes the whole system will be looked at again once it is
installed. And he is already looking forward to evaluating the follow-on
product: this is R/3, a so-called client-server system which runs on
networks of PCs and small computers.
'There are so many things we can do with such an integrated system that if
we tried to introduce them all while we were implementing the system we
would never get there,' Mr Goode says.
'We have to keep the business running while the system goes in. Once it is
fully live, I believe we will review everything again to get still more
benefits.'
At national level, those benefits come not least from the integrated nature
of the system, which means everyone uses the same information. Mr Goode says
this integration also demands discipline in data management, which initially
raised new issues as well as benefits.
'It's very important that everyone uses the same data, but that in turn
makes the data very important,' he says. 'Before, different functions had
their own data on the ICL or Data General systems. But now, for example, as
soon as a delivery is recorded by goods inward, finance knows it's there and
can immediately see if the price is correct. This means all data entry has
to be accurate, which is a great benefit, but it can cause problems of
discipline in data handling in the early days.
At international levels, the use of the same system in different countries
means that each national company can link up through the group network to
check stocks in other countries to meet orders. A co-ordinated bill of
materials means the company can have a single product list across Europe
which accurately reflects all the products available from any site.
Mr Goode says that in the UK the system has been a catalyst for change.
Lansing Linde has built a new Pounds 43m factory in Basingstoke and
introduced new products as well as the computer system in the past four
years.
'Introducing a package like R/2 demands that you look at all your business
processes, which we had to do anyway,' he says. 'The system has therefore
been an enabler in that exercise.'
Supplier profile SAP: formed in Germany in 1972 and in the UK in 1988.
Product: R/2, an integrated package covering everything from accounting and
human resources to logistics and manufacturing. It was launched in 1980 and
the current release was announced in 1993. Lansing Linde expressed
uncertainty about the future of this mainframe product, especially after the
introduction of the R/3 client-server version in 1992; SAP says it is
committed to R/2 until well into the next century and that this is reflected
in the fact that it is working on a new release.
Turnover: DM1.1bn in 1993 with net profit DM146.2m. UK turnover was Pounds
10.8m.
Employees: 4,000, including 75 in the UK.
Hardware and operating systems: IBM mainframes.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (18): Fitting in
the with package - Business process re-engineering / John Kavanagh finds
that software was the key to company restructuring at ventilation group Colt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One way to ensure that a company takes business process re-engineering
seriously is to first destabilise the entire organisation - something that
can be achieved easily by introducing a new computer system. This is the
view of Malcolm Goodwin, management information systems manager at Colt
Group, following a re-organisation from separate national companies to a
single Europe-wide business running the same program package in each
country.
Colt, a UK company formed in 1931, is the European market leader in
ventilation for factories, shopping centres and other industrial and
commercial complexes. Some of its systems are custom-built - such as the
pyramid on top of London's Canary Wharf - but most are configured to order
from standard products. The group has 200 staff and a turnover of more than
Pounds 90m, two-thirds of which comes from outside the UK.
Until the early 1990s, Colt's manufacturing companies in Germany and the
Netherlands and at group headquarters in Havant, Hampshire, operated largely
autonomously. This autonomy was reflected in the fact that each
manufacturing site had its own IT staff running different systems. Sales
teams in six other European countries had PCs. None of these systems was
linked to any other.
The impending opening of the single European market led to a business
strategy review. This highlighted the need to re-organise into a
pan-European operation, retaining local autonomy where possible. Computer
systems were seen as vital. 'Standardising our systems would not only
address existing shortcomings such as inflexibility and separate databases
but also encourage culture change to align each company to the new group
business strategy,' Mr Goodwin says.
A standard software package for all sites was seen as the only way ahead:
'We wrote into the group's policy statement the fact that we would not use
any bespoke systems, even if it meant changing the business to fit the
package. 'With bespoke systems there is the problem of specifying exactly
what is needed so that the IT department can exactly produce it.'
Colt wanted a supplier which would still be around in 10 years' time and
which could support it in the three main countries. However, it took a
liberal approach on system functions.
'We didn't write a detailed functional specification, because it would be
impossible to find a package which would fit precisely,' Mr Goodwin says.
'We set up multinational teams of users from the same business functions to
discuss their requirements in general terms and produce a high-level
invitation to tender.'
An independent consultant helped with detailed weighting and analysis of
technical bids from two short-listed suppliers. These suppliers also had a
day each to present their systems to the user teams. A lesson was learned
here.
'The end-users' evaluation was not adequately structured, so their responses
tended to be emotive,' Mr Goodwin says. 'This could have distorted the
selection process but fortunately they preferred the supplier which had
emerged as favourite from the more scientific analysis of the technical
bids.'
The winning supplier, Baan International of the Netherlands, had extra
attractions for Mr Goodwin. 'It's a family business, with two brothers, both
very active,' he says. 'They have great vision for the future of the company
and the product, which we needed.'
Colt now has Baan's Triton manufacturing package, which includes related
applications such as accounting. Triton was seen as lacking pre-sales
facilities, so Colt chose the Brock Activity Manager, a market leader in the
US and sold in the UK by Cocam. Uniplex was chosen for office automation.
One factor in the choice of these last two packages was that they use the
same relational database design as Triton, allowing them to be linked
easily, for example to extract data from Triton into Uniplex to produce
tender documents for prospective customers.
All the systems run under the Unix operating system on IBM RS/6000 computers
at all three factories. The systems are gradually also being installed at
the other European operations. Colt uses the Internet for communications and
has gone to Internet services supplier Pipex.
Colt introduced Triton using a Baan method which was time consuming but
brought considerable benefits. 'The method involves training a key user in
each functional area to a high level and allowing them to lead the
implementation,' Mr Goodwin says.
The team approach to choosing and introducing the new system has had lasting
impact. 'There is far greater communication between people in different
countries,' Mr Goodwin says.
There has been a small reduction in IT staff but they now work more closely
with the users and focus on helping them get the most out of the packages.
Mr Goodwin says the IT staff were previously seen as an obstacle to business
use of IT.
Using a standard package has had a dual impact on Colt's business
reorganisation. 'Before, we were constrained by rigid systems; our new
package is highly configurable: there are always two or three ways of
achieving something. This means we can continue to change our organisation
without being held back by our systems.'
Running a single package across all countries has also brought many
operational benefits. For example, an order that once generate 22 copies is
now on one piece of paper and information can be shared instantly through a
single database by manufacturing, sales and finance. In some cases this has
cut deliveries to customers from four weeks to three or four days. Stock and
work in progress have been cut by more than a quarter.
The significance of the systems project to the future of the group is
reflected in the fact that it was the biggest and most ambitious initiative
ever undertaken. The first phase, putting the systems and equipment in the
three main sites, cost Pounds 1.75m.
Supplier profile Baan International: formed in 1978, it is a privately owned
Netherlands company specialising in packaged software for manufacturing.
Product: Triton, the company's main product, is described as an enterprise
resource planning system. It covers MRP-II, logistics, distribution,
transport, finance and project management, and handles multiple currencies,
plants and languages.
Employees: 820 in Europe, North and South America and Asia. Turnover:
Dollars 75m.
Hardware and operating systems: Triton runs under the Unix operating system.
Number of users: 1,800 installations worldwide.
Price: on application; the Colt contract, covering multiple sites, was worth
more than Pounds 650,000.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (17): Consultant's
critique
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GRUMBALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is much easier to tell if the ground is uneven when driving a car than
when riding a bucking bronco. There are far fewer variables to deal with and
the car does not have quite as many inherent instabilities.
To improve quality in process industries, reduce variability as far as
possible. If a system is stable, it is much simpler to spot rogue results
and to take corrective action early.
Philips has to control all stages along the production line. Any error in
temperature may ruin a large batch of glass. It is effectively a single
critical path and losses are lost for ever - there is little or no slack.
Rapid corrective action reduces the size of variations as well as their
duration.
In the past this has been managed with paper-based methods such as Shewhart
charts. Results are plotted, the average calculated and upper and lower
limits drawn. If a result is found outside those limits, then it warrants
investigation. The narrower the band between the two limits, the better the
delivered quality.
The system that Philips uses is a good match for its requirements. It
provides a response that is fast enough even if it is not a true real-time
system. It achieves the desired goals at a low cost and is simple enough to
be maintained locally. A more complex system might give finer control when
working but be more risky if it were to fail.
Most importantly, the system will allow Philips to enter the market for
computer monitor screens which demand higher quality than televisions. It
enhances future prospects as well as current productivity.
Lessons from this case:
Avoid the temptation for an all-singing, all-dancing system.
Match the solution to the requirements.
Decrease variability to increase the quality.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (16): Taking a
pragmatic approach - Production information systems / A comprehensive
network back-up system means that Philips Components' factory can work round
the clock without constant technical support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It takes a leisurely two hours or more for a television screen to progress
from a dollop of molten glass through several cooling and cleaning processes
to the finished product at Philips Components.
The company's factory on the edge of Burnley, Lancashire, has therefore
taken a pragmatic view about the frequency of updates and levels of back-up
it needs in its on-line production information system.
The system, developed last year as part of a multi-million pound refit of
the entire plant, provides information which is six minutes old. The
information network depends largely on a single central computer with
various levels of fall-back without expensive duplication of equipment. The
350 staff keep the highly automated factory working round the clock,
producing 2.5m screens a year.
Until the refit and the new system, information was gathered on old Apple
and BBC PCs. Reports were printed once a day and photocopied for
distribution in time for the following day's production meeting. Information
was therefore up to 24 hours old, so by the time problems were analysed from
the printed reports it could be 30 hours after the initial incident before
things were put right.
The importance of these adjustments is reflected in the fact that the
dollops of molten glass (known as gobs) are squeezed out of a 70-ton tank at
1,000 degrees - and the temperature can be adjusted by two degrees at a
time. The plunger which presses each gob into a mould can be adjusted by
0.5mm. As plant manager Barrie Taylor says, 'output, yield and quality were
erratic'. Business applications were run remotely on a mainframe computer at
Philips' headquarters in the Netherlands.
The factory refit brought the opportunity to replace the hotchpotch of
systems with a single network developed from scratch. The Manman package
from ASK (recently taken over by Computer Associates) was chosen for
materials requirements planning (MRP).
An on-line information system was produced by IT specialist Steve Hewitt and
a colleague using the Powerhouse development language from Cognos.
The factory now has a small central Vax computer from Digital Equipment
which communicates with PCs on the factory floor and other devices which
monitor and count the screens as they progress from the mould to the
inspection area.
Another 70 PCs and terminals away from the factory floor give managers and
others access to the production information as well as to multi-user Vax
versions of Wordperfect and Lotus 1-2-3 for word processing and
spreadsheets.
A Cognos facility called Quick enables users to do detailed analysis, for
example to look at trends over longer periods.
Technical design was vital. 'We only have a small IT presence, so the system
had to be able to run round the clock without constant support,' Mr Hewitt
says.
'Communications handling was kept off the PCs and put in the central Vax. It
contacts each PC to collect data, typically every 10 seconds.' The Vax puts
the data in batches and updates the information system every few minutes.'
If the Vax goes out of action the factory PCs continue collecting data and
the managers' PCs hold production information up to the last update. If all
or part of the network goes down the computers affected continue working,
albeit in isolation.
In both cases, when links with the Vax are restored, the central machine
checks when it last received data and gathers the missing data from the
factory PCs. If a PC goes down the Vax notices after several attempts to
collect data and displays a message to the central computer operator.
There is further fall-back with the production counting systems. The
counters are at 25 points and connected to a PC; if the PC goes down the
counters have enough electronic memory to accumulate their totals until the
PC is back in action.
Mr Hewitt and a colleague developed the information system in Powerhouse in
three months. 'We were assured by other users in Philips that it was easy to
use and would enable us to do what we had planned, and that's how it turned
out,' he says. 'Even if we'd been able to find a packaged information system
it could have taken three months to implement it.'
Mr Taylor says yield and output have increased by 10 per cent since the
plant refit, and he believes most of that is down to the system. 'We now
have more sophisticated control and can intervene much earlier if there is a
problem,' Mr Taylor says. 'We therefore have lower statistical variations
and consistent output.'

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (15): Closing the
gaps - Refocusing on customers / John Kavanagh looks at how a standard
package forced change on a manufacturer of trailers, tankers and tippers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Installing a new manufacturing software package has meant so much to Crane
Fruehauf that one director has said: 'Without it we'd be dead.'
It is not the package itself that has made the difference but the exercise
of examining the way the company works.
Crane Fruehauf is Europe's leading manufacturer of heavy goods trailers,
tankers and tippers. It has operations in Norfolk, France, Germany and the
Netherlands. The former US parent was formed in the late 1980s from a
management buy-out, a project which UK finance director Paul Logie believes
distracted the managers from running the business. By the time the US group
sold the European operation to fund debt, the business was losing its market
lead, largely as customer service was slipping and costs were too high.
The business was not helped by its ageing systems. 'In the UK we had
separate systems for different functions and some people ran their own
informal systems too,' Mr Logie says. 'If you asked three departments for
information, you got three different answers, because the data was not as
accurate or up-to-date as it should have been. There was generally a lack of
discipline in the way we worked.'
In 1992 the UK company decided to move from a traditional hierarchy, with
directors of sales, production and so on, to smaller units based on product
groups. This has focused people's activities on their products and
customers.
Today, there are fewer layers of management. Closing the gap between the top
and bottom of the company has seen the executive car park disappear,
extended clocking-in to everyone (although it will probably be phased out),
brought senior managers out of exclusive offices into an open-plan set-up,
and made them more accessible.
The package chosen to support this extensive reorganisation was the SIM/400
MRP-II (manufacturing resource planning) system from Hoskyns, running on an
IBM AS/400. The product was chosen partly because it was being installed in
sister companies in Europe. 'MRP-II through a single system has given us
control and stability in our day-to-day operations,' Mr Logie says. 'From
here we have moved to just-in-time working, geared to cutting waste,
reducing inventory and shortening lead times. Meanwhile our total quality,
cell manufacturing approach has generated a feeling of involvement and
ownership of products and customers.'
Electronic data interchange is being introduced as part of the just-in-time
approach. Orders are sent electronically to a growing number of suppliers
and some deliver directly to the production line.
Crane Fruehauf has taken the standard SIM package as it is. 'We were
determined not to tinker with it,' Mr Logie says. 'It is a proven product
with many users, so we regard it as adequate for us, too. In fact we saw it
as a catalyst for change, in that we changed the way we operate to fit the
system: this forced us to challenge the way we did things.'
Benefits have emerged quickly. 'We have certainly cut our inventory by
Pounds 1m,' Mr Logie says. 'Our market share is increasing again, not least
because of the dramatic change in our view of our customers, products and
suppliers.'
Supplier profile Product: SIM, a manufacturing and order processing system,

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (14): Faithful to
the dinosaur - Just-in-time on a mainframe / Nissan uses 'old-fashioned'
technology to support one of the world's most advanced factories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just-in-time manufacturing is down to a fine art at Nissan Motor
Manufacturing (UK). Stockholding of some components is just 10 minutes - and
the holding of all parts bought in Europe is less than a day.
Yet while many companies move to distributed computing and so-called
client-server systems, Nissan's Sunderland plant, one of the newest and most
advanced in the world, depends largely on a traditional central mainframe
serving simple terminals.
What is more, virtually all the systems have been produced by the company's
own IT staff - using a database management system and development language
which have been around for more than 20 years.
Construction on the 800-acre site started in 1984 and by late 1993 4,250
people were employed. Last year 246,000 Primera and Micra cars were built,
with 80 per cent being exported.
Nissan has moved beyond just-in-time to synchronous supply for some
components, which means manufacturers deliver these components directly to
the production line minutes before they are needed.
These manufacturers do not even receive an order to make a component until
the car for which it is intended has started along the final assembly line.
Seat manufacturer Ikeda Hoover, for example, has about 45 minutes to build
seats to specification and deliver them to the assembly line a mile away. It
delivers 12 sets of seats every 20 minutes and they are mounted in the right
order on an overhead conveyor ready for fitting to the right car.
Nissan has close relationships with this dozen or so suppliers and deals
exclusively with them in their component areas. It involves them and even
their own suppliers in discussions about future needs and other issues.
These companies have generally established their own manufacturing units
close to the Nissan plant.
Other parts from further afield are collected from manufacturers by Nissan
several times a day at fixed times. This is more efficient than having each
supplier making individual haulage arrangements.
Car manufacturing schedules for each day are produced by the big IBM
mainframe computer and sent to Hitachi process computers on the production
lines so that they know what to expect in terms of factors ranging from
colour to left-hand or right-hand drive.
The process computers signal a Digital Equipment Vax computer when
appropriate to transmit an order to the components manufacturers involved in
synchronous supply.
Meanwhile materials handling people on the production lines check on levels
of other components, such as low-value items supplied in bins. If stocks get
low, they use barcode readers to send orders to the mainframe, which
transmits messages to radio data terminals in the warehouse.
Orders to suppliers with longer delivery times are sent weekly, although
this is being cut to once a day. Again, suppliers are given specific
delivery times.
More than 90 per cent of orders are sent via electronic data interchange,
the exchange of business documents between computers run by trading partners
with little or no manual paper handling. In some cases transport
arrangements are also notified by this method.
All the mainframe and Vax systems are written in the Natural language from
Software AG and are based on the company's Adabas database management
system, which has been in use since the early 1970s.
Nissan in Japan has long used Adabas and Natural as standard, so when the UK
IT department was set up with four development staff and a medium sized IBM
mainframe in 1985, its first systems, supplied from Japan, were based on
these products. Since then all the systems have been rewritten and others
have been developed as the plant has moved from an assembly unit to a total
manufacturing operation, taking raw metal into its foundry at one end and
turning out cars at the other.
'We had Adabas and Natural from day one, so that limited our choice of
program packages,' says John Hope, general manager of the information
systems department.
No doubt we could have taken packages written in other languages and linked
them together but we are very much an integrated manufacturing facility in
which the rate at which we receive and use parts is critical, so we wanted
similar integration of our systems. We didn't believe packages could provide
the sophistication necessary. In addition, we didn't want to have to support
different products using different languages and database systems.'
The only significant packages, for accounting and personnel, have also been
replaced by systems written by the IT staff, again to provide the
integration and facilities the business demanded.
The development of all the systems to support such a sophisticated and
time-critical manufacturing and business operation has been done with just
50 staff, an issue of some pride to Mr Hope, especially as none had
experience of Natural or Adabas.
'Natural is an English-like language and is easy to learn,' he says. 'We
train people in-house and sit them next to experienced people and they are
writing programs after a couple of days.'
However, Nissan's system development methods have played a major part.
Nissan likens programming to the car production line. A four-hour standard
is set as the average for program production for work planning, although
some programs are completed in 20 minutes and some take much longer.
All systems have the same basic screen displays, with standard displays for
adding, deleting, changing and browsing through data and for the overall
list ('menu') of facilities. There is a library of standard programs which
carry out these functions and they are fitted together whenever a new
program is written, considerably cutting development time. If business users
want extra facilities, these are agreed with the system designer and added
to the basic displays.
'This policy means all development staff work the same way and all can
understand and maintain any programs without needing in-depth knowledge of
the particular application,' Mr Hope says.
About 500 simple display terminals link users to the mainframe systems.
There are also about 500 PCs running word processing and spreadsheet systems
but these are not connected to business systems as a matter of course: some
can access the mainframe, but only to extract data for modelling in a
spreadsheet program.
'We are very much a traditional mainframe set-up, because we strongly
believe it's right for Nissan,' Mr Hope says. 'We try to minimise the
technology in use, because that minimises the support skills we need. We
have 50 development staff, which is significantly less than in other
companies of our size. Some people say the mainframe is extinct, but after
our success over the last nine years we are pleased to have stayed with the
mainframe 'dinosaur'.'

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (23): The most important deal
of your life - Richard Gourlay looks into the future as Wigits is sold to
its management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The process of raising money for a management buy-out involves managers in
the most important deal of their lives. Few will have relevant previous
experience. Here is a version of how a deal might evolve and be structured
and how it might turn out for the venture capitalists and the MBO team
David Mann knew something was up when he saw his boss's car in the company
parking lot. As managing director of Wigits, the engineering subsidiary of
Publico Ltd, he would have expected notice of a visit from head office.
He soon unravelled the mystery. 'Good news and bad news, David,' said Andrew
Suit, group planning supremo, tetchily. 'The board's been persuaded by some
damned institution that Wigits doesn't fit in our corporate strategy. I
don't agree, but there you are. You have three weeks to mount a management
buy-out or the board will offer the company in an auction. Keep in touch.'
Mann's jaw fell as Suit swept past him to the car park. Wigits's five-strong
executive team had often dreamed about an MBO. But now it was thrust upon
them Mann knew they had no idea where to begin.
As he hurried along the corridor to his finance director, he wondered why
the normally amiable Suit had been so abrupt. Could it be because he would
be left out of the deal? Or was it because the sale of Wigits would shrink
Suit's empire?
His reverie was ended when he nearly collided with Alan Counter, the finance
director. 'Alan, great news - we've been given the opportunity to mount an
MBO - call the accountants,' Mann said.
A week later, after a series of preliminary meetings, Mann and his team were
sitting in the offices of Grapple Ventures, an investor in MBO and MBI teams
which had kept particularly close to Wigits's local accountant.
The tension was palpable. While Mann needed Alan Counter in preparatory
meetings because of his knowledge of the figures, Grapple had just brought
him bad news. While he was a fine subsidiary finance director when it came
to dealing with a head office, his skills would not be relevant or
appropriate when Wigits had its own shareholders and was heading for a
flotation. Grapple had concluded it would need to bring in a new finance
director.
Mann and his team had already burned the midnight oil to reassess their
profit projections.
There was nothing like potential ownership of the business to encourage
close examination of every budget line - what Mann referred to as 'rooting
out contracts to service the office rubber plants'.
Before the buy-out was mooted, Wigits's performance had been steady but
unspectacular. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 6m in 1993 from sales of about
Pounds 80m from the main specialist metal business and Wigits's smaller
components manufacturing operation. The two businesses had net assets of
Pounds 52m.
The trick was to come up with an offer for Wigits both acceptable to Publico
and attractive to Grapple Ventures or another MBO backer. An added
complication was that the management of the components business had got wind
of the deal from Publico and said they would be highly disillusioned if they
could not mount their own buy-out.
Grapple cautioned that the first priority must be to focus on a deal with
Publico. The starting point, the financiers said, was to ascertain how much
debt the business could support on reasonable profit projections.
Grapple believed the Pounds 6m profit could become Pounds 7.5m in 1995,
Pounds 9m the next year and Pounds 11m by 1997. Despite the relatively
steady cash flow from operations, Grapple wanted interest to be covered at
least twice by pre-tax profits. With an all-in interest cost of 10 per cent,
Pounds 6m of profits could support an interest bill of Pounds 3m - or Pounds
30m of debt.
Next, Grapple took a sighting shot at how Publico might value the
engineering business using a reasonable market multiple. Looking at
prospective profits of Pounds 7.5m (post-tax profits of about Pounds 5m) and
a p/e multiple of about 12, Grapple reckoned Pounds 60m would be a
reasonable price.
The question was whether investing Pounds 30m of equity (Pounds 60m less
Pounds 30m of debt) would give Grapple an adequate return. The answer was
no. At that price, the financier's annualised rate of return, assuming a
flotation in three years time at the same p/e multiple would be in the low
20 per cent area.
Back to the drawing board. Mann, with the bit between his teeth, suggested
Grapple had been too pessimistic about the speed at which re-focused
management could accelerate profit growth. Grapple was adamant. Wigits might
think it knew its market but the financiers had seen more missed projections
than Mann had had hot dinners.
Wigits tried another tack. 'What about putting in more debt,' said Mann who
fancied himself as something of an instant expert on MBO financing. 'I'm
told that all those banks that stopped lending to MBOs in the early 1990s
are shovelling out money in bagfuls, claiming they never left the market.
Let's leverage up a bit. Our cash flow is solid enough and it'll raise your
IRRs (internal rate of return).'
Grapple had thought of this. The recent appetite for banks to put on assets
was already worrying, bringing back memories of the highly-geared deals such
as Magnet and Isosceles in the late 1980s.
The senior partner would not budge. If more debt was loaded in, the
assessment of an acceptable return would also have to rise to compensate for
the increased risk.
Looking at a lower Pounds 57m price for Wigits, Grapple was happy with the
numbers. Mann was worried this would not wash with Publico. But as time was
ticking by his mind turned, not for the first time, to what the management
team would get and how much they would have to invest.
By now familiar with the alchemy of MBO gearing, he knew the answers were
respectively lots and not very much.
At a purchase price of Pounds 57m, Grapple would be putting in Pounds 27m of
equity. But Pounds 26m of that would be in the form of preference shares or
subordinated loan stock which would be repaid first. Grapple would be
putting only Pounds 1m of pure equity into the transaction.
On the principle that management should put up a 'meaningful' amount but
that most managers were salary slaves unable to lay their hands on too much
capital, the team would be putting up a total of Pounds 250,000.
That would give them 20 per cent of the equity. Mann also wanted to build in
ratchets to increase this stake if results exceeded expectations.
But that could wait. The issue of what to do with the components subsidiary
had arisen again. First, its management might be seriously demotivated if
they were forced to stay within the group and outside the Wigits MBO team.
In addition, merchant bankers suggested Wigits could be more easily floated
as a company if it were focused exclusively on specialist metals.
Selling the components business immediately would lead to a smaller capital
gain for Grapple. But by focusing Wigits, it could float at a significantly
higher multiple.
It all seemed so easy to Mann. Sitting in another interminable meeting with
lawyers, his mind wandered to a sunlit day three years hence when the
company was being floated on the stock exchange.
Champagne corks were popping and Grapple's senior partner was standing with
his arm around Mann's shoulder. The business had indeed made Pounds 11m
before tax, or Pounds 7.5m after tax, and had been floated in its entirety
on a multiple of about 12 times. This gave a market capitalisation of Pounds
90m.
Senior debt, by then down to Pounds 23m after repayments, had been repaid,
leaving Pounds 67m. Grapple had then received its Pounds 26m of preference
shares, which left Pounds 41m to be divided between ordinary shareholders.
Grapple had pocketed Pounds 33m for its equity, which with the repaid prefs
gave it a total return of Pounds 59m - or an IRR over the period of 32 per
cent. And the management team had received Pounds 8m for its Pounds 250,000
stake.
Suddenly, this Elysian dream evaporated and was replaced by another
altogether darker vision dominated by the smirking figure of Andrew Suit,
head office planning supremo. Something had gone wrong. Wigits's sales must
have collapsed - maybe the French contract had fallen through or the
Americans were finally perfecting a ceramic substitute for metals. Sales
were static. There was no flotation and no champagne.
Supportive but subdued, a junior Grapple executive was trying to retrieve
something by re-negotiating a preference dividend. The wind whistling around
Wigits's windows seemed to whisper 'You are in limbo - the land of the
living dead.'

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (12): Upjohn links
up the orders - Moving to a global supply chain / A pharmaceuticals
manufacturer found a feeling of system ownership was created by introducing
a package designed to connect three separate systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals manufacturer Upjohn is moving from three unconnected systems
in the UK to a worldwide supply chain in which demand for chemicals in one
country will automatically spark off orders in another.
The first step is the replacement of existing systems around the world by
the same BPCS package (Business Planning and Control System) from System
Software Associates (SSA), running on IBM AS/400 business computers.
The project is removing barriers between departments, improving negotiations
with customers and suppliers and changing attitudes towards computer
systems.
The US group has a UK factory in Crawley, Sussex, making 90 products, 60 per
cent of which are exported. UK turnover is Pounds 70m and there are about
500 staff.
The UK operation used to run manufacturing, purchasing and accounting on
separate IBM System/36 computers using a package installed 10 years before.
This meant information on customers and suppliers was keyed into different
systems.
The UK now has the single BPCS system, chosen by the US as the new group
standard.
'The company was very segmented,' says information systems manager Elizabeth
Bielby. 'The integrated system now forces functions to communicate and
operate as a single unit, because if data is entered in one area it affects
others.'
There is also better communication with the computing department. 'Things
have changed dramatically,' Mrs Bielby says. 'The old systems were very much
owned by the IT department and remote from the people who created and used
the data. Today the users own and drive the systems. Indeed we want to move
the entering data as close as possible to the people who create it. For
example, at present information from the shop floor is entered from paper
forms by supervisors; we want to have real-time data entry by the people
actually doing the production work.'
This feeling of system ownership was created not least by the way the system
was introduced. SSA trained 50 users, who used this standard training to
develop a course geared precisely to Upjohn's needs. These people then
trained their colleagues, mainly on the job as different functions came into
use.
Upjohn has modified the standard product to its own needs. SSA has built
some of these changes into new releases to ensure that Upjohn has a package
which is as near to the standard as possible. Upjohn currently has 10 major
modifications outside the standard product but Mrs Bielby says she hopes
this will fall to three with the next release, due for installation in
October.
'The package argument is that you buy into the supplier's development work,
and we're working hard to contain the number of modifications,' Mrs Bielby
says. 'But the downside to taking a package is that you get the same as
everyone else. We would continue to modify the package if we felt we would
gain significant competitive advantage.'
An unusual benefit of using a package in the chemicals industry relates to
regulation. Processes have to be formally inspected by regulatory bodies;
computer systems are part of those processes. 'SSA has done a lot of
validation work on the package, so the inspectors simply check the company's
own documentation,' Mrs Bielby says. 'This means we don't have to validate
our own systems. In fact, the costs can be so great that this alone means it
is no longer cost-effective to develop our own systems. So the validation
costs of the package are spread among all the customers, just as the
development costs are. This has emerged as a major benefit.'
The new system and new way of working have had a big effect. Output is up by
a third, with 7 per cent fewer staff. Inventory supplies of 3.5 months
comfortably beat the target of 4.3 months - and continue to fall by 6 per
cent a year. Better information, especially forecasts, means better
negotiations with customers and suppliers and a tighter linking of demand to
manufacturing.
This is being extended across the international group: Upjohn is now looking
at using information technology to bring all operations together so that
chemical plants are geared precisely to the needs of product manufacturing.

A manufacturing software package installed by Energizer Rechargeable
Products has helped the company to get separate departments working together
as a single unit. The impact on quality and customer service has enabled it
to retain hesitant customers and gain new ones in a fiercely competitive
market.
Energizer makes batteries at a factory in Newcastle-under-Lyme,
Staffordshire. It has regional offices in the UK, France, Germany and Sweden
producing a European turnover of Dollars 40m. There are 120 staff.
In 1992 it replaced an old IBM System/36 business minicomputer running a
much amended package, with a PC network version of the Micross package from
UK company Kewill Systems. Energizer also considered packages for IBM AS/400
or Unix computers but found the PC product was a third of the price.
The company has adapted its own procedures to the package where necessary,
rather than change the system.
'By sticking to the standard package we get all the standard upgrades.
Previously a user would ask for a new feature and IT would write it. But
just because a user has an idea for a new facility, it doesn't mean that is
the right way for the company as a whole to go,' says Anthony Elliott,
European information systems manager.
A big operational benefit lies in the fact that data is entered just once,
Mr Elliott says. 'Everything is now done automatically from one entry. This
also reduces the margin for keying errors.'
Quality manager Bob Evans says the fact that managers and others are now
on-line to the same information has had a big impact. 'The easier flow and
access to information have helped managers understand the business better,'
he says.
Energizer has spent Pounds 85,000 on 45 networked Dell PCs and a file
processor, plus about Pounds 30,000 on Micross.
Return on this investment has not been measured but there has been a Dollars
100,000 annual saving merely from linking in the regional offices. These
offices used to contract out their accounting to local firms but it is now
all done centrally. In addition, the regional offices used to communicate
with the head office on paper, so they had little information about product
availability.
But the main benefits have been the intangibles resulting from the single
data entry and the access to information. 'We are a better run business now
and people understand what the business is all about,' Mr Evans says. 'We
have a far better view of the things that matter.'
Supplier profile Product: Micross, the UK's biggest selling manufacturing
control system, according to independent market research. Suppliers: Kewill
Systems.
Turnover: Pounds 31.8m in 1993-94. Employees: 175 in the UK, 370 worldwide.
Hardware: networked PCs. Users: 2,100. Price: from Pounds 10,000.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (21): Uncertainty slows
activity - Italy / David Lane says the outlook is increasingly optimistic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lean pickings rewarded the efforts of investment bankers and corporate
finance advisers operating in Italy's buy-out market during the three years
of recession from 1991 to 1993. Figures from KPMG Peat Marwick show that
only 15 MBOs and MBIs were concluded last year. While a slight improvement
on 1992, it was only one half the level of activity recorded in 1990.
'Last year was awful,' says Paolo Colonna of Schroder Associati, who sees
this year as one of transition. 'The economy is picking up, but the
corporate sector and banks still have problems. The low level of completed
buy-outs reflects this,' he says.
Others are more bullish. Dante Razzano, Morgan Grenfell's managing director,
believes that when the figures are extracted at the year-end, the total will
be reasonable. 'There is a lot of activity at the moment, albeit few
transactions are being closed.'
Stefano Tanzi at KPMG Peat Marwick, which studies buy-outs, is also
optimistic, noting that a dozen transactions were closed in the first half
of the year. 'There are numerous operations in the pipeline. We expect an
increase that could take the total as high as 25 this year,' says Mr Tanzi.
Uncertainty is putting a brake on action. Italian managers and company
owners are holding back on decisions until the political and financial
situation becomes clearer.
Many expected that the elections in March which led to a pro-business,
right-wing government would stimulate buy-out operations. However,
expectations of government decisiveness in matters such as privatisation and
the adjustment of public sector accounts, and of measures to encourage
innovative financial operations, have been disappointed.
While economic activity has picked up sharply in Italy this year, with
industrial production rising steeply and exports booming, significant
problems remain unresolved. The continuing large public sector deficit and
the enormous weight of accumulated public sector debt overhang the financial
system. There is concern that inflation has not been tamed. Interest rates
seem to be on a rising trend.
'The cost of money, now up to 12 per cent, is definitely a factor in making
managers think carefully before deciding on a buy-out. They ask themselves
about the direction and magnitude of future rate moves, and the answer is
most uncertain in the present situation,' remarks Mr Tanzi.
At the same time, the authorities are urging caution on banks whose
non-performing loans have risen significantly over the past three years.
Quality of lending has become an issue in bank boardrooms.
This may explain why there are funds looking for transactions. 'There is a
lot of willingness by serious lenders to provide money again,' notes Mr
Razzano. Mr Tanzi also says that large amounts of finance are available for
equity and debt.
The downward trend in the average debt-to-equity ratio in transactions is
possibly a factor in encouraging lenders. Protagonists in leveraged
operations have become more cautious about debt during the past four years,
and the debt-to-equity ratio is one half of the level recorded in 1990,
though KPMG Peat Marwick report that debt-to-equity ratios are significantly
above average in large transactions.
Does the availability of funds but few takers mean an absence of significant
opportunities in Italy? Investment bankers and corporate finance advisers do
not believe this is so. Schroder Associati's Mr Colonna says that
privatisation will continue to offer opportunities. 'Buy-outs will also
arise when large groups are restructured and in the process of
internationalisation,' he suggests.
At KPMG Peat Marwick, Mr Tanzi says that changes in the ownership of family
companies will bring many buy-out opportunities during the next decade.
Mr Razzano at Morgan Grenfell has a shorter time scale. 'Next year Italy's
buy-out scene will be very active,' he forecasts. All agree that pickings
should be fatter in the future.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (22): Landmark for
privatisation - Case study / Esaote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'This buy-out is based on expansion,' affirms Andrea Oberti, general manager
of Esaote, the Genoa-based medical equipment maker.
'Many buy-outs aim to produce results through restructuring and cuts. Esaote
intends to continue growing and this is underlined by the commitment to
maintaining annual research and development spending at more than 8 per cent
of turnover,' he adds.
Mr Oberti was one of four senior managers who helped set up Esaote in 1981
and who led the MBO operation that was finalised in July. It is probably
Italy's most significant transaction this year. With a L55bn (Dollars 36m)
price tag, it is substantial by Italian standards. But it is also a landmark
for privatisation in Italy, the seller being the Finmeccanica sub-holding of
the IRI state holding corporation.
Established as the Biomedical Division of the IRI-Finmeccanica Ansaldo
company, after sophisticated medical equipment had been identified as a
strategic growth sector, it made profits within three years. The
Montedison-Farmitalia subsidiary, Ote Biomedica, was acquired at the end of
1986 and Esaote formally established as a joint stock corporation in 1988.
'Our mission is to provide niche markets with leading-edge technology in
equipment offering high performance to price ratios,' says Mr Oberti.
Esaote is European leader in the production of ultrasound diagnostic
equipment. 'We have recently launched a magnetic resonance imaging system
dedicated to extremities of the body. This will allow the costs of scans to
be reduced by two thirds, an important selling point given the squeeze on
health service spending,' he says.
Revenues of L20bn from the magnetic resonance imaging system will help
Esaote reach an estimated L207bn sales this year, from L177bn in 1993. Net
pretax profits are expected to be L9bn, a healthy increase on L4bn in 1993
though still falling short of the L12bn and L14bn posted in 1992 and 1991 on
sales of L179bn and L161bn respectively.
Esaote has been a steady profit-earner. Why was it privatised? Carlo
Castellano, chairman and managing director, says: 'The medical equipment
sector was defined as unstrategic when the Amato government unveiled its
privatisation programme in July 1992.'
IRI-Finmeccanica appointed Wasserstein Perella as advisers in autumn 1992
and a trade sale was sought. But the trawl for potential buyers was
unsuccessful. 'None of the offers examined in February 1993 was
satisfactory. Some fell short on price, while others failed on operational
and industrial factors. So the privatisation was suspended. This was very
worrying. The suspension created uncertainty and was damaging for the
company's image,' says Mr Castellano.
The MBO began a year ago when Mr Castellano and three colleagues teamed up
with Sofipa, Mediocredito Centrale's merchant bank, which headed a group of
investors. A letter of intent was signed in January and the contract, which
became effective in July, followed in May.
'There were many difficulties. Italy seems impermeable to innovative
financial operations like MBOs. Corporate and fiscal aspects are complex,'
explains Mr Castellano.
With the transaction concluded, he and his three senior colleagues, and
Esaote's 20 other managers, hold a 10 per cent stake in the company's L30bn
equity. Sofipa has 21 per cent, Advent International 32 per cent, IPEF 17
per cent, Arca Merchant 16 per cent and Euroventures Italy 4 per cent.
Senior debt amounts to L25bn.
The next step will be a L1bn bond issue with warrants, planned for the
year-end. This will be open to all the company's employees, 520 in Italy and
a further 110 in other countries, thereby allowing full participation in the
privatisation operation. And for Esaote's financial investors the exit route
already seems clearly signposted.
'Stock market quotation is the aim,' says Mr Castellano.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (10): Starting off
on the right foot - Forward planning / Claire Gooding recounts user
experiences with a business planning tool which helps lay the foundation for
profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone contemplating setting up a new business has plenty to think about:
accounts usually come later. But business planning is an essential part of
starting up, and the process of fixing budgets, prices, and estimating the
cost of raw materials, services, and overheads, will eventually filter
through to profit and loss accounts.
Business Architect, a product recently launched in the UK, is a PC-based
pre-planning tool that provides the analytical power which so many users say
they want from their accounts software.
'Business Architect is not an accounting system as such, but it leads you
through the process of setting up a business plan,' says Rory Anderson, a
managing partner in Dunn and Crome, based in Lowestoft, Suffolk, a family
firm of solicitors. He is involved in the launch of a new company being set
up by a client who has invented an innovative building product.
'Our practice wanted to move away from traditional legal fields and go back
to its roots as men of business,' he explains. He is producing his own
packaged service for small businesses and specialises in new ventures. The
new product he is helping to launch provides an effective way of fixing
plasterboard to ceilings.
'There's a huge potential, because it is relevant to 90 per cent of new
dwellings or refurbishments, not just in the UK, but in Europe and
internationally. We used Business Architect to put together a 15-page
financial business plan for the product.'
Business Architect helped him set up on an IBM PC the necessary accounts,
trial balance, profit and loss accounts, balance sheets and cash flow for
the new company. This job is usually left to management accountants,
especially when seeking capital from outside sources. The process helped him
to work through some of the projected figures for income, and realise that
the projected losses in the first year would continue for the next few years
with the pricing structure as it was.
'The client was cautious about new sales, but even so it was clear that the
price was fixed too low. The new product needs less skill than the existing
methods, and it's cheaper and better, so the balancing act was to make it no
more expensive than traditional products. We simply played until we got the
lowest possible pricing at which a profit could be made.'
Mr Anderson believes that life is too short to waste time learning how to
use software, and says he taught himself to use the package in about five
minutes. 'I've got really excited at what it can do.'
Another keen user of Business Architect is Peter Cross, managing director of
Leatherhead-based Computer Turnkey, which specialises in
internationally-used software packages for the insurance and re-insurance
industry.
As for any software developer, balancing resources available to support
existing software products and those needed to develop new ones is a fine
art. When deciding to launch a new version of its package for an
international market, Mr Cross decided to treat it as a separate enterprise
which would not take funds from existing core business.
'It helped clarify a number of factors in the marketplace, such as the
volume of sales to international outlets, the effort needed to support
existing activities, and the amount of additional finance we would need,'
says Mr Cross.
'It's more than a series of linked spreadsheets, it's about elements in the
business plan. Once it is set up, it can be used for 'what-if' games.
There's a lot of text, for example, on qualifying sales leads, assessing
expenses and so on. It was a good starting point from which to plan a new
project, but as an established company, it would be even better to pick up
real live accounting data for the planning model.'

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (11): Speed is
essential - Ease of use for small businesses / Claire Gooding finds that
moving rapidly from pub to pub poses accounting problems for Adams Inns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A small family business run from home, Adams Inns specialises in being a
'locum' for the pub trade. The quick turnover of pubs brings some specific
accounting problems.
Adams specialises in running pubs, most of them from the Tetley Brewery,
taking over the administration between long-term tenants. One of its tasks
as a 'locum' is often to build up the trade of a pub that has become run
down or neglected, although it also runs two long-term leases at present.
Its tally of pubs fluctuates - it currently has six - and for every pub it
takes on, it has to set up accounting details and administration, providing
full accounts when it hands it back to the brewery or on to new tenants.
In a constant state of data take-on, there are few software products that
would not present headaches.
'We have to be able to set up very rapidly. We looked at Pegasus Opera, and
found it very powerful, but a lot of these packages need a PhD to run them,'
says Ian Napier, development manager of Adams Inns. 'We found it was taking
two days to set up the nominals for each individual cost centre.'
A chance encounter with the managing director of a software house led to led
to a free trial of a package called WinAccs. Mr Napier had previously used
the WinBuild property development accounting package from the same stable,
FCG, and was delighted to find the same ease of use in its general-purpose
offshoot, WinAccs, using Windows.
'With WinAccs it takes 15 seconds to set up the nominals. We didn't need
training because of the incredibly friendly front end. We bought the package
and had the entire lot loaded in two days,' Mr Napier explains. Once the
coding structure was set up using an external consultant, Adams had a
'skeleton' that could be applied to every pub. The reporting structures were
also tailored to provide the required management information.
With WinAccs Mr Napier found an easy solution to the problem of folio
numbers for tracking invoices, (which would have needed a costly Pounds
2,500 conversion on the previous package), and also found a speedy response
from FCG when he had a printer problem - the kind that dogs all SoHo (small
office home office) sites. 'It took two calls, one to report it, one to fix
it.
'One of the best things about FCG is its fantastic support. You can talk
straight to the developers if you need to, but we've had no reliability
problems. Upgrades arrive like clockwork, and they are easy to install.
'If there are any disadvantages, it is that because it is so invitingly easy
to use, we made some mistakes in the initial analysis of the sub-schedules.
We should have had a professional accountant in earlier, to help us set up
some of the postings and allocations.'
Adams is now an enthusiastic user of the FCG integrated modules for payroll
and job costing, all run on one Fujistu 486 PC (with optical drive), which
also supports another home-based business. The total cost of all the
software modules was Pounds 700, a special trade-in price for Pegasus Opera,
plus a year's maintenance.
Supplier profile Product: WinAccs, launched in 1988, is a Windows-based
accounting system for the provision of financial information to small
companies.
The package is integrated with a Windows-based payroll package, WinPay, and
software for job costing.
Suppliers: FCG Computer Systems is a privately owned UK company founded in
1975 to provide software products for the construction industry, and claims
to be the first in the world to have developed an accounting package under
Windows.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (18): Awash with cash again -
US / Richard Waters on the wave of new investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US buy-out industry is awash with cash again. Back in the late 1980s,
the Dollars 8bn-10bn a year that flowed into private buy-out partnerships
provided the springboard for some of the decade's biggest acquisitions: by
using debt to gear up their equity tenfold in some cases, the LBO funds
became a power in the land.
Today, leveraged acquisitions may not be as leveraged as they were (a recipe
of three or four parts debt to one part equity is more the norm). But the
equity base of the buy-out industry is getting back to the levels of the
1980s.
After Dollars 7.2bn in 1993, acquisition funds raised Dollars 5.7bn in the
first half of this year, according to Private Equity Analyst, a newsletter
based in Wellesley, Mass. The tide of cash seems well on its way to matching
record levels.
This wave of new investment in the buy-out industry is being driven by
supply, not demand. While the opportunities for large-scale deals are still
relatively few and far between, there is no shortage of institutions looking
to back them.
In the main, the suppliers of cash to private equity partnerships have been
US pension funds, lured by the chance to make investment returns well in
excess of those available in public markets.
Over the past two decades, leveraged buy-out funds are estimated on average
to have made compound annual returns for their investors of some 25 per cent
(after management fees.)
Those fund sponsors who came through the upheavals of the 1980s and early
1990s with their records (and reputations) intact are well placed to benefit
now.
Investment returns in the future are unlikely to be as high, though. The
lower levels of leverage reduce both the financial risks and rewards of
buy-outs.
The demand side of the equation has yet to match the supply.
Several big-name sponsors who put together new investment partnerships last
year have yet to put any of the money to work.
In part, that has been due to the high level of activity in the public
equity markets. With the stock market putting a historically high valuation
on many companies, anyone looking to dispose of a business has tended to do
so either through the initial public offering (IPO) market, or by selling to
another company which can issue equity at a high earnings multiple to pay
for the acquisition.
Those big buy-outs that have been done this year have tended to involve the
sale by large corporations of businesses they no longer consider to be
central to their operations. Often, these companies are also looking to
raise cash.
One of the most active buy-out funds recently, New York-based Clayton
Dubilier &amp; Rice, has rung up a list of such transactions, buying businesses
from ailing corporate giants like General Motors and Westinghouse Electric.
'We concentrate on buying properties from corporations,' says Richard
Braddock, a Clayton Dubilier partner and former president of Citicorp.
Competition for these deals does not come from the public equity markets, he
says: 'The people we find ourselves in competition with are corporate
buyers.'
This year's small handful of Dollars 1bn-plus deals have followed this
pattern, including the sale by General Motors of its car rental business and
the disposal by Kmart of PayLess, a drugs store chain.
Jonathan Sockaloff, a general partner of Leonard Green &amp; Partners, the Los
Angeles-based buy-out firm which handled the PayLess deal, says: 'It was a
classic case of a large company having to concentrate on its core business,
and having to raise cash through the sale of non-core businesses.'
There are several reasons to expect the level of buy-out activity to rebound
further in the coming months.
For a start, higher US interest rates are likely to help the buy-out market
more than hinder it. They help by taking the shine off the public equity
markets, reducing the options available for selling a company: the IPO
market has wound down as interest rates have ratcheted up. As yet, though,
equity prices have not dropped to the sort of bargain levels that tempt
buy-out funds back into the market in force. Says Mr Braddock: 'The prices
today are still generally quite high.'
Higher rates also hinder deals, of course, by raising the cost of borrowing.
But the lower levels of leverage make this less of a problem  - and most
buy-outs are tested against higher interest rate assumptions (though a much
bigger spike in rates than has yet been seen would pose more of a
challenge).
'You have to adjust the interest rate structure to the reality of the
interest rate market you are in,' says Mr Sockaloff.
'We can achieve our required rates of return in this interest rate
environment, or even a higher interest rate environment,' Mr Sockaloff
continues.
Another reason to expect a rebound in buy-outs is simply the amount of cash
available. With the war chests full, there is an army of deal sponsors
scouting for transactions.
There is also plenty of debt finance available to back these deals.
Commercial banks, which largely abandoned leveraged deals in the early
1990s, are back in force, seeing this as one of the most profitable areas in
which to put their excess capital to use.
The bank debt has in part plugged the gap left by a scarcity of high-yield
(or junk) bond finance. Last year, high-yield mutual funds provided the bond
market with ample funds to back acqui-sitions. Now, personal investors'
mistrust of bond funds generally has carried over into the high yield area,
halting the flow of new cash.
As the late 1980s demonstrated, when there is cash available, the deals
follow. Whether that means that buy-outs will again become as big, leveraged
and aggressive remains to be seen.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (20): Intriguing success
stories - France / A relative lack of activity but the future looks good
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market for management buy-outs has generated some intriguing success
stories in France over the past few years: a radio station with the slogan
'all the pops and none of the flops'; a rubber boots business; and a company
providing artificial insemination for animals, to name just three of the
more bizarre.
But perhaps more significant than the quirky nature of any of the particular
examples is the fact that those involved in the sector can quickly call to
mind all the transactions that have taken place. One of the reasons is the
relative lack of activity in France.
Compared to the UK and the US, France has a long way to go to catch up.
Edmund Truell, managing director of Hambro European Ventures, says: 'We have
done four transactions in the last two years.' That is a figure of which he
claims to be proud in a division which only expects to carry out three or
four across Europe each year. 'The market is under-developed.
'We find France a good market to operate in compared with the southern parts
of Europe,' he says. 'It has relatively clear-cut legal, accounting, tax and
other information requirements and a strong code of conduct. You can resort
to the courts if you need.'
However, he also says: 'The standard of confidentiality is lower than in the
UK. Everyone knows about your deal before you do.' He adds that it is
important to use 'political savvy' and work close with local French
partners. 'The attitude of 'the Brits are here, get out of the way' does not
go down well.'
Mr Truell says the bulk of the transactions in France of which he has
experience are an amalgam - with the owners wanting to expand capital and
strengthen management. 'They are very rarely simply management-led
acquisitions,' he says. 'They normally leave the existing owners with a
significant stake. It gives them two bites of the cherry and avoids a too
lengthy debate about value.'
'The French market is very much smaller than the UK,' says George Elliston,
a partner of Domino, a Paris-based corporate finance boutique. 'The culture
is just not there to go in to companies to talk about financial leverage. At
some stage you need to have a management taking the initiative by coming to
you saying we want to do an MBO. It just doesn't seem to happen.'
Arnaud Limal, managing director of Schroeders in Paris, says: 'There has
certainly been a tightening of credit. The financial conditions are a lot
tighter than in the UK. It has been less part of the culture to consider
buy-outs from companies.'
That is not the complete story, of course. Ciclad, a French company, is
raising FFr300m (Dollars 59m) for a new fund which will invest in MBOs.
Created in 1988 with supporters including IDI, a development capital company
which was itself an MBO from a government agency, it has invested in some 40
others.
Thierry Thomann, one of the partners, stresses that leverage is much less
important in French buy-outs. 'We don't have lots of asset stripping,' he
says. 'We invest development capital and are active partners in companies.'
But he concedes, too, that 'we started rather later in France than in the
UK'. He says there is now a 'real market of managers who want to buy their
companies and don't just want to be employees'.
But he adds that this has only started to come to fruition, where a few
years ago the idea of a family company selling out was considered as a
failure.
One of the traditional problems for the growth of MBOs in France is that the
law prevents bankers securing their loans against the assets of the target
company.
They must instead rely on cash flow from the holding company making the
acquisition. That can act as a disincentive to potential financiers.
However, Jean Bereget, head of acquisition finance for Paribas, defends this
system. 'What's the use of choking a company if the financial side doesn't
go well?' he says. 'If there is a fruit tree that has been producing a good
crop for 60 years, we want to be reimbursed from the fruits, not by burning
the tree or cutting it down to make planks for furniture. This system
preserves the operating side of the company where otherwise there could be a
financial temptation to cut it down.'
For critics of the current French system, however, the law makes the merging
of holding and target companies more difficult than some other
jurisdictions. This can have important tax implications and make the process
of consolidating the two cumbersome.
In addition, the disappointing performance of the French stock market -
especially in the past two years - has made the exit route through quotation
less easy than in other countries. 'It has been difficult to exit, and a lot
of funds have not been able to turn their position around,' says Mr Limal.
All this is clearly beginning to change. The classic tale told by corporate
finance advisers is of a market bulging with potential MBOs.
France is particularly well endowed with a small- and medium-sized business
sector (the 'PME' or petit et moyen enterprise) of profitable,
privately-held companies.
Many were founded after the second world war, and their creators are now
reaching retirement age. Lack of interest by their children - or a
reluctance to deal with such a succession process - means that there is
suddenly enormous scope for managers or employees to buy out the company
from its original owners.
'I think you can expect growth in MBOs in France,' says Frederick de
Broglie, managing director of 3i France, the venture capital company. 'It's
a question of culture. There is an awareness by subsidiaries now that MBOs
are a way of becoming rich and becoming your own boss.'
There are really exciting prospects for companies in the FFr200-300m range,'
says Hambro's Mr Truell. 'I am optimistic. There are relatively few people
doing MBO advisory work in France - and long may it continue]'

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (19): Concept slow to catch on
 -Germany / Andrew Fisher on the uphill struggle for institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Persuading owners of German companies to part with control so that managers
can purchase a shareholding and take over has been an uphill struggle for
banks and finance houses keen to promote management buy-outs.
Until recently, the concept of the buy-out (and the buy-in) made slow
progress in a country which puts industrial performance far ahead of
financial innovation. But MBOs are steadily gaining ground, even though they
are never likely to be as commonly accepted as in the UK or the US.
One reason is the lack of so-called exit possibilities. Because of the slow
pace of new issues on the German stock market and the reluctance of many
companies to go through the listing process, it is hard for those financing
MBOs to make a profit through share flotations. 'It's a real shortcoming for
the German financial scene that it still has an underdeveloped stock
market,' says Thomas Schlytter-Henrichsen, head of 3i Deutschland.
On the transaction side, however, the trend has certainly become more
buoyant. 'A lot has happened in the past few years,' says Thomas Krenz of
Schroders and Partner in Germany, part of Schroder Ventures of the UK.
'Compared with 1989 or 1990, the market has become much stronger and more
active.'
Not only have German banks dropped their initial scepticism over this form
of financing, but there are also now more foreign institutions with
promising deals available, such as Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank.
'The market will get better in the long term,' adds Mr Krenz, 'but I don't
think a buy-out culture will develop as it has done in the UK.'
Also encouraged by recent trends, but more positive about the outlook in
coming years, is Mr Schlytter-Henrichsen. 'This year, 3i has had its best
result in Germany so far,' he says. In the first 10 months of 1994, 3i (part
of the 3i group of the UK) has carried out 14 buy-outs compared with nine in
the same period of last year. Next year, he expects 3i to do more deals and
forecasts the total number of MBO deals will expand by some 30 per cent
annually over the longer term.
The 3i deals cover companies with turnover ranging between DM15m and DM260m,
the value of the transactions being from DM10m to DM120m. 'Businessmen are
seeing that management buy-outs and buy-ins are quite normal now and a
normal part of the mergers and acquisitions market. Now, they don't simply
say they will sell to another company.' More companies are now coming to 3i
on their own initiative - 'the word has got around that MBOs can be an
attractive solution'.
Along with this greater readiness to consider the idea has come more
openness about letting deals be known. 'Previously, the problem was that
companies did not want to have them publicised,' adds Mr
Schlytter-Henrichsen. 'This year, we've done a lot of very, very interesting
transactions and some of the companies want them publicised.'
This gradual dropping by sellers of their reticence to let the rest of the
community know what price they had obtained for their businesses can only
help spread the MBO message. Among the buy-outs handled by 3i this year are:
Offset Gerhard Kaiser, a high-quality printing concern with turnover of
DM65m; Passport-Modevertrieb, a fashion house with DM75m turnover; and Ama
Holding (furniture) with DM20m.
3i has also just concluded a deal involving a much bigger company - based in
Bavaria, with turnover of DM260m - about which it can give no details,
except that it is a world market leader in its area of manufacturing and
highly profitable. 3i's most recent deal led to the formation of Brahms
Diagnostika, the former diagnostic services division in Germany (with DM42m
turnover) of Dow Chemical of the US.
Although several institutions have pulled out of the German MBO market after
entering with high hopes, Mr Schlytter-Henrichsen says others have come in.
One of the best-established is Schroders which led one of Germany's biggest
buy-outs, that of Ex-Cell-O, the machinery company, in 1987.
This year, it has carried out another sizable buy-out, that of the
all-terrain vehicle company of the Kassbohrer group. That deal was one of
the five biggest MBOs to have occurred in Germany to date, says Mr Krenz.
The company has a turnover of DM170m and is very profitable. Schroders has
done four deals this year, the others involving companies in the automotive,
fireproof tiling and paint equipment sectors.
Now that the recession in Germany has ended, more companies are coming back
into the market, adds Mr Krenz. They are looking to offload subsidiaries
that are not central to their activities but which are now in better
financial shape to sell than a year or so ago. Also, the imminent 7.5 per
cent solidarity tax surcharge (to help pay for German unification costs) is
prompting owners to try and sell their businesses before this comes into
effect next year.
The German MBO total for 1994 should exceed 60 deals compared with around 50
in 1993, Mr Schlytter-Henrichsen reckons. In the absence of exit
possibilities through the stock market, the main method of cashing in on
successful MBOs is by trade sales to other companies. Susan Deacon,
assistant director of Morgan Grenfell Development Capital in the UK, says
the existence of a more developed stock market would help the MBO scene. 'We
are very conscious with German buy-outs that exits are not easy.'
So far, Morgan Grenfell has not transacted any German MBOs, but it is
looking hard for the right deals. Its powerful parent, Deutsche Bank,
invested in its previous buy-out fund and is putting Pounds 30m (next to
Morgan Grenfell's pounds Pounds 70m) into its latest Pounds 300m fund. Of
that total, around a quarter will go into western European buy-outs, mainly
French and German.
The entrepreneurs are there, she says. It is just that the right deals take
time to find. That is a problem with which Morgan Grenfell's competitors are
all too familiar.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (17): Scottish house expands -
Regional fund / Murray Johnstone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the management buy-out of Ferranti Technologies entered its final stages
last week, it marked yet another step in the emergence of the Scottish
finance house Murray Johnstone in English venture capital markets.
The question is why Murray Johnstone was once again leading a significant,
high profile deal - this time with Pounds 1m of equity - to secure more than
300 jobs at the old Cairo Mill in Oldham. The company makes electronic
equipment and highly specialised gyroscopes for the defence industry.
The risk is small compared with the Pounds 11m of equity capital put into
the management and employee buy-out of Greater Manchester Buses North
earlier this year, but the Ferranti deal is typical of what the fund manager
is up to.
Scotland, however, has little to do with it. Success is emanating from
Manchester, where the Glasgow-based Murray Johnstone decided in 1988 to open
an office. It was bidding to manage Ventures North West, a Pounds 20m
regional fund backed by the Pounds 2.5bn of superannuation monies of the 10
Greater Manchester local authorities, the police and similar regionwide
bodies.
Jonathan Diggines, then a 35-year-old Manchester solicitor who had impressed
when acting for corporate clients, was head-hunted to take charge. Murray
Johnstone won the beauty parade to run Ventures North West but it soon
became clear that the arrangement was likely to offer something more than an
average-sized regional fund could offer.
It piggy-backed into northern England access to Pounds 200m of funds managed
by Murray Johnstone generally. This has made a decisive impact on the way Mr
Diggines and two other Manchester-based investment managers have been able
to operate.
No regional fund invests more than 10 per cent of its pot in any one
venture, and most would regard 5 per cent as the prudent upper limit. This
limits the scope for driving deals, confining many regional players to
playing second fiddle in syndicates.
Mr Diggines, however, has been able to take the lead with a freedom denied
to many of his counterparts. The result is that Ventures North West's Pounds
20m fund is almost fully invested in 23 companies, but Murray Johnstone has
been able to do another Pounds 130m of deals out of Manchester, involving 25
companies in all.
For example, the buses buy-out received about Pounds 1m of equity backing
from Ventures North West, but nearly Pounds 10m from Murray Johnstone. Local
knowledge - the prerequisite of a good local deal - was available in
abundance, so no great selling job had to be done to pull in outside
firepower.
Mr Diggines is now in charge of Murray Johnstone's London office as well as
Manchester, with a remit to repeat in the south-east and south what he and
his colleagues have done in the north. He sits on the Murray Johnstone board
and on the investment committee which makes its decisions by teleconference
every Wednesday. In Manchester, his investment managers are accountants, but
they will be joined by a merchant banker shortly.
He thinks small teams and decisiveness have been important in Murray
Johnstone's emergence. It is policy to say 'no' quickly so as to make as
much resource available as possible for speeding 'yes' decisions. 'But if
you say yes, you have got to mean it, and not be half-hearted,' he says.
Murray Johnstone believes it is now second in UK regional markets to 3i,
which has a 50 per cent share. Unlike 3i, it always adopts a hands-on
approach, taking a seat on the board of investee companies.
Mr Diggines also believes Manchester's financial and professional network
has been important, enabling many deals to be brokered and syndicated in the
northern capital's 'square half-mile' - the city centre area peopled by
lawyers, fund managers, accountants and the like.
The key, however, is access to substantial funds and to the ability to
commit them. Something more than a representative office is required. In its
Manchester set-up, Murray Johnstone appears to have discovered an ideal
approach. Some London-based funds are already trying to copy it in the
regions. If Murray Johnstone can repeat its Manchester success in the south
and south-east, the gauntlet will really be down.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (16): Good time to hunt for
bargains - Investment trust / David Wighton looks at Legal &amp; General's
latest idea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With venture capitalists sitting on more funds for buy-outs than there are
buy-outs to fund, managers are coming up with some ingenious ideas to
increase their share of the action.
Legal &amp; General Ventures' latest notion is an investment trust which will
invest primarily in companies recently floated by management buy-out and
buy-in teams.
Charles Peal, managing director, admits that one of the main aims behind the
trust is to support the company's own buy-out funds.
He hopes that buy-outs will be keener to bring Legal &amp; General Ventures in
on the original deal if they think that the new trust will take shares in
the eventual flotation - the very time when other venture capitalists want
to exit.
'In this respect the concept is similar to Mithras Investment Trust, the
first investment trust in the UK to specialise in mezzanine loans which we
formed earlier this year.'
The new trust will reserve up to 25 per cent of its assets for unquoted
investment in buy-outs and buy-ins. This should ensure that it can take a
full allocation of new issues which other fund managers may find are
oversubscribed. It will also give it the benefit of knowing the buy-out for
some time before making its decision on flotation. And with luck the
unquoted portfolio should also deliver a useful boost to the trust's overall
performance.
However, this will depend mainly on the progress of the flotations. And
recent experience of buy-out new issues is not encouraging.
The past few months have brought several disappointments and spectacular
flops. Shares in Aerostructures Hamble and McDonnell Information Systems
have tumbled after profit warnings issued very shortly after their
flotations.
They seemed to confirm the widely-held view that buy-out/buy-ins should be
treated with even more caution than other flotations. According to this
argument venture capitalists are only interested in getting as high a price
as possible on flotation and managements are only too happy to go along with
them if the size of their own stake is dependent on the price. Critics also
point to the danger that highly geared buy-out companies have been starved
of capital to invest in the business, reducing future growth prospects.
However, while these arguments might seem plausible, there is little
evidence to suggest that buy-outs underperform after flotation. Indeed, the
studies that have been done tend to show the opposite.
Last year stockbrokers James Capel constructed an index of all buy-outs with
a market capitalisation of more than Pounds 40m starting at the beginning of
1986. The companies were removed from the index three years after flotation
on the grounds that, after a time, their characteristics become more typical
of a quoted company than of a buy-out.
The index, which included 32 companies, outperformed the the FT-SE All-Share
index almost fourfold in the eight years to September 1993. Capel has
recently updated the research and the results for the past year are not
quite so impressive since many of the companies that came to market in early
1994 were overpriced. But buy-out flotations overall have still outperformed
their stock market sectors.
Work by SG Warburg Securities has reached similar conclusions and older
studies in the US also support the case. Mr Peal believes the results are
not surprising. 'The success of these ex-buy-outs and ex-buy-ins is
attributed to the motivation of the management, whose personal fortunes were
made as founding shareholders in the original buy-out or buy-in.' He points
out that most managements retain the bulk of their shareholdings after
flotation giving them every incentive to make the company perform. He also
believes that the disciplines imposed by venture capitalists are healthy.
'Under venture capital control managements are obsessed with profits and
cash flow rather than turnover and market share.'
Former buy-outs tend to be highly focused and lean companies with good
managements. Weak managers usually do not survive the weight of the buy-out
structure and the scrutiny of the venture capital backers.
Many buy-outs have been extremely successful after flotation such as Hays,
Compass, Trinity and Fairey. Moreover several that blotted their copybooks
shortly after flotation, like Holliday Chemicals and Kenwood, have since
recovered fully.
The market is now so nervous about buy-out flotations that go wrong that Mr
Peal believes share prices over-react on the merest hint of bad news.
Regarding these as buying opportunities the trust has invested in a number
of the recent casualties.
Formed in 1986 as Group Development Capital Trust, it had decided to
liquidate itself in the middle of this year when Legal &amp; General, the
largest shareholder with 26 per cent, proposed taking over as manager and
changing the investment policy. It has just raised Pounds 18m from a share
issue, taking its total value to more than Pounds 30m, with Legal &amp; General
increasing its stake to 49 per cent.
The new trust aims to pick the top 25 per cent of all the former buy-outs
and buy-ins that have come to the market since the beginning of 1990. There
have been more than 60 above its minimum flotation size of Pounds 25m with a
total value of Pounds 5bn.
On top of a core portfolio of around 15 stocks the trust will aim to invest
in about one in four of all new former buy-out flotations.
The objective of the new investment policy is to generate a total return in
excess of the FT-SE All-Share index. If it can achieve this after three
years or more then its directors and managers qualify for a 5 per cent
option package. The options are exercisable between years three and seven
only if the All-Share hurdle has been exceeded by 1.25 per cent a year
compound.
The trust has attracted a heavyweight chairman in the form of Lord Sheppard,
chairman and chief executive of Grand Metropolitan, who has considerable
experience of buy-outs from all angles.
The trust has timed its rebirth pretty well. Not only are several of the
recent buy-out flops trading at very depressed levels the disasters have
made investors extremely cautious about new buy-out flotations driving
prices down. Mr Peal is not the only one who believes that now is a good
time to hunt for bargains.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (15): What do they mean by
that? - The management buy-out specialists speak a jargon that is peculiar
to its industry but impenetrable to the outsider. Richard Gourlay offers a
helping hand to management teams seeking membership to the club
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Bimbo: a deal involving existing managers with outsiders who have brought
the deal to venture capitalists or who are brought in by the financiers. It
stands for buy-in/management buy-out. An option increasingly favoured by
venture backers.
Bought deal: When a deal-maker provides all the finance for a buy-out deal,
and then sells on or syndicates part of the funding to other investors
later. Done by the larger providers of finance when speed is important for
the deal to succeed.
Bridge financing: short-term funding provided when a company is about to
raise a new round of equity, or is about to go public.
Caps, collars and cylinders: clauses in buy-out deals which limit the extent
to which the interest rate charged on borrowed funds can rise or fall. They
act as a safeguard against borrowing costs rising to the point where the
company's cash flow is stretched too far.
Deal flow: the rate at which investment propositions come to the deal-maker
or financier. It is difficult to find any financiers who have anything but a
'very good deal flow at the moment'. The real test is the number of deals
that deserve finance.
Development capital: finance supplied to established companies which are
profitable or nearly profitable and require capital to develop further,
probably to a stage where they will be able to provide a flotation or other
exit for their investors.
Due diligence: detailed analysis and appraisal of the background of the
entrepreneur and his business plan, often carried out in conjunction with
accounting firms.
Earn out: either a formula for relating the final purchase price of a
company to actual future earnings, or a means of encouraging management to
perform by payment on the basis of future performance.
Employee buy-out: a deal involving a large proportion of employees in an
organisation as well as its management.
Employee share ownership plan (Esop): a trust which is established to
acquire shares in a company for subsequent allocation to employees over a
number of years.
Exit: the point at which the financier sells his holding in the buy-out
company, either through a trade sale to a larger company, by the management
buying out the other investors to assume complete control, or by a
flotation.
Gearing, or leverage: the ratio of debt to equity in a company's capital
structure. Intermediate forms of capital, such as redeemable preference
shares and convertible loans, are generally regarded as debt for gearing
purposes, though they very quickly look like equity if the business goes
wrong.
Hands on/hands off: the degree to which an investor in a buy-out becomes
involved in its management. A hands-on investor would normally nominate a
non-executive director to the board. Hands-off investors would have little
involvement. Internal rate of return (IRR): different investors calculate
this in different ways, but the term generally refers to annual compound
rate of return to the investor over a given period. Returns normally include
dividend distributions and profits from either disposals or a fair valuation
of the buy-out company. Used as targets for investors, actual rates of
return usually fall wildly short or greatly exceed initial projections.
Junior debt: unsecured loans which rank after secured or senior debt for
repayment in the event of a default (see senior debt).
Junk bonds: high yielding, unsecured debt used in US buy-outs. In the form
of a bond certificate, junk can be bought and sold more easily than the
mezzanine loans used to finance UK buy-outs.
Lead investor: venture capitalist (VC) that won the mandate for the deal and
leads any large syndication. The lead investor does not necessarily take the
largest stake.
Lemons and plums: Bad deals and good. A retrospective assessment - no deal
ever started as anything but a plum.
Leveraged buy-out: similar to a management buy-out, though usually applied
to US deals where the transaction will have been initiated by a financial
group rather than by management. Increasingly deals are initiated in the UK
by financiers.
Living dead: a VC-backed business that is neither dead on its feet nor going
anywhere very fast. The backers are usually locked in with no exit and
little option but to watch the actual IRRs sink. Tend not to make it into
VC's corporate brochures.
Lock-out agreement: an agreement to give the buy-out team time to negotiate
the purchase of their company free of pressure from other bidders.
Management buy-in: an offshoot of the MBO industry. The purchase of a
business by one or more outside managers with the help of a group of
financial backers. Pure buy-ins are often riskier than pure buy-outs,
because they involve outside management, but buy-ins, management buy-outs
(Bimbos), are increasingly popular.
Management buy-out: the purchase of a business by its management with the
help of financial backers. The managers put up a relatively small amount of
the finance but gain a disproportionately large share of the equity.
Mezzanine finance: loans, usually unsecured, which rank after secured or
senior debt but before equity in the event of the company failing. To
compensate for the greater risk, they typically carry interest one to three
percentage points above secured loans, and an equity 'kicker' to give the
lender a stake in the equity.
Preferred ordinary shares: refers to the ordinary shares taken up by outside
investors in a buy-out. They rank ahead of the plain ordinary shares owned
by management in terms of dividends and the pay-out in the event of a
winding-up.
Ratchet: an incentive arrangement whereby managers get a bigger share of the
equity if the venture performs well. These can work the other way, with
managers' shares of the equity disappearing towards the venture backers.
Second-round financing: sometimes needed to help buy-outs which have run
short of funds. Usually leave the company in a weak negotiating position.
Senior debt: secured debt which ranks first in terms of repayments in the
event of a default (see also junior debt).
Syndicated investment: an investment which is too large and risky to be
handled by one investor and which needs to be shared among several partners.
Vendor finance: finance provided by the vendor in the form of either a
deferred payment or a retained minority stake in the bought-out company.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (8): Broad range of
entries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of entries rose once again in the fourth year of the Business
Software Challenge '90s design competition for higher education students.
This time the judges were challenged even in deciding on a shortlist from
among such widely differing projects.
Sponsored and funded by Computer Associates, with Pounds 20,000 worth of
cash, hardware and software prizes, Business Software Challenge '90s is
supported by FT Software At Work, the British Computer Society, the
Institute of Management and Coopers and Lybrand.
The projects described (in no particular order) are taken from the shortlist
of eight that provided the eventual winners in two categories:
Overall Winner and
Best Business Solution.
Judges had to bear in mind the wide differences between the authors of the
submissions. These ranged from teams of HND students, (who had sometimes
produced a prototype system within a short deadline) to highly specialised
entries from individual postgraduate and PhD students.
The panel also used a broad definition of 'business solution', allowing any
well-defined problem well-researched, analysed and resolved to qualify, even
if it did not have widespread commercial potential.
Some had a broad 'horizontal application' for almost any business,
(Brainbox, Word-of-Mouth), whereas others were tightly-focused on a specific
business area, or even a specific user-company.
Nevertheless, as in 1993, the commercial potential of some of the systems
was obvious and a few of the entries produced professional documentation.
Some of them even presented some live implementations.
Information about the winners and next year's entries: contact the
Competition Secretary, Business Software Challenge '90s, PO Box 2ER, London

Brainbox
Written by: Peter Smee of the Open University
Aimed at: individual users who wish to organise their ideas on-screen
Runs on: IBM compatible PCs (486) under Microsoft Windows 3.1, written in
Visual Basic 3.0
Professional
'Mental scaffolding' was the phrase the author himself used to describe the
process created by his program, Brainbox.
The system organised and collated ideas, depicting them on the screen in a
series of boxes or 'connective maps'.
Its target audience could be almost anybody, doing anything from writing an
essay to formulating a marketing campaign.
The screen used drop-down 'sheets' of ideas to prompt users to rank ideas
and topics in order of importance, and rate them - something that was
actually easier to do on the computer than by using the traditional
'card-shuffling' exercise with slips of paper.
Using a computer might legitimise this simple but effective way of
organising ideas, argued the author. The success of at least two well-known
commercial products in the same area suggests that he may be right.
Marketing is already under way and well-produced documentation was part of
the demonstration.

Scrapcutter- product-based optimisation
Written by: Glynn Timmins of Aston University
Aimed at: A company specialising in manufacturing metal safe-access
equipment
Runs on: IBM compatible PCs (486) under Microsoft Windows 3.1, written in
Visual Basic
3.0 Professional
Where there is scrap, there is money being wasted. This product was written
in order to save money on material and optimise the process of cutting
specified lengths from fixed-length raw material.
Clever use of the screen-space showed the pattern being cut, and allowed the
user to define and store it to create the basis of a 'materials database'
that would eventually link up with other systems in order to carry out stock
control and job estimation.
The idea came to the author while working on industrial placement, and the
system has already proved its worth in saving manufacturing costs in a live
implementation. Users appreciated the ability to design and store
custom-sheets, and create automatic orders.
While other similar products exist, this one won a place on the shortlist
because of the flexibility built into the PC-based design, and the creative
use of the screen, which made it easy to follow the process.
As his product is well-established in its beta-test site, the author hopes
to interest other potential users.

Hydroponics Controller
Written by: Stephen Armitage, Peter Collins, Kevin Hatcher, Will Halsall,
Ian Wilson of the Farnborough College of Technology
Aimed at: Market gardeners and greenhouse
nurseries
Runs on: IBM PC 386 or compatible under MS-DOS 5.0, written in Microsoft
Windows, C and
C++ Version 7
Nursery growers and greenhouses are always racing to get their products to
market before anyone else does, especially those working on large-scale
sites.
The trick is to extend the growing season, and that means keeping careful
control of heat, light, and other factors. It was this commercial ambition
that gave the team the idea of developing a 'real time' system.
The system makes automatic adjustments to control greenhouse equipment for
warmth, light, moisture and other factors used to encourage growth, using
levels chosen by the user to suit the crop. This entry found favour for its
thoroughness and well thought out programming and screen depiction.
Each 'cell' or growing unit showed a graph for each variable, which
responded in real time to changes in the values.
The system itself had been well-built and tested, sadly without the
involvement of a real life grower.

Merlin Metrics System
Written by: Antony Powell of Aston University
Aimed at: Any company which needs to estimate the cost of producing software
Runs on: Sun Microsystems Sparcstations and compatibles under Unix (SunOs),
written using Ingres database and Windows 4GL Version 2.0/02
'You can't deliver what you can't measure' is a well-known conundrum of the
software industry. Software metrics provide one of the traditional
yardsticks used to estimate the time and effort it will take in order to to
create new software.
Such metrics are based on generally accepted, tried and tested rules of
thumb, often an estimate of lines of code written per day. These were simply
too wide of the mark for a specialised company such as Rolls Royce and
Associates, where the Scientific Software Department had highly trained
staff, working on scientific problems.
Other measurement systems proved unsatisfactory, so the author set out to
create a system that could 'model' specialised developments.
Models could be stored, manipulated, and drawn on to adapt to new
circumstances, so that the development model closely reflects the experience
and the culture of a particular company.
Most important, the author had defeated the main problem experienced with
such systems in that the data was simple to collect and enter.
Commercial plans for this product have not spread beyond its enthusiastic
users at Rolls-Royce as yet.

Live - Makaton Environments
Written by: Richard Eastgate, Mirabelle D'Cruz, Brendan Collins and
Christopher Lee of Nottingham Univerity
Aimed at: Schools for children with learning difficulties, including
multiple disabilities
Runs on: IBM compatible 486 PC, with joystick and SVGA graphics, under
MS-DOS 5.0, written using Virtual R
The word 'Live' in the title of this product stands for 'Learning In Virtual
Environments', a description of an innovative computer-based approach to the
teaching of a special sign language, Makaton.
This cross-disciplinary team, inspired by practical research, set out to
create a world within the classroom. The teacher can explore the various
properties of an item (such as a ringing telephone, shown on an office desk)
and children taught and tested using the signs within a 'real' environment.
The system supports various special peripherals - such as a joystick and
speakers - so that it can be used by multiply-handicapped children with
learning difficulties.
The split screen shows on one side a moving cartoon figure who demonstrates
the making of the sign (this is easier to follow and interpret than the
traditional card-based pictures with arrows) and on the other the
'environment'. The product may soon be available through a specialist
software company, Rompa, and the team is continuing to develop new modules
and facilities.

Inspire - Intelligent System for the Purpose of Information Retrieval in
Education
Written by: Alan Cloughley, David Black, John Taylor of Napier University,
Edinburgh
Aimed at: Educational institutions and students in higher education
Runs on: IBM compatible PCs under MS-DOS or SCO Xenix, written in Borland
Turbo C Version 5.0.
This product is aimed at the overworked student counsellor who needs an
instant source of information on higher education grants and funding.
Currently such advisors, and those students that are trying to help
themselves, find that they have to wade through a maze of books, pamphlets
and other sources to find the information they need.
Furthermore, they may remain ignorant of special funds - such as charities
and trusts - that could help them, given the right set of qualifications.
Inspire uses a series of menus and draws a 'profile' of the enquirer's
special circumstances and connections, so that every possible source of
funding is revealed, with an analysis of the potential grants, loans,
benefits, trusts and sponsorships, and even tax benefits, that could be
drawn upon.
The enormous effort made in gathering and organising the information was
matched by a thoughtfully-planned screen presentation.
This enterprising team of authors has already formed itself into a company,
called Knowledge Tree Systems, and is marketing and supporting the system
commercially.
They will, however, have to keep a close eye on pricing and the cost of
maintaining an up-to-date knowledge bank.

The Word-Of-Mouth- Emulator
Written by: Clare Harvey of University of Sunderland
Aimed at: Any company which needs to centralise and use its body of research
knowledge
Runs on: IBM compatible PC 486 under Microsoft Windows 3.1, written in
Visual Basic
A researcher starting off on a new project is well-advised to finding
someone who already knows something about the subject. The traditional
method is word of mouth.
In a large, widely-spread organisation, this might not be so easy, and many
a goldmine is stashed away in laboratory notebooks of which colleagues may
not even be aware. It was to create a knowledge network at Courtaulds
Coatings Research and Development Department that this student created the
Word of Mouth Emulator.
A database registers the interests of users as they file and retrieve their
everyday work, and builds up its knowledge on their enquiries, so that the
more the system is used, the more useful it becomes as a 'map' of internal
knowledge.
The screen showed simple-to-use prompts and listings of areas of expertise
and interest, so that people could investigate for themselves, a popular
feature with pilot users.

Minvest - Financial Evaluation of Mining Projects
Written by: Dr Chaoshui Xu of the University of Leeds
Aimed at: Mining companies assessing investments
Runs on: IBM Compatible PC 386 under MS-DOS version 4.0, written using
Zortech C++ from Symantec, Version 3.1.
Mining is a high-capital investment business, and assessing the risk of a
new venture is a job for experts. Few experts, however, are equally at home
in the worlds of mining and high finance.
This PhD student set out to marry the two topics in one robust and
easy-to-use piece of software, having researched the limitations of current
methods and software tools. The screen walks the user through a number of
considerations and variables, including the quality and amount of ore, tax
rules and profitability, (which vary according to the country of origin and
the material).
The answers can be constructed into a model, using a series of spreadsheets,
grids and graphics to show cash-flow and payback analysis. Although
developed without the benefit of Windows, this thorough and professional
tool used simple Windows-like techniques.
The pool of 35 test users are reported to be enthusiastic, and this product
has good commercial prospects.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (14): Geographical complexity
 -Case study / Nutreco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dollars 425m sale earlier this year of British Petroleum's animal and
fish feeds divisions was the largest management buy-out since the purchase
of Gardner Merchant, the contract catering company, from Forte in 1992.
But it was also one of the most complex buy-outs in recent years because of
the wide geographical spread of the business and the need to transform the
150 disparate legal entities involved into a coherent corporate structure.
The Nutreco buy-out involved 20 operating companies employing 5,700 people
at 250 main sites in 19 different legal jurisdictions. Combined annual
turnover of the businesses is more than Dollars 2bn.
The top tier of 70-80 senior managers own 11.5 per of Nutreco's shares,
although there are plans to encourage wider share ownership among employees.
The buy-out was the final piece of a Dollars 1.5bn disposal programme begun
by BP in 1992, when the company decided to focus on its core activity as an
integrated oil and natural gas company.
The companies slated for sale were grouped under the BP Nutrition Division,
although their products ranged from shampoo to fish feeds.
They included such household names as Purina Mills, one of the largest
animal feed operators in the US, as well as small specialist companies
operating in worldwide national or regional markets.
Most of the businesses in the Nutreco buy-out are involved in fish and
animal feeds, although there are also abattoirs as well as poultry breeding
and pork processing operations. In some ways they were a strange mishmash of
companies,' said one adviser to the deal. 'They represented the rump of BP
Nutrition,' he added.
But Simon Rowlands of CINven, which jointly led the buy-out with Baring
Capital Investors, says Nutreco's broad portfolio of products and
geographical spread were part of its appeal.
So, too, was its presence in fish foods, a fast growing sector worldwide.
Although Nutreco is often described as being basically an animal feeds
business, Mr Rowlands says it is 'rapidly becoming a fish feeds business
with animal feeds attached'.
But the benefits of a broad geographic spread also created problems in
structuring the deal. 'There was the whole question of control and
management cultures,' says Mr Rowlands. 'We had to take a view on whether to
go forth as a single international company or as a series of national
barons.'
The decision was to form a more coherent company under Richard van
Wijnbergen, chief executive, with headquarters in Boxmeer in the
Netherlands.
But the task of transforming the business at the same time as structuring
the deal proved tricky. One problem for the 20 operating companies was the
shock of leaving the BP fold. 'Severing the cord to mother BP proved to be a
painful process for some of the companies,' says one adviser.
The lack of detailed information on the businesses became evident at a
relatively early stage, says Mr Rowlands. 'BP's information availability was
not as extensive as one would have liked,' he says.
An extensive due diligence exercise put considerable pressure on the local
managers of the companies. But the information it uncovered led to a change
in the structure of the deal as well as in its price. It also caused some
delays.
Chris Berisford, a partner in the London corporate finance department of
accountants KPMG, said the unusual nature of the disparate markets served by
the various businesses complicated the exercise.
'Some businesses were purely international, like fish feeds, while others,
such as slaughterhouses, had a very regional focus,' he said.
Many of the companies also had complex contracts with their customers that
were related to the cyclical commodity markets in which they operated, but
which were difficult to understand.
Such complexity meant that 'the numbers kept changing all the time,'
according to Mr Berisford.
The structure of the deal also caused some anxiety among the national
companies, in large part because the buyers wanted to put the debt into the
various operating divisions.
Mr Rowlands at CINven said executives at many continental European
operations found it difficult to understand why their companies had to
assume a portion of Nutreco's debt.
'The Spanish operating company would ask 'why are people in London and
Holland imposing this on us?''
The geographic spread of the businesses meant that the closing of the deal
had to be carefully planned. Alastair Dickson, of London lawyers Dickson
Minto, said the deal structure called for tiers of acquisitions to be
executed within a short period over time zones that stretched from Australia
to South America.
The deal closed on September 30 after two days of transfers, notarisations
and banking transactions.
Mr Rowlands says it was the sheer complexity of the Nutreco deal that
resulted in another unusual feature of the buy-out; the fact the two
financial institutions led the deal.
'It was the first time that two financial institutions had worked so closely
together,' he says. But it is unlikely to be the last. He believes more
joint deals will emerge in the future as buy-outs become bigger and more
complex.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (12): The fear of a failure is
daunting - Financing a bid / Peter Carty looks at the cost of professional
fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER CARTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fear of the consequences of a failed bid might discourage many managements
from trying to buy their company. If the buy-out goes ahead Newco - the new
company formed by a deal - pays all the professional fees. But what if there
is no Newco? In this event, losing homes or life savings to fund the
professional fees run up in an abortive bid is unlikely.
Although no two buy-outs are the same, most bids can be examined in a couple
of stages: before and after the exclusivity deal in which management becomes
the preferred bidder. 'Exclusivities are still very much the norm,' says 3i
director Gordon Maclean.
Management's first task is to find a corporate finance adviser, usually a
corporate finance boutique, accountants or, rarely, a merchant bank. The
adviser is likely to ask the vendor to underwrite management's initial
professional fees in the event of the bid not progressing.
Vendors often agree to this. A buy-out bid is a useful benchmark against
which to assess other bids, since the management has an inside track on what
the business is worth.
Otherwise, most or all of the preliminary advisory work is likely to be
carried out on a contingency basis. Advisers readily admit that they take a
gamble when agreeing to act for managements. 'For every three serious
approaches, only one is backed,' estimates Chris Beresford, KPMG Peat
Marwick's buy-out head.
Advisers are well aware that while companies can afford substantial fees,
managers normally cannot. The exception is where a bid is driven by a
wealthy entrepreneur.
Having said this, advisers may retain the option of recovering some fees in
the event of an unsuccessful bid. A typical sum is Pounds 10,000. 'We might
want a commitment of that sort,' says Mr Beresford.
He rarely invoices management even if a bid fails There are two sets of
circumstances in which it does happen: where managements benefit from
negotiating a trade sale, perhaps by getting a percentage of the
consideration; and where managements pull out without a satisfactory reason.
Partly because collection after abortive deals is at the adviser's
discretion, attitudes vary. Some boutiques and smaller firms of accountants
appear to take a harder line, but again the issue is normally only whether
they collect a nominal commitment rather than whether they bankrupt the
management team. Others side-step the collection issue. First Independent
Corporate Finance asks for a consideration in advance: 'A few hundred or
thousand up front,' according to managing director John Beattie.
Managements may not use an independent corporate finance adviser at all.
They frequently go direct to a venture capitalist or, in the era of the IBO
(institutional buy-out), institutions approach them. According to research
by Coopers &amp; Lybrand on completed MBOs for the year to September 30,
managements were not reported as having received independent financial
advice in more than half of the deals surveyed. In such cases all the
professional advice management receives is likely to be arranged through the
equity provider, normally on a contingent basis.
The professional fees meter only starts really running after the exclusivity
hurdle is cleared and management becomes the preferred bidder. At this point
an outline deal with a completion date is normally agreed. Most of the due
diligence and legal work is then carried out. Sometimes it is done in-house
by venture capitalists. If not, particularly for larger deals, firms of
lawyers and accountants are used.
Marketing consultants are likely to be brought in to report on the
business's prospects and other advisers assess the bid's pensions
implications. Environmental impact reports are also increasingly required.
If the bid falls after clearing the exclusivity hurdle, the management team
is still unlikely to be liable for any of these fees. The venture capitalist
or vendor is most likely to be billed. 'If you walk away you pay, if the
vendor walks away then it pays,' says 3i's Gordon Maclean. Many of the
professionals and institutions involved are accustomed to receiving lower
fees for abortive bids. 'The management team in my experience are rarely on
the hook for anything,' he says.
However, in exceptional cases, as well as a small sum to the corporate
finance advisers the management team may also have to compensate the
solicitors. 'As lawyers we ask for a commitment,'' says Mark Vickers, a
partner in city solicitors Alsop Wilkinson. But he stresses that this is not
onerous. 'You have to be realistic.' He says that most of the time his firm
does not collect from managements on abortive deals. If they do, the sums
are typically no more than Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 4,000 per manager.
Any potential liability for corporate finance or legal fees will be set out
in terms of engagement. But many management teams should be able to
negotiate away any downside liability, even for initial advisory fees. Key
factors to dangle in front of institutions and advisers are the size of the
deal and its likelihood of success, and the calibre and commitment of the
management.
Often it is a foregone conclusion. 'They offered before I asked,'' says Bob
Littledale. He mounted a buy-out for his company, Oxford-based CSE Aviation
Ltd, in 1990. The company went to a trade buyer instead. Mr Littledale
incurred no liabilities and subsequently participated in a successful bimbo
(a buy-in/buy-out).
'I've failed twice in a buy-out,' admits Stewart Swinden, managing director
of Energy Facilities Management Ltd, based near Manchester. Both bids
foundered through no fault of the management teams and Mr Swinden did not
pay any fees. He was then backed by 3i in a successful buy-in bid for his
present company in 1989. Mr Swinden advises other managers to request that
all fees are on a contingency basis: 'Don't be afraid to ask.'
So, managements are most unlikely to lose their shirts over a failed bid. Of
course, it is different if the bid succeeds but Newco later founders. Then
family homes really can be lost.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (13): Workers share bonus -
ESOPs / David Cohen on benefits in involving employees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'What about the workers?' may not be the first question on the agenda when a
team of managers sits down to plot a buy-out but a growing number of MBOs
now give employees the chance to become shareholders. Managers who decide
not to keep all the equity may be motivated by feelings of guilt as they
contemplate the vast gains they hope to make on their own shares. But wider
ownership can also bring more tangible benefits.
First, where a management team faces competition from other bidders the
inclusion of employees may tip the scales in its favour. This is more likely
when the target business is being privatised and there may be a political
decision favouring a MEBO (E for Employee). Half the privatised London bus
companies - and a majority outside the capital - have been bought by MEBOs.
However, it will rarely be possible for the bulk of employees to be
shareholders in the MBO. The stringent requirements of the 1986 Financial
Services Act and the practical difficulties of co-ordinating a complex
transaction on a tight timescale favour the employee shareholdings being
held through an Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP).
An ESOP is a discretionary trust for the benefit of a company's employees.
If the decision is taken to allocate, say, 10 per cent of the MEBO company
to the employees as a whole, the shares can be taken up at the outset by an
ESOP with the ultimate distribution postponed. This should solve the
logistical headache with only the trustee of the ESOP - usually a corporate
entity controlled by the main MEBO company - needing to be directly involved
in the actual
As well as being convenient, an ESOP may make it easier to raise the finance
needed for the buy-out. The extent to which a target company's assets can be
used as security for loans to fund a buy-out is severely restricted by
section 151 of the 1985 Companies Act which makes it illegal for a company
to provide financial support for the purchase of its own shares. Whereas
MBOs have to try and take advantage of the very restricted section 151
loopholes, ESOPs have their own clear-cut exemption.
A bank which has refused to increase the amount it will offer to an MBO may
reconsider if the MBO becomes an MEBO and the bank can secure the target
company's property or its guarantee.
An ESOP should also make it cheaper for the MEBO to service and repay its
debt because regular, properly-structured contributions by the target
company to the ESOP should be deductible for corporation tax purposes.
But this tax break cannot be taken for granted. The Inland Revenue considers
each case on its own merits. The only way to guarantee tax relief will be to
ensure that the ESOP qualifies as an Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT)
under the 1989 Finance Act.
An ESOT has to satisfy rigorous conditions. Democratically elected employee
representatives must comprise a majority of the trustees or - as a result of
a reform introduced by this year's Finance Act - the trust can adopt a
'paritarian' structure with employee and management teams agreeing on the
selection of the independent professional who would hold the balance of
power.
Another perceived drawback of ESOTs is that shares must be distributed
either directly, by gift or sale, to all eligible employees, or via an
Inland Revenue-approved profit sharing scheme.
Managers who are prepared to tolerate these constraints may be able to take
advantage of the fact that a vendor who sells to an ESOT can 'roll over' any
capital gain on his shares by investing the proceeds in other assets and
will pay no capital gains tax until he disposes of those other assets. If
the conditions for this relief are met - in particular, the ESOT must own at
least 10 per cent of the target company within 12 months of the sale -
shareholders who want a rollover should be prepared to accept a lower price
for shares.
In spite of these attractions, ESOTs are still scarce. The majority of MEBOs
have turned their backs on the extra tax reliefs and opted instead for the
greater flexibility of the plain vanilla ESOP.
Nowhere is this flexibility more evident than in relation to the
distribution of shares to employees. Possibilities range from an offer for
sale - a test of employee commitment and a way of raising funds - to free
shares which, if held on the employees' behalf by the trustees of a profit
sharing scheme for five years, will also be tax-free. Or employees can be
granted IR-approved share options to be satisfied by the transfer of shares
from the ESOP.
Whatever the tax and financing pluses of slotting an ESOP into the MBO
jigsaw, the acid test will be whether the ESOP can achieve a 'hearts and
minds' objective. Wider employee ownership may defuse trade union objections
to a proposed buy-out and dampen worker resentment of 'get rich quick'
managers. This will be a particularly important safety valve if, as is often
the case, the managers' road to riches is paved with redundancies and other
cost-cutting measures.
On a more positive note, the managers and their investors will hope that
equity involvement engenders a sense of teamwork and a clear focus on common
goals throughout the workplace.
Simon Smith of Capital Strategies, specialist advisers on MEBOs, says 'the
benefits of employee ownership, bringing greater staff participation, can
enhance the value of everybody's shares. An index of large US companies with
significant employee ownership has outperformed the Standard and Poors 500
index by 22.7 per cent over the last 11 quarters'.
Similar trends in the UK should more than outweigh the cost of putting the
'E' into MEBO.

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (7): Inland Revenue
asks for a discount - On-line information / Claire Gooding looks at the way
the tax authorities are using their accounting system to negotiate discounts
with suppliers and keep tight budget control
</HEADLINE>

A radical change of culture is taking place at the Inland Revenue, not least
because it is expected to spend money as efficiently as it collects it. Like
any other government department, the Revenue is taking responsibility for
its own procurement.
According to assistant director of procurement, John Cavell, it is leading
the way with its PCS - Purchasing Cycle System.
Walker's software had already been chosen as the basis of PCS when Mr
Cavell, whose responsibilities include contracts and purchasing, took over
his post three years ago. A believer in the principle that 'information is
power', his brief was to maximise the purchasing power of the Revenue, and
that included keeping track of how much had been committed to a particular
supplier.
'Experience has proved that you can make 80 per cent of savings without a
computer system just by using professional practices, but you can get the
extra 20 per cent by using a computer,' he says. 'The information it
supplies gives you the purchasing power to negotiate discounts.'
The Revenue wanted to record projects involving ongoing commitments as well
as upfront payments. Although a certain amount of tailoring was needed for
the Accounts Payable, Stock Control and Purchasing modules, Mr Cavell says:
'Where possible we've tried to stick to the standard package because we
recognise that the more we modify it, the more costly it becomes.' The
Revenue used outside consultants, including Ernst and Young, on the
contract.
Currently 700 sites are served by PCS, which is adopting the system as part
of project Iron, the Inland Revenue Office for the Nineties. For end users
the system runs on PCs, although the big advantage is the mainframe
centralisation of data. The commitment accounting (Encumbrance) module,
which the Revenue encouraged Walker to complete, is a particular attraction
for end users because they can make forward planning commitments as well as
tracking cash payments for goods and services that have already been
delivered.
'We trap expenditure at source so that we know up front how much is
committed in the long term,' explains Mr Cavell. 'It helps with delegated
budgets and what we term empowerment, where people are responsible for their
own budgets. Previously bills were paid centrally at Worthing, but now users
can have a halfway house, accessing the system from their own screen.'
The project, worth a total of Pounds 500,000 in current terms, is planned to
save more than Pounds 20m, achieved from early payment discounts, a
reduction in printed forms and stockholding.
Supplier profile Product: Release 16.5 of Walker's mainframe applications

FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (11): How miners chose to go
it alone - Case study / Goitra Tower Anthracite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Miners at the Tower pit in south Wales had long suspected that managers
there wanted to launch a buy-out. But when closure came earlier this year no
bid materialised.
The response of more than 200 miners was to organise their own bid, an
employee buy-out. Last month they were chosen as the government's preferred
bidder for the pit in readiness for an expected handover of the assets on
Christmas eve.
The miners will have virtually the whole of Wales willing them to succeed.
The region was once one of the coal capitals of the UK but Tower was British
Coal's last deep mine operating in the region when it closed in April.
Until the buy-out team took an interest there was a danger that deep mining
would be lost to the region for ever. Tower pit itself was first sunk in the
1930s.
Assuming the bid is successful it will be quite a coup. The miners will have
persuaded both financial backers and government that they are capable of
making a success out of a mine for which British Coal said there were not
enough markets.
Neither the government nor the buy-out team will discuss the size of the bid
but it is thought to be worth considerably more than the Pounds 2m that the
men have raised by putting in Pounds 8,000 each.
Winning the government's backing as preferred bidder for the pit was a
considerable achievement. At least one other company put in a tender.
Ministers had always said they wanted workers to have a stake in the future
of the industry and were known to want to encourage buy-outs.
However, employee buy-outs are often considered to be riskier ventures than
management buy-outs. The government would not do a deal with the buy-out
unless there was a strong chance of running the pit successfully.
It will look bad for the government if any of the companies chosen to run
the industry after privatisation should fail, but more particularly if the
company has been founded with the money of its employees.
Failure is not something which Goitra Tower Anthracite, as the buy-out
company is called, believes is remotely possible. Tyrone O'Sullivan,
secretary of National Union of Mineworkers lodge at Tower when it closed,
says Tower made operating profits of Pounds 28m in the last three years.
He says the company will aim to produce 430,000 tonnes of coal a year and it
has markets for all of it. Some three quarters of the output is expected to
go to the domestic market where profit margins are high.
Goitra also believes that costs will be much cheaper than in British Coal
even though pay for each of the miners will, according to Mr O'Sullivan, be
higher and working methods similar.
'Management levels will be more sensible,' he says. 'In British Coal days
there were about 50 managers,' he says. 'We will have nothing like that.'
But in an employee buy-out, who will do the managing? Are there dangers of a
conflict of interest?
Mrs Caroline Price, senior corporate finance manager at Price Waterhouse,
which has advised Goitra on the bid, says there is a clearly defined
management structure.
'Employees will have two hats. They can vote at the annual general meeting
but on a day-to-day basis they will be employees. They understand very well
the need for discipline and often point out that in a mine it can be a
matter of life and death.'
Goitra has appointed Cliff Jones, ex manager of the Betws pit, also in south
Wales, as pit manager.
He will be one of three management directors on the board, along with Tony
Shott, mine surveyor. The third will be a finance director who is being
appointed from outside the coal industry.
There will also be two workers' directors, including Mr O'Sullivan. The
chairman of the board will be Philip Weekes, a former director of the
National Coal Board in South Wales. He first came into contact with miners
at Tower 35 years ago.
