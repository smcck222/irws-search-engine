FT  30 NOV 94 / BP board in big reshuffle: Chairman and chief executive
appointed from within in first shake-up since 1992 coup ousted Horton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Petroleum is to promote a new chairman and chief executive from
within its ranks in the first big reshuffle since the boardroom coup of
1992.
Lord Ashburton, the chairman who led the coup against the former chairman
and chief executive Mr Robert Horton, is to retire next July 1.
He will be succeeded by Mr David Simon, the current chief executive. He in
turn will be succeeded by Mr John Browne, head of the company's exploration
arm.
Lord Ashburton had always intended to step down after three years as
chairman, and the changes announced yesterday were 'an example of
continuity'. The timing of the announcement, on Budget Day, was dictated by
the need to inform staff before a top-level planning session for 1995 which
begins tonight.
Those involved in the changes stressed that they did not imply any shift in
the strategy which BP set itself after the ousting of Mr Horton. This is
based on a drive to reduce the company's large debts, tighten the
integration of its operations, and achieve 'disciplined growth'.
All the executives involved in the reshuffle have been closely involved in
managing BP's recovery from the losses which resulted from Mr Horton's
expansionist strategies.
Mr Simon, who took over as chief executive in 1992, will become a
non-executive chairman, spending three or four days a week at BP. He said it
was important to separate the role of chairman and chief executive. Mr
Browne, who is 47, has held a variety of posts at BP including group
treasurer. Most recently he headed a successful expansion of the company's
oil and gas reserves.
The new head of exploration will be Mr Rodney Chase, the managing director
with responsibility for the western hemisphere and corporate affairs.
Mr Russell Seal, chief executive of BP Oil, the downstream arm, will take on
a new set of responsibilities to oversee the further integration of the
group. His position will be taken by Mr Rolf Stomberg who heads BP's
European oil operations.
The announcement of the changes comes at the end of a year in which BP's
finances have staged a solid recovery.
In the first quarter, the company paid its first dividend increase since the
coup, and by the third quarter it had reduced its debts from Dollars 16bn to
around Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6bn). The company has also been boosted by
substantial oil discoveries in Colombia and west of Shetlands, as well as a
recent gas find in Vietnam.
Mr Browne intended to seek further growth for the company by emphasising the
role of gas. He also saw opportunities to 'deepen' BP's position in the
refining and downstream markets, such as in eastern Europe and Asia.
BP's chemicals business had undergone expansion which would enable it to
take advantage of the current upswing in chemical markets.
Mr Simon said that BP's dividend policy would continue to be reviewed on a a
quarterly basis. 'We would like to progressively grow the dividend if we
have a sustainable financial performance,' he said.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): PEP investments range
expected to be widened - Personal Equity Plans
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor proposes in his Budget to extend the range of eligible
investments for general Personal Equity Plans to include certain corporate
bonds, convertibles and preference shares.
The chancellor's intention is to widen the range of investments which people
can put in a PEP, and to help encourage the development of new sources of
finance for companies.
It is expected that this measure will take effect on - or as soon as
possible after - April 6 1995, subject to consultation on the necessary
changes to the regulations.
Under current rules, direct investment in PEPs is restricted to quoted UK
ordinary shares or similar shares in European Union companies.
Individuals may also invest in unit and investment trusts in a general PEP,
provided the trusts satisfy a number of conditions governing their
investments.
The chancellor proposes to extend general PEPs to a range of UK corporate
bonds and convertibles and UK and EU preference shares.
The Budget proposals will mean that individuals will be able to invest up to
the full general PEP limit of Pounds 6,000 directly in:
1. UK ordinary shares or similar shares in European Union companies.
2. Specified corporate bonds and convertibles of UK non-financial companies.
3. Preference shares in UK and EU companies. Investments must be in quoted
companies.
In addition, unit and investment trusts which hold at least half their
assets in the instruments listed in 1 and 3 above will be eligible for the
full Pounds 6,000 general PEP limit.
The trusts' investments may be in quoted or unquoted companies.
In order to qualify for inclusion under the new rules, corporate bonds will
need to have a minimum term of at least five years to maturity and be issued
at a fixed rate of interest.
The Inland Revenue will be consulting on the regulations needed to implement
the new provisions, including, in particular, other detailed rules for
corporate bonds and 'non-qualifying' trusts.
Subject to the consultation process, it is intended that these measures will
take effect from April 6 1995.
Regulations will also be made to allow newly constituted open-ended
investment companies to qualify for PEPs on the same terms as authorised
units trusts and to extend the range of persons able to market PEPs in the
UK to include certain European institutions.
In the tax year 1993-94 1.38m new general plans and 190,000 new single
company plans were taken out, with Pounds 5.72bn and Pounds 490m invested
respectively.
These figures are the highest for a single tax year since PEPs began in
1987.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Retirees able to defer
annuities until rates rise - Personal pensions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Members of a tax-approved personal pension scheme will be allowed to defer
purchasing an annuity at pension date, if they wish, until age 75. They will
also be able to withdraw amounts during the deferral period which are
broadly equivalent to the annuity that their fund could have provided.
The changes will take effect after Royal assent is given to the finance
bill.
Under the tax rules an annuity must be purchased when any benefit is taken
from a personal pension fund. This means that people who retire when annuity
rates are low may have to buy a considerably smaller annuity than they could
have done with the same fund if they had been able to postpone purchase
until annuity rates were more favourable.
Under the proposed measures, personal pension scheme members who defer
purchasing an annuity will be able to make income withdrawals in the
deferral period broadly equivalent to the annuity that their fund could have
provided. Income withdrawals will be reviewed every three years to ensure
the pension fund is not too rapidly depleted.
Investment income and capital gains will continue to build up tax-free
during the deferral period.
The proposed measures will apply whether or not members elect to take the
tax-free lump sum at pension date.
Amendments are proposed to allow the trustees or managers of approved
pension schemes to purchase annuities from certain insurance companies
established in other European Union countries.
One of the ways that tax-approved occupational and personal pension schemes
provide benefits is by securing pensions through the purchase of an annuity
from a life insurance company.
At present the tax rules limit annuities to those provided by UK-authorised
insurers. The Third Life Insurance Directive creates a single market in
insurance products throughout the EU.
Under the Budget proposal, the range of insurance companies that can provide
annuities to tax-approved pension schemes will be extended to include those
in other EU member states.
It will, however, be necessary for the foreign insurance company to appoint
a fiscal representative in the UK (or enter into other arrangements) to
secure compliance with the company's tax obligations.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Moves to make UK more
attractive - Non-residents
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Changes are proposed to the rules for taxing the income of non-residents
from transactions carried out through investment managers and brokers in the
UK.
The changes will ensure that the non-resident faces no liability to tax
beyond tax, if any, deducted at source.
They will apply to income arising on or after April 6, 1995.
The chancellor's intention is to enhance further both the attractions to
non-residents and the international competitiveness of the UK investment
management industry.
At present, tax chargeable on a person not resident in the UK can be
assessed on a person acting as agent for the non-resident in the UK.
This rule does not apply to income from either:
Transactions carried out through a broker, or
Investment transactions carried out by an investment manager, provided those
services are rendered in the normal course of the trade as a broker or
investment manager and for full remuneration.
The exclusion of investment transactions from the rule above does not apply
if the non-resident is either the sole client of or connected with the
investment manager.
The chancellor proposes in his Budget to correct a technical defect in the
provisions in the Finance Act 1993 permitting members of Lloyd's to set up a
new-style special reserve fund. As no arrangements permitting new-style
funds have been approved by the Inland Revenue the amendment can be treated
as always having had effect.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Tax-free premium payment
allowance increased - Friendly societies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An increase is planned, to Pounds 270 from Pounds 200, in the annual amount
that an individual can pay in premiums under tax-exempt life assurance
policies issued by friendly societies.
The premium under an existing tax-exempt policy is to be increased to
reflect the new limit without the policy losing its tax privileges.
There will be a removal of the statutory limitation on the surrender value
of a qualifying tax-exempt policy that can be offered by a friendly society
during the first 10 years of the policy.
These measures will take effect on the day the finance bill receives Royal
assent.
In applying the limit on premiums payable under tax-exempt life assurance
policies, allowance is made for the extra cost involved in collecting
premiums at monthly rather than annual intervals.
The proposed annual limit of Pounds 270 will allow societies to provide
policies with premiums of up to Pounds 25 a month written on their
tax-exempt funds.
In general, tax-exempt policies are designed to meet the conditions for a
'qualifying policy'.
If a policy is a qualifying policy, then once premiums have been paid for 10
years, or for 7 1/2 years in the case of some shorter policies, the
policy-holder can take the benefits from the policy without incurring a
charge to tax on the profit produced by the policy.
The conditions for a qualifying policy include a requirement that premiums
should be payable year-by-year in equal amounts.
The measures will enable societies to offer existing holders of qualifying
tax-exempt policies the opportunity to increase the premiums payable for the
future without losing the benefit of qualifying status.
It is a long-standing condition for a qualifying tax-exempt policy that it
should carry an express condition limiting the surrender value of the policy
during the first 10 years, or 7 1/2 years in the case of some shorter
policies, to a maximum of a return of premiums.
It is proposed that this condition should be removed, leaving societies free
to offer the best possible surrender value on their qualifying policies.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Plan to amend tax
treatment of repo deals - Gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Changes to the tax treatment of approved stock lending arrangements and sale
and repurchase transactions (repos) are planned. The changes will take
effect from Royal assent.
Where collateral for approved stock lending arrangements is provided in the
form of cash, and the lender receives interest on the cash collateral
without deduction of tax and passes it on in full to the borrower, the
borrower will get relief for the interest paid and will be able to pay it
without deduction of tax.
Anomalies in the application of existing legislation to repos will also be
addressed.
Stock lending is an important mechanism for supporting the liquidity of the
securities and equity markets. It enables stock to be borrowed to meet an
obligation to sell to a third party. The disposals and acquisitions that
arise are ignored for tax purposes if the stock lending arrangements are
approved.
Removal of the anomalies in the application of existing legislation to repos
will ensure that double charges and double reliefs do not arise. The
chancellor's intention is to enable those lenders who prefer cash as
collateral to take a more active part in the market.
The Bank of England yesterday published a consultative document on
establishing an open market in the sale and repurchase of government
securities.
The Inland Revenue will be consulting shortly on the potential tax
implications of a gilt repo market. The consultation period will end on
January 31 1995.
Marketmakers in gilts can already borrow stock using the services of the
stock exchange money brokers in what are in effect bilateral repo
transactions. An open repo market will allow all market participants to use
repos.
The introduction of an open repo market would mark an important further
development of the structure of the gilts market. Repos should improve
liquidity and efficiency, reducing yields and the government's debt interest
costs.
Each reduction in yields of just one basis point - one-hundredth of 1 per
cent - will save more than Pounds 25m a year of public expenditure.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Sharesave scheme to be
extended - Save-As-You-Earn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The right to offer Sharesave contracts will be extended to certain European
institutions who are authorised to accept deposits in the UK.
The 'ordinary' save-as-you-earn (SAYE) scheme will be abolished and tax
relief will no longer be available on new SAYE contracts which are not
linked to share options.
Existing contracts will be allowed to run their course with full tax relief.
Tax relief is to continue for SAYE Sharesave schemes, which are contracts
linked to approved employee share option schemes, but with the substitution
of a Treasury model for the present Department for National Savings (DNS)
model.
SAYE Sharesave schemes provide employees with an opportunity to buy shares
in their own company by saving for five or seven years.
Until now, the DNS has set up and run its own savings schemes, which also
act as a model for savings schemes offered by the private sector (banks and
building societies). The government sets the terms and conditions for each
of these schemes.
The DNS is now withdrawing from operating schemes in order to concentrate on
its core activities.
As a result, the DNS scheme will no longer provide a model for banks and
building societies and a Treasury model scheme will be introduced in its
place.
The measure will not take effect before the finance bill receives Royal
assent. It is envisaged that the change will be made when the current
prospectus is replaced.
Only an institution authorised under the Banking Act 1987, building
societies or the DNS may currently offer SAYE contracts.
The proposals extend this list to include 'European authorised
institutions', which are credit institutions authorised to accept deposits
throughout the European Union by the central bank in their home state.
Ordinary SAYE provides a tax relief for regular contractual saving in a bank
or building society account. The scheme was introduced in 1969 and has been
unchanged since 1974.
The maximum monthly contribution is Pounds 20. A fixed bonus is paid at the
end of a five-year contract, with a higher bonus if the savings are left
untouched for a further two years.
Both the maximum contribution and the implicit interest rates are now
largely obsolete.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Maturity will bring new
lease of life - TESSAs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Changes to the rules for Tessas are planned so that investors who have held
an account for five years will be able to open a second account with the
full amount of capital deposited in their first Tessa, but not the
accumulated interest.
This will mean that they will be able to go on getting tax-free interest on
up to Pounds 9,000, provided they leave the capital untouched for a further
five years.
The chancellor's intention is to encourage people to hold on to savings
built up in their Tessas.
The first Tessas will mature in January 1996.
Interest earned on the account after maturity will become taxable. Under
current rules investors would then be able to open a new Tessa with a
max-imum first-year deposit of Pounds 3,000.
The chancellor proposes to increase the first-year deposit limit for a
second Tessa to allow individuals to invest up to the full amount of
capital, at most Pounds 9,000, which they had kept in their first Tessa
until maturity.
Investors who wish to take advantage of the increased limit will need to
open their second account within six months of the maturity of their first
Tessa.
People who invest less than Pounds 9,000 in the first year of their second
account will be able to go on saving over the next four years within the
usual limits of Pounds 1,800 for each year.
All Tessas will remain subject to an overall investment limit of Pounds
9,000 and to the rule that a Tessa has to last for five years if the tax
advan-tages are to be obtained.
The maximum first year deposit for people who have either not previously had
a Tessa or who invested less than Pounds 3,000 in their first Tessa will
remain at Pounds 3,000.
The Inland Revenue will be consulting the bodies representing institutions
offering Tessas on the changes needed to administer the new rules.
Under the Budget proposals the range of institutions able to offer Tessas
will be extended to include 'European Authorised Institutions'.
These are, broadly speaking, credit institutions incorporated in other
member states which are authorised to take deposits anywhere in the European
Union by virtue of the relevant authorisation in their home state.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Framework will be
equivalent to unit trusts' - Open-ended investment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor proposes in his Budget to make rules for the taxation of
open-ended investment companies and their shareholders, equivalent to those
already applying to authorised unit trusts and their unit holders.
They will also remove tax impediments to conversion of an authorised unit
trust into an open-ended investment company.
Regulations setting out the detailed rules will be introduced once the
necessary company-law and regulatory provision for these new vehicles is in
place - on present plans by mid 1995.
Open-ended investment companies (OEICs) cannot currently be formed under UK
company law. They are, however, commonly used elsewhere in the European
Union as a vehicle for collective investment.
Treasury ministers agreed in principle in June 1992 to allow the
establishment of OEICs in the UK. A decision was announced in June 1993 to
proceed by means of secondary legislation under the European Communities Act
(ECA) 1972 and the Treasury published a consultation document on a proposed
structure in December 1993.
The Treasury intends to publish a further consultation document shortly,
including draft ECA regulations. The Securities and Investments Board will
also consult about draft product regulations early next year.
Under the chancellor's proposal, OEICs and their shareholders will be taxed
on essentially the same lines as currently apply to authorised unit trusts
and their unitholders:
OEICs will be exempt from tax on capital gains realised for the benefit of
their investors
Their income will be subject to corporation tax at a special rate -
generally 20 per cent but 25 per cent where OEICs are invested primarily in
interest-bearing assets
Shareholders will be taxable each year on the full net income earned for
them, whether distributed or accumulated by the OEIC. This income will be
treated, at the OEIC's option, as a dividend; a foreign income dividend; a
dividend paired with a foreign income dividend; or a payment taxable as
interest
OEICs will be eligible to distribute income to non-resident shareholders (or
accumulate it) without deduction of UK tax if the OEIC invests in
appropriate assets and its shareholders comply with the formalities
OEICs will be eligible to be held through a Personal Equity Plan on the same
terms as apply to authorised unit trusts.
An existing authorised unit trust will be permitted to convert into an OEIC
if it chooses (subject to rules which the Securities and Investment Board
will lay down in due course).
The chancellor proposes legislation to eliminate any significant tax charges
arising from such a conversion which would tend to distort this choice.
Regulations will also deal with stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax
consequences.
It is also intended that the VAT treatment of OEICs should parallel that of
authorised unit trusts.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Concession to smaller
funds on distribution - Offshore
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two changes to the offshore funds legislation are planned so that the
legislation will no longer apply to entities that are not 'collective
investment schemes' as defined in the Financial Services Act, and funds with
low gross income will not need to incur the administrative cost of
distributing it to satisfy the 'distribution test'.
The first of the two measures will apply as from today and the second for
account periods of funds ending on or after today.
Under the first of the chancellor's changes, entities that are not
collective investment schemes within the definition in the Financial
Services Act 1986 would be removed entirely from the scope of the offshore
funds legislation. This is intended to apply to certain types of commercial
structures used by international groups, which are not created as vehicles
for rolling-up income but may technically be offshore funds as the
legislation now stands. (Other offshore funds which are collective
investment schemes will not be affected by this change.)
Under the second proposal, funds seeking Inland Revenue certification as
'distributor' funds will be treated as having met the distribution test
where the gross income in a year is very low - and where the cost of
distributing that income to investors would be disproportionate. At present
this relaxation is only available where annual income is nil. It is proposed
that the de minimis limit will be set at 1 per cent of the average value of
the fund's assets.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Their Budget): The coal executive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Jermine, 50: Chairman of mining company earning six-figure salary,
married with two children at private schools.
Politics: High Tory.
Wanted: Higher capital allowances for companies so greater investment can
take place. Did not want any cut in direct taxes or in public spending. Said
yesterday: 'It is a boring Budget which has done nothing to create new jobs.
It was an hour and 25 minutes of dressing up neutrality. There is some
tinkering at the fringes but no initiatives which will have any significant
effect on industry. The chancellor should have been much more aggressive and
behaved as if we were being successful, rather than 'steady as she goes'. I
don't see the merit of the waste disposal tax. The waste is being produced
and it just makes it more expensive for local authorities to get rid of it.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Making it easier to
calculate your own tax bill - Self assessment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A raft of changes to the tax system were outlined as part of a move towards
self assessment.
The 1994 Finance Act introduced from the tax year 1996-97, new rules for
filing tax returns including the option for people to calculate their own
tax bill from the figures on their return, or to ask the Inland Revenue to
make the calculation for them.
To make this easier, the complex preceding-year basis which was used for
taxing income from self-employment and some investment income was abolished,
and payment dates were aligned for all income tax levied by assessment, and
for capital gains tax.
This allows all tax to be brought together in one bill.
The measures, to be introduced in the Finance Bill, include
reform and simplification of income tax, the basis of taxation of income
from property;
simplification of the procedures for taxing non-residents and align them
with self assessment;
provision for employers to give their employees information they will need
to complete tax returns;
introduction of anti-avoidance legislation to deter artificial manipulation
of profits and income to take advantage of the transitional provisions
introducing the current year basis of assessment for tax on the
self-employed;
plus various other changes to simplify the taxation system.
These proposals represent the second phase of the changes necessary for a
fundamental reform of personal tax administration.
A key element of the proposals to make the tax system for the self-employed
and those who receive investment income simpler and fairer, is the
introduction of the current-year basis of assessment for all types of
income.
To permit the move from the preceding-year basis to the current-year basis,
without taxing businesses and income twice, it is necessary to tax profits
and income arising in the transitional period at an average rate reflecting
the length of the period.
Measures to ensure that employers give their employees the information to
complete their tax returns after 6 April 1997 have been brought forward.
employers should provide the Inland Revenue and their employees by 6 July,
with details of expenses payments and benefits in kind provided in the
previous tax year unless a dispensation has been given by their Inspector of
Taxes. This would be a change from the rules under which the employer is
required to provide the details to the Inland Revenue only and has to do so
by 6 June;
such details should include a calculation by the employer of a cash
equivalent for any benefit in kind provided to the employee;
the current penalty regime for failure to make returns to the Inland Revenue
should be extended to apply where employers fail to provide the required
information to employees;
a time limit - 19 May following the end of the tax year - should be set for
the provision by the employer of details of pay and tax deducted to
employees.
Most of the measures will be effected through PAYE Regulations, although
some will be in legislation proposed for the 1995 Finance Bill.
The 1994 Finance Act contains provisions for the introduction of the
current-year basis of assessment for the profits of the self-employed and
other income that is not taxed at source.
Under the new basis, income arising in any year is taxed for that year. The
old basis broadly taxed the income arising in the previous tax year. The
rules for the transition from the previous year to the current year basis
ensure broadly that there is no double taxation of business profits or other
income.
Other measures include changes to interest relief. As a consequence of the
proposed changes to the taxation of income from property, existing
provisions for allowing interest relief in respect of commercially let
property will be changed.
From 6 April 1995 interest payable in respect of a property letting business
will be allowable as a deduction in computing the profits of the business.
The rules - under which interest paid is allowed as a deduction from letting
income, provided the property is let at a commercial rent (or is available
for letting) for more than 26 weeks in a period of 52 weeks - will be
repealed.
In addition, minor amendments will be made to the provisions of the mortgage
interest relief at source (MIRAS) scheme to reflect changes in other
legislation. These will have effect from the time the 1995 Finance Bill
receives Royal Assent.
New rules will be introduced for the assessment and collection of tax on
trust income and gains where there is more than one trustee.
Anything done by or to any liable trustee will be treated as done by or to
all the liable trustees. This means that any liable trustee will be able to
make a return and self assessment and these will be treated as satisfying
the tax obligations of all the liable trustees. Conversely liable trustees
will be accountable for errors, failures or omissions in meeting their tax
obligations. The new rules will take effect from the 1996-97 tax year.
The tax treatment of residuary beneficiaries of deceased persons' estates
will be simplified, making it easier for them to self assess.
From 6 April 1995 payments to beneficiaries of the income of the residue of
an estate will be taxable in the year of receipt. There will be no spreading
of liabilities across the administration period.
The new rules will apply to estates in the course of administration at 6
April 1995 as well as to new estates.
At the same time technical defects will be corrected in the legislation
applying to foreign income dividends and certain forms of deemed income
received by personal representatives of deceased persons' estates, and to
payments made out of such income to residuary beneficiaries.
Further details of the changes will be provided when the Finance Bill is
published in 1995.
Most of the changes will come into effect for the tax year 1996-97, the
first year of self assessment. The main exceptions are the changes to the
rules for taxing income from property and the rules for beneficiaries of
estates which apply from 1995-96.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Amusement machines
included - Gaming machine licence duty
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gaming machine licence duty will increase by an average of around 19 per
cent for licence applications made on or after 1 December 1994 with the
chancellor's intention to restore the real value of GMLD to 1987 levels.
As of 1 November 1995, the scope of GMLD will be extended to include
amusement machines, such as video and quiz machines, and, as a consequence,
the duty will be re-named Amusement Machine Licence Duty (AMLD).
However, snooker or pool-tables, bar billiards, football games and
children's rides will continue to be exempt. A lower rate will be introduced
for the newly taxed machines and, to help operators meet the additional
cost, payment by instalments will be allowed for all machines subject to
AMLD. The chancellor's intention is to raise additional revenue and to
prevent the tax base for GMLD being eroded by competition from machines
outside the scope of the existing duty.
The rates of tax vary according to machine type, cost per play and the
period for which a licence is taken out.
The rates of GMLD were last increased in the March 1993 Budget, but only by
20 per cent when an increase of 40 per cent was necessary to restore the
value in real terms to 1987 levels. The increase prior to 1993 was in 1987.
A small-prize machine (also known as amusement-with-prizes) is statutorily
limited to a maximum payout per play of Pounds 3.00 cash or Pounds 6.00
tokens. All gaming machines are limited to a maximum cost perplay of 20p.
Five-penny machines and Other machines are commonly referred to as jackpot
machines, the only distinction being the amount staked. Five penny small
prize machines pay no duty.
The seasonal concession which is available to operators of machines
currently subject to GMLD, eight months (March to October)for the price of
six, will continue but will not extend to machines which become chargeable
when AMLD is introduced. Five penny smallprize machines will continue to be
exempt from duty as will five penny machines which are not prize machines.
All the machines currently liable to GMLD are subject to Home Office and
local authority social legislation which governs stakes, payout and siting.
These rules do not affect the machines which will be brought into charge by
AMLD.
The home secretary has indicated recently that he intends to consult on
further deregulatory measures for gaming machines. Thiswill help machine
operators to compete more effectively in the leisure market.
The increase in licence rates on 1 December 1994 is expected to yield Pounds
5m in 1994-95 and Pounds 25m in 1995-96. Introducing AMLD is expected to
raise Pounds 10m in 1995-96 and Pounds 30m in a full year, but this will be
offset in the first year of operation by the introduction of payment by
instalments, which carries a one-off cost of up to Pounds 50m.
A Compliance Cost Assessment (reference CCA 13) is available from the
Customs and Excise, New King's Beam House, 22 Upper Ground, London SE1 9PJ.

business cars
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Businesses are to be able to recover VAT paid on the purchase of cars bought
wholly for business purposes - primarily leasing - from August 1 1995. In
these cases, businesses will have to charge VAT when they sell the car.
Customs and Excise said it was proposed to introduce a provision that only
50 per cent of the VAT applying to car leasing charges can be recovered
where there is any use of the car for private motoring.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Tackling 'artificial
price' - Stock valuation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rules on the valuation of stock when a trade is discontinued and sold or
transferred to a connected person come under scrutiny .
The intention is to counter avoidance of tax by enabling an artificial price
placed on the stock in these circumstances to be over-ridden for tax
purposes.
The change will take effect in any case where a trade is discontinued on or
after today. It is estimated that the measure will yield Pounds 20m in the
tax year 1996-97.
At present, when a business is discontinued and its stock in trade is sold
to another trader the price of the stock agreed between the parties is
regarded as a trading receipt of one and a trading expense of the other,
whatever the value of that stock.
Where the parties are connected with one another (for example, by means of a
family or proprietorial link) the price of the stock is sometimes
manipulated to produce an advantageous overall tax result. Typically the
stock is sold at undervalue to create losses to carry back against profits
in earlier years or to defer the tax liability by transferring it to the
purchaser. But occasionally the stock is sold at overvalue to create a
profit to absorb earlier trading losses of the vendor and effectively to
pass on losses to the purchaser.
It is recognised that there may be circumstances where the arm's length rule
would impose tax on potentially substantial unrealised profits even though
no tax advantage was sought.
The rule was introduced in 1938 to ensure that a trader who had stock which
had appreciated in value since its acquisition did not escape paying tax on
the profits represented by that growth in value by arranging for a disposal
of the whole business. It is now, itself, being used to avoid or defer tax,
by manipulation of the price agreed between connected parties.
The Chancellor produced proposals to protect the capital gains charge which
may arise when a company leaves a group, with the intention of closing a
loophole in the 'degrouping charge' which may apply when a company leaves a
group holding an asset which it acquired from another company within that
group.
The changes proposed would apply when a company leaves a group on or after
today.
The Inland Revenue explained that the move was designed to counter a new
variation of the 'envelope trick' blocked in previous legislation.
One company transfers the asset to a shell subsidiary and both companies
then leave the group but in such a way that the group does not in fact lose
economic ownership of the degrouped companies. Such artificial degrouping
can be achieved by, for example, an outside financial institution
subscribing for new shares in the shell company. These new shares would
carry negligible economic rights but would cause the two companies to be
degrouped for capital gains purposes. No degrouping charge arises because of
the let-out for associated companies leaving a group at the same time.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): A new regime is planned -
Taxation of income from property
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A series of preparatory measures towards a new self assessment regime will
take effect from April 6 1995 and deal with income tax rules applying to the
taxation of income from property.
This will make it easier for those liable to income tax to compute their
income from property and to assess it under the new regime.
Income from property in the UK is taxed under Schedule A. Income from
furnished lettings is presently taxed under Case VI of Schedule D. The
changes proposed apply only to income tax. The present rules for companies
with Schedule A and Case VI property income will remain as they are.
For the purposes of income tax it is proposed to bring all income from
property situated in the UK including furnished lettings within the new
rules for Schedule A.
Under these rules tax will be charged on the profits of a business of
letting property including isolated or casual lettings.
The current prescriptive approach of defining what receipts are taxable and
what deductions are allowable will largely disappear and in calculating
profits most of the rules currently in force for trading profits under
Schedule D will apply, including the use of ordinary accounting principles.
But although income from property will follow the trading computational
rules, this does not mean it will be taxed as if it is trading income.
Income from property will continue to be treated as investment income, and
the income received as a return on capital which has been invested in the
property.
Under the new approach all income from property situated in the UK will be
pooled together regardless of the type of lease or whether the property is
furnished or unfurnished, including income not derived from a lease.
Expenditure incurred in earning that income will be allowed against the
pooled income. Capital allowances will be given as a Schedule A expense, as
part of the property income calculation.
As capital allowances are not available for plant or machinery let in a
dwelling house, the renewals basis or the wear and tear allowances for
furnished lettings will be maintained.
All losses brought forward to date will be set against the new pooled
income, and any excess can be carried forward against future income from the
business.
The treatment of income from property situated outside the UK will be
aligned with that of income from UK property by importing some of the new
rules into Case V of Schedule D. This will mean that, for example, interest
payable on a loan to purchase the property will in future be allowable as a
deduction.
There will be no change to the rules computing income from property for
corporation tax purposes.

yesterday.
The estimated net revenue yield is Pounds 15m in 1995-96 on an indexed and
non-indexed base. The existing commitment to 3 per cent real increases
(already announced, and therefore not scored as additional revenue) is worth
Pounds 240m on an indexed base and Pounds 375m on a non-indexed base.

unchanged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The duty rates on beer, spirits and cider and table wine were left
unchanged. The decision reflects a number of considerations, including the
position of the industry, levels of duty elsewhere in the single market, and
the desire to simplify the duty structure where possible and eliminate
anomalies.
There will be changes in some of the minor wine duties. The duty (including
consequential VAT) on fortified wine is being reduced by 13p for a 75 cl
bottle, in line with previous international agreements, and the duty on
sparkling wine is being aligned with fortified wine to remove the present
anomaly whereby sparkling wine is charged more duty than fortified wine
although fortified wine is stronger. The duty on a typical 75 cl bottle of
sparkling wine will be reduced by 27p (including VAT). The changes take
place from 1 January 1995.
The estimated revenue cost from these changes is Pounds 10m in 1995/96
compared.

second-hand goods
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Businesses dealing in second-hand goods will come under the European
Community (EC) Seventh VAT Directive on second-hand goods. From January 1
1995 the margin scheme of accounting for VAT will be extended to all
second-hand goods, works of art, antiques and collectors' items except
precious metals and gemstones.
An effective reduced VAT rate of 2.5 per cent will be introduced on imports
of certain works of art, antiques and collectors' items currently exempt
from VAT at import.
Any supplies of goods made through agents, including auctioneers, when
acting in their own names, will be treated for VAT purposes as supplies made
to them and by them.
An accounting scheme for auctioneers will be introduced which will ensure
they continue to pay VAT only on their fees.

Norway and Sweden, which belong to the European Economic Area (EEA), but not
to the European Community (EC) to honour UK obligations under the European
Economic Area Agreement.
APD is charged according to where the passenger's journey ends. For journeys
ending in the UK or any other EC Member State the rate is Pounds 5. Return
journeys in the UK are only taxed once.
In any other case the rate is Pounds 10, except for journeys to Basle and
Geneva - which are treated as Pounds 5 destinations because of their
location on the Swiss-French border and the difficulty of determining
whether a passenger to these airports will end up in France or Switzerland -
and, by extra statutory concession, journeys to destinations in the EEA
which are outside the EC.
As of January 1 1995 the system for charging interest on arrears of APD will
be brought into line with those for insurance premium tax and VAT to ensure
uniformity between the taxes and to have an efficient system for collecting
interest on arrears of APD, which would otherwise have to be collected by
civil proceedings.
Under changes in insolvency legislation, APD debts will have preferential
status in Great Britain and Northern Ireland to bring the position on APD
into line with that for other duties and taxes collected by Customs.

The rules on the VAT partial exemption de minimis limit are to change, to
help combat tax avoidance estimated to cost Pounds 20m a year.
Customs and Excise said: 'From December 1 1994, to qualify for treatment
under the de minimis limit, businesses must satisfy the additional condition
that VAT incurred on the exempt supplies they make (exempt input tax) must
be no more than 50 per cent of the VAT on all their purchases.'

share issues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The issue of shares within the EU is exempt from VAT, which means that
traders making an issue cannot reclaim the VAT on any associated costs. VAT
avoidance schemes have been set up to avoid this by selling a few shares
outside the EU, because VAT on the costs of selling shares to purchasers
outside the EU is recoverable.
From accounting periods starting on or after December 1 1994, businesses
will have to identify more precisely the VAT they incur on shares issued
outside the EU.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Benefits from change of
ownership to be withdrawn - Unused tax relief
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Proposals to reduce the loss of corporation tax which can occur when an
investment company with unused tax reliefs changes hands were annnounced by
the Inland Revenue.
It said the proposal would yield about Pounds 30m in 1996-97 and subsequent
years, 'and will prevent further loss of tax from any increase in this
activity'.
The proposal is that tax relief be withdrawn 'for management expenses and
charges carried forward where the ownership of an investment company changes
and:
there is a major change in the nature or conduct of its business, or its
business revives, having become small or negligible before the change, or
there is a significant increase in the company's capital; or
an asset is acquired from a company in the purchasing group after the change
in ownership and disposed of shortly afterwards'.
The new rules apply to changes in ownership on or after today, except where
the change occurs under a contract entered into before today.
'In some cases, investment companies with unused tax reliefs carried forward
(management expenses and charges) have been bought, and new investments have
been put into them, in order to use the tax reliefs against income and
capital gains generated by those investments.
'Income and gains made under one ownership are thereby sheltered from
corporation tax by excess tax reliefs generated under a different ownership,
despite the fact that the company may be carrying on a different business
and/or operating on a different scale after the change of ownership.
'In other cases, a purchasing group of companies passes an asset into the
newly acquired investment company, then sells it, setting the unused
management expenses against the chargeable gain.
'In this way, a gain about to be realised by the group is sheltered from
corporation tax.
'The Chancellor's proposals are intended to limit the circumstances in which
unused tax reliefs can be used following a change of ownership. They mirror
existing provisions which apply to trading losses, capital losses, and
surplus advance corporation tax when ownership of a company changes. They
use the same definition of 'change of ownership', and apply similar tests in
determining the availability of certain reliefs during a period which
contains a change of ownership.
'One provision operates to deny any use of excess management expenses and
charges (such as interest payments) at the date of the change of ownership
for periods after that change. It takes effect in any of three different
circumstances:
where, during a three year period, a company has both a change of ownership
and a major change in the nature or conduct of its business;
where a business has become small or negligible before a change in
ownership, and is significantly revived following the change;
where there is a significant increase in the capital of the company in the
year before the change, or the three years after the change.
'A second provision applies where an asset has been acquired via a no
gain/no loss transfer from another group member after the company's change
in ownership, and has been disposed of within three years of that change. It
prevents the company from setting excess management expenses and charges
from before the change in ownership against chargeable gains on the asset
concerned.
'Management expenses and charges are allowed when they are paid or
disbursed, unlike trading expenditure which is allowed as it accrues. The
proposal also applies to accrued management expenses and charges so it will
apply where management expenses or charges have been accruing in the company
to be sold and are only paid after the change of ownership. These proposals
will not apply to life insurance companies.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Tax relief extended to
boost appeal of simplified system - Enterprise Investment Scheme
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Enterprise Investment Scheme is to be simplified and tax reliefs
available under it extended, the chancellor announced yesterday.
In a statement, the Inland Revenue said the aim was to make the scheme more
attractive and easier for companies and investors to use.
It said: 'The tax reliefs will be extended by allowing the tax on a
chargeable gain arising from the disposal of any assets on or after today,
to be deferred where the gain is reinvested in a subscription for shares
under the EIS. The subscription will continue to qualify, in addition, for
the existing 20 per cent income tax relief and capital gains tax exemption.'
The scheme will be simplified by:
abolishing the interests in land rule which, broadly, denies relief when
more than half a company's assets are in the form of land and buildings;
abolishing the parallel trades rule which denies relief in some
circumstances when similar trades are carried on by different companies
under common control;
abolishing a rule which denies relief in some circumstances when a company
makes a rights issue;
enabling shareholders to retain their capital gains tax exemption when
companies which have used the scheme merge.
'All the above changes apply with effect from today. There are also a number
of minor proposals to ensure the scheme provisions work as intended. Some of
the changes also apply to BES companies.
'A new relief will allow an investor to defer a chargeable gain arising on
any disposal when the investor subscribes for shares under the EIS. The
deferred gain will be brought back into charge in certain circumstances, for
example if the company ceases to be a qualifying company under the EIS
rules.
'The relief will apply to disposals made on or after today. It will be
available when the subscription for shares under the EIS is made in a period
beginning one year before and ending three years after the disposal.
'Income tax relief at 20 per cent will continue to apply. Where both reliefs
apply to a subscription an investor may qualify for total initial tax relief
of up to 60 per cent (20 per cent income tax relief and 40 per cent capital
gains tax postponement in the case of a higher rate tax payer).
'The interests in land rule broadly prevents relief from being given if more
than half of the value of the company's assets is represented by land and
buildings. The rule must be observed throughout a relevant period of,
generally, three years from the day the shares are issued. If the rule is
broken, relief is withdrawn from the investor.
'This rule will be abolished with effect from today. Abolition will apply
not only in the case of companies which have yet to issue shares under the
EIS, but also to companies which have already issued shares under either the
EIS or the BES in respect of that part of their relevant periods which has
not yet elapsed. Abolition will also apply for the purpose of capital gains
tax re-investment relief.
'The parallel trades rule denies relief, for investment in a company, to an
individual who is part of a group of persons who control that company and
another company or business carrying on a similar trade. The rule will be
abolished for shares issued on or after today.'
Under existing rules part of the relief given to an individual if the
company makes a rights issue at a discount during the five years after the
issue of the shares on which the relief is given may be withdrawn.
'Relief may also be withdrawn if an individual disposes of the rights. The
rule will be abolished for rights issues on or after today. Abolition will
also apply for the purpose of the BES.
'Under existing rules, some shareholders who have invested under the EIS can
lose entitlement to capital gains tax exemption for future periods when
companies merge.
The rules will be changed for mergers (and other transactions to which
sections 135 and 136 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 apply) on
or after today so that all shareholders will continue to enjoy the capital
gains tax exemption on shares which they have held for at least five years,
when one company which has raised money through the EIS mergers with another
company which has also done so. The changes will also apply to the BES, and
to mergers between EIS and BES companies.
'The Finance Bill will contain other measures to ensure the scheme works as
intended.' In particular:
the capital gains tax exemption will not be restricted where an investor has
insufficient income tax liability to make full use of the 20 per cent
relief;
a loss made on the disposal of shares to which some income tax relief is
attributable will be an allowable loss for capital gains tax purposes.
These changes will be backdated to the start of the scheme on 1 January
1994.
'As another measure to ensure the scheme works as intended, the capital
gains tax exemption will be restricted if the investor or another
shareholder receives value from the company in certain forms.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Changes to rules will end
the 'uncertainty' - Roll-over relief
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rules governing business asset roll-over relief from capital gains tax for
companies within groups are to be changed.
The Inland Revenue said in a statement the move would:
'Give statutory backing to a long standing practice concerning availability
of roll-over relief for groups of companies.
Prevent companies receiving excessive relief when assets are transferred
between members of a group.
Extend relief available when land subject to a compulsory purchase order is
sold by one group member, and replacement land bought by another group
member.
Legislate for an existing extra-statutory concession.
'The Chancellor's intention is to remove uncertainty over how roll-over
relief for groups of companies operates to ensure that it does so as was
always intended, and to prevent loss of tax through manipulation of the
relief by groups.'
The new measures will apply where either the disposal of the original asset,
or the acquisition of its replacement, takes place on or after Budget day,
and to claims made on or after that day. The statutory backing for the
Revenue's long-standing practice is deemed to have had effect from 6 April
1965.
Preventing 'roll-around' should produce some Pounds 50m in extra revenue in
1996-97, and subsequent years, and also prevent a further loss of tax from
use of this device. The extension of roll-over relief for compulsory
purchases of land should have a negligible cost.
'The changes will:-
Give statutory backing for the current practice which allows roll-over
relief when one company within a group disposes of an asset at a gain, but
another company in the group acquires the replacement asset. This clarifies
the position following the case of Campbell Connelly &amp; Co. v Barnett.
Prevent 'roll around', which currently allows group members to secure
roll-over relief when existing assets are transferred between group members,
but no new asset is brought into the group.
Allow roll-over relief between members of a group of companies when land is
disposed of by one member of a group as a result of a compulsory purchase
order, and replacement land is acquired by another group member.
Legislate for an existing extra-statutory concession (ESC D30) which gives
roll-over relief where assets are used in a trade carried on by a group of
companies, but are held by a non-trading member of the group.
1 Roll-over relief under Section 152 Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act (TCGA)
1992 allows a business to replace its trading assets without incurring an
immediate tax charge. Tax arising on the sale of a business asset may be
deferred or 'rolled-over' if the proceeds from the sale are used to acquire
another qualifying business asset. The deferred charge is reinstated when
the replacement asset itself is sold.
2 For the purposes of roll-over relief, companies within a group have, in
practice, always been treated as if they were a single company. This allowed
one company in a group to roll-over a gain made on the sale of an asset
against the acquisition cost of another asset, even though the new asset was
acquired by a different group company.
3 The case of Campbell Connelly &amp; Co. Ltd v Barnett cast doubt on the
statutory basis of this practice. In September 1992, the then Financial
Secretary to the Treasury announced that roll-over relief would continue to
be available as before. The Chancellor's proposal will now give legislative
backing to the Financial Secretary's announcement. Subject to a formal
claim, roll-over relief will be given on the same basis as under the earlier
practice.
4 An equivalent to roll-over is available when a person disposes of land
subject to a compulsory purchase order, and acquires replacement land. The
Chancellor's proposal will provide this relief when different companies in a
group make the acquisition and disposal.
5 Under Section 171 TCGA 1992, an asset can be transferred within a group
without a tax charge arising (a 'no gain/no loss' transfer). At present, an
asset acquired in this way can be treated as a replacement asset for
roll-over relief purposes. Companies can use these arrangements to defer
paying tax on a capital gain despite the fact that the group as a whole has
made no new acquisition. These arrangements, known as 'roll around',
effectively grant roll-over relief in circumstances never originally
envisaged.
6 The Chancellor's proposal will prevent relief being given when no new
asset is acquired by the group.
7 Strictly, roll-over relief is only available to a company which is itself
trading. Extra Statutory Concession D30 gives relief for assets used in a
trade by members of a group, even though the company which actually holds
the asset does not itself trade. The Chancellor proposes to legislate for
this concession as part of the package for roll-over relief.
'The Board of Inland Revenue has determined under Section 42(5) of the Taxes
Management Act 1970 that a claim to roll-over relief under Section 152-159
of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 shall be made in writing, with
seven specifications.
Where the claim to relief is made by virtue of Section 175(2A) TCGA 1992,
the claim shall be made jointly by the two companies involved.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Expense exemption lifts
employers' burden - Regulation of business
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A number of measures to help lift the regulatory burden on business
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
including a reduction in business's compliance burdens - was among the
proposals outlined by the Inland Revenue.
The Revenue said: 'A de minimis exemption for personal incidental expenses
paid for by employers is being introduced solely to reduce employers' costs
as part of the move to self assessment. The measure will exempt from tax
payments up to Pounds 5 (Pounds 10 when abroad) for employees' personal
expenses when they stay away from home on business. This is another change
that has been proposed in response to a number of representations made by
business.
'The proposal to remove the existing income tax charge on employees whose
employers pay for their liability insurance or meet their work-related
uninsured liabilities such as legal costs will end a reporting requirement
to the Inland Revenue as well as sparing employers the complex task of
apportionments of premiums between themselves and their employees. There
will be similar compliance savings for employers as a result of the revised
treatment for replacement beneficial loans announced on November 3.
'The chancellor has also announced further progress on the alignment of NICs
and income tax. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary will be issuing
further details of this today.
'The Chancellor also confirmed that the Inland Revenue and the Contributions
Agency are exploring ways of working more closely together, with a view to
providing a better service to employers. The intention will be to remove any
unnecessary overlaps at the margins between the departments to ensure that a
consistent approach to business can be made.
'The Chancellor also confirmed that the Inland Revenue and Customs and
Excise have now drawn up plans for closer working between the two revenue
departments as anticipated in the government's white paper on
competitiveness.
'In drawing up these plans the departments have consulted with business to
establish what changes they would like to see made. Two clear messages came
through. Business wants:
quick and easy access to authoritative and clear advice
the revenue departments to detect the non-compliant and uphold the law.
'The closer working plans aim to meet these objectives. They include a range
of projects to improve access to information such as shared telephone
helplines, along with a freer exchange of information between the two
departments (while retaining the same standards of privacy to information
received as a result of any such exchanges as they do to information
received direct).
'For small employers, the chancellor confirmed that he will raise by Pounds
150 a month the level below which deductions under PAYE and NICs can be paid
to Inland Revenue quarterly rather than monthly.
'Ministers have sought to avoid measures which would add to burdens on
business. But keeping the tax system up to date has inevitably meant that
some new burdens will be imposed. The changes listed below will, however,
bring other benefits and the impact on small companies of these various
measures will be negligible. Compliance cost assessments have been prepared
for the following measures:
payments between connected companies: the measure removes some of the
perceived harshness of the current rules applying to thinly capitalised
companies and amplifies them to provide more certainty. Some companies
making payments to connected companies will face a modest increase in
compliance costs.
Deferral of personal pension annuity purchase: this will give personal
pension scheme members increased flexibility in the way they use their
personal pension fund and will introduce some new compliance costs for the
financial institutions which provide personal pensions and choose to offer
the new flexibility.
'The move to self assessment will mean an ongoing reduction in overall
compliance costs for businesses generally. This is mainly because of the
removal of the cumbersome system of estimated assessments and appeals for
the self-employed.
'Compliance cost assessments are normally prepared only where a measure has
introduced a new burden on business. But an extensive compliance cost
assessment has been prepared for self assessment because the detailed impact
of the package will vary between businesses - including, for example, some
which may face higher costs because of the new rules for employers who
provide benefits in kind. And a change of this nature - representing the
biggest change to the administration of direct taxation since PAYE was
introduced over 50 years ago - will inevitably bring some transitional
costs.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Their Budget): The farmer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Butler, 44: Wiltshire farmer whose 1,500-acre dairy and arable farm
provides the family partnership with an income of over Pounds 100,000 a
year.
Politics: Conservative.
Wanted: Stable interest rates. Tax changes to encourage investment in
agriculture, and more generous capital allowances on investment in farm
buildings and machinery.
And a 'cry from the heart': Simpler capital gains tax. The complexity of the
current system - particularly for dairy farmers grappling with milk quotas -
costs a fortune in professional fees. Said yesterday: 'I have no quarrel
with the Budget aim of sustainable growth but I'm disappointed on many of
the specifics for agriculture. The failure to put in any tax incentives for
let land, either through further inheritance tax relief or removing other
tax burdens, means the new farm tenancy legislation will be very
ineffective. We had to have tax reform for that to work.'
He was disappointed there will be no increase in capital allowances. 'The
chancellor hasn't grasped that the majority of farm businesses are run as
partnerships or sole traders and haven't benefited from cuts in corporation
tax. The removal of 25 per cent grants on farm waste handling facilities -
for silage and slurry - is very shortsighted from a government intent on
reducing pollution. The rise in fuel tax hits farmers and others in rural
areas particularly hard.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Package of measures
simplifies complex area of VAT law - Tax treatment of property
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A package of measures on the VAT treatment of construction, and land and
property was announced yesterday, with the intention of deregulating and
simplifying a complex area of VAT law, assisting the construction industry
and blocking a tax avoidance device.
Customs and excise said from March 1, 1995, VAT zero-rating for conversion
of non-residential property into dwellings 'will be legislated for and
extended to cover most other forms of accommodation.
'The measure means developers will be able to reclaim the VAT incurred in
the course of conversion and follows consultation with trade interests.
'The distinction for VAT between new and existing buildings will be
clarified. Until now the absence of a satisfactory distinction has been a
source of much litigation as developers have tried to get the benefit of the
zero rate for new housing.
'There will be legislative cover for two extra statutory concessions which
allow builders to reclaim the VAT on ventilation, burglar and fire alarms,
and other safety equipment installed in new housing.
'From November 30, 1994, the 'lease and lease back' tax avoidance scheme
some developers have used to spread their VAT bills on business property for
between 20 and 2,000 years, will be blocked.
'From March 1, 1995, the developers' self-supply charge on business.
property will be repealed as a deregulatory measure at the request of the
trade. The rules which give landlords the choice of charging VAT (the option
to tax) on business rents will be simplified and relaxed.
'From shortly after Royal Assent, the VAT rules governing property owned by
more than one person will be simplified as a deregulatory measure at the
request of the trade.
'The 'lease and lease back' avoidance scheme has been used by developers to
spread VAT liabilities incurred constructing a building intended for use in
a business making supplies which are exempt from VAT. Typical users are
banks developing their own properties.
'New buildings constructed for business use are standard- rated for VAT. If
the building is purchased for an exempt business use the purchaser cannot
reclaim the VAT on the purchase price. If the developer is building for
their own exempt use, they cannot reclaim the VAT incurred on the cost of
construction, ie the VAT 'sticks'.
'In total the net additional revenue to the exchequer is estimated at Pounds
15m in 1994-95 and Pounds 150m 1995-96, when the yield of Pounds 210m from
the anti-avoidance measure will be partly offset by the Pounds 60m cost of
the deregulation/simplification changes.

Politics: Not committed, but feels Kenneth Clarke has done a good job as
chancellor.
Said yesterday: 'There were encouraging remarks regarding interest rates,
dispelling some of the pessimism in the City. He has recognised that our
industry has a major problem on excise duty differential resulting in
illegal bootlegging and lost jobs but to expect the European Community to
work together to harmonise duty and resolve a peculiarly British problem is
pretty naive.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Tax encouragement for
investment in smaller businesses - Venture Capital Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
To promote investment in smaller businesses additional tax reliefs are being
introduced for Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs). Investments in VCTs will
receive 20 per cent up-front relief on up to Pounds 100,000 a year, provided
the shares are held for at least five years. Dividends and capital gains
will also be tax-free. The tax on up to Pounds 100,000 of capital gains on
other assets may be deferred when they are reinvested in new VCT shares. The
new reliefs will cost Pounds 150m in 1995-96 and Pounds 290m the following
year.
VCTs are aimed at promoting a culture of investing in risk and encourage the
many active British entrepreneurs. This is a new scheme, aimed at generating
risk capital in the unquoted company sector, while giving investors the
security of a quoted pooled vehicle. Companies can raise up to Pounds 1m a
year through the scheme.
The Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) will also be enhanced by extending
capital gains tax reinvestment relief to investments in the EIS. To simplify
the scheme, the rules on interests in land and parallel trades, and a rule
which can deny relief when a company makes a rights issue, will be
abolished.
To widen small companies' access to external finance representatives of
small business and others will be consulted on the development of a
financial management certificate. The aim would be to devise a certificate
that provided a clear signal of a company's financial competence, providing
an incentive for them to improve and implement financial management skills.
The Loan Guarantee Scheme will be made simpler and more attractive.
To help businesses in difficulty the president of the Board of Trade will
issue a paper on insolvency reform.
An important element will be a 28-day moratorium that will be binding on all
parties. This will give management a breathing space to assess the rescue
prospects and to come to an arrangement with creditors. There will be
safeguards to prevent abuse, and to preserve integrity of financial markets.
The government will also consult further on a mechanism to assist the
substitution of equity for the debt of companies in administration or
receivership. This could have a profound influence on behaviour during
insolvency negotiations and lead all parties to focus on the potential of
the business for continued trading.
Separately, individuals will now be able to claim tax relief on necessary
expenditure after trading has ceased.
To reduce burdens on small businesses the average monthly payment threshold
below which small employers can account quarterly for PAYE and national
insurance contributions will be raised from Pounds 450 to Pounds 600.
Traders will be consulted on a move to annual VAT returns and payments for
small businesses. It is envisaged that those who voluntarily register for
VAT will make annual returns by the end of 1995, with a possible extension
to businesses with an annual turnover below Pounds 100,000 the following
year.
Dispensations given to employers by the Inland Revenue on tax-free expenses
paid to employees will also count for national insurance purposes.
The VAT registration threshold will be raised from Pounds 45,000 to Pounds
46,000 and the penalty for failing to register for VAT will be reduced in
line with the 1993 changes in other VAT penalties.
The threshold above which monthly Intrastat returns must be made will be
raised from Pounds 140,000 of annual intra-EU trade to Pounds 150,000.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Moves to assist
insolvency recovery - Traders' debts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor proposes two further deregulatory changes to the rules which
limit the extent to which traders' pre-insolvency debts can be deducted from
VAT credits ('set-off') arising during an insolvency administration.
Customs and Excise said that when companies trade under administration
orders and administrative receiverships, VAT credits arising after recovery
will not be set off against debts remaining from the pre-insolvency period.
Customs also stipulated that the rules preventing set-off during the period
for which a provisional liquidator is appointed in the winding-up of a
company will also be applied during the period when an interim receiver is
appointed in the bankruptcy of an individual.
The chancellor's intention is to assist companies in their recovery from
insolvency and to respond to trade representations about minor anomalies in
existing legislation.
The chancellor also proposes to make a minor amendment to the legislation
affecting relief from VAT on bad debts. The chancellor's intention is to
clarify beyond doubt that relief is available only on supplies made on or
after April 1 1989.
The Insolvency Act 1986 enables creditors to allow a business to continue
trading while trying to make the business commercially viable. These
arrangements are known as voluntary arrangements, administration orders or
administrative receiverships.
Where there is no prospect of rescue the creditors may take action to have
the business declared formally insolvent, either through bankruptcy or
liquidation.
The cost to the Exchequer is estimated to be negligible.
The current bad debt relief scheme allows the recovery of VAT charged on any
supplies or services which remain unpaid after a 'waiting period'.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Cash flow boosted for
employers - Staged deductions under PAYE and NIC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is planned to raise by Pounds 150 a month the level below which
deductions under Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and National Insurance Contributions
(NIC) can be paid to the Inland Revenue quarterly rather than monthly. For
deductions made in periods beginning after April 5 1995 employers will be
able to pay quarterly if their average monthly payments are less than Pounds
600. The present limit is Pounds 450 a month.
The chancellor's intention is to give an additional 100,000 employers the
opportunity to benefit from improved cash flow and reduced administrative
costs. This will bring the number of employers who could benefit to 750,000
 -more than 60 per cent of employers.
The change will also apply to payments by contractors in the construction
industry.
At present, employers whose average monthly payments to the Inland Revenue
of PAYE and NIC are less than Pounds 450 in total can choose to pay
quarterly rather than monthly. This limit will be increased to Pounds 600
for deductions made in periods beginning after April 5 1995.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Package aims to get the
unemployed back to work - Incentives for employers and aid for former
claimants
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Under a banner of new work incentives and a budget for work, the chancellor
announced a Pounds 680m package of measures to help the unemployed back to
work and reduce the cost to employers of taking them on.
There are four measures to encourage employers to take on people who have
been out of work, particularly for long spells:
Employer national insurance contributions cut by 0.6 per cent from April
1995, for all employees earning less than Pounds 205 a week, at a cost to
the Treasury of Pounds 250m a year.
Employer NIC holiday: from April 1996, employers who take on someone who has
been out of work for at least two years will be able to get a full NIC
rebate for that person for up to one year. On average, employers will save
more than Pounds 300 for every person they take on, at a cost of Pounds 45m
a year.
Expansion of Work Trials scheme: there will be more opportunities for
employers who give people who have been unemployed for more than six months
a three-week trial in a job before deciding whether to take them on
permanently. Unemployed people will continue to receive their benefits
during the trial, so the scheme is free to employers. There will be 150,000
Work Trial places over the next three years, costing Pounds 30m.
* New Workstart pilot schemes: there will be more grants for employers who
take on the long-term unemployed, through further Workstart pilots. Details
of the pilots are to be finalised, but around 5,000 people will benefit at a
total cost of Pounds 8m.
In addition, the Chancellor announced four measures to ease the transition
from unemployment to work:
Speeding up housing benefit and council tax benefit, plus four-week rent and
council tax guarantee for people taking jobs. From April 1996 people who
have been out of work for at least six months will be able to get their
housing benefit and council tax benefit paid at full existing rates for the
first four weeks after they take a job. The aim will also be to ensure
people are told how much continuing help they will get with housing and
council tax benefit within the four weeks, and that this will be paid
promptly. The scheme will cost Pounds 50m a year and 440,000 people will
benefit. The government will shortly be consulting local authorities who are
responsible for paying housing benefit and council tax benefit.
Speeding up the payment of family credit The government plans that by April
1996, 95 per cent of family credit claims from employees will be dealt with
within five working days of the claim being received by the Department of
Social Security. The cost is Pounds 5m a year and 400,000 people will
benefit.
announced in October, will be tax free. People who lose benefit because they
do a few hours work while claiming income support or the new Jobseeker's
Allowance will get a cash lump sum of up to Pounds 1,000 when they move to
work of at least 16 hours.
National extension of Jobfinder's Grant: Up to 25,000 grants will be
available to people who have been unemployed for at least two years when
they start a lower-paid job, to help with initial work expenses. The grants
are worth an average Pounds 200 each and will cost Pounds 5m a year.
Two measures to help people who want full-time work:
Extra money for family credit claimants working full-time: anyone who is
entitled to family credit who takes a full-time job (at least 30 hours a
week) will get an extra Pounds 10 a week, from July 1995, at a cost of
Pounds 205m a year. People who also receive housing benefit and council tax
benefit will be able to keep an extra Pounds 10 of income before these
benefits are affected, guaranteeing that they will benefit by the full
amount of the extra family credit. Some 350,000 families on low incomes will
be helped.
Further Jobmatch pilot schemes: people who have been unable to find a
full-time job will be helped to build up full-time hours and wages by taking
on a number of part-time jobs. The design of the new pilots is being
finalised, but there will be up to 3,000 opportunities at an annual cost of
Pounds 5m.
For the unemployed, there were three measures to keep unemployed people in
touch with the labour market:
National extension of 1-2-1 interviews and Workwise courses: help for 18 to
24s unemployed for a year to look for work more effectively
Community Action: work experience and help in looking for work for long-term
unemployed.
The measures also included a Pounds 25m pilot scheme for unemployed people
without children. The pilot scheme will run for three years from October
1996, and include 20,000 people or one in 25 childless people in the UK. If
they show the scheme is successful, the government will consider introducing
the benefit nationally. Consultations on the details of the scheme will
begin in April 1995.
Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, welcomed the budget measures
and said: 'Prospects look good. Unemployment is down by 455,000 from the
December 1992 peak and by a third of a million compared with a year ago. We
have more of our working-age population in jobs than any of our major
European partners. Our Employment Service is meeting and beating its
toughest ever targets to place unemployed people into jobs. And the new
Jobseeker's Allowance will ensure that our benefit system is simplified and
more than ever geared to helping every individual who wants work.'

Faulty cabling will be protected by automatic fuse switches and the
sprinkler system will have increased capacity and be made more reliable.
The Department of National Heritage plans to hand over the building to the
British Library during the last quarter of 1996. It will then be for the
Library to implement its plans for occupation and thereafter open to readers
and the public.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Education spending set to
rise by 4% to Pounds 11bn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Education secretary Gillian Shephard announced a Pounds 427m increase in
government spending on education. The budgets of the Department for
Education and Ofsted will total almost Pounds 11bn with a 4 per cent rise -
1 per cent in real terms - over 1994-95 levels. The 1994-95 figure itself
represents a real terms increase of 5 per cent over last year's expenditure.
Total central government provision for capital expenditure on county,
voluntary and grant-maintained schools is Pounds 621m, Pounds 672m and
Pounds 661m in 1995-96, 1996-97 and 1997-98 respectively. In the first two
years, this is an increase of Pounds 14m and Pounds 27m respectively over
the figures announced at the time of the last Budget. The private finance
initiative is expected to make an increasing contribution in the schools
sector.
Mrs Shephard also announced plans for grant-maintained and voluntary aided
schools have become technology colleges. Additional money will be provided
for the programme: Pounds 15m in 1995-96, rising to Pounds 20m and Pounds
25m in the following years to extend the programme to secondary schools
wishing to develop a special strength in foreign languages. The programme,
which has up to now been limited to grant-maintained and voluntary aided
schools, will be open to all maintained secondary schools. By 1997-98, the
Department hopes over 200 schools will be taking part in the programme.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Amendments in wake of
changes in accounting - Profit-related pay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rules governing profit-related pay schemes are to change with the aim of
ensuring that, after a recent change in accounting practice, tax relief for
PRP can continue to be linked as closely as possible to profits which
genuinely reflect the efforts of the employees in the scheme.
Under the proposed changes, the following could be taken into account or
left out of account in drawing up profit and loss accounts for PRP purposes:
profits or losses on the sale or termination of an operation;
costs of a fundamental restructuring having a material effect on operations;
profits or losses on the disposal of fixed assets;
the tax effects of any of these items.
The proposed changes will replace the current treatment of 'extraordinary
items' for PRP purposes. This will apply to profit and loss accounts for
profit periods beginning on or after the date of Royal assent to the finance
bill.
The PRP legislation provides that 'extraordinary items' may be left out of
account, or taken into account, in drawing up profit and loss accounts for
registered PRP schemes, notwithstanding the accounting requirements imposed
by the Companies Acts.
At the time the legislation was introduced, 'extraordinary items' were
defined, in Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 6 (SSAP 6), to include
a range of items which could not be said to reflect the efforts of the
workforce.
The recent replacement of SSAP 6 by Financial Reporting Standard 3 (FRS 3)
has altered the definition of 'extraordinary items'. Many items which might
previously have been treated as 'extraordinary' for accountancy purposes may
no longer be so treated.
That change makes it more difficult for businesses to draw up PRP schemes
under which PRP is closely linked to profits which genuinely reflect
employees' efforts.
The Inland Revenue announced in July that this change would require an
amendment to the tax legislation.
The chancellor proposes to replace the reference to 'extraordinary items' in
the PRP legislation with a reference to the following three categories of
'exceptional items', which FRS 3 requires to be shown separately on the face
of the profit and loss account after operating profit:
profits or losses on the sale or termination of an operation;
costs of a fundamental restructuring having a material effect on operations;
profits or losses on the disposal of fixed assets.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Tax net falls on some
securities linked to indices - Capital gains
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor proposed measures to ensure that 'certain securities linked
to a share index are chargeable to capital gains tax'.
The Inland Revenue explained that the intention was 'to end the situation
whereby quoted securities whose value depends on share prices can be
qualifying corporate bonds so that profits on disposal escape tax'. The
change will apply to disposals on or after today.
The Revenue said profits on the disposal or redemption of 'deep gain'
securities were chargeable as income. 'But there is an exception from deep
gains treatment for 'qualifying indexed securities.'
'These are securities subject to a number of detailed conditions but, in
particular, linked to the retail prices index or a similar overseas general
index of retail prices, or quoted securities whose value is linked to an
index of share prices.
'Securities linked to a United Kingdom share index have been issued which
can benefit from both the QCB exemption from capital gains tax and the deep
gains exemption for qualifying indexed securities. The result is that
profits on disposal of such securities would generally not be liable to tax.
'This could lead to significant loss of tax and to distortion in the
investment market.' The chancellor's proposals will prevent this by ensuring
that with effect for disposals on or after today these securities are, like
the underlying shares which determine their value, within the charge to
capital gains tax.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Change to remove obstacle
to provision by employers - Liability insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has moved to meet concern about a possible obstacle to the
provision of liability insurance by employers for employees and to payments
by employers for employees' work-related liabilities which could have been
insured against.
The Inland Revenue said the proposal 'would put employees who meet their own
liability insurance costs or uninsured liabilities on the same footing as
employees whose costs are borne by their employer.'
With effect from April 6 1995, the chancellor proposes to:
Remove the charge to tax on employees when employers pay for their liability
insurance or meet work-related uninsured liabilities.
Give relief for employees' own expenditure on liability insurance and
work-related uninsured liabilities, including expenditure up to six years
after the year in which the employment ends.
The Revenue explained: 'Under current income tax law, payments by employees
or directors for liability insurance, such as directors' and officers'
liability insurance or professional indemnity insurance, do not qualify for
tax relief.
'This is because the expenditure is not considered to be incurred wholly,
exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of the
employment.
'Payments by employers to provide liability insurance which protects
employees or directors are taxable as a benefit in kind for directors and
those employees earning a rate of Pounds 8,500 a year or more.
'Payments by employees or directors for uninsured personal liabilities
arising from their activities at work, such as legal costs in defending an
action brought against them, do not qualify for tax relief. Payments by
employers to meet employees' or directors uninsured personal liabilities are
taxable.
'On 12 May 1994 the Inland Revenue published a consultative paper entitled
'Schedule E: Liability Insurance And Payments To Meet Uninsured
Liabilities'.
'There were 92 responses to the consultative paper from representative
bodies, financial institutions, the insurance industry and others. Most
favoured an exemption from a benefit in kind tax charge for liability
insurance premiums paid by employers.
'Responses generally favoured an exemption covering all legally insurable
risks. Most responses also favoured relief for payments by employers to meet
employees' uninsured liabilities to match any new relief for insured
liabilities.
'Most of the responses also said that there should be tax relief for
liability insurance premiums paid by directors and employees, and were also
in favour of tax relief for expenditure by individuals to meet their own
uninsured liabilities.
'The chancellor proposes to change the law to:
exempt from any benefit in kind charge directors and employees whose
liability insurance premiums are paid by their employer;
exempt from income tax payments by employers to meet employees' uninsured
liabilities (such as legal costs) arising from their work, but only where
the liabilities could have been insured against: in other words, liabilities
arising from, for example, criminal convictions will not attract relief;
give employees tax relief for expenses incurred to provide their own
liability insurance and to meet their own uninsured liabilities, in line
with the exemption for employer-funded insurance and uninsured liabilities.
'Relief will also be available to former employees who, after the employment
has ceased, pay for liability insurance or meet uninsured liabilities
relating to their work. The relief will be given against the income and
gains in the year the expenditure is incurred, for up to six years after the
year in which the employment ceased. 'The new relief will apply from the tax
year 1995-96 onwards.
'It will also have a helpful deregulatory effect by relieving employers of
the need to provide the Revenue with details of liability insurance provided
for employees or payments for uninsured liabilities. Employees will be able
to claim the new relief for their own expenditure on liability insurance and
uninsured liabilities on or after 6 April 1995.
'The Department of Social Security intend to bring forward Regulations to
parallel the new exemptions for employer-funded liability insurance and
uninsured liabilities for National Insurance Contributions purposes. It is
estimated that the cost of this proposal will be about Pounds 40m a year'.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Individuals can offset
trading expenditure - Post-cessation tax relief
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is to be a new tax relief for individuals' expenditure, such as
professional indemnity insurance premiums, incurred after a trade or
profession has ceased. The intention is to relieve genuine 'trading'
expenses which do not at present qualify for tax relief. The change will
take effect for expenditure which qualifies on or after today.
The Inland Revenue explained: 'At present, no relief is available under the
tax system for expenditure incurred after a trade or profession has ceased,
unless the expenditure is provided for in the final accounts or there are
post-cessation receipts against which the post-cessation expenditure can be
set.
'From today, certain post-cessation expenditure, closely related to the
trading or professional activities while they were carried on, can be set
against income and capital gains to the extent that relief is not available
under the present rules.
'The new relief will be restricted to individuals, and limited to particular
types of loss or expenses which can be seen to relate directly to the
trading or professional activities. These are:
the costs of remedying defective work done, goods supplied, or services
rendered while the trade or profession was continuing and damages paid by
the taxpayer in respect of such defective work, goods or services whether
awarded by a Court or agreed during negotiations on a claim;
insurance premiums paid to insure against the costs above;
legal and other professional expenses incurred in connection with the costs
above;
debts owed to the business which have been taken into account in computing
the profits or gains of the trade or profession before discontinuance but
which have subsequently become bad;
the costs of collecting debts which have been taken into account in
computing the profits of the trade before discontinuance.
'If in the final accounting period of the trade a deduction was given for
expenses unpaid at cessation, and those expenses remain unpaid at the end of
the year of assessment in which the new relief is given, the amount of the
new relief will be reduced by the amount of the unpaid expense. (If the
unpaid expense is subsequently paid it will be eligible for new relief in
the year of assessment in which it is paid.)
'The new relief will be set against income and capital gains of the year of
assessment in which the expense is paid.
'Where there is insufficient income or capital gains to cover the
expenditure, the unrelieved expenditure of that year will not be able to be
carried forward under the new relief arrangements against future income or
capital gains. (However the unrelieved expenditure will continue to be able
to be carried forward under the present post-cessation relief arrangements
to be set against any post-cessation receipts which may arise in the
future.)
'The new relief will apply to expenditure which qualifies in a period of
seven years after a trade ceases. If an insurance policy is taken out in
relation to the expenditure for which relief may be allowed under the new
proposal and amounts are received in connection with that policy, these
amounts are to be treated as post-cessation receipts under the present
post-cessation arrangements.
'The same treatment will be given to recoveries of expenditure from any
other person and to recoveries of debts for which relief has been allowed
under the new proposal.
'Claims for the new relief must be made within two years after the end of
the year of assessment in which the expense is paid. The cost of the new
relief will be about Pounds 10m a year.'
Changes to tax rules for life insurance companies will allow annuities and
some interest to be deducted when it is necessary to measure the trading
profits of a life insurance business and prevent a loss being used more than
once. The rules also amend the way income and gains are attributed to
different classes of business to minimise distortions when a company changes
its valuation basis.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Red Book Details): Spending plans cut for a third
year
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's objective is to reduce public spending as a share of
national income over time. The plans for public expenditure set out in this
Budget are consistent with that objective.
The public expenditure survey covers the period from 1995-96 to 1997-98. In
each year, the new plans are well below those announced in the last
Financial Statement and Budget Report (FSBR). This reflects savings across
most programmes, partly because the price level in 1995-96 and thereafter is
now expected to be about 2 1/2 per cent lower than assumed last year.
The government's plans for public spending are set in terms of the Control
Total (previously the New Control Total). This covers over 80 per cent of
total spending. It excludes accounting adjustments and the two areas most
affected by the economic cycle (cyclical social security and debt interest):
these are included in general government expenditure, which is discussed
below.
The Control Total for the current year, 1994-95, is currently forecast at
Pounds 249.6bn, an underspend of Pounds 1.3bn compared with the plans in the
last Budget (after taking account of classification changes). Social
security and local authority spending are forecast to be higher than
planned, but that is more than covered by the Reserve of Pounds 3 1/2 bn set
last year. Elsewhere, there are minor changes in departments' expected
levels of spending and an allowance for shortfall which reflects the
Treasury's view that overall departments will underspend this year.
The Control Totals for the next three years contain Reserves of Pounds 3bn
in 1995-96, Pounds 6bn in 1996-97 and Pounds 9bn in 1997-98.
The new plans are substantially below the figures in the last FSBR. This is
the third successive Budget to reduce the spending plans set the year
before. In cash terms the plans for 1995-96 have been reduced over the last
two years by Pounds 8.3bn compared with those originally set in the 1992
Survey.
Because inflation in the current year has been lower than expected at the
time of the last Budget, the real level of spending in 1994-95 is higher
than planned last year. But the plans for the next three years are lower in
real terms than those published last year.
Year on year, the Control Total in 1995-96 is expected to be about 0.8 per
cent lower in real terms than in 1994-95. The plans then imply real terms
increases of  1/2 per cent in 1996-97 and 1 per cent in 1997-98. Average
real growth over the three year Survey period is less than  1/4 per cent a
year, well below the ceiling of 1 1/2 per cent established by the government
in 1992.
Some measures taken in this Budget directly affect public expenditure
outside the Control Total. In particular there are measures which reduce
cyclical social security, as described below.
In total, general government expenditure excluding privatisation proceeds
(GGE) is expected to be some Pounds 28bn lower over the years 1995-96 to
1997-98 than projected in last year's FSBR. The ratio of GGE to GDP is
projected to be lower throughout the period than expected in the last
Budget.
Year on year, GGE is expected to grow by 0.1 per cent in real terms between
1994-95 and 1995-96, by 1.1 per cent in 1996-97, and by 0.7 per cent in
1997-98. Average real growth over the three Survey years is 0.6 per cent,
well within the projected growth rate of the economy.
Further analysis of GGE for years up to 1994-95, by function and economic
category, will be published early next year in the Statistical Supplement.
The programme of fundamental expenditure reviews, initiated in February
1993, has continued this year. These reviews have been considering long-term
trends in spending, looking at ways in which services could be delivered
more economically and effectively, and considering whether there are any
areas from which the state should withdraw altogether. The results of these
reviews have informed this year's decisions about spending priorities, and
have contributed to some of the increases in efficiency reflected in the new
plans.
The aim is to cover all departments of state in the course of the
Parliament. The next batch of reviews will include the Department of
National Heritage, the Ministry of Agriculture and other agriculture
spending, the environmental programmes of the Department of the Environment
and the Office of Public Service and Science.
In line with the Chancellor's announcement on 14 September 1994, central
government departments are expected to offset, or more than offset, pay and
price increases through efficiencies and other economies. Budgetary
provision for the rest of the public sector has been set on a comparable
basis. Provision for the running costs of civil departments, which was
Pounds 15bn in 1994-95, has been set at Pounds 14.8bn in 1995-96, Pounds
14.7bn in 1996-97 and Pounds 14.6bn in 1997-98. Compared with previous
plans, provision has been reduced by Pounds 300m in 1995-96 and Pounds 500m
in 1996-97. The Ministry of Defence is no longer included in these figures,
but provision for its operating costs is set on the same basis.
The latest plans imply that running costs will be held broadly constant in
cash terms over the four years from 1993-94 to 1997-98. In real terms, the
plans imply a cut in running costs of 10 per cent over this period.
Departments may now carry forward all underspends on running costs to add to
provision in a later year. This allows them to manage their money sensibly
from year to year. The underspend carried forward from 1993-94 totals Pounds
270m. The plans for running costs include extra resources for the Department
of Social Security over the next two years to implement anti-fraud measures,
the jobseeker's allowance and the new incapacity benefit. There are
reductions in other departments as a result of lower unemployment and
privatisations. Radical steps to reduce staff numbers have been announced by
a number of departments, including Transport, Defence, Health and Customs
and Excise.
Total public sector capital spending (measured net of receipts from asset
sales) is expected to be Pounds 22.9bn in 1994-95, up from Pounds 21.7bn in
1993-94. The increase larcapital expenditure by local authorities.
In 1995-96 public sector capital spending is expected to be Pounds 22.2bn,
implying a significant increase in real terms on the capital spending plans
in last year's Budget. A large proportion of this is accounted for by higher
spending by local authorities, who are now expected to carry forward
significant unspent balances from the temporary relaxation of the rules
governing the use of their capital receipts. The figures for 1996-97 and
1997-98 are boosted by projected capital expenditure of around Pounds 1bn
financed by the National Lottery, which though not part of the Control Total
is included in GGE.
The level of public sector capital spending beyond 1995-96 is particularly
uncertain. After allowing for a conventional stylised allocation from the
Reserve, capital spending is expected to remain broadly flat at around
Pounds 22bn.
However, direct spending by the public sector does not tell the whole story
on capital spending. It takes no account of the impact of the private
finance initiative.
The private finance initiative was launched in 1992 and the Private Finance
Panel established under Sir Alastair Morton in November 1993. Significant
progress has been achieved in attracting private sector capital into areas
previously regarded as public, adding to overall capital spending. Around
Pounds 500m will have been invested by the end of 1994-95, and much more
will follow.
For example, taking the four transport projects announced in the 1993
Budget: 11 consortia have now pre-qualified to bid for the first four
design, build, finance and operate roads; the competition has been launched
for the Docklands Light Railway Lewisham Extension; the Civil Aviation
Authority hope very shortly to be going out to competition for the new
Scottish Air Traffic Control Centre; and the specification study for the
West Coast Main Line refurbishment will be finished by the end of the year.
In addition, London Underground have been holding a competition for the
provision of a privately financed Northern Line train service; bids are due
back in from the four pre-qualified consortia on the Channel Tunnel Rail
Link (CTRL) by March 1995; and the CTRL hybrid Bill was introduced in
Parliament on 23 November.
Over 50 projects have been completed or approved which will bring in over
Pounds 100m of capital to the NHS.
Tenders have been received for the first two privately financed prisons,
providing 1,400 places in Merseyside and South Wales. Contracts will be
awarded by April 1995 with the prisons planned to open by 1997-98.
Invitations to tender for the first secure training centre for juvenile
offenders will be issued shortly.
Around Pounds 1bn of information technology projects are currently going
down or considering the private finance route. For example three bidders
have been shortlisted to provide a replacement for the National Insurance
Recording System, with preliminary bids to be received by the end of the
year; and prequalification is under way for the project to automate post
office counters.
Overall the government expects to let contracts under the private finance
initiative next year leading to around Pounds 5bn of capital investment.
As well as building on initial successes, the private finance initiative is
developing into new areas. For example, London Underground will be
considering how to extend private finance into other areas of its business.
Key candidates include power supplies and communications. Highland Regional
Council have launched competitions for privately financed sewerage treatment
works at Fort William and Inverness. This is the start of a programme of
private finance projects in the water and sewerage sector in Scotland and
Northern Ireland potentially worth over Pounds 1bn. The Department of Social
Security will shortly be inviting private finance proposals for the
redevelopment of its site at Longbenton in Newcastle. The Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are considering using private finance for
the provision of new office facilities at Crewe and Northallerton. The Home
Office will be procuring two further prisons under the private finance
initiative, and the Scottish Office are currently looking at the case for a
privately financed prison in Scotland. The London Docklands Development
Corporation has invited tenders to form a joint venture company with them to
provide infrastructure for environmentally responsible and competitive
energy supplies in the Royal Docks. In education, universities already get
approaching one third of their income from private sources.
Savings have been found on most programmes to reflect lower inflation, tight
control of administrative costs and increased efficiency. Resources have
also been switched between programmes to reflect priorities. In particular,
savings are expected from a major effort to combat social security fraud,
and reforms of housing benefit and income support for mortgage interest. On
the other hand, the plans provide for a larger real increase in health
spending than planned last Budget, and also protect the government's
achievements on law and order and education. The science budget and the aid
programme have benefited from additions to last year's plans.
Central government support for local authorities and the financing
requirements of nationalised industries have been attributed to the
appropriate departments.
The following paragraphs briefly describe the new plans for each department.
The departmental reports to be published during February and March 1995 will
give more details.
As envisaged in last year's Budget, defence spending will continue to fall
in real terms over the coming years. The Defence Costs Study (DCS) was
successful in identifying substantial savings in the support area, while
preserving the front line. The new plans accommodate the costs of military
redundancies flowing from the DCS, and the enhancements to the front line
announced by the Secretary of State for Defence in July.
The new plans reflect the importance that the government attaches to
diplomacy following the end of the Cold War, and to the Department's
overseas political and commercial effort. Compared with the plans in last
year's Budget, the real value of provision is 2 per cent higher in 1995-96,
and 1 1/2 percent higher in 1996-97.
The UK has the sixth largest aid programme in the world and extra resources
have been added to previous plans. The real value of provision is 2 1/2 per
cent higher in 1995-96 and almost 5 per cent higher in 1996-97 than planned
in last year's Budget.
The new plans for agriculture reflect an increase in the estimated cost of
agricultural support in the UK under the Common Agricultural Policy, largely
due to a lower than expected 'green pound', which determines the rate at
which CAP support prices set in Ecu are converted into national currency.
These additions are offset by savings on domestic spending, mainly
reductions in running costs and capital grants.
Provision for DTI programmes will be higher in real terms in 1995-96 and
1996-97 than the plans in last year's Budget. DTI programmes are being
developed and strengthened in the light of the Competitiveness White Paper.
Priority is being given to the development of Business Links and services
delivered through them including support for exports, innovation and good
management practice. Improvements in delivery of DTI services and value for
money will be secured by greater involvement of the private sector.
Provision is made for the external financing limits (EFLs) of Nuclear
Electric, the Post Office and British Shipbuilders, and for meeting the cost
of residual liabilities in the coal industry after privatisation. The plans
for Nuclear Electric include the costs of a restructuring package in 1995-96
and 1996-97, which is expected to contribute to a significant increase in
efficiency in 1997-98. Provision for the Post Office is held at the levels
set in the last Budget. The plans for coal will allow offers to be made to
buy out concessionary coal entitlements in 1997-98.
The department, through its Fixed Rate Export Finance programme, provides
medium- to long-term fixed interest rate support at interest rates set by
the OECD. Increases in plans reflect ECGD's exposure to movements in
interest and exchange rates. To a limited extent they are offset by OECD
agreement to cut interest rate subsidies and technical adjustments to the
terms on offer.
The new Employment Department plans focus on helping unemployed people to
get jobs in the context of the new jobseeker's allowance. There are net
savings in both programme and running costs reflecting efficiency
improvements and lower unemployment.
A number of innovative schemes will be introduced or extended, including
incentives to employers to recruit the long-term unemployed, work experience
opportunities and targeted help with jobsearch.
There will be a major reform of the Training for Work programme aimed at
increasing the number of trainees who move into jobs. The plans also provide
for Modern Apprenticeships and the new training measures announced in the
Competitiveness White Paper.
The new plans for transport reflect the decision to reduce national roads
expenditure compared with previous plans. Central government support for
spending on local roads and transport will also be reduced. But substantial
spending to maintain and improve trunk roads and motorways in England will
continue: with over Pounds 5bn planned for the next three years. Over the
next three years it is also expected that substantial private finance will
be introduced, with the first four contracts for private sector firms to
design, build, finance and operate trunk roads due to be negotiated by the
middle of next year. This will help to minimise the impact of the reduction
in provision on the trunk road programme.
The department's programmes also include the financing of railways, together
with the external financing limits of London Transport and the Civil
Aviation Authority (CAA). Total funding for the core activities of the
railways (British Rail, Railtrack, Union Railways and European Passenger
Services) remains unchanged from previous plans in 1995-96. Other changes in
financial provision for railways over the next three financial years reflect
the effects of privatisation.
Investment in London Transport should be around Pounds 1bn in 1995-96,
including considerable support for the Jubilee Line Extension and the
Crossrail project, as well as a substantial order under the private finance
initiative for the provision of a new Northern Line train service. CAA plans
have been reduced over the period since there is further potential to
attract private finance for their investment.
The new plans incorporate a reduction in the Housing Corporation capital
provision, which will now be at a level of around Pounds 1.35bn a year.
There are substantial estimating savings on housing benefit for local
authority tenants, reflecting the lower inflation forecast and a reduction
in the number of tenants expected to need assistance. The reduced Housing
Revenue Account subsidy provision also reflects changes in housing benefit
policy and the consequential savings from an increasing effort by DSS and
local authorities to combat benefit fraud. Local authority credit approvals
for housing renovation have been reduced. An extra Pounds 30m is being
provided over three years for the Home Energy Efficiency scheme.
Within the Single Regeneration Budget, created last year, more than Pounds
800m is being made available for new regeneration projects. This will
provide extra resources for the first bidding round and for the launch of a
second bidding round with funding beginning in 1996-97.
Law and order continues to be a key government priority. The new plans
include sufficient provision to sustain police numbers, taking account of
the savings to come from the Sheehy reforms. The plans also make provision
for 4,000 extra prison places, and allow for increased expenditure on
security and safety measures. Additional resources have also been found to
increase the effectiveness of immigration control, and to deal with
increased asylum applications.
Provision for these departments is slightly lower in real terms than the
plans in the last Budget. These savings come from increased efficiency,
savings in lower priority areas of programmes, and continuing tight control
of legal aid spending. Legal services including legal aid were subject to a
fundamental expenditure review this year. Any major changes flowing from
this will be subject to public consultation, likely to be in the New Year.
Total education spending by central government in England (including support
for local authorities) will rise in real terms, to almost Pounds 11bn in
1995-96. The new plans will allow almost one in three young people to enter
higher education and maintain in real terms the support available for
students from loans and maintenance grants. The new plans provide for
continued expansion of student numbers in further education and further
growth in the number of grant-maintained schools.
The plans for the Department of National Heritage allow extra money in
1995-96 for the new British Library and the celebrations for VE and VJ Day.
The plans for later years reflect lower inflation and scope for efficiency
savings in future. The Department will be undertaking a fundamental
expenditure review to be completed in 1995.
The National Lottery will bring in considerable extra money for spending on
a wide range of sporting and cultural projects (perhaps giving them as much
as Pounds 1bn every year once it is well established) in addition to the
government's existing spending. Spending of lottery money counts as general
government expenditure, but is outside the Control Total.
The priority the government attaches to spending on the NHS is illustrated
by spending plans that continue to increase significantly in real terms year
by year, more than fulfilling its manifesto commitment. Planned spending on
the NHS in England in 1995-96 is Pounds 32bn, Pounds 1.3bn higher than the
1994-95 plans and representing real growth of 1 per cent. This increase
comes on top of real growth in 1994-95 plans over 1993-94 outturn of 3.8 per
cent.
At the same time, the NHS will benefit from an improvement in efficiency in
1995-96 of at least 3 per cent, equivalent to an additional Pounds 600m in
1995-96 for patient care. Initiatives to scale back bureaucracy will save
approaching Pounds 200m a year by 1997-98, which will be ploughed back into
the NHS in full. This combination of extra resources and improved
efficiency, with pay rises being financed through efficiency growth, will
increase the number of patients treated in 1995-96 by around 4 per cent.
Private finance will also add significantly to the total resources devoted
to the NHS in 1995-96.
The new social security plans incorporate revised estimates of the number of
claimants and provide for the uprating of benefits over the coming years. In
addition, the plans include the extra help in pensions and income related
benefits following the introduction of VAT on domestic fuel and power.
The new plans also reflect the reform of benefits for the unemployed, to
create the new jobseeker's allowance, for which legislation will be enacted
in the 1994-95 parliamentary session. They include savings from a proposed
reform of housing benefit, so as to give tenants and landlords incentives to
economise on rents, to limit housing benefit payments on empty property, and
increases in the contributions made by non dependant members of households
in assessing housing benefit. Some of the costs of the work incentives
measures also fall on social security within the Control Total.
The plans also take account of the administrative costs of an intensified
effort to combat benefit fraud: some of the savings are scored within the
Control Total, although the bulk are reflected in lower estimates of
cyclical social security - see below.
Changes in these programmes reflect in the main the effect of changes in
comparable programmes in England. Each Secretary of State has wide
discretion about the distribution of expenditure within his programme;
detailed plans will be announced shortly.
The expenditure of the Chancellor's departments is very largely accounted
for by the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise, and is taken up mainly by
running costs. Fundamental expenditure reviews have been undertaken by these
two departments and also the Treasury this year. Some of the resulting
efficiency savings are reflected in these new spending plans.
Extra resources have been provided for basic and strategic scientific
research so that it will be maintained in real terms in 1995-96 at this
year's record level. Total central government spending on science and
technology in1995-96 will be about Pounds 6.1bn, broadly in line with
previous plans.
Compared with the previous forecast, net payments are higher in 1994-95, but
slightly lower thereafter. The uneven profile arises because contributions
are paid on the basis of agreed estimates of contributions likely to be due,
which are subsequently adjusted in the light of later information. The main
reason for the higher forecast of net payments in 1994-95 is that the amount
of contributions which was brought forward within the 1994 European Union
budgetary year to reflect the timing of reimbursements of CAP expenditure to
member states was much lower than anticipated. In the later years, the
forecast continues to reflect the decisions taken at the Edinburgh European
Council in December 1992, and the UK's growth relative to other member
states.
Local authority spending is financed by support provided by central
government and from local authorities' own resources.
The level of local authority spending is determined by individual
authorities, taking account of support provided by central government,
finance available from their own resources and their decisions on local
taxation. The government intends to use its powers to cap local authority
budgets, should that prove necessary.
For 1995-96, Total Standard Spending (TSS) in England - ie the amount which
the government thinks it is appropriate for local authorities to spend on
revenue expenditure - has been set at Pounds 43.5bn, after transfers. For
1996-97 and 1997-98, TSS has been set at Pounds 44.1bn and Pounds 44.6bn
respectively. These figures include provision for care in the community.
Adjusting for functional change, the increase next year over 1994-95 is 0.9
per cent excluding community care, and 2.2 per cent including it.
Central support for local authorities' revenue expenditure in 1995-96,
Aggregate External Finance (AEF), has been set at Pounds 42.4bn for Great
Britain as a whole.
Gross capital expenditure by local authorities in 1995-96 is expected to be
Pounds 8 3/4 bn, somewhat lower than the levels in 1993-94 and 1994-95,
which were boosted by the temporary relaxation of the capital receipts rules
announced in the 1992 Autumn Statement. Capital receipts in 1995-96 are
projected to be around Pounds 3 1/4 bn, giving net capital spending of
around Pounds 5 3/4 bn.
In addition to expenditure within the Control Total, GGE also includes
cyclical social security, privatisation proceeds, and debt interest.
Cyclical social security is defined as unemployment benefit and income
support paid to people of working age. The forecast for cyclical social
security show substantial reductions compared with those in the last Budget
reflecting the improved prospects for inflation and unemployment.
There are also measures which reduce cyclical social security by Pounds
0.4bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 0.7bn in 1996-97 and by Pounds 0.9bn in1997-98.
The bulk of this is the savings expected to flow from the anti-fraud
initiative referred to above, and the savings in Income Support following
the government's decision to place limits on the amount of assistance made
available for mortgage interest payments. These figures also include some of
the costs of the work incentives measures.
The accounting adjustments include various other items within general
government expenditure but outside the Control Total. The increase between
1994-95 and 1996-97 mainly reflects expenditure of the proceeds of the
National Lottery and the effects of early retirements on civil and armed
forces superannuation payments.
Privatisation proceeds are projected to be Pounds 3bn in 1995-96, Pounds 3bn
in 1996-97 and Pounds 2bn in 1997-98. General government gross debt interest
is projected to rise from Pounds 19.7bn in 1993-94 to Pounds 26.6bn in
1997-98. Gross debt interest payments declined from 5 1/4 per cent of GDP in
1981-82 to just over 3 per cent in 1993-94. Debt interest payments are
projected to rise to 3 1/2 per cent in 1995-96 and 1996-97, then fall back
to 3 1/4 per cent in 1997-98.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Red Book Details): PSBR to be halved to 3% of GDP
in two years as recovery continues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Projections for the public finances up to 1999-2000, after allowing for the
measures in the Budget and the new assessment of economic prospects, are set
out below. This also includes an analysis of changes from the November 1993
Budget projections.
The main projections suggest that the public sector borrowing requirement
(PSBR) is likely to return more quickly to balance than envisaged a year
ago, with the public sector current account in surplus by 1997-98. Before
then, the deficit will have fallen below the reference level of 3 per cent
for the European Union's excessive deficits procedure.
The PSBR in the short term: The outturn for the PSBR in 1993-94 was Pounds
45.4bn, 7 per cent of GDP. This was a cyclical peak in borrowing, which is
now running at a significantly lower level. The latest forecast for the PSBR
in 1994-95 is Pounds 34 1/2 bn, 5 per cent of GDP.
Taking into account the tax changes announced in the Budget and the new
public expenditure plans, the PSBR in 1995-96 is forecast to fall to Pounds
21 1/2 bn, 3 per cent of GDP. This means that the PSBR will have more than
halved in two years.
Receipts in 1995-96 are forecast to rise substantially faster than money
GDP, reflecting the phased tax increases announced in the two 1993 Budgets
and a cyclical recovery in corporation tax receipts. Public expenditure is
projected to grow more slowly than GDP despite rising debt interest
payments.
Medium-term PSBR projections: As the economic recovery continues and the
measures in the 1993 and 1994 Budgets come through, the PSBR falls further,
with a small debt repayment projected by 1998-99. Receipts rise slightly
faster than GDP, and public expenditure is projected to fall as a per cent
of GDP in line with the new spending plans.
Other measures of the fiscal stance: The table sets out projections of the
current deficit of the public sector and the financial deficit for both
general government and the public sector as a whole, and shows how they
relate to the PSBR. The deficit on the public sector's current account is
forecast to fall steadily from Pounds 28bn in 1994-95, and give way to a
surplus from 1997-98 onwards.
Net capital spending - the public sector's balance on capital account - is
forecast at Pounds 12 1/2 bn in 1994-95, when it is boosted by temporarily
high local authorities' spending. Slightly lower net spending is projected
for future years. The public sector financial deficit (PSFD) is projected to
fall steadily from Pounds 40 1/2 bn in 1994-95, with a surplus achieved by
the end of the decade. The gap between the PSFD and the PSBR falls from
around Pounds 6bn in 1994-95 as privatisation proceeds decline.
The general government financial deficit (GGFD) - the measure used to
monitor budget deficits under the European Union excessive deficits
procedure - is forecast at Pounds 42bn for 1994-95, 6 1/4 per cent of GDP.
It is forecast to fall to 2 1/4 per cent of GDP in 1996-97, below the 3 per
cent reference level for deficits used in the excessive deficits procedure.
The GGFD is slightly higher than the PSFD up to 1997-98 because public
corporations are forecast to be in small financial surplus.
Public sector debt
The table sets out projections for the stock of net public sector debt and
gross general government debt. Net public sector debt at end-March 1994
stood at Pounds 252bn, 38 1/4 per cent of GDP. The latest forecasts for the
PSBR imply a further increase in the ratio, which reaches a peak of 42 3/4
per cent of GDP at end-March 1996. Thereafter the ratio is projected to fall
steadily as the PSBR is brought down further.
Gross general government debt, the measure used for the European Union's
excessive deficits procedure, stood at 47 per cent of GDP at end-March 1994.
It is projected to peak at 49 1/4 per cent of GDP at end-March 1996,
comfortably below the reference level of 60 per cent, and to fall back
thereafter.
General government receipts
Receipts in 1994-95: General government receipts are now expected to rise by
9 1/2 per cent in 1994-95, well above the forecast increase in money GDP.
This will be the first time for five years that receipts have risen faster
than GDP. Much of the rise reflects the effects of tax increases announced
in the two 1993 Budgets. But corporation tax receipts are also forecast to
rise sharply - by around 35 per cent - because of the cyclical recovery in
profits last year.
Receipts in 1995-96 and beyond: General government receipts are forecast to
rise by 10 1/2 per cent in 1995-96, again much faster than money GDP as the
cyclical recovery continues. The further changes in income tax reliefs and
VAT announced in the two 1993 Budgets, and due to take effect in April 1995,
will raise taxes by a further Pounds 2 3/4 bn in 1995-96 and another Pounds
 3/4 bn in 1996-97. The tax changes announced in this Budget do not change
the projections significantly. Leaving aside the temporary reduction in
business rates from the new transitional relief scheme they reduce taxes by
around Pounds  1/2 bn a year.
After 1996-97, when the tax increases have worked fully through, receipts
are projected to increase at an average 5 1/2 per cent per annum, marginally
higher than money GDP reflecting the over-indexation of tobacco and road
fuel duties and real fiscal drag.
Taxes as a share of GDP: Tax and social security revenues fell quite
markedly as a share of GDP during the recession to reach a trough of 33 3/4
per cent in 1993-94, the lowest level for 20 years. But following the tax
increases announced in the two 1993 Budgets, and with a strong cyclical
recovery now under way, the tax/GDP ratio is expected to rise sharply in
1994-95 to 35 1/4 per cent, 1 1/2 percentage points up on the previous year.
The same factors contribute to a further sharp rise in the tax/GDP ratio
forecast for 1995-96, which will bring the ratio back close to the level at
the beginning of the recession. Thereafter, on the conventional assumption
of no changes in tax rates and an indexed tax system (except where a policy
of real rises in rates has been announced), the ratio is projected to
continue rising, but at a much slower rate.
General government expenditure
The Government's objective for public spending is to reduce general
government expenditure (GGE) excluding privatisation proceeds as a share of
GDP over time. This aggregate includes spending within the Control Total,
cyclical social security expenditure, debt interest payments and various
accounting adjustments needed for consistency with the national accounts.
The new plans show real GGE growth over the next three years averaging
between  1/2 and  3/4 per cent per annum, well below the projected growth
rate of the economy.
The accompanying table shows the 1993-94 outturn, forecasts for 1994-95 and
projections up to 1999-2000 for GGE and its main components. The projections
up to 1997-98 are consistent with the new public spending plans. Figures for
the later years assume that Control Total spending will grow by 1 per cent a
year in real terms.
Expenditure in 1994-95: GGE excluding privatisation proceeds in 1994-95 is
now forecast to rise by 4 1/4 per cent, a bit below the expected growth in
money GDP. Control Total spending is forecast at Pounds 249 1/2 bn, Pounds 1
1/4 bn lower than the plans in last year's Budget. This still represents a
real terms increase of 1 1/4 per cent on 1993-94 spending.
Expenditure over the medium term: The new public spending plans provide for
Control Total spending to rise at under 3 per cent a year in cash terms over
the next three years. This represents an average of only 1/4 per cent a year
growth in real terms. The projected increase in GGE is a little higher - an
average of 3 1/4 per cent per annum in cash, or between  1/2 and  3/4 per
cent in real terms.
Outside the Control Total, cyclical social security is broadly flat in cash
terms, as Budget measures offset the underlying upward trend. However
accounting adjustments are projected to rise, reflecting among other things
the spending of National Lottery proceeds. Debt interest payments are also
rising, as a consequence of the recent high borrowing requirements. Central
government debt interest is forecast to increase by over one-third in the
three years from 1993-94 to 1996-97; thereafter it is projected to flatten
out as borrowing is reduced.
Expenditure as a share of GDP: The ratio of GGE (excluding privatisation
proceeds) to GDP, which increased sharply during the recession, stood at 44
1/4 per cent in 1993-94, marginally below its peak in the previous year.
The ratio is expected to fall by around  3/4 percentage point in 1994-95,
and the new public expenditure plans imply a further fall of around 2 1/2
percentage points over the next three years.
The medium-term projections show this fall continuing, with the GGE/GDP
ratio in 1999-2000 down to 39 1/4 per cent, a similar level to 1988-89.
Changes since the last Budget
PSBR in 1993-94 and 1994-95: The outturn for the PSBR in 1993-94 was Pounds
3.7bn lower than the forecast made in the last Budget, adjusted for
subsequent classification changes. The forecast for 1994-95 has been reduced
by Pounds 3bn. In both cases this is due primarily to lower cash spending.
The projections: The PSBR projections are lower than those in the last
Budget. Spending is lower throughout in cash terms reflecting the new plans
in the Budget. In the short run, apart from the impact of the Budget
measures, receipts are little changed because the impact of lower prices is
offset by higher activity. But in the medium term receipts are lower. The
Budget measures contribute relatively little to these lower medium-term
receipts, as the table shows. General government receipts are little
different as a per cent of GDP from the projections in the last Budget.
Most of the reduction in general government expenditure is accounted for by
the reductions in Control Total spending announced in the Budget. But there
are also significant reductions in cyclical social security, both because
prices and unemployment are lower than envisaged a year ago and because of
the measures in the Budget. The projection of debt interest is little
changed from a year ago; the impact of higher long-term interest rates is
offset by the effect of a lower borrowing profile.
The level of prices (as measured by the GDP deflator) now forecast for
1995-96 is 2 1/2 per cent lower than assumed in last year's Budget
projections, and this reduction is projected to persist in the medium term.
The cash reductions announced in the Budget bring Control Total spending in
real terms below the levels in last year's Budget plans, as the table
illustrates. On top of this, the cash reductions in cyclical social security
represent a significant real terms reduction in spending. As a result, the
GGE/GDP ratio is lower throughout than in last year's Budget projections.
Funding policy
Funding policy will continue on the basis set out in the 1994-95 MTFS and
the gilts remit published on 17 March 1994 and updated in the Summer
Economic Forecast. The table updates the funding arithmetic to allow for the
new PSBR forecast, the latest information on gilts sales, National Savings
and other changes. It is expected that Pounds 10.5bn of gilt sales will be
required in the months November 1994 to March 1995 to achieve full funding.
New remits for gilts and National Savings will be published just before the
start of the financial year 1995-96. The remits will explain funding policy
in more detail and how it will be implemented.
Margins of error and alternative projections
Average errors: The PSBR forecasts are subject to a wide margin of error.
Over the past 10 years the average absolute error on forecasts of the
current year made in the autumn (November Budget forecast for last year,
Autumn Statement forecasts for previous years) has averaged 3/4 per cent of
GDP, equivalent to plus or minus Pounds 4 1/2 bn in today's terms. The
average absolute error in projections for the year ahead, adjusted for
subsequent Budget measures, is 1 1/2 per cent of GDP, or plus or minus
Pounds 10 1/2 bn in today's terms.
Alternative projections: There are inevitably uncertainties about the path
of the economy and these can be a source of error in the medium-term
projections for the public finances. Cyclical variations in output
automatically produce variations in tax revenues and, to a lesser extent, in
government expenditure. Given a higher degree of spare capacity, growth
could be stronger for a period without generating inflationary pressures. On
the other hand some indicators suggest rather little spare capacity, in
which case sustainable medium-term growth might be weaker. The growth rates
in the table differ from the main projection by  1/2 per cent in either
direction from 1995-96.
The table shows the path of the PSBR on unchanged policies in these
alternative projections. Public expenditure within the Control Total is
assumed to be unchanged, but cyclical social security and debt interest
payments are allowed to vary. Tax rates, allowances and thresholds are
assumed to be at the same levels as in the main projection, with revenues
allowed to vary automatically with the output path.
The stronger growth projection moves the public sector into significant
surplus by the end of the decade on present plans. Even in the slower growth
projection, public expenditure restraint is sufficient to keep the PSBR on a
downward trend.

Earns: Over Pounds 30,000.
Politics: Voted Conservative last time.
Said yesterday: 'There isn't a lot of expenditure on new hospitals, new
roads, new schools. This has got to be bad news from my point of view. The
building industry is in a bad way. The change on housing benefit and private
property seems very fair and logical but there are exceptions. There needs
to be realistic flexibility.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Red Book Details): Tax thresholds rise,
investment spurred
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tax and national insurance proposals in the Budget are summarised in this
section. The measures raise the main tax allowances and thresholds in line
with prices, with extra increases for the elderly and in the lower rate tax
band. Fuel and tobacco duties are increased in real terms in line with
previous commitments, while most alcohol duties are frozen. There are a
number of proposals to encourage investment in small and growing businesses,
to help businesses facing higher rates bills, to simplify and deregulate the
tax system and to close loop-holes.
Overall the measures will cost some Pounds 1bn in 1995-96, due mainly to
transitional support on business rates. By 1997-98 the cost falls to under
Pounds 1/2 bn, so the measures do not have a significant effect on revenues
in the medium term.
The effect of the measures on government revenues is set out in the table
below.
Inland Revenue taxes
Personal taxation: The following allowances, limits and thresholds will be
increased in line with statutory indexation (based on the 2.2 per cent
increase in the Retail Prices Index in the year to September 1994):
 - personal allowance for people under 65;
 - income limit for age related allowances;
 - basic rate limit;
 - capital gains tax annual exempt amount;
 - threshold for inheritance tax.
Personal allowances for people aged 65 and over will be increased by Pounds
430, which is Pounds 330 more than indexation. The lower rate band will be
increased by Pounds 200, Pounds 100 more than indexation. The blind person's
allowance is unchanged. The new levels are as follows:
Changes will be made in the tax treatment of premiums paid for employee
indemnity insurance such as directors' and officers' liability insurance.
Where employers pay, the payment will not be taxable as a benefit in kind;
where employees pay, they will get tax relief. The same treatment will apply
to payments made to meet work related liabilities, such as legal costs,
which are not covered by insurance; and to payments made up to six years
after the end of the year in which the employment ends. This will take
effect from 6 April 1995.
The rules for registered profit related pay schemes will be amended to
reflect changes in accountancy practice on extraordinary items.
Benefits in kind: The scales for assessing the benefit of fuel provided by
employers for private use in company cars will be increased from 6 April
1995 by 5 per cent for petrol cars and 4 per cent for diesel cars, in line
with the price of fuel. The scales are also used for employers' national
insurance contributions and VAT.
Accessories for the disabled, fitted in company cars, will not be taxed as a
benefit in kind from 6 April 1995.
Self assessment: Measures to simplify the personal tax system and allow self
assessment were announced in the March 1993 Budget. Measures which build on
this framework are:
 - all income from property, including furnished lettings, will be brought
together and taxed using rules similar to those for trading income;the rules
for taxing non-residents will be simplified;
 - employers will be required to give employees certain information, mainly
about benefits and expenses, which they need to complete their tax returns;
 - anti-avoidance provisions will be introduced to prevent exploitation of
the rules for the transition from the 'preceding year' to the 'current year'
basis of assessment.
Simplification and deregulation: Employees' personal expenses of up to
Pounds 5 a night in the UK and Pounds 10 a night abroad, paid by employers
when employees stay away from home on business, will not be taxable from 6
April 1995.
Other simplification and deregulation changes are:
 - the rules for taxation of trusts and other settlements which tax the
settlor on the income of a settlement in certain circumstances will be
simplified from 6 April 1995;
 - tax will be deducted at the basic rate from interest credited to bank
accounts belonging to discretionary and accumulation trusts from 6 April
1996;
 - two changes will be made to simplify the offshore funds legislation from
29 November 1994;
 - measures will be introduced to allow certain tax returns to be submitted
electronically;
 - in Scotland, Inland Revenue will be able to pursue debts of up to Pounds
50,000 through the Sheriff courts rather than the Court of Session;
 - the tax rules relating to foreign income dividends and certain forms of
deemed income received by personal representatives of deceased persons'
estates, and to payments made out of that income to residuary beneficiaries,
will be clarified from 6 April 1995.
Savings: Changes will be made to the rules for Tax Exempt Special Savings
Accounts (Tessa) so that when an account matures after five years, up to
Pounds 9,000 of the capital may be deposited in a new Tessa. The normal
limit for first year deposits is Pounds 3,000.
Personal Equity Plans (PEPs) will be extended to corporate bonds and
preference shares.
The annual amount which may be invested in a friendly society tax exempt
life assurance fund will be increased from Pounds 200 to Pounds 270 with
effect from Royal Assent.
The maximum level of earnings for which pension provision may be made with
tax relief (the 'earnings cap') will be increased in line with statutory
indexation to Pounds 78,600.
Other savings measures are:
 - investors in personal pension schemes will be given more flexibility to
choose when to buy an annuity and to buy annuities from insurance companies
established in other European Union countries;
 - the ordinary Save As You Earn (SAYE) scheme will be abolished. Contracts
starting on or after 1 December 1994 will not get tax relief. The Sharesave
scheme will continue, and the Treasury will take on responsibility for the
model scheme from the Department for National Savings;
 - financial institutions in other European Union countries will be able to
offer PEPs, Tessas and Sharesave SAYE schemes in the UK;
 - gains made by higher rate taxpayers on certain life assurance policies
and life annuity contracts written by insurers established in other European
countries will in future only be charged on the difference between the
higher and basic rates of tax.
Investment in small businesses
As announced in the November 1993 Budget, tax reliefs will be available to
investors in Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs), a new vehicle designed to
encourage investment in unquoted trading companies. Investors will benefit
from income tax relief at 20 per cent, and capital gains tax reinvestment
relief, on purchase of new VCT shares of up to Pounds 100,000 a year. Income
and gains on these investments will also be tax free.
Relief from capital gains tax which is available where gains are reinvested
in an unquoted trading company will, from 29 November 1994, be extended to
cover companies which are engaged in farming or developing property, or
which hold more than half their assets in land and buildings.
The reliefs available under the Enterprise Investment Scheme will be
extended to allow CGT to be deferred on capital gains where they are
reinvested in a company which qualifies under the scheme. Changes will also
be made to simplify the scheme and make it more attractive for companies and
investors to use. These include allowing relief when more than half a
company's assets are in land and buildings.
Business taxation
Tax relief will be given for certain spending by individuals after their
trade or profession has ceased. The relief will apply to spending on or
after 29 November 1994.
Employers will be allowed to make quarterly rather than monthly payments of
PAYE and national insurance contributions from 6 April 1995 when their total
PAYE and NIC bill is below Pounds 600 a month, an increase from the current
threshold of Pounds 450.
The industrial buildings allowance provisions will be amended to extend
capital allowances to design, build, finance and operate (DBFO) roads; and
new rules will give capital allowances balancing charges to them and to toll
roads covered by the private finance initiative.
Other business taxation changes are:
 - the relief which allows group companies to set gains from the sale of
business assets against the cost of assets acquired by other companies in
the same group will be put on a statutory basis;
 - the stamp duty relief for sales of property within a group of companies
will be extended to new leases, and the test for group membership for the
purposes of this relief will be revised from 90 per cent ownership of issued
share capital to 75 per cent ownership of ordinary share capital, from Royal
Assent;
 - changes will be made to facilitate the use of cash as collateral for
stock loans and to address anomalies in the interaction between the
legislation on sale and repurchase of securities in the Finance Act 1994 and
other legislation; - a tax regime will be established for open ended
investment companies, a new form of collective investment vehicle which will
be constituted as a company with continuously variable share capital. It is
expected that the necessary secondary legislation will be brought into
effect by mid-1995;
 - the distribution rules applying to thinly capitalised companies will be
modified;
the tax treatment of short rotation coppice (in which fast growing trees are
regularly harvested for fuel) will be clarified to ensure that it is taxed
as farming and thus excluded from the exemption for commercial woodlands.
Anti-avoidance measures
Returns on certain debt instruments such as deep discount bonds held by UK
companies associated with companies carrying on a UK banking business will
be taxed as they accrue, rather than on sale or maturity, from 29 November
1994. There will be no change where the instruments are held for long-term
insurance purposes.
From 29 November 1994 companies within a group will only be able to claim
rollover relief for business assets acquired from outside that group and not
by transfer from other companies within the same group. Changes from the
same date will also counter avoidance of the charge which applies when a
company leaves a group holding an asset which it acquired from another
company in the same group.
Changes will be made to prevent tax avoidance by manipulating the valuation
of stock when a trade is transferred between connected parties.
Where there is a change in the ownership of an investment company, measures
will be introduced to prevent companies setting excess management expenses
and charges from the period before the change against profits of a later
period. This will apply to changes in ownership on or after 29 November
1994, unless the contract for sale was entered into before that date.
Any petroleum revenue tax (PRT) losses transferred to the purchaser of an
interest in an oil or gas field will exclude losses attributable to reliefs
brought into the field by the seller. Reliefs brought into a field will also
be excluded from any unrelievable field loss which is set against the PRT
liability of another field. The changes apply to claims for relief and
transfers of an interest made on or after 29 November 1994.
Measures will be introduced to prevent erosion of the tax base for life
assurance companies through reinsurance arrangements, and to correct other
anomalies.
Measures will also be introduced to:
 - ensure that capital gains tax applies to disposals of certain securities
linked to a share index, on or after 29 November 1994;
 - amend the capital allowances rules for industrial buildings and buildings
in enterprise zones to clarify the amounts on which allowances can be
claimed;
 - amend the provisions introduced in the March 1993 Budget for Lloyd's
special reserve funds to ensure that they operate as originally intended.
Customs and Excise taxes
Value added tax: The annual turnover threshold above which traders must
register for VAT will increase from Pounds 45,000 to Pounds 46,000 and the
deregistration threshold will rise from Pounds 43,000 to Pounds 44,000, from
midnight on 29 November 1994.
From 1 August 1995 businesses will be able to recover VAT on the purchase of
cars bought wholly for business use, primarily leasing. Where VAT is
recoverable, businesses will have to account for output tax on the eventual
sale of the car by the business. Only half of the VAT applying to leasing
charges will be recoverable where there is any private use.
The scheme under which VAT on certain second-hand goods is charged only on
the dealer's margin will be extended to virtually all second-hand goods,
antiques and collectors' items, whether sold by a dealer or at public
auction. A simplified method of global accounting for some margin scheme
transactions will be introduced, and an effective VAT rate of 2.5 per cent
will be charged on imports of certain works of art, antiques and collectors'
items which were previously exempted from VAT at import. These changes
implement the European Community seventh VAT directive and will be phased in
from 1 January 1995.
The zero-rating of passenger transport will be confined to public passenger
transport in the generally accepted sense, as envisaged when the relief was
first introduced, from 1 April 1995.
A number of changes will be made to reduce burdens on business:
 - traders will be consulted on a move to annual VAT returns and payments
for small businesses. Subject to views expressed, it is envisaged that those
who voluntarily register for VAT will make annual returns by the end of
1995, with a possible extension to businesses with an annual turnover below
Pounds 100,000 the following year. There will also be consultation on a
simplified scheme for calculating VAT due from small businesses, which would
link payments to turnover rather than to detailed accounts of all sales and
purchases;
 - a number of deregulatory measures associated with the VAT liability of
construction and land and property will be introduced. Most will take effect
from 1 March 1995;
 - the penalties for late VAT registration, unauthorised issue of tax
invoices, and failure to notify import of new means of transport or goods
liable to excise duty and pay the VAT on time, will be reduced to bring them
into line with other VAT penalties, from 1 January 1995;
 - VAT bad debt relief provisions of the VAT Act 1994 will be clarified, and
from Royal Assent Customs' right to deduct traders' debts from VAT credits
arising during insolvency will be limited further;
 - the long-standing practice of allowing payment of VAT due on goods
removed from excise warehouses to be deferred will be put on a statutory
basis from Royal Assent.
A number of changes will be made to reduce scope for avoidance of VAT:
 - the rules will be changed to stop avoidance of VAT through lease and
lease back of property from 30 November 1994;
 - the rules on incidental financial transactions will be changed to block a
device used to avoid VAT on share issues from 1 December 1994;
 - to counter abuse, the de minimis rules which determine when small
businesses making exempt supplies can treat themselves as fully taxable will
be tightened from 1 December 1994;
 - traders appealing against a Customs requirement to provide security
against payment of their VAT liability will have to be up to date with their
VAT returns and payments, from Royal Assent;
 - section 30(5) of the VAT Act 1994 will be repealed from Royal Assent to
prevent it being used as a basis for tax avoidance. Alternative legislative
cover will be provided to allow registered charities to continue to reclaim
VAT on goods exported for charitable purposes.
Excise duties
Duty on beer, table wine, cider and spirits will be unchanged. Duty on
fortified wine will be cut from 1 January 1995 in line with a previous
international agreement. The duty on sparkling wine will be reduced to the
new fortified wine rate at the same time.
Duties on tobacco products will be increased from 6 pm on 29 November 1994,
in line with the Government's commitment to increase duty on average by at
least 3 per cent a year in real terms.
Tax on petrol will rise by 2.5 pence per litre, and duty on diesel will rise
to bring it into line with that for unleaded petrol, from 6 pm on 29
November 1994, in line with the Government's commitment to increase duty on
road fuels on average by at least 5 per cent a year in real terms. Duty on
gas oil and fuel oil will rise by 0.5 pence per litre from the same time.
The changes in duty and their effect on the price of each product are set
out below. Price effects include VAT except for gas oil and fuel oil.
The rate of duty on road fuel gas will stay at its current level, but be
expressed per kilogram rather than per litre from 6 pm on 29 November 1994.
The rules for giving duty relief to traders using mineral oil for industrial
purposes other than as motor or heating fuel will be changed to reduce the
administrative burden on traders from summer 1995.
The definition of vehicles entitled to use rebated heavy oil (commonly known
as red diesel) as fuel on public roads will be revised to preserve nearly
all existing entitlements following changes to vehicle excise duty, from 1
July 1995.
A number of changes will be made to simplify the structure of alcohol
duties:
 - the number of tax bands for wine and made-wine with strength between 1.2
and 5.5 per cent alcohol by volume (abv) will be reduced from five to two
from 1 January 1995;
 - the systems for refunding duty on alcohol used in the manufacture of food
and non-alcoholic drinks will be unified and simplified from Royal Assent;
 - the regime for denatured alcohol, including methylated spirits, will be
extended to cover all dutiable alcohols used in foods and non-alcoholic
drinks from the summer of 1995;
 - the definition of beverages between 1.2 and 5.5 per cent abv which are
liable to beer duty rate will be clarified from 30 November 1994.
A statutory right to recover excise duty which has been overpaid will be
introduced; and there will be provision for claims to be brought before the
VAT and Duties Tribunal in the event of an appeal, from the summer of 1995.
Gaming machine licence duty will be increased on average by about 19 per
cent for licence applications made on or after 1 December 1994, and payment
by instalments will be introduced from 1 November 1995 for annual licences.
From the latter date, the duty will be extended to include amusement
machines and will be renamed amusement machine licence duty.
A number of changes will be made to air passenger duty:
 - treatment of debts in insolvency will be aligned with other duties and
taxes collected by Customs, from Royal Assent; and
 - a mechanism will be provided for the assessment and collection of
interest on arrears from 1 January 1995.
Insurance premium tax: From Royal Assent, Customs' powers under the
legislation for insurance premium tax will be aligned more closely with
those available for other indirect taxes. In addition, the right of insurers
to request a review and appeal against an assessment for tax due will be
removed for cases where no tax return has been submitted.
Intrastat: The threshold above which traders are required to submit monthly
statistical returns on trade with European Union countries will be increased
from Pounds 140,000 of annual EU trade in goods to Pounds 150,000, from 1
January 1995.
Vehicle excise duty: Duty on cars, light goods vehicles, taxis and vans will
rise from Pounds 130 to Pounds 135 from 30 November 1994. Duty on lorries is
unchanged.
The system of concessionary and exempt classes of VED will be rationalised
with effect from 1 July 1995. The number of concessionary classes will be
reduced from 132 to nine. Exemption from VED will be extended to police
vehicles.
The definition of a goods vehicle for tax purposes and the taxable weight of
such vehicles will be clarified.
A number of other changes will be made:
 -new powers will be introduced to enable a fee, to cover the costs of the
Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), to be charged on new vehicle
registrations which are not notified to DVLA under the automated first
registration scheme;
DVLA will be allowed to sell anonymised data, for example to market research
companies;
 -powers will be introduced to enable wheelclamping to be used to combat VED
evasion;
 -new requirements to provide documentation will be placed on the vendor, to
reinforce the proposed move to joint notification of changes in vehicle
ownership;
vehicles with fewer than nine seats currently licensed as 'Hackney'
carriages, will be licensed as cars from 1 July 1995.
Business rates
Transitional relief: A revaluation of non-domestic properties will take
effect across Great Britain from 1 April 1995. This will be the first five
yearly review of property valuations for rating purposes following the
introduction of the new business rating system.
Changes in rateable values resulting from revaluation will vary
significantly between regions. A scheme of transitional relief will limit
the maximum real increases in rates bills over the coming years to 10 per
cent a year for large properties, 7 1/2 per cent for small properties, and 5
per cent for small mixed domestic/non-domestic properties (such as shops
with flats above).
The transitional relief scheme will be financed in 1995-96 in part by
limiting real reductions in rates bills to 5 per cent for large properties
and 10 per cent for small ones. An Exchequer contribution will cover the
balance.
Rate poundages: The unified poundages in England and Wales for 1995-96 will
be increased in line with the RPI for the year to September 1994, after
account is taken of the effects of the revaluation. In Scotland a unified
poundage will be introduced for the first time in 1995-96. It will be set at
the same level as the poundage in England.
National insurance contributions
The lower rates of employers' national insurance contributions will be
reduced by 0.6 per cent from April 1995.
From April 1996 employers who take on someone who has been out of work for
at least two years will be able to get a rebate on their employer NICs on
that person for up to a year.
From April 1995 the lower earnings limit will be increased from Pounds 57 to
Pounds 59 a week, in line with the single person's rate of retirement
pension; the earnings thresholds for the employers' lower rate bands will
each be increased by Pounds 5 to Pounds 105, Pounds 150 and Pounds 205; and
the upper earnings limit will be increased from Pounds 430 to Pounds 440 a
week. The new structure of contributions is:
The weekly Class 2 rate for the self employed will be increased to Pounds
5.85, and the Class 3 voluntary contribution to Pounds 5.75. The lower and
upper profits limits for Class 4 contributions will increase to Pounds 6,640
and Pounds 22,880 respectively.
To simplify the NICs system and provide a better service for business,
Inland Revenue dispensations will count for NICs; and the Inland Revenue and
the DSS will be drawing up a programme for closer working.
Treasury grant not exceeding 12.5 per cent of contributory benefit
expenditure will be made available to the National Insurance Fund in
1995-96.
The Government Actuary will report on the likely effect of the changes on
the National Insurance Fund.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Red Book Details): Growth rates in the world's
leading economies set to converge next year
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent economic developments and prospects are examined in detail in the
following section. Growth in the seven major countries (Group of Seven)
picked up in the second half of 1993 and has increased further this year. It
is forecast to be 2 3/4 per cent both in 1994 and 1995. G7 consumer price
inflation is expected to rise to 3 per cent.
In the UK, GDP growth has been stronger than forecast in the summer. It is
now forecast to be 4 per cent in 1994, slowing to 3 1/4 per cent in 1995
largely as a result of slower growth of North Sea output.
Underlying RPI inflation has been a little lower than anticipated in the
summer and was 2 per cent in October. It is forecast to rise to a temporary
plateau of 2 1/2 per cent while prices adjust to higher commodity prices and
profit margins increase in the buoyant manufacturing sector.
Unemployment, as measured by the claimant count, has fallen by 455,000 since
December 1992 to 2 1/2 million. The Labour Force Survey shows a similar rate
of decline and suggests that rising employment accounts for most of the fall
in unemployment.
The current account deficit was much lower in the first half of 1994 than
was generally expected. It is forecast to fall from Pounds 10 1/2 billion in
1993 to Pounds 4 billion in 1994 as a whole and to Pounds 3 1/2 billion in
1995.
The sterling index has been fairly steady this year. The forecast is based
on the conventional assumption that sterling remains close to recent levels.
Long-term interest rates have risen sharply this year, but have fallen back
a little recently. Short-term rates were increased from 5 1/4 per cent to 5
3/4 per cent in September. M0 growth has continued above its monitoring
range; M4 growth is in the lower half of its monitoring range.
The PSBR in 1993-94 was Pounds 45 1/2 billion. It is expected to fall to
Pounds 34 1/2 billion in the current financial year and to Pounds 21 1/2
billion in 1995-96; Pounds 3 billion and Pounds 8 1/2 billion respectively
lower than in the last Budget (after allowing for classification changes).
For the purposes of medium-term fiscal projections, GDP growth from 1996-97
is assumed to average 2 3/4 per cent a year. Inflation as measured by the
GDP deflator is assumed to fall from 3 1/4 per cent in 1995-96 to 2 per cent
by the end of the decade.
The world economy
Output has continued to accelerate in the G7 as a whole. G7 GDP grew by 3
per cent at an annual rate in the first half of 1994, up from 1 3/4 per cent
in the second half of 1993. Recovery is at last under way in mainland
Europe. In the United States growth has moderated a little from its peak at
the end of last year but the economy continues to expand rapidly. In Japan
it is still not clear that recovery has taken a firm hold.
G7 growth is forecast to be 2 3/4 per cent in both 1994 and 1995, increasing
to 3 per cent in the first half of 1996. After fast growth in the US and
slow growth in Europe and Japan over the past year, growth rates within the
G7 should converge in 1995. The US is forecast to grow in 1995 by around 3
per cent, down from nearly 4 per cent in 1994. Mainland Europe is expected
to accelerate, with growth of 3 per cent in Germany and in Europe as a
whole. In Japan sustained growth is expected to resume in the second half of
1994 and to average 2 1/2 per cent in 1995.
World trade has picked up sharply in 1994, particularly in Europe. It is
forecast to grow by over 9 per cent in 1994 - more than three times faster
than in 1993 - and to continue growing rapidly in 1995 and the first half of
1996. UK export markets will probably grow a little more slowly because
trade in Europe - our main export market - is projected to rise more slowly
than trade between the Asian economies.
Non-oil commodity prices have risen by around 40 per cent since their trough
in mid-1993. This sharp increase reflects both rising demand and problems of
supply for some commodities. But prices have flattened off in recent months
and are expected to grow more moderately over the forecast period. The Brent
oil price has risen from a low point of Dollars 13 1/2 a barrel at the
beginning of 1994 and has been trading around Dollars 17 a barrel recently.
It is assumed to remain around this level in the forecast period.
The US Federal Reserve has increased the Federal Funds rate by 2 1/2
percentage points since it began to tighten policy in February. The German
discount rate has remained at 4 1/2 per cent since May. In Japan the
Official Discount Rate has been unchanged at 1 3/4 per cent since September
1993. Long-term rates drifted up over the summer in all the major countries
following the sharp rise earlier in the year.
Although consumer price inflation looks to have stopped falling in the G7 as
a whole, immediate inflationary pressures appear weak. In Germany inflation
 -now just below 3 per cent - is expected to fall further. In Japan consumer
prices are stable. In the US inflation rose to 3 per cent in the early
autumn but has subsequently fallen back. However, with higher commodity
prices and higher output, G7 inflation is forecast to increase a little,
reaching 2 3/4 per cent by the end of 1995 and 3 per cent in the first half
of 1996.
Demand and output
In the UK output has risen more than expected in the summer. Growth in the
second and third quarters of 1994 was stronger than forecast and growth in
earlier quarters has been revised up. In the year to the third quarter, GDP
is currently estimated to have increased by 4.2 per cent; for non-North Sea
GDP the increase was 3.7 per cent.
GDP is now 7 per cent above its trough in the first quarter of 1992 and 3
1/4 per cent above its previous peak in the second quarter of 1990.
Excluding oil and gas extraction, which has risen by over 50 per cent since
1990, GDP is 6 1/4 per cent above the trough and 2 1/4 per cent above its
previous peak. Output has risen in all the main sectors of the economy: by 6
3/4 per cent in manufacturing and 4 per cent in construction, though output
is still below its previous peak in both these sectors. Service sector
output, which accounts for 60 per cent of the total and fell less than
output in other sectors in the recession, has risen 6 3/4 per cent since its
trough and is now well above its previous peak.
Over the past year the basis of the recovery has shifted away from consumer
demand towards exports. In the early stages of recovery most of the growth
in GDP came from consumer spending. Stocks and exports also contributed, but
the contribution of exports was more than offset by rising imports.
Arithmetically, therefore, net trade made a negative contribution. But more
recently the growth of consumers' expenditure has slowed, exports have
accelerated and imports decelerated. Net trade accounts for about half the
growth in 1994 so far.
Non-North Sea GDP has been growing faster than trend since the middle of
1993. The current size of the output gap - the difference between actual and
trend levels of GDP - cannot be estimated with any certainty, but there is
almost certainly still a sizeable gap. In other words there is still spare
capacity in the economy as a whole. This should allow the economy to
continue growing faster than trend without significant upward pressure on
prices.
The only direct measures of capacity utilisation are based on surveys and
relate to particular sectors. The CBI survey, which reflects utilisation of
both labour and capital, shows capacity utilisation in manufacturing back to
normal levels. Outside manufacturing, the British Chambers of Commerce and
Building Employers' Confederation surveys show increases in capacity
utilisation in services and construction respectively, but to levels well
below those seen in the late 1980s.
However, there are grounds for thinking that currently reported levels of
utilisation represent less of a constraint on expansion and hence less of an
inflationary threat than in the past. Under pressure to cut costs, companies
have probably been exploiting opportunities to use their existing capacity
more efficiently. There have been strong incentives to reduce the time plant
and machinery spends idle and to remove bottlenecks. On the employment side,
labour market reforms have discouraged labour hoarding. In these
circumstances the key question is how quickly capacity can be expanded and
at what price. For new plant and machinery lead times on installation have
probably shortened. Moreover there is a large pool of available labour:
unemployment remains high despite its rapid fall since the end of 1992. Nor
is there much evidence of shortages of skilled labour.
The pace of GDP growth is likely to slow a little from now on, while
remaining above its trend rate. This largely reflects much slower growth of
North Sea output following the very large increases of the past couple of
years. But it also reflects a marginal slowing in non-North Sea growth,
mainly accounted for by slower growth of public expenditure in volume terms
and little further contribution from stockbuilding.
GDP is forecast to increase by 4 per cent in 1994, and by 3 1/4 per cent in
1995 - stronger than the summer economic forecast of 2 3/4 per cent in each
year. Excluding North Sea output, GDP is projected to rise by 3 1/2 per cent
in 1994 and by 3 1/4 per cent in 1995. These growth rates are above
estimates of trend growth, implying a further narrowing of the output gap.
Personal sector
The growth of consumers' expenditure has weakened this year, with quarterly
growth rates of 1 per cent in the second half of 1993 giving way to
increases of around  1/2 per cent in the first three quarters of 1994. In
part this reflects greater caution on the part of consumers towards major
purchases. Spending on cars has slowed, and weakness in the housing market
has held back expenditure on other durable goods. Elsewhere there is much
less evidence of any significant weakening since the tax rises in April, and
the trend in retail sales remains buoyant. Consumers' expenditure as a whole
is expected to rise by 2 1/2 per cent in 1994.
As expected the saving ratio has fallen. It is estimated to have averaged 10
per cent in the first three quarters of this year, down from 12 1/4 per cent
last year. Three related factors probably account for this fall:
Lower interest rates, lower inflation and economic recovery have encouraged
spending;
The personal sector has significantly improved its financial position by
running substantial financial surpluses, which have more than offset the
deficits of the late 1980s;
Consumers are to some extent offsetting the effect of higher taxes on
spending by reducing their saving.
In 1995 as a whole consumption may increase by 2 1/2 per cent, the same as
in 1994. This is faster than the growth of real personal disposable income,
which is forecast to rise by 1 1/2 per cent. Thus the saving ratio is
expected to fall again, though by less than in 1994 when real personal
disposable income seems likely to be unchanged on 1993.
Housing market turnover increased strongly in 1993 but has fallen back this
year. House prices have moved erratically with no pronounced trend up or
down. In October they were at much the same level as a year earlier. This
lacklustre performance looks surprising in the face of low mortgage rates,
low house prices in relation to incomes, and the continued recovery in the
financial position of the personal sector. It may be the consequence of
persistent negative equity and significant, though diminishing,
repossessions - both unknown before the last few years. The two percentage
point increase in the cost of fixed rate mortgages, the result of the rise
in bond rates, may also have kept some purchasers out of the market. (Fixed
rate mortgages have accounted for the greater part of new mortgage lending
this year.) Finally, the housing market may also still be adjusting to the
changes in mortgage interest relief announced in the last two Budgets.
On balance the housing market indicators point to renewed recovery. Housing
remains very affordable, with house prices and mortgage interest payments
both low in relation to incomes. Continued economic growth, which increases
the personal sector's resources and reduces uncertainty about the future,
should lead to modest increases in both turnover and house prices next year.
A prominent feature of the recession was the move by the personal sector
from deficit into substantial financial surplus, as saving was increased and
investment cut. The surplus fell slightly in 1993, but it remained at a
historically high level. It is forecast to fall sharply in 1994 mainly
because of lower saving. Further, smaller, declines are forecast for 1995
and 1996, but the personal sector is expected to remain in comfortable
surplus.
Industrial and commercial companies (ICCs) have transformed financial
deficits of the order of 4 per cent of GDP in 1989 and 1990 into a record
surplus in the first half of 1994. Strong profits growth, sharp reductions
in interest and tax payments, and lower capital expenditure have all
contributed to this dramatic turnaround. At the same time companies have
been restructuring their balance sheets by issuing equity and repaying bank
borrowing. The key issue for the forecast is whether balance sheet
adjustment has largely been completed. One view is that most companies still
have a long way to go in repairing damage to their balance sheets because
recent financial surpluses fall well short of making good the large deficits
run between 1988 and 1992. On this view companies will remain reluctant to
invest and will continue to run relatively large surpluses.
An alternative view, on which the forecast is based, is that companies have
largely completed the adjustment. Since early 1991 ICCs have repaid over
Pounds 19 billion of bank borrowing and the market has absorbed large-scale
capital issues. Debt as a proportion of total financial liabilities has
fallen sharply, and financial assets, particularly liquid assets, have been
built up. Overall the market value of ICCs, as measured by their net
financial liabilities (including equity), was almost 50 per cent higher in
mid-1994 than at the end of 1990. All this suggests that companies in
aggregate are now in reasonable financial shape and have little need to
forego profitable investment opportunities for the sake of sustaining
substantial financial surpluses.
ICCs' profits rose by 13 1/2 per cent in 1993, having been virtually static
throughout the recession. In the first three quarters of 1994 they showed a
further gain of over 16 per cent on a year earlier. This reflects continued
tight control over unit costs, rising output and expansion of margins,
particularly for exports. Higher profits have fed through to company saving
(retained income), which rose by over a third in 1993 and has continued to
grow at a similar rate in 1994.
Profitability, as measured by the real rate of return on capital, is likely
to show another healthy rise in 1994. Some further increase is forecast for
1995. But with output growth slowing and only modest further rebuilding of
margins, profits growth is unlikely to be sustained at recent rates.
Moreover dividends and, particularly, tax payments are forecast to rise
relatively quickly in response to the earlier strong growth of profits.
Company saving could, therefore, be fairly flat in 1995.
Business investment in the third quarter of 1994 is estimated to have been 1
1/4 per cent higher than a year earlier. With profitability up, and demand
and capacity utilisation continuing to rise, the need to install extra
capacity is likely to become an increasingly important motive for
investment. Companies should typically be well placed to finance investment
internally, having moved into substantial financial surplus and largely
restructured their balance sheets. So the climate for investment is much
improved. Moreover there is little sign that the rise in long-term interest
rates earlier this year will prevent a significant rebound in capital
spending. The first indications of a marked step up in investment intentions
have recently been emerging from business surveys.
In 1994 business investment is expected to increase only modestly, by 2 per
cent. However, it is forecast to grow by nearly 11 per cent in 1995. At some
point during economic upswings it is usual to see a surge in business
investment: in the early 1980s this started in 1984, three years into
recovery, about the same stage as 1995 in the present upturn.
General government investment in fixed assets rose by 5 3/4 per cent in 1993
and is projected to rise by 4 1/2 per cent in 1994, boosted in both years by
the temporary relaxation of the rules governing spending out of local
authority capital receipts announced in the 1992 Autumn Statement. As this
temporary measure unwinds, local authority investment will return to more
normal levels. Central government investment is also forecast to level off
in 1995, following strong growth in recent years. General government
investment is expected to fall back in 1995 and the first half of 1996,
while remaining well above the levels seen in the 1980s.
Fixed investment in the economy as a whole is forecast to grow by 3 3/4 per
cent in 1994 and by 5 3/4 per cent in 1995. Stronger business investment is
partly offset by weaker growth in housing investment and the fall in general
government investment.
In 1993 the level of stocks in total was virtually unchanged, though
manufacturers destocked for most of the year. So far in 1994 companies have
been rebuilding stocks, and stockbuilding is forecast to contribute  1/2
percentage point to GDP growth in the year as a whole. Stockbuilding is
forecast to continue at around recent rates, making virtually no
contribution to GDP growth in 1995.
Rising capital spending against a background of slower profits growth and
higher tax payments implies a declining financial balance. ICCs' financial
surplus is forecast to fall from 2 1/4 per cent of GDP in 1994 to 1 per cent
in 1995.
The labour market
Interpreting developments in the labour market is made difficult by
discrepancies in estimates of employment between the Labour Force Survey
(LFS) and the employer-based survey, especially for men. According to the
LFS, which is a survey of households, the trough in employment occurred in
winter 1992-93, and by summer 1994 employment had risen by 334,000, with the
increase split fairly evenly between men and women. But according to the
employer-based survey, employment has increased by only 44,000 since its
trough in March 1993, with male employment having fallen.
Some discrepancy is not surprising as the two series are not attempting to
measure exactly the same thing. For example, the LFS counts people in
employment while the employer-based survey counts jobs. Nevertheless over
the past year they cannot be readily reconciled by adjusting for known
coverage differences. Of the two measures, the LFS seems more consistent
with what has been happening to unemployment and output. If employment had
not been increasing, the fall in unemployment would imply a large decline in
labour market participation, which would not be easy to explain. At the
present stage of the cycle participation normally increases.
Uncertainty about what has been happening recently to employment carries
over to the published data for productivity, and hence unit wage costs.
These are currently calculated using the employer-based, not LFS, estimates
of employment. Recorded non-North Sea productivity growth has yet to show
any sustained slowdown, contrary to what might have been expected two and a
half years into recovery. Indeed it rose by 3 1/2 per cent in the year to
the second quarter of 1994, somewhat faster than the 3 per cent recorded in
1993. This could reflect the acceleration of output in the first half of
1994, though if employment is under-recorded recent productivity growth is
overstated by the published figures. But the 6 per cent rise in
manufacturing productivity in the year to the third quarter is probably
reasonably accurate, because the data problems lie largely outside the
manufacturing sector.
Productivity growth in both the manufacturing sector and the non-North Sea
economy as a whole is forecast to revert towards trend rates in 1995. This
is usual once recoveries become more mature, and consistent with companies
operating at a satisfactorily high level of labour utilisation.
Unemployment has continued to fall at a fairly rapid rate. Again there are
two alternative measures, but they both tell much the same story. The LFS
measure (on the internationally agreed definition) shows a fall of 273,000
in unemployment in Great Britain from its peak in winter 1992-93 to summer
1994. Over the same period the GB claimant count fell 334,000. The main
differences in coverage between these measures are that LFS unemployment
includes non-claimants who are looking for work, and the claimant count
includes a similar number of people who are not classified as unemployed in
the LFS. The latest LFS figures show a slower rate of decline since the
spring than the claimant count, which is consistent with rising
participation. This is the normal pattern as economies continue to expand,
with more people being encouraged to seek work.
Total claimant unemployment in the UK was 2.52 million in October 1994,
455,000 down on its peak at the end of 1992. Over the past six months it has
fallen by 27,000 a month on average, rather faster than the average monthly
decline of 21,000 a month since the peak. Looking ahead, improving job
prospects, demographic factors and the new incapacity benefit medical test
are likely to increase the number of people participating in the labour
market. This means that unemployment is likely to fall less than employment
rises.
The current account deficit has declined sharply this year. In the second
quarter it was Pounds 700 million, the lowest figure since 1987. Much of
this improvement arose from a stronger invisible surplus, with net
investment income at its highest-ever level. The visible deficit also fell,
largely the consequence of higher oil output. But more recently the non-oil
balance has shown a noticeable improvement too. In the three months to
August the non-oil deficit was Pounds 3.1 billion compared with Pounds 3.6
billion a year earlier.
The recent improvement in the performance of non-oil visible trade is in
part the result of better competitiveness:
The improvement in cost competitiveness following sterling's withdrawal from
the ERM has been largely maintained. Cost competitiveness is currently
estimated to be more than 10 per cent better than in the second quarter of
1992. Changes in unit labour costs in the UK are projected to be much the
same as overseas, implying that, if the exchange rate stays close to recent
levels as assumed, the current level of competitiveness will be broadly
maintained.
Taken at face value the published figures suggest that export price
competitiveness is worse than before sterling left the ERM. However, it
seems likely that there is a discontinuity in the export price series at the
beginning of 1993 when the Intrastat system for recording European Union
trade was introduced. Making some allowance for this, export price
competitiveness is probably close to its pre-ERM exit level.
The differences between cost and price competitiveness result mainly from
the rebuilding of profit margins by UK exporters. These were squeezed
sharply during sterling's membership of the ERM, when firms held export
prices down in the face of rising costs. Margins regained their pre-ERM
levels by the third quarter of this year, although the discontinuity in
export prices means that published figures probably exaggerate the increase.
Higher margins encourage firms to supply the export market, and this appears
to be more than offsetting any reduction in demand for UK exports because of
higher prices. Recent figures for manufacturing export volumes and survey
indicators of the state of firms' order books do not suggest any fall off in
overseas demand for UK goods - quite the reverse. The export orders balance
in the November CBI survey was at its highest level since March 1988. While
margins are not expected to grow any further, the favourable prospects for
unit labour cost growth in the UK mean that the incentive to export should
remain strong, notwithstanding increases in other costs.
Exports of non-oil goods increased by 10 1/2 per cent in volume terms in the
three months to August compared with a year earlier. This strong growth was
well spread across categories. Non-oil exports to other European Union
countries rose by 14 per cent, comfortably in excess of market growth. UK
exports to other countries rose by 5 1/2 per cent in the three months to
October compared with a year earlier. Exports overall appear to have
increased faster than UK export markets.
The prospects remain good. UK export market growth, forecast to be 8 per
cent in 1994, is expected to be around 7 1/2 per cent in 1995, as stronger
growth in Europe largely replaces weaker demand growth from North America.
Exports of manufactures are expected to rise by 9 1/2 per cent in 1994, and
they more than maintain their improved market share in 1995, increasing by 8
per cent. Non-oil exports in total are expected to grow at a similar rate.
Non-oil import volumes have been subdued this year. They were lower in the
three months to August than in the first quarter, even though demand
increased. Compared with a year earlier they have risen by 5 1/2 per cent.
Non-oil imports are expected to be 5 1/4 per cent higher in 1994 than in
1993. This is a modest increase in relation to the anticipated demand growth
of 4 per cent - normally imports have grown 3-4 per cent faster than demand,
the consequence of continuing specialisation of world production.
This improved import performance is probably the result of better
competitiveness in the UK. It is expected to continue, with import growth of
6 per cent in 1995, around 2 1/2 percentage points faster than demand.
Export prices have risen sharply since sterling left the ERM as margins have
been rebuilt, although the published figures may overstate the increase.
Even so, recorded export prices have not increased as much as import prices.
Thus the non-oil terms of trade are 2 per cent below pre-ERM exit levels,
with import prices up 15 1/4 per cent and export prices up 13 per cent.
While the rise in export prices is largely accounted for by higher margins,
the rise in import prices is more than accounted for by the impact of the
lower exchange rate and the growth of world prices. Non-oil import prices
are expected to rise by around 2 1/4 per cent in 1995, a little less than in
1994 partly because of slower growth in commodity prices. Export prices are
forecast to rise by around 3 per cent in 1995, much the same as domestic
producer output prices but a little faster than competing world prices.
North Sea output in the third quarter of 1994 was nearly half as high again
as at the start of 1993. In 1994 as a whole it is expected to be 27 per cent
higher than in 1993. But growth of less than 2 per cent is forecast for 1995
because most of the major new developments are now on stream. The increase
in output has benefited the current account. Despite a fall of about 9 per
cent in the sterling oil price, the oil balance is expected almost to double
between 1993 and 1994, rising from Pounds 2 1/2 billion to Pounds 4 1/2
billion. A small further increase is expected in 1995.
The surplus on invisibles increased sharply in the first half of 1994 to
Pounds 3 1/2 billion, Pounds 1 billion more than in the second half of 1993.
This was more than accounted for by higher investment income (the earnings
on the UK's net holdings of overseas assets) which rose to over Pounds 4
billion, the highest figure ever recorded. Although figures for investment
income are erratic and prone to revision, outturns over the past couple of
years suggest it should continue to make a significant contribution to the
surplus on invisibles.
Despite a weak outturn in the second quarter of 1994, the prospects for the
balance of services are also favourable. It should benefit from improved
competitiveness and the recovery in world activity. The overall surplus on
invisibles is expected to fall back to around Pounds 3 1/2 billion in 1995
from Pounds 5 billion in 1994, with the turnaround more than accounted for
by erratic movements of investment income.
The current account deficit is expected to more than halve from Pounds 10
1/2 billion in 1993 to Pounds 4 billion in 1994. It is forecast to fall a
little further in 1995 to Pounds 3 1/2 billion. The improvement in 1994 is
largely the result of a fall in the visible deficit. A further fall in the
visible deficit more than accounts for the projected fall in the current
account deficit in 1995.
With the financial surpluses of both the personal and ICC sectors projected
to decline, the financial surplus of the private sector as a whole is
forecast to fall to 3 3/4 per cent of GDP in 1995 and 2 per cent of GDP in
the first half of 1996. This compares with surpluses of around 6 per cent in
both 1993 and 1994.
The main counterpart is a lower public sector deficit, consistent with the
substantial fall in the PSBR. The current account deficit is expected to
fall from around 1 3/4 per cent of GDP in 1993 to about 1/2 per cent in 1994
and to remain at that level in 1995 and the first half of 1996.
Developments
Sterling has remained stable against a basket of currencies this year,
although it has appreciated against the dollar and depreciated against the
main European currencies and the yen. For the most part the sterling index
has been in the range of 79 to 81, averaging a little over 80 in recent
weeks.
Base rates were reduced by  1/4 percentage point to 5 1/4 per cent in
February. In September, as the strength of the recovery became evident, and
to ensure that no risks were taken with inflation, base rates were raised by
 1/2 percentage point to 5 3/4 per cent. Other short-term rates have
followed a similar pattern: variable mortgage rates are back at the same
level as a year ago, having been  1/4 percentage point or so lower in the
first half of 1994; deposit rates have moved similarly.
Long rates rose steadily in the first half of the year. This was to a large
extent prompted by developments abroad, especially in the US, which led to a
rise in bond rates world wide. UK rates initially rose by more than other G7
countries' rates, but they have been declining recently and the differential
with other G7 rates has narrowed. Yields on 10-year gilts, which peaked at 9
1/4 per cent in mid-September, are now 8 3/4 per cent. The future rates of
inflation implicit in gilt yields remain well above most forecasts of
inflation. Although the rise in long rates may have contributed to the
renewed weakness in the housing market, there is no evidence that it has
been a significant drag on recovery in other sectors.
House prices have moved erratically over the past couple of years. They are
currently around the same level as a year ago. The commercial property
market is in the early stages of recovery, though rents and capital values
remain very depressed. Equity prices rose sharply in 1993 and in early 1994
before falling back with the decline in world bond markets. Since the spring
they have fluctuated with no apparent trend. In late November they were
about 15 per cent below their peak in February and little changed from a
year ago. The dividend yield is about 4 per cent.
The 12-month growth rate of M0 was 7.3 per cent in October. It has been
above its 0 to 4 per cent medium-term monitoring range since the start of
1993. A period of rapid M0 growth is normal when interest rates are reduced
as the public adjusts its cash holdings to reflect their lower cost in terms
of interest forgone. M4's 12-month growth rate was 3.8 per cent in October.
So far this year it has remained in the range 3 3/4 to 5 1/2 per cent, below
the middle of its medium-term monitoring range of 3 to 9 per cent.
The growth of M4 lending - bank and building society lending to the UK
private sector - has continued to be weak. In October its 12-month growth
rate was 3.8 per cent - the highest figure for the year to date. Lending
secured on residential property has been growing more rapidly - its 12-month
rate has been over 6 per cent. But industrial and commercial companies, as
they have moved from financial deficit to surplus and taken opportunities to
exploit cheaper forms of finance, have continued to repay bank debt.
The economy now appears to be running with less spare capacity than
previously expected, particularly in the manufacturing sector, implying less
disinflationary pressure. Yet underlying inflation, as measured by the RPI
excluding mortgage interest payments (MIPs), has continued to fall by more
than forecast, recently reaching a 27-year low of 2 per cent.
Taken together, these factors suggest little overall change in the balance
of inflationary pressures, compared to the assessment made in the summer
economic forecast. While there may be a small pick-up next year, inflation
is expected to remain low by historical standards. Despite increasing
capacity utilisation, there is still scope for output to expand without
posing a serious inflationary threat.
However, in the shorter term the buoyancy of the manufacturing sector is
likely to afford opportunities for manufacturers to rebuild margins further.
In addition, there is upward pressure on costs from higher commodity prices.
Producer output price inflation has already started to show signs of picking
up. As these effects feed through, underlying RPI inflation is expected to
rise temporarily from its current very low level. But the rise is expected
to be limited by the intensity of competition in the retail sector.
Underlying average earnings growth picked up from its low of 3 per cent in
autumn 1993 to 3 3/4 per cent in January this year. Since then it has
remained remarkably flat, only occasionally rising to 4 per cent in months
when earnings were temporarily boosted by high bonus and overtime payments.
Moreover settlements generally are still very low, although they have been
edging up over the past year. Latest data from the CBI show settlements in
the third quarter of 2.9 per cent in manufacturing and 3.4 per cent in
services, both about  3/4 percentage points up on the fourth quarter of
1993. No doubt rising demand, good productivity performance and increased
profits have relieved some of the pressure on companies to contain earnings,
while allowing them to keep unit labour costs under tight control.
Unit wage costs in the non-North Sea economy are estimated to have risen by
only  3/4 per cent in 1993, and to have barely changed at all in the year to
the second quarter of 1994. These figures may be somewhat flattering if the
employer-based estimates of employment (to which they are linked) have been
under-recording job creation over the past year to the extent suggested by
the LFS. Nevertheless, unit wage cost performance has been impressive.
This is particularly true in the manufacturing sector, where the data are
more reliable. Manufacturing unit wage costs have been falling: in the third
quarter of 1994 they were 1.4 per cent lower than a year earlier. They also
seem likely to be lower in 1994 as a whole, following a small rise in 1993.
This probably explains why producer output price inflation continued to fall
through to the summer, when it reached 2 per cent. But with a sharp increase
in input prices, up 7.1 per cent in the year to October, and with
manufacturers seeking to increase domestic margins, output prices have
already picked up in recent months. The annualised three-month rate of
producer output price inflation in October was 3 1/2 per cent, up sharply
from its low point of 1 per cent in April.
Looking ahead, unit labour cost growth is likely to pick up a little as
productivity growth slows down and earnings growth increases. Moreover,
manufacturers are expected to take advantage of buoyant markets to push
through further increases in domestic margins. Some may also be looking to
pass on higher imported input and other raw material costs, despite
offsetting effects from unit labour costs. Price expectations as measured by
the CBI survey certainly point to further upward movement in output prices
in the months ahead. As a result, producer output price inflation is
forecast to rise temporarily to 3 1/4 per cent by mid-1995. It is expected
to fall back to 2 1/4 per cent by mid-1996, as upward pressure on margins
eases and import cost inflation recedes.
Retail prices
Underlying RPI inflation was 2 per cent in October, and is now expected to
average 2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1994. This is  1/2 percentage
point below the summer economic forecast, and 1 1/4 points below last
November's Budget forecast. It is forecast to rise to 2 1/2 per cent by the
end of 1995, mainly as a result of higher producer output price inflation.
The forecast rise in underlying RPI inflation is, however, much less
pronounced than for producer output price inflation, because competition in
retailing is expected to remain tougher than in the more buoyant
manufacturing sector.
The recent increase in interest rates and the further reduction in mortgage
interest relief in April 1995 will tend to keep all-items RPI inflation
above the underlying rate. But the outlook for the all-items rate will also
depend on what happens to interest rates from now on. Other things being
equal, each 1 percentage point change in mortgage rates changes the level of
the all-items RPI by just over  1/2 per cent.
Prospects for the GDP deflator differ from those for retail prices primarily
because of its wider coverage. It is forecast to rise by 2 per cent in
1994-95, 2 percentage points less than in the last Budget forecast. Most of
this downward revision reflects the outturns for the first two quarters of
the financial year which show domestic prices, particularly for investment,
growing more slowly and the terms of trade slightly less favourable than
previously forecast. In 1995-96 the GDP deflator is forecast to increase by
3 1/4 per cent. This acceleration is expected to be temporary and mainly
reflects a rebound in investment prices from extremely low levels and the
projected rise in the terms of trade.

Earns: Pounds 21,000
Politics: Not sure.
Verdict: 'It was encouraging in that it said the things I wanted to hear,
like cuts in public spending. But the net effect will be a slight increase
in taxes and less disposable income, which is not good for someone in
business for themselves. The one thing that did please me was that I can now
do employees' national insurance and tax quarterly instead of monthly. These
changes lift a great and costly administrative burden.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Red Book Details): Health and growth return to
economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The economy is now recovering strongly, and inflation has fallen to its
lowest level since the 1960s. The Budget is designed to ensure that the
improvements in the public finances announced in 1993 are delivered, and to
introduce further structural reforms to make the economy work better. This
will help to ensure sustainable growth in the medium term, supported by
permanently low inflation.
The public finances: The tax and spending measures in the two 1993 Budgets
were intended to ensure that the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR)
returns towards balance in the medium term, and the projections published
last November showed it close to balance by 1998-99. The deficit on the
government's current account was projected to disappear by 1997-98.
But the economy has grown faster than envisaged a year ago, with GDP now
expected to be up 4 per cent in 1994. And inflation has turned out lower,
taking it well into the lower half of the Government's target range.
Faster growth will tend to bring the PSBR down more rapidly. But lower
prices reduce revenues, which tends to raise public borrowing. So the
government has made substantial cash reductions in its spending plans, which
are also slightly lower in real terms than a year ago.
This should enable the PSBR to return to balance by the end of the decade,
as intended in last year's Budget, with the public sector current account
deficit eliminated by 1997-98.
Most of the reductions in general government expenditure are accounted for
by reductions in the Control Total, though cyclical social security is also
lower because of lower unemployment, lower prices and the measures in the
Budget. Privatisation proceeds are also increased from 1995-96 to 1997-98.
The changes in receipts are mainly accounted for by changes in the path of
the economy; the medium-term effect of the Budget measures is comparatively
small, though transitional relief for business rates reduces revenue in the
short term.
The Budget is intended to be broadly neutral in its effects on the public
finances, given the changed paths of output and inflation since last
November. Higher output is reflected in a lower PSBR than in the November
1993 Budget, particularly in the next three years.
Employment boost
To help people back to work, family credit will be increased for those in
full time work; payments of housing benefit and family credit will be
accelerated for people taking jobs; and, in a pilot study, family credit
will be paid to people without children.
To help the unemployed back into work, Community Action will be extended;
there will be more Work Trial opportunities; three existing pilot schemes,
Jobfinder's Grant, Workwise, and 1-2-1, will become available nationally;
and two other pilot schemes, Workstart and Jobmatch, will be further
developed.
To make it cheaper to take on new staff, employer national insurance
contributions will be cut by 0.6 per cent for employees earning less than
Pounds 205 a week; and they will no longer have to be paid for the first
year of employment when taking on someone who has been unemployed for two
years.
To reform training, the Training for Work programme will be refocused to
increase the number of trainees who get jobs. Around Pounds 325m will also
be spent over the next three years on the training measures announced in the
Competitiveness White Paper.
To improve the working of the housing market, housing benefit will be
reformed so that, whether or not rents are met through housing benefit,
landlords and tenants take price as well as size and quality into account in
agreeing tenancies. Scaling back income support for mortgage interest from
October 1995 will transfer more of the cost of mortgage default to lenders
and borrowers where it properly belongs, and also reduce the work
disincentives which current arrangements create.
To help exporters, ECGD average medium- and long-term premiums will be
reduced by around 10 per cent. The limit on cover for important developing
country markets is rolled forward and increased by Pounds 300m in 1997-98.
To promote investment, the private finance initiative is gathering speed.
Contracts involving around Pounds 5bn of capital investment are expected to
be let in 1995.
To encourage more investment in small businesses, there are a number of
proposals flowing from the Industrial Finance Initiative.
A new Venture Capital Trust scheme will be introduced.
This scheme will provide income tax relief at 20 per cent, and CGT
reinvestment relief, on investments up to Pounds 100,000 a year in the
shares of trusts which invest mainly in unquoted trading companies.
Income and gains on these shares will be tax free.
Improvements will be made to the Enterprise Investment Scheme introduced
earlier this year.
To cut the regulatory burden on small firms, the threshold for quarterly
payments of PAYE and NICs will be raised to Pounds 600 a month. The VAT
registration threshold will be indexed.
There will be consultation on annual VAT accounting and a simplified VAT
scheme for small traders.
To encourage personal saving, holders of Tax Exempt Special Savings Accounts
will be able to deposit up to Pounds 9,000 capital from a mature account in
a new account. Personal Equity Plans will be extended to cover corporate
bonds and preference shares.
Moves to curb public spending
The Control Total is reduced by Pounds 6.9bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 8.3bn and
Pounds 8.9bn the following two years. This is achieved by:
Savings on most programmes to reflect the lower level of prices;
A concerted drive to improve efficiency and reduce waste in Government: cash
running costs of civil departments are planned to be the same in 1997-98 as
in 1993-94; provision for the rest of the public sector assumes pay
increases will be offset by efficiency gains and other economies;
Measures to restrain the growth of social security including a reform of
housing benefit. A drive against fraud and reform of income support for
mortgage interest will also restrain social security spending which falls
outside the Control Total;
Reductions in the housing and roads programmes.
At the same time, priority has been given to health, where spending will
grow in real terms each year.
The government's achievements on education and law and order are protected;
and there are extra funds for science and overseas aid.
Additional resources are provided for home insulation and cold weather
payments on top of last year's Pounds 1.25bn package of extra help to
pensioners and those on income related benefits to meet the cost of VAT on
domestic fuel and power.
Tax changes
The tax measures in the Budget are designed to:
Increase the main personal allowance and income tax thresholds in line with
prices. The annual exempt amount for CGT and the threshold for inheritance
tax are also indexed. The lower rate tax band is increased by Pounds 200 to
Pounds 3,200;
Help pensioners by increasing personal allowances for those aged 65 and over
by Pounds 430;
Support environmental and health objectives by raising road fuel duties by 5
per cent in real terms and tobacco duties by 3 per cent in real terms, in
line with the commitments given in last November's Budget.
Duty on diesel is aligned with unleaded petrol. Vehicle excise duty for cars
rises by Pounds 5. A tax on landfilled waste will be introduced in 1996
after consultation, with costs on business offset by lower employer national
insurance contributions;
Ease the transition for those businesses facing higher rates bills in
1995-96 and beyond following the revaluation of properties.
Increases in real terms will be limited to 10 per cent a year for large
premises and 7 1/2 per cent for smaller premises. Support will be funded
partly by the Exchequer and partly by limiting real gains for those with
lower valuations to 5 per cent a year for large premises and 10 per cent for
smaller premises;
Stop a number of artificial schemes to avoid tax.

Said yesterday: 'There was no sense of a feelgood factor. We are constantly
told the economy is improving but there was no recognition of this in the
Budget. In particular, I would like to have seen him do something about the
VAT on fuel. If we are to find alternative forms of transport and get cars
off the road, then the current increase in petrol prices will not be enough.
I was glad to hear of the increase in education spending, but I would like

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Red Book Details): Policy benefits come in ahead
of schedule - Medium-term financial strategy, creating an environment for
sustained low inflation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The objective of the government's economic policy is to promote sustained
economic growth and rising prosperity.
This requires structural policies to improve the long-term performance of
the economy and a stable macro-economic environment.
Inflation: Economies function most efficiently in conditions of low and
stable inflation. Since October 1992, the government has had an explicit
inflation objective. The aim is to keep underlying inflation (as measured by
the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments) in the range 1-4 per cent and
to bring it down into the lower half of this range by the end of the present
parliament. This aim is being achieved; underlying inflation is already in
the lower half of the range and at its lowest levels for nearly 30 years.
Monetary policy: It is the role of monetary policy to deliver low inflation.
Since monetary policy influences inflation with a lag, interest rate
decisions are based on an assessment of the prospects for underlying
inflation in one to two years' time. This assessment is based on a wide
range of information, including:
Monetary and other financial indicators that could provide advance warning
of changes in inflation pressures. They include the growth in the narrow and
broad monetary aggregates, movements in the exchange rate and asset prices,
and expectations about future inflation;
Indicators of activity that could affect wage- and price-setting by firms
and employees. If overall demand runs ahead of the economy's capacity to
supply goods and services (as indicated for example by reductions in spare
capacity, strong retail sales growth and labour shortages), inflation
pressures may increase. The overall stance of fiscal policy is also taken
into account;
Indicators of costs which may affect final prices directly; in particular,
rises in wage costs and material input prices (including commodity prices).
Since the start of the year, the minutes of the monthly monetary meetings
between the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England have been
published.
The chancellor's and governor's assessments of inflation pressures and the
overall conduct of monetary policy are thus much more open to scrutiny. As a
result the monetary framework is now one of the most open in the world.
M0 growth has been above the top of its 0-4 per cent range since early 1993.
This is something the government has taken seriously. It has been a signal
of faster than expected growth in overall activity. But in part it probably
has also reflected the temporary effects of adjustment to lower interest
rate levels.
It is also becoming evident that the recent rapid growth in M0 may reflect a
potentially lasting change in its medium-term trend relative to GDP. It is
likely that, in an environment of sustained low inflation and lower nominal
interest rates, there is less incentive to economise on cash holdings and
velocity will grow more slowly. This may imply that over the medium term M0
can grow faster than previously thought without putting the government's
inflation objective at risk.
This change in trend would be consistent with experience in the 1950s and
1960s.
However, it is too soon to be certain that there has been a permanent shift
in trend. For much of the next year annual M0 growth is expected to remain
above the top of its 0-4 per cent range. But growth could fall back during
the year as the effects of interest rate cuts weaken, and as growth in
activity moderates.
Over the last year M4 has remained in the lower half of its 3-9 per cent
range. Growth in lending has also been very weak, as industrial and
commercial companies in total have continued to repay bank borrowing.
There is uncertainty about trend growth in M4 also, which can be affected
substantially by changes in financial innovation (as has happened in the US
recently).
Given these uncertainties, the government will retain for the time being the
existing medium-term monitoring ranges for M0 and M4.
It will continue to assess the growth of narrow and broad money alongside
the evidence of all the other indicators. The monitoring ranges will,
however, be reviewed carefully in the light of continued experience.
Fiscal policy: The role of fiscal policy is to ensure sound public finances.
The fiscal objective is to bring the PSBR back to balance over the medium
term, and the November 1993 Budget set the public finances on a path to
achieve this.
Aiming for budget balance is a prudent objective given the considerable
uncertainties about medium-term prospects. It allows some safety margin
against unfavourable developments and ensures that the ratio of public
sector debt to GDP, and hence the burden of debt service, will fall.
As the PSBR returns toward zero, the general government financial deficit
will fall below the reference value of 3 per cent of GDP set out in the
European Union's excessive deficits procedure and the public sector's
balance on current account will move into surplus. These 'milestones' will
be passed in 1996-97 and 1997-98 respectively.
The government is committed to reducing public expenditure as a proportion
of national income. It does not have a target for capital spending, which is
now more clearly distinguished in the public sector accounts.
However, the government intends that a steadily rising proportion of capital
investment in the public services should be financed by private capital,
based on a proper transfer or sharing of risk.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (The Speech): How the six wise men saw the
chancellor's performance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Andrew Britton
National Institute of Economic and Social Research
It is a broadly neutral Budget, which is right for this year. The chancellor
has said that he will make more significant tax cuts when they can be
afforded, that is to say when the level of borrowing has been significantly
reduced. On his present figuring, that claim might well be made in his
Budget speech next year.
The Budget includes some welcome changes, particularly the measures to
reduce structural unemployment. I was particularly pleased to hear of the
cut in the rate of National Insurance cont-ributions at the lower end of the
scale.
He described the measures as affordable, which means he felt constrained by
the need to reduce borrowing. He was able, nevertheless, to make some useful
changes to the benefit system, which will help the transition back to work,
especially for the long-term unemployed. It was, overall, a step in the
right direction, but it leaves a lot still to be done - perhaps next year.
Tim Congdon
Lombard Research
With this Budget, the chancellor has consolidated the progress in reducing
public sector borrowing which began in the two Budgets of 1993. Next year
the PSBR will be 3 per cent of GDP, still rather high but no longer
excessive. In 1996-97, there is a good chance the public debt will be
growing more slowly than national output.
That is a signal achievement, particularly in an international environment
where virtually all other industrial countries have rising ratios of public
debt to national income and serious problems of long-run fiscal
unsustainability.
After massive tax increases announced in 1993, a large change in the tax
burden was plainly not in prospect. Instead, Mr Clarke has made only
marginal discretionary changes. This cramped his style and made for a very
dull speech. Nevertheless, the outlook for the PSBR is exciting.
David Currie
London Business School
This is a well-crafted Budget, delivered with characteristic panache. The
overall Budget judgment is the right one: a broadly neutral Budget, but
leaving in place the Pounds 6.5bn tax increases due next year as a result of
the 1993 Budgets. The cuts in public spending are largely in cash terms, and
not real, reflecting lower inflation; and the chancellor has made some
sensitive adjustments to spending priorities, notably in health.
However, the Budget does not avert the need for further rises in interest
rates if the chancellor is to maintain his ambitious inflation target.
The measures to promote savings, help the long-term unemployed and in taxing
landfill are imaginative, though he could have gone further, particularly in
using environmental taxes to reduce taxes on jobs, particularly for the
low-paid.
The chancellor's caution this year leaves him room for manoeuvre next year,
when we may see more fireworks.
Gavyn Davies
Goldman Sachs International
The package of measures to help the structural unemployed is welcome, though
limited, and the chancellor has been wise enough to ignore calls for early
tax cuts. However, he may not have done enough in this Budget to slow demand
growth, which is now clearly excessive.
I would have preferred larger cuts in the real level of government spending,
or higher consumer taxes, to slow the economy and thus limit the need for
higher base rates.
Although the PSBR is falling fast, this does not justify tax cuts now or
later. Paradoxically the government needs the economy to slow down from its
present excessive rate in order to justify tax cuts, even if this retards
the drop in PSBR.
One way of achieving this is to raise interest rates further in the near
future - something which would anyway have been needed, but now looks more
necessary in the wake of today's broadly neutral package.
Professor Wynne Godley
Cambridge University
Given the current rate of economic expansion, there remains the danger that
the Budget was not tough enough in strategic terms. The chancellor is taking
a bit of a risk in not capitalising on the current favourable economic
conditions to raise taxes further and cut public expenditure in order to
arrest growth. Tighter fiscal and spending measures would allow for a more
accomodative monetary policy later.
I stated in the last Treasury advisers' memo that the right thing to do is
nothing at all. I would be sorry in the event of economic overheating if the
chancellor was forced to raise interest rates prohibitively.
The focus should be on getting investment going and maintaining a
competitive exchange rate.
Professor Patrick Minford
Liverpool University
This is a cautious Budget, built on a supply-based improvement in UK
performance that has surprised forecasters. It has a welcome emphasis on
modest improvements to incentives for the low-paid and on continuing
reforms, and unexpectedly tough control, of public spending, including the
injection of private finance.
The chancellor rejected demands for higher capital allowances against
corporation tax, preferring to keep the low corporation tax rates. The new
housing benefit rules should stop 'rent inflation'. The forecasts of the
PSBR have been revised down sharply, but still look too high and show that
fears about the public finances were greatly exaggerated.
There is scope for tax cuts: Mr Clarke's Pounds 1bn-plus devoted to business
rates and the low-paid is modest. But by deferring large-scale tax cuts he
has scotched any case for raising interest rates.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94: The chancellor's speech
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor makes no change to income tax rates, but personal allowances
are to be indexed and the 20p tax band widened to Pounds 3,200. Drivers
suffer as car excise duty is raised by Pounds 5 to Pounds 135 a year and
petrol rises by 2.5p and diesel by 3p a litre. Smokers are penalised for
their habit, with cigarettes up by 10p for 20. Drinkers, however, are spared
any further pain
The Financial Statement and Budget Report, with a number of press releases
filling out the details of my proposals, will be available from the Vote
Office as soon as I have sat down.
I have three priorities in my Budget this year. First, to keep the economy
on track to achieve the great prize of sustainable growth. This recovery
offers the best prospect that the British people have faced for many years
to enjoy the benefits of growth that does not pass through illusory boom to
painful bust.
My second priority has been to use this recovery wisely, to encourage the
creation of more jobs particularly for people who have been out of work for
some time. We must combine greater prosperity for the majority with measures
to prevent the emergence of a deprived underclass excluded from the
opportunity to work and dependent on welfare.
The third priority is to strengthen the economy in the longer term. We must
aim for a modern economy in which the growth of enterprising companies will
give people a greater sense of confidence in the flow of new jobs that will
always be required to replace the old jobs eroded by technology and
competition.
UK Economy
The background to this year's Budget is the healthy growth in output that we
are seeing in Britain and overseas. The recovery has been under way at a
modest pace for over 2 1/2 years.
It is now stronger and output has grown by over 4 per cent over the past
year. That is easily the fastest rate of growth of any of the major European
economies.
The forecasts I am publishing with this Budget show the economy expected to
grow by 3 1/4 per cent next year.
As the recovery has got stronger, growth has come increasingly from exports.
Over the last year, exports have grown by over 8 per cent. Investment in
plant and machinery has grown by over 5 per cent. Consumer demand has
increased by a more modest 2 to 3 per cent.
That is a very healthy shape for this stage of the recovery and bodes well
for our long-term future as a competitive industrial economy.
Our exporters have been able to take advantage of the pick-up in growth
overseas, by keeping their costs down and raising their productivity. Our
producers have succeeded in improving their performance in domestic markets,
so that while exports continue to rise, imports are little changed. Overall,
I expect our balance of payments on current account to improve by over
Pounds 6bn this year.
An improving balance of payments is remarkable at a time when the economy is
growing strongly. More encouragingly still, inflation has remained low.
Underlying inflation has fallen to levels we have not seen for a generation.
Indeed, only about one third of the population of this country have ever
experienced such low inflation during their adult life. The other two thirds
are still finding it difficult to adjust to the change.
Unemployment is on a clear downward trend, having fallen by over 450,000
since December 1992. The UK is the only major economy in Europe where
unemployment has fallen over the past year.
The unemployment rate in this country is lower than the European Union
average. And the number of people in work is rising. The Labour Force Survey
shows an increase of 226,000 in the last 12 months. That means real new jobs
for people up and down the country.
Mr Deputy Speaker, we are seeing strong output growth, strong export growth,
falling unemployment, an improving balance of payments and low inflation.
This combination is almost unique in this country since the war.
But let us be under no illusions. These promising conditions have to be
sustained if they are to deliver higher living standards and secure jobs for
men and women. And these promising conditions have only arisen at all
because of the difficult decisions this government has been prepared to take
in recent years.
We must not throw away the gains that have been made by turning to some
short-term dash for yet faster growth. Growth will only be sustained if we
keep the lid on inflation, get public borrowing down further, and push ahead
with measures which strengthen the economy. That is the way to convert
growth into prosperity and jobs.
That way lies the virtuous circle of improved competitiveness, rising
productivity, economic growth, low inflation, and more jobs. We must not
change our minds now for the sake of short-term popularity. Only by keeping
our nerve and sticking to the determined policies that we have put in place
over the past couple of years will we be able to enjoy the full fruits of
improved economic performance in rising prosperity and lower unemployment.
Inflation
Mr Deputy Speaker, let me deal first with inflation. Low inflation creates a
climate of stability which encourages savings and investment in the future
of this country. Nothing would be more damaging than if we let inflation off
the leash again, only to have to take another dose of bitter
anti-inflationary medicine.
The British experience is that high inflation has brought economic recovery
to a halt three times over the past 20 years. That is three times too often
for my liking.
And while we have succeeded in bringing inflation down to levels last seen
when England won the World Cup, we must never take that for granted. Before
that game I had lived in a low-inflation economy.
I live in one again now and I am glad to say that our inflation rate is well
below the European average. We need to keep up this performance, if we are
to be a competitive manufacturing nation enjoying the living standards of
the best in future.
I will therefore continue to set interest rates to meet our objective of
keeping underlying inflation in a range of 1 to 4 per cent, and in the lower
half of that range by the end of the present Parliament. That is a tough
target by Britain's recent standards, though not by those of some of our
best competitors.
To make sure we achieve it, I have backed good intentions and resolve, with
a number of important decisions over the last year that have strengthened
the framework for policy.
The Bank of England's quarterly Inflation Report is now fully independent of
the Treasury. The governor decides the precise timing of interest rate
changes. And, most importantly, I decided in the spring to publish the
minutes of my meetings with the governor.
As a result we now have one of the most open frameworks for monetary
policy-making in the world. This will stand us in good stead in keeping
inflation permanently low.
It will most certainly not avoid the need to take tough decisions at times.
In September the governor and I agreed that, with the recovery strengthening
at home and prices rising abroad, there was a sufficient risk of inflation
picking up here to justify raising interest rates by half a per cent. By
acting before retail price inflation itself picks up, we aim to nip
inflation in the bud.
I expect inflation to rise slightly over the next year, reaching a temporary
plateau of around 2 1/2 per cent, as a result of higher commodity prices and
stronger profit margins in our buoyant manufacturing industries. But
continuing competitive pressures will ensure that producers and retailers
keep costs under control and pass on the benefit to consumers. I expect that
underlying inflation should then resume its downward trend.
Gilt Market Repos
Before I turn to the public finances, I can announce an important further
development of the gilts market. The Bank of England is publishing today a
consultative document on the establishment of an open sale and repurchase -
repo - market.
This should improve both liquidity and efficiency, reducing yields and hence
the government's debt interest costs. Each reduction in yields of just one
basis point - one hundredth of one per cent - will eventually save more than
Pounds 25m a year of public expenditure.
Public finances
I turn now to the public finances.
Last year, I continued the process started by my rt hon friend the member
for Kingston Upon Thames. I announced measures which cut the Public Sector
Borrowing Requirement by 1 1/4 per cent of GDP by the end of this
Parliament.
Combined with the healthy growth in the economy that we are now enjoying,
those measures have helped bring down the PSBR from Pounds 45.5bn in 1993-94
to an expected Pounds 34.5bn this year. My objective remains the same: to
balance the Budget over the medium-term.
We remain on course to eliminate government borrowing entirely by the end of
the decade. By 1996-97 borrowing will be approximately equal to the
government's net capital expenditure.
About half of my own cuts in public borrowing last year were achieved
through cutting public spending plans. But, because of the length of the
recession, my rt hon friend and I also had to raise taxes to meet the
objective of healthy public finances.
Delay and failure to act would have caused intolerable additional pressures
to raise interest rates faster and to raise taxation still further. We would
not have had strong and sustainable recovery now if we had failed to cut
spending and raise taxes last year.
For that reason, the public spending cuts and the tax increases that I
announced last year remain, of course, quite essential to the strategy of
achieving economic recovery. We have restored confidence in our ability to
achieve sustained recovery by taking firm measures. We would damage that
confidence again if we now seemed to falter or even go back on any of the
measures that we have already put in hand.
VAT on fuel compensation package
I am able to improve the package of help that I announced last year to
cushion the effects of VAT on fuel on all pensioners and on vulnerable
groups - enormous though that package was.
Last year I doubled public spending on the very effective Home Energy
Efficiency Scheme so that, for the first time, everyone over the age of 60
became eligible for a grant. This has been a huge success and soon over 1m
people will have received grants to improve the insulation of their homes,
reducing their excessive heating bills and improving their comfort.
That is still not enough. I am therefore, on top of last year's doubling
which will carry forward each year, adding another Pounds 10m a year to the
resources to fund grants. Soon British homes will at last be a match for the
British weather in every part of the United Kingdom, especially for the
elderly.
Cold weather payments were set at Pounds 6 each week only two years ago. I
now intend to increase them to Pounds 8.50p each week in order to reassure
people that they will get help with their bills when spells of freezing
weather occur.
Furthermore, next year, 1995-96, there will be an additional Pounds 52 for
single pensioners and Pounds 73 for couples built into all retirement
pensions as compensation for VAT on fuel.
From April 1996 there will be Pounds 68 extra on the single pensioner rate
and Pounds 96 for pensioner couples. This is more than the whole of the VAT
on fuel bills for a significant number of them.
In addition electricity prices have been falling for many people. Gas prices
are to be raised for the first time since 1991 but this will be coupled with
discounts for prompt payment that will reduce many peoples' bills.
So far, inclusive of the first stage of VAT, both gas and electricity bills
have fallen by 1 per cent in real terms over the last two years. That
real-terms fall is before taking into account the package of help for
pensioners so far in payment.
The full burden of the tax is, of course, only borne by people of working
age not receiving means-tested benefits. I have made it quite clear that
people of working age cannot expect tax cuts or a reverse of previously
announced tax increases this year.
Public Spending
I would like to turn now to the government's new plans for public spending.
Last year's Budget set a new milestone in the control of public spending. We
managed to reduce the control totals that had been set in the previous
spending round, by Pounds 8bn over three years, and General Government
Expenditure by Pounds 15bn over the same period.
This was a measure of the success of the new system of public expenditure
control introduced in 1992, and the first fruits of the programme of
fundamental reviews of all departments.
The reaction to this new approach was predictable. A welcome from this side
of the House. Criticism and alarmist nonsense from the party opposite. And
scepticism from the so-called experts who doubted whether the plans could be
delivered in practice.
In fact, for the current year, 1994-95, we expect to do better than the
plans that were set, and underspend by more than Pounds 1bn
At the start of this year's survey, cabinet decided that we should also keep
within last year's planned totals for 1995-96 and 1996-97 and allow no more
than 1 per cent real growth for 1997-98.
The plans I am about to announce deliver that remit. But it has not been
easy. Last year's settlement was extremely tight. I am grateful to my rt hon
friend the chief secretary for his skilful handling of what has been a
difficult spending round.
We have been guided by four basic principles this year. First, we have taken
advantage of the welcome fall in inflation since the last Budget.
Thanks to lower inflation the price level in 1995-96 will be 2 1/2 per cent
lower than we expected when we decided on spending plans last year.
We have not let that feed through into a higher level of real resources for
government departments but have reduced our cash plans for almost all
programmes. Lower inflation needs to be matched in the public sector by
lower cash spending.
Second, we have built on the increasingly important role played by private
finance. All government departments are now looking actively at private
finance options.
Third, we have focused our search for savings on administrative and running
costs, cutting the back office and protecting the frontline delivery of key
public services. Our aim has been to provide a better output of public
services, for fewer inputs.
Fourth, we have taken a close look at the government's own spending
priorities. We have looked for savings on some programmes so that resources
can be channelled into the services and policies to which the government
attaches most importance.
Private Finance
Mr Deputy Speaker, privatisation and private finance for capital investment
are rapidly becoming the chosen method for raising the quality of public
services in the majority of countries in every continent in the world. They
started in this country. Although the political debate here has been
transformed since I first became a minister, an irritating amount of
post-Socialist resistance still persists. Fortunately, the government's
private finance initiative remains alive and well and is growing rapidly.
Last year I announced that a number of transport schemes would go ahead
under the private finance initiative. Significant progress has been made.
Pounds 370m of private capital has been invested in transport projects over
the past two years, with a further Pounds 760m already committed. In
addition some Pounds 3.5bn of projects are currently out to competition and
the value of contracts placed will steadily build up from a stream to a
significant flow.
But the private finance initiative runs much wider than transport. There are
now over 50 health projects either approved or completed bringing in over
Pounds 100m of new capital into the NHS. Bids have been received for the
first two privately financed prisons and over Pounds 1bn of Information
Technology projects are now following or considering the private finance
route.
In higher education, universities now get approaching a third of their
revenue from the private sector. And the environment secretary announced on
31 October new proposals to make it easier for local authorities to form
joint ventures with the private sector.
New projects are constantly emerging as the initiative breaks new ground and
today I can announce that we are on course to let contracts in 1995 under
the private finance initiative leading to around Pounds 5bn of capital
investment.
Transport
The growing importance of private finance has helped us to find significant
savings in the transport programme. Over recent years we have seen a huge
increase in public expenditure on the trunk roads and motorway programme
which has risen by one half in real terms over the last 10 years. This was
essential to tackle traffic bottlenecks and to reduce costs on British
industry seeking to get goods to markets at home and abroad.
Now that the main need of the economy is control of public spending and
borrowing, we cannot carry on pumping in the same amount of taxpayer's
money. We have therefore significantly reduced the planned public spending
on trunk roads and motorways.
Even so, public spending on such roads - without taking account of the
expected contribution from private finance - will be considerably higher in
real terms than the average level of provision in the 1980s. Rapid progress
with private finance of Design, Build, Finance and Operate roads will take
provision still higher and four schemes will shortly go out to tender.
Private finance will also now play an increasingly major role in London
Underground investment. In particular, I am pleased to report that the
private finance competition for the provision of a new Northern Line train
service has proceeded apace. My rt hon friend, the secretary of state for
transport, will be able to announce a decision very soon.
This, together, with future deals, should improve the quality of London
Underground investment as well as its quantity. In addition to the
contribution from private finance, the plans in the Budget imply total
investment in the Underground network next financial year of around Pounds
1bn
The Budget also takes account of the key effects expected to arise from rail
privatisation, not least the privatisation of Railtrack within the lifetime
of this Parliament, as announced by my rt hon friend the secretary of state
for transport last week.
As has been the case with other privatisations, rail privatisation will
bring benefits to passengers, from more efficient management bearing down on
costs and being more responsive to passenger needs.
Running Costs
Mr Deputy Speaker, private finance will play an increasingly important role
in financing better infrastructure for public services in coming years. I
now turn to the need for firm control of the government's current, as
opposed to capital, spending.
One of our key objectives this year has been to intensify the search for
savings on administrative and running costs. My rt hon friend the chief
secretary came to the Treasury from the Ministry of Defence where he played
a lead role in preparing the Defence Costs Study. That experience served him
well.
The success of the Defence Costs Study is just one example, a very
successful one, of how key programme objectives can be protected by bearing
down on the administrative costs of delivering them.
The outcome has been a substantial benefit both for the taxpayer and for the
front line.
The defence plans in the Budget fully cover the costs of the important
equipment orders the secretary of state for defence announced in his
statement in July.
Indeed, taking account of the changes in inflation since last year, these
plans actually allow a slightly higher real terms level of spending than
implied by the plans last Budget, accommodating the costs of military
redundancies associated with the Defence Cost Studies.
Improvements in the efficiency of delivering services is a policy that must
apply throughout the public service, and the plans in this Budget reflect
the results of a rigorous scrutiny of the government's own administrative
costs. It must be right for government to modernise its own management
structures and to get its own overhead costs down.
As last year, we have maintained the policy that the pressure from pay and
price increases should be met by greater efficiency or other economies. This
has allowed public services to achieve very reasonable pay settlements that
reflect low levels of inflation and allow modest increases in real earnings.
It is ridiculous to describe this long overdue sensible practice as a pay
freeze.
In total, the plans in this Budget are for central government running costs
not to rise in cash terms over the four-year period from 1993-94 to 1997-98
taken as a whole. This represents a real-terms reduction of more than 10 per
cent in the cost of government. It is consistent with the Civil Service
White Paper expectation that total Civil Service staff numbers will fall
significantly below 500,000 over the next four years to their lowest levels
since the war.
Local Authorities
It is only right that local government should follow central government and
take a similarly tough approach to containing its costs. The government's
proposals for local authorities have been set on this basis.
1995-96 total standard spending in England will be 2.2 per cent higher than
this year, including provision for Community Care. This is perfectly
reasonable after a year in which provision was far better than local
authorities had expected or planned for because of the government's success
in reducing inflation.
As in central government, local authorities will need to pursue
opportunities for savings rigorously. Local authorities have substantial
scope for improvements in efficiency, and for other economies.
Through this, and by concentrating on priority areas, they will be able to
protect key services. The government will use its powers to cap excessive
local authority budgets should that prove necessary.
My rt hon friend the secretary of state for the environment will announce
the detailed settlement proposals on Thursday.
Housing
We have managed to find savings in housing capital expenditure, in
particular that of the Housing Corporation. The government will comfortably
exceed its election manifesto commitment on the provision of new social
housing up to 1994-95.
The new plans will still allow a substantial social housing programme to
continue, assisted by the Corporation's success in levering in private
finance.
Employment
Against the background of steadily falling unemployment, it has also been
possible to make economies in the employment programme while improving the
quality of the programmes provided. A major reform of training for
unemployed adults based on payment by results will seek to ensure that more
trainees get jobs when they finish their courses.
Social Security
As a result of the announcements in last year's Budget, we are already well
down the track of a thoroughgoing reform of the Social Security benefit
system. We intend to ensure that it is better targeted on today's real
needs, and to make it simpler and less susceptible to abuse.
Legislation to reform statutory sick pay and to introduce a new incapacity
benefit was enacted last session. And this session will see the passage of
the Jobseeker's Allowance Bill, and a major Pensions Bill to modernise the
framework for both state and occupational provision.
Tomorrow, my rt hon friend the secretary for social security will announce
the details of the next phase of this programme of reform. I wish to mention
now three of the initiatives he will be announcing from which I expect
substantial public spending savings to flow.
First, Housing Benefit.
My rt hon friend will be announcing tomorrow a reform of the arrangements
through which the general taxpayer subsidises local authorities' payment of
housing benefit to the tenants of private landlords. The effect of this will
be that authorities will not be fully reimbursed if they pay housing benefit
on rents significantly above the average for the area and type of property.
Local authorities will therefore scale back the benefit they actually pay in
line with the new restriction on central government subsidy. They will
however retain discretion and have some funding to pay the full rent in
individual circumstances which they consider justify it.
The previous arrangements meant that neither the landlord nor the tenant
usually had any incentive to negotiate a lower rent because housing benefit
would usually pay the rent in full. This has had the inevitable effect of
driving up rents and public expenditure.
The Social Security budget sometimes pays the rent in full in cases where
the rent is far above the average rent for property of that type in that
neighbourhood. In future, people on housing benefit will have an incentive
to make the same judgments about what they can afford as people who have to
pay all their own rent. The system will no longer be a prey to the
unscrupulous landlord. The reform will take effect from October 1995.
Existing claimants remaining in the same property where they live now will
not be affected.
Second, my rt hon friend will be announcing tomorrow further measures to
limit support for mortgage interest through the income support system, so as
to constrain the cost to the taxpayer and minimise the distortion to work
incentives.
Most people are readily able to insure their mortgage interest payments if
they wish against periods of sickness or unemployment and many already do
so. For new mortgages taken out by people of working age after October 1995,
support will not normally be available for the first 9 months though my rt
hon friend will be consulting on the precise arrangements, including
different treatment for circumstances in which insurance might not be
available. There will also be some scaling back of support for existing
borrowers.
One reason why insurance has not become more widespread is because the
taxpayer has picked up the interest bill too readily in too many cases. This
change will give more borrowers an incentive to ensure that the mortgage
costs of people who are temporarily unable to keep up with their payments
will be met by borrowers themselves and lenders rather than by the state.
Third, my rt hon friend will also be announcing a major intensification of
the war against fraud in the social security system. We are already saving
Pounds 700m a year from existing efforts.
These further measures, which include a major project to pay benefits in
Post Offices by electronic means rather than by paper transactions, will at
a cost of Pounds 300m save another Pounds 2.5bn over the next three years.
Mr Deputy Speaker, the government know that firm control of public spending
and reduced public borrowing is essential to sustained recovery, prosperity
and jobs. We will also show that strong control of public spending overall
can be combined with improvements in key public services.
Education
The Department for Education provision will increase in real terms by almost
1 per cent next year. The government is intent on extending its significant
achievements in education but we have also managed to find savings in parts
of the education programme.
Almost one in three young people are now going to university, compared with
one in eight in 1979. That is a remarkable achievement. A period of
consolidation to secure quality and standards is now required after a period
of very rapid expansion. However the overall package of student grants and
loans will once again increase in line with inflation.
There will be continued growth in student numbers in further education,
again to record levels. The new plans also allow for further growth in the
number of grant-maintained schools and additional capital spending in
schools.
Home Office
The government continues to attach high priority to spending on law and
order. The new plans for the Home Office increase provision for the police
by 3 per cent in 1995-96. Major efficiency improvements from the Sheehy
proposals will enable more police officers to be released for frontline
duties. Reforms to be implemented next year will give chief constables much
greater freedom to manage their own resources, and to respond more
effectively to the public's priorities.
Single Regeneration Budget
As a former minister with responsibilities for the inner cities, I am
pleased to say that within the Single Regeneration Budget we have found
extra resources to support new projects in our run-down urban areas and
elsewhere. My rt hon friend the secretary of state for the environment will
be providing for more projects under the current bidding round and will be
able to conduct a second round with funding starting in 1996-97. In all,
there will be over Pounds 800m for new regeneration projects over the next
three years.
Health
This brings me finally to the government's plans for the Health Service.
With inflation so much lower than expected this year than last, it would
have been possible for us to reduce our previous plans for health and still
meet our manifesto commitment to real growth in resources each year.
Because of the high priority we give to the National Health Service, we have
decided not to do this. Instead the health service will keep the unplanned
bonus it has had this year from lower inflation.
This means that next year spending on the health service will grow by Pounds
1.3bn, 1 per cent in real terms, against the  1/2 per cent increase allowed
for in last year's Budget. That comes on top of a real increase of 3 3/4 per
cent this year.
In addition to the extra money from the taxpayer, the health service
continues to benefit from the improvements in performance flowing from the
government's reforms. Further improvements in efficiency are expected to
release at least Pounds 600m extra for patient care next year.
All these savings, including gains from rationalising management and
administration costs throughout the department and the NHS are ploughed back
into patient care. These extra funds achieved from savings come from a
variety of measures, which have only one thing in common. They have all so
far been opposed by the party opposite.
All this means that next year we shall all benefit from an even better
financed health service which has seen real increases in spending upon it by
the taxpayers in every year since the government took power. It will be
delivering even better standards of patient care, with further improvements
in patients' charter standards, and more progress in reducing waiting times.
Helping people back to work
Mr Deputy Speaker, at the beginning of this speech I said that the
combination of healthy growth and low inflation we are now seeing is
virtually unprecedented in Britain's recent past. Few doubt the strength of
the recovery.
But everyone in touch with the real world knows that the benefits of
recovery have yet to feed through to many people in this country.
Unemployment remains far too high.
Thanks to the labour market and trades union reforms of the 1980s,
unemployment did start falling at a much earlier stage of this recovery than
it had in recent previous recoveries. And, unlike other European countries,
we have resisted pressures to add social costs on top of wage costs for
employers.
Unemployment will fall further as the economy recovers. But, I have long
believed, as my panel of independent forecasters points out and as is now
widely recognised, that to demand expansion on its own is not enough to
produce a sufficient fall in unemployment. We have to do more to reduce
unemployment in ways which are consistent with sustained growth and low
inflation.
I have been making speeches and giving lectures ever since I became
chancellor on the need to ensure that we do not have recovery without jobs.
As well as giving speeches, I have already done something about it. In my
last Budget, I did three things.
I announced measures to make it harder for people who are quite capable of
working to stay on benefit without looking for a job. That is at the heart
of the Jobseeker's Allowance.
I made it easier for people with children to take jobs, by introducing a
childcare allowance into family credit.
I made it cheaper for employers to give people work, by cutting the lower
rates of employers' National Insurance contributions by a full percentage
point.
In this Budget I want to do more on all three fronts. We must get people
back into work and out of dependency. We must reduce the cost to employers
of employing people who have been out of work. I aim to ensure that we do
not have a class of people in this country who are excluded from economic
activity.
Incentives for employers
The first step is to encourage employers to look more favourably on people
who have been out of work some time.
I can announce, therefore a wholly new incentive to encourage employers to
take on more people who have been unemployed for two years or more. In
future, employers will get a full National Insurance rebate for up to a year
after taking on such a person. That will provide employers with an important
new reason to give a second chance to someone who has been unemployed for
some length of time.
This National Insurance contribution holiday will run from April 1996. More
immediately, my rt hon friend the secretary of state for employment intends
to develop new pilots under the Workstart scheme. This offers employers a
grant to recruit people who have been unemployed for over two years.
There will be around 5,000 new job opportunities. Experience with existing
pilots suggests that the scheme helps to break down the prejudice which can
blight the long-term unemployed.
I know that some employers will still worry that people who have been
unemployed a long time may have lost the habit of working. We introduced the
Work Trials scheme to counter that. It allows unemployed people to try out a
new job for three weeks, while keeping their benefit.
It costs employers nothing and it lets employers see for themselves whether
the people they take on can be relied on to hold down a steady job. The
record so far is impressive. A large number of people are kept on at the end
of the trial period. So I propose to expand the scheme to provide 150,000
job opportunities over the next three years.
In addition, I propose a further cut in the lower rates of employers'
National Insurance contributions for every employee. From next April, they
will come down by another 0.6 per cent.
This will reduce the cost to employers of providing lower-paid jobs by
another Pounds 230m in 1995-96, on top of the reduction of Pounds 940m
carried through from 1994-95. It must make sense to keep on cutting the
burden on employers who create jobs and in particular on those employers who
provide jobs for less skilled people.
Incentives to look for work
I need to match these incentives to employers with measures to ensure that
people get the rewards to which they are entitled when they move from
unemployment into work.
First, we need to ensure that people are kept in touch with the labour
market and do not stay on benefit unnecessarily. The Jobseeker's Allowance
will reinforce the link between claiming benefit and looking for work. It
will be supported by an unprecedented range of measures to help the
unemployed.
One of our existing measures, Community Action, was due to finish next year.
My rt hon friend the secretary of state for employment has decided to extend
the scheme in revised form. It will provide work experience and a route back
to jobs for around 40,000 long-term unemployed people each year.
We introduced Restart when I was minister of employment in 1986. That
required people who had been on benefit for a long time to come in for an
interview and advice. It gave positive help to many people and got many back
into work. It also revealed that some could not be bothered to come for the
interview. They lost benefit.
For young unemployed people, we have been experimenting with similar schemes
called Workwise and 1-2-1. We propose to extend them nationwide.
Helping employees with the
transition to work
But it has to be worth people's while to take jobs. I also intend to
introduce new measures to ensure that people are not deterred by short-term
financial problems when they move from unemployment into work.
Anyone moving from benefit into a low-paid job is likely to be better off,
but it may not seem like it. The first thing that happens is that income
support disappears, and with it all help with the cost of housing and their
council tax. In due course, the person in the new job may be entitled to
family credit and housing benefit. But it can be hard to find out how much
that will be, or when it will come.
And in the meantime, there are all the expenses of getting to work - buying
clothes or tools, travelling to work, and so on. Time and time again, I have
had people tell me that this is a major deterrent to work and they cannot
afford to take a job because of these gaps in the system. I have a number of
measures to help.
I propose to speed up the payment of family credit, so that anyone who takes
a job can be sure of getting the benefit to which they are entitled, and
getting it quickly.
I propose to enable people who take a job to go on getting the same help
with their rent and council tax as they had on income support, for their
first four weeks in the new job. I propose to speed up the payment of
housing benefit, so they can be quite sure where they stand at the end of
the four weeks.
I propose to exempt from tax the back to work bonus which my rt hon friend
the secretary of state for social security announced in October. That will
give people who have been unemployed, but have managed to do a bit of
part-time work, a lump sum when they leave benefit and take a job.
I also propose to expand the number of grants available to people who take
jobs, to cover their start-up costs. These are known as Jobfinder's Grants.
I propose to make available around 25,000 grants of an average of Pounds 200
for those who have been unemployed for more than two years.
Family Credit
Family Credit has been an important and effective way of encouraging lone
parents and couples with children to take employment. By providing top-up
benefit for those in work it makes it worthwhile to give up unemployment and
benefit dependency. It now helps half a million people. Last year, I
improved it by announcing the new childcare allowance which was introduced
in October.
I now intend to give low-paid and unemployed people with families an
incentive to take full-time work. The existing structure of Family Credit
strongly favours part-time over full-time working. But the majority of the
long-term unemployed are people who need to find full-time work.
I intend, therefore, to introduce a Pounds 10 a week premium for full-time
workers on Family Credit to give a new incentive to take full-time work
rather than stay on benefit. This will also give a substantial boost to the
incomes of 345,000 low-paid families with children.
But childless couples and single people account for two thirds of the
long-term unemployed. These people cannot, at present, claim Family Credit.
I would like to examine whether introducing a new in-work benefit for
childless people would be effective.
This is obviously a very big step and I have agreed with my rt hon friend
the secretary of state for social security that we should try it out on an
experimental basis. We intend to test run a new benefit through a pilot
scheme covering 20,000 people. If the pilot shows that the benefit helps to
get childless couples and single people back into work we will consider
introducing a national scheme.
I have also been impressed by an imaginative scheme pioneered by the
Training and Enterprise Council in Lincolnshire. This helps people build up
full-time work by parcelling together a number of part-time jobs. The scheme
is known as Jobmatch. I propose to extend it to help up to 3,000 people a
year.
Overall, these measures constitute a very important and carefully
thought-out package of support for unemployed people in this country. It is
no longer credible for some people to campaign for reductions in long-term
unemployment without having effective policies to deal with it.
The days of priming the pump to cut unemployment are long since past. The
government is building on reforms to remove the distortions and anomalies
from the benefit system which discourage so many unemployed people from
taking jobs.
This package aims to lift people from dependency into work and to smooth the
transition from out-of-work benefits to modest in-work benefits. These
measures will work because they are carefully put together and affordable
and because they are being introduced at a time of strong economic recovery
based on our sound economic policies so that more jobs are becoming
available.
They are a set of effective policies to tackle the big problem of structural
unemployment which faces the whole western world. I am sure they will gain
widespread support - even from those who have no practicable ideas of their
own.
Tax
Let me turn now to my proposals for taxation. Happily, in this year's
Budget, I have no need to raise revenue overall in order to secure the
public finances. The action in last year's Budget, combined with a firm
approach to public spending, will see to that. Nor - as I have already made
clear publicly - are significant tax cuts justified this year. But I do have
a number of proposals to ensure that we raise the necessary revenue in ways
which do least damage to the economy while helping vulnerable groups.
Anti-avoidance
I am delighted that there now appears to be a wide political consensus in
this House on the need to close loopholes and prevent the artificial
avoidance of taxation. There is in some quarters a tendency to exaggerate
the extent of tax avoidance by including proposals that would impose extra
taxes on legitimate business under the guise of a crackdown on so-called
loopholes.
I have said before that we are no friends to the tax avoidance industry.
Last year, I announced a number of measures to close genuine loopholes,
raising Pounds 2bn over three years.
This year, I intend to go further by tackling the artificial avoidance of
VAT on property transactions and share issues, stopping the purchase of
companies simply to make use of their surplus management expenses; and
preventing tax avoidance through operations with discounted securities.
In total, the anti-avoidance measures in this Budget will yield an
additional Pounds 1.5bn in the next three years. We will continue to close
down genuine loopholes wherever we may find them.
Vehicle Excise Duties and VAT on cars
I have some major proposals on vehicle excise duty this year. Few things
annoy honest motorists more than knowing that many people still drive
without a tax disc and waste the time of police and the authorities in
trying to track them down.
Earlier this year my rt hon friend the former secretary of state for
transport announced that the government intended to move to continuous
licensing. That means licensing on possession rather than use of a vehicle.
We will be issuing a consultation paper setting out how we intend to do
this.
The move is designed to combat evasion and help fight crime by enabling the
police accurately to check the ownership of vehicles.
I can however reassure the House that we will not seek to disadvantage those
motorists, including classic car owners, who do not pay vehicle excise duty
now because their cars are genuinely off the road.
I also intend to bring up to date the system of concessions and exemptions
from vehicle excise duty. The existing highly complex arrangements go back,
in some cases, to before the second world war and have little relevance to
the modern world.
The number of different concessionary classes will be reduced from 132 to 9,
a simplified and sensible handful. This will come into effect from 1 July
1995, and will yield about Pounds 30m a year.
But the House will be pleased to hear that special treatment will still
apply to cars for disabled drivers and emergency vehicles. Moreover, I have
also decided that accessories for the disabled fitted in company cars will
no longer be taxed as a benefit-in-kind from next April.
I propose to increase the rate of vehicle excise duty for cars - the tax
disc - by Pounds 5, to Pounds 135. But to avoid adding to industry's costs,
lorry duty rates will again remain unchanged.
I propose to introduce a significant change to one part of VAT relating to
cars. Since 1992 taxi and car hire firms, unlike most businesses, have been
able to recover the VAT on their cars.
In response to industry's concerns about market distortion, I propose to
extend this to cars bought by any business wholly for business use. This
will mainly affect leased cars, with consequential changes to their VAT
treatment when sold or leased on. The change should be revenue neutral in
the long-run, but will cost Pounds 140m in the first year.
Fuel Duties
In my last Budget, I announced that road fuel duties would increase on
average by at least 5 per cent in real terms in future Budgets. This year, I
intend to stick to that commitment.
It is an essential part of the plans that I set out last year to deliver
healthy public finances as quickly as possible and forms an important part
of the government's strategy to return carbon dioxide emissions to their
1990 level in the year 2000. From 6.00pm tonight petrol taxes will therefore
go up by 2 1/2 pence a litre for both leaded and unleaded petrol, taking
into account the effect of VAT.
In recent years there has been a small differential between the duty on
diesel and unleaded petrol. This differential is difficult to justify in
economic, health or environmental terms. I therefore propose to tax diesel
at the same rate as unleaded petrol. This means an increase of about 3 pence
a litre on diesel.
I also propose to increase the duty on gas oil and fuel oil by  1/2 pence a
litre, which will raise Pounds 70m a year, and to freeze the duty on road
fuel gases.
Tobacco
I turn next to duties on tobacco. The government is committed to reducing
smoking. I continue to believe that higher tax is the most effective and
fair means of doing so.
Last year I said that I intended to increase tobacco duties by at least 3
per cent in real terms on average a year. I intend to stick to that
commitment today.
Tax on cigarettes will therefore increase by 10 pence on a packet of 20 from
6.00pm tonight. Duty on other tobacco products will go up by a similar
proportion.
Alcohol
Mr Deputy Speaker, the Single European market has brought real benefits to
British industry, through an expanded market for business, increased
competition, reduced bureaucracy at frontiers and cheaper transport costs.
These have all greatly benefited consumers. But one of the most widely
publicised other effects of the single market has been the increase in
legitimate cross-border shopping in alcohol and tobacco, and in smuggling.
Both have inevitably meant some loss of duty to the Exchequer and pressures
on the British drinks industry. No chancellor can remain unmoved in the face
of this but neither can any chancellor simply adopt popular measures to cut
taxes on alcohol that would threaten the revenue and require taxes on other
goods to be raised.
In the longer term, the government must work with our European partners to
bring duties more in line. The forthcoming review of Europe-wide minimum
excise duties gives us the opportunity to make a start.
This year, I have once again listened to the concerns of the industries and
I propose no increase in the duties on beer, table wine and spirits. This
will mean that the proportion of the cost of an alcoholic drink represented
by tax in this country will continue to fall. Ten years ago 37 per cent of
the price of a pint of beer was tax. Today it is only 30 per cent.
Betting and gaming duties
The government also intends to modernise and deregulate betting and gaming.
This process is, in my opinion, welcome and much overdue. The coverage of
taxation must also keep up-to-date with the modern world. I therefore
propose to widen the coverage of gaming machine licence duty to cover
amusement machines, such as arcade video games.
It is anomalous that we should tax amusement machines with prizes, but not
those without. I am sure this measure will be welcomed by parents although
maybe not by children.
Gaming machine licence duty has only been increased once since 1987. I
propose to restore its real value to the 1987 level and to allow payment by
instalments.
These measures will raise around Pounds 60m in a full year.
In 1991 my rt hon friend the member for Kingston upon Thames announced a
reduction in pools' betting duty of 2 1/2 per cent. Since then, this has
helped to fund the Foundation for Sport and the Arts. My rt hon friend the
secretary of state for National Heritage and I have now reviewed this
reduction.
We have agreed that it should continue for a further five years provided
that the pools companies also continue to fund sport and the arts at their
present level. The Foundation continues to support a number of worthwhile
projects to encourage participation in sport and the arts. I am delighted
that the pools companies have generously reaffirmed their commitment.
Business taxes
Mr Deputy Speaker, a strong and thriving business community is the only way
to ensure a strong and thriving economy. This government has a record of
achievement in developing the tax system in ways which improve
competitiveness, sharpen incentives, simplify administration and encourage
the small and medium-sized businesses which are so important to the future
development of the economy.
I would like to announce a package of measures today which will add further
to the strength of British industry. Decisions on many of the measures I
shall be announcing today have been informed by the Industrial Finance
Initiative undertaken last year by my hon friend the minister of state and
my rt hon friend the financial secretary and his predecessor.
Corporation tax and
capital allowances
First, I would like to say a few words about corporation tax and capital
allowances.
We have one of the lowest corporation tax rates in the industrialised world.
Low tax rates are good for incentives. They mean businesses can keep more of
their profits to use as they want.
Since 1984 we have cut the main corporation tax rate from 52 per cent to 33
per cent while scaling back capital allowances to a level broadly matching
commercial depreciation.
I have considered again all the calls for increased allowances to encourage
investment. They have a simplistic appeal.
But I remain firmly of the opinion that increasing capital allowances would
distort investment decisions and not encourage the high quality investment
needed to improve economic performance. A narrower tax base would jeopardise
our ability to maintain the low tax rates which have helped to transform
British industry over the last decade.
The change from high capital allowances to low rates of corporation tax has
been very successful. I propose to maintain that emphasis on low rates for
the successful rather than high allowances for all in our system of business
taxes. I also have no changes to announce on the rate of advance corporation
tax or the value of the tax credit on dividends.
Business rates
I would now like to deal with business rates. We are about to implement the
first five-yearly review of valuations of properties for rating purposes.
Without these five-yearly reviews the rate base would become hopelessly out
of date. The property market has changed a lot over the past five years with
wide regional variations.
As a result of the review, many properties in the south of England will
begin to see reductions in their rates bills. Some businesses in the
Midlands, the North, Scotland and Wales will benefit as well but others will
discover that up-to-date valuations will raise their liability.
I am glad to say that I will be able to continue to find resources to help
businesses through this new transition period in the same way that we have
been helping business through the transition from the last revaluation. My
rt hon friend the environment secretary and my rt hon friends the
secretaries of state for Scotland and Wales will announce details of the
scheme later today.
But I can tell the House now that increases in bills will be limited to 10
per cent in any one year for large properties, once adjusted for inflation.
Small business properties account for three quarters of those receiving
protection.
We have decided to limit real increases for such properties to 7 1/2 per
cent. This protection will in part be financed by limiting real reductions
in rates bills for large properties to 5 per cent and for small properties
to 10 per cent.
But the revenue from limiting gains is not enough to help those businesses
who happen to find themselves worse off as a result of more up-to-date
valuations. I have therefore decided to provide assistance of Pounds 605m
next year to finance the transitional relief. This is similar to the amount
we are spending on the former transitional relief scheme this year.
ECGD
I laid stress at the beginning of this speech on our improved export
performance. We need to build on this and not become complacent. Strong
export growth will be essential if healthy recovery is to be sustained.
My rt hon friend the president of the board of trade and I have taken a
closer look at the services provided by the Export Credit Guarantee
Department. We have agreed that a reduction in premiums of around 10 per
cent on average is possible while still protecting taxpayers' interests.
This will improve our competitiveness, building on the premium reductions on
the past two years.
Furthermore, we have agreed to increase the amount of ECGD cover available
to many important developing markets by Pounds 300m for 1997-98. These
measures will provide an added incentive for British exporters to play an
even greater role in the most successful, and rapidly growing economies in
the world.
Landfill Tax
As I said earlier, one of my main objectives for the tax system is that it
should raise revenue in ways which do the least possible damage to the
economy. In some cases, taxes actually do some good, by helping markets work
better and by discouraging harmful or wasteful activities.
Taxes can play an important role in protecting the environment. One major
problem is the disposal of waste. I would like to make an announcement today
to help tackle this problem.
My rt hon friend the secretary of state for the environment and I will issue
shortly a consultation paper setting out details of a new tax to be
collected by Customs &amp; Excise on waste disposed in landfill. We propose that
a new landfill tax should come into effect in 1996. It should raise several
hundred million pounds a year.
But I am determined not to impose additional costs on business overall. I
shall therefore be looking at ways to offset the impact of the new tax by
making further compensatory reductions in the level of employer national
insurance contributions - when the new tax is introduced. In brief, I want
to raise tax on polluters to make further cuts in the tax on jobs.
Small Businesses
Mr Deputy Speaker, I have more measures to help small businesses in
particular. The need to focus on smaller firms with growth potential has
been an important theme of the Industrial Finance Initiative. It is
certainly essential that we have a healthy and vigorous small firms sector
for the future economic well-being of the country and to achieve higher
levels of employment.
One important way in which we can help small businesses is by encouraging
the venture capital industry. A flourishing venture capital industry plays a
key role in promoting job creation, innovation and growth. The UK venture
capital industry has been growing in recent years and I am determined that
this growth should continue.
In my Budget last year I announced the introduction of the Enterprise
Investment scheme, consultation on a new Venture Capital Trust scheme and an
extension of capital gains tax reinvestment relief.
All three of these measures were aimed at encouraging equity investment in
small companies. I want to build on them today.
Enterprise Investment Scheme
The new Enterprise Investment Scheme is now in place offering tax relief for
investment in unquoted trading companies. Over 40 per cent of the schemes
set up so far involve so-called business angels who want to invest their
expertise, as well as their money, in a business.
This is a good start but the scheme has some complex rules and I have
decided to simplify them. I am also extending Capital Gains Tax reinvestment
relief to the Enterprise Investment Scheme which should increase greatly its
attractiveness.
Venture Capital Trusts
I have consulted widely on Venture Capital Trusts and the response has been
very positive. I have accepted suggestions for change on some details and I
propose to implement the scheme in full.
And I want to go further by making investment in risk capital even more
attractive than I originally proposed. Investment up to Pounds 100,000 a
year in new shares in a Venture Capital Trust will offer 20 per cent
up-front income tax relief and capital gains tax reinvestment relief, in
addition to tax-free dividends and capital gains. I believe that Venture
Capital Trusts will make a successful contribution to filling a gap in our
enterprise economy, by encouraging more people to become venture
capitalists.
The cost of the new scheme is expected to be Pounds 150m next year, rising
to Pounds 290m in 1996-97. This will, of course, depend on the take-up. But
it could mean that funds of Pounds 2.5bn might be raised over the next three
years, providing much more investment where it is most needed.
My proposals go significantly beyond what I first set out 12 months ago.
They now put in place an effective and imaginative set of measures aimed at
generating equity investment in dynamic, innovative growing businesses.
They should be widely welcomed by everyone who understands how a modern
free-market economy works and how new jobs are created. Unlike some hon
members, I do not describe tax reliefs of this kind to stimulate investment
in business and enterprise as tax loopholes.
Insolvency reform
During the recent recession, businesses, particularly small businesses, were
too often being closed down by their creditors and jobs lost before rescue
options had been properly explored.
Following consultation, my rt hon friend the president of the board of trade
will shortly issue a paper setting out the government's main conclusions on
company rescue procedures in future.
To give management more time to reorder their affairs, we will introduce a
28-day moratorium binding upon all parties. This will give companies a
breathing space to assess rescue prospects and come to an arrangement with
creditors.
We are also consulting further on a mechanism to help substitute equity for
debt of firms in administration or receivership.
These measures will contribute further to the creation of a rescue culture,
discouraging wasteful liquidation of sound businesses.
Loan guarantee scheme
The impact of the 1993 changes to the Loan Guarantee Scheme has been
encouraging but its rules have quite rightly been criticised as too complex.
Together with my rt hon friend, the president of the board of trade, I
intend to review these rules with a view to make the scheme simpler and more
attractive.
Lifting burdens on business
Mr Deputy Speaker, the tax system not only imposes a financial burden on
business, but a regulatory burden and an overhead cost as well. I want to
reduce those burdens.
Simply running PAYE and NICs is difficult for many small businesses. From
next April, I propose to increase by more than 30 per cent the threshold for
businesses to make quarterly rather than monthly payments to the Inland
Revenue.
This will benefit around 100,000 employers at a one-off cost of Pounds 75m.
Nearly two thirds of all employers in the country will now be able to make
quarterly payments.
I also propose to consult on a move to annual VAT payments for small
traders, and simplification of VAT accounting.
Furthermore, I intend to improve the administration of the tax system by
encouraging closer working between the two revenue departments, Inland
Revenue and Customs &amp; Excise, as well as closer co-operation between the
Inland Revenue and the Contributions Agency. This will be particularly
directed at improving the service offered to business.
I would also like to make some progress towards closer alignment of tax and
National Insurance. From next April clearances given by the Inland Revenue
concerning non-taxable expenses will also count for National Insurance
purposes. My rt hon friend the secretary of state for social security will
give details of this and other measures in his statement tomorrow.
I also intend to raise the registration threshold for VAT to Pounds 46,000
tomorrow in line with inflation. This will help a number of the smallest
businesses.
Finally, I turn to self-assessment. I am publishing today for consultation
some details of the remaining legislation for self-assessment.
The Inland Revenue has been consulting widely on the changes. The response
has been positive and my rt hon friend the financial secretary and I intend
to go ahead with our proposals which will aim to keep any burden placed on
employers as low as possible.
Taken together this latest package of tax reliefs and deregulatory measures
provide a substantial package of support for the business community. They
aim to strengthen British businesses by easing cashflow problems, cutting
back red tape and providing targeted help for small businesses. They should
maintain our improved business performance, help to sustain the recovery and
help to create more jobs.
Savings
Mr Deputy Speaker, higher savings also have an important role to play in
helping sustain growth, by providing additional resources for investment. I
have already announced measures to encourage savings into unquoted
companies. There are two further measures I would like to announce today.
Peps and corporate bonds
Personal Equity Plans have been very successful since their introduction in
1986. Over Pounds 15bn has been invested in over 4m plans to date. They have
widened share ownership and played an important role in providing finance to
industry. I want to take that success further and in particular to widen the
type of finance available to industry through Peps.
I propose that, from next year, people will be able to invest through Peps
in a range of corporate bonds, convertibles and preference shares, and not
simply equities. This change is expected to cost Pounds 10m in 1995-96
rising to Pounds 40m in 1997-98.
Tessas
When my rt hon friend the prime minister introduced tax exempt special
savings accounts, or Tessas, it was understood that tax-free interest would
be allowed to build up over a five-year period. For some of those accounts,
the five-year period will soon be coming to an end.
I have had to consider whether this tax exemption for savings should be
extended. Tessas have been very popular, allowing many people to catch the
savings habit and build a nest-egg for their future. Over 4m people have
invested over Pounds 20bn since they were first introduced.
Given their success and popularity, I have decided that all or part of the
capital accumulated in a Tessa at maturity can be reinvested straight away
in a new Tessa. Anyone who wants to continue to save tax free will therefore
be able to do so up to an overall limit of Pounds 9,000. This measure will
cost Pounds 150m in 1996-97.
Income tax
Finally, I turn to income tax.
The lower, basic and higher rates of income tax will remain unchanged in
1995-96. However we can at last begin to benefit from our steady return to
healthy public finances. This means that I can fully index the personal
allowance, the threshold for higher rate tax, and the income limit for the
age-related allowances.
I have been able to provide some additional help in two important areas.
First, I want to do a little bit more for pensioners. I propose to increase
the age-related personal allowance by more than indexation. The allowances
for everyone aged 65 and over will be increased by Pounds 430. Nearly 3m
pensioners will gain from this, at a cost of Pounds 200m in a full year.
Second, I propose to widen the 20p band to Pounds 3,200. This increase is
twice the amount necessary for indexation. One in five of all taxpayers will
now only pay tax at the lowest rate.
The tax measures that I am announcing in this Budget reduce revenue by
Pounds 1bn in 1995-96 because I have had to provide Pounds 605m for the
transitional relief for business rate payers. I have said many times that I
would like to go further and that I will in due course go further. We on
this side of the House are tax-cutters by instinct. But I have also made
clear over and over again that tax cuts can only come when we can afford
them and when it is in the interests of our industrial economy that we
should make them.
That means two things. First, we have to improve further our long-term
economic performance. That is why in my Budget today I have introduced yet
again numerous measures designed to strengthen the economy and make sure
that recovery is sustained. The second requirement is firm control of public
spending.
Public Spending Aggregates
All my efforts to help businesses and help the unemployed would be to no
avail if I did not keep a firm grip on public spending.
I have already dealt with spending by each department. But I have not
described what will happen to spending overall as a result of our decisions.
Last year's spending round delivered substantial cuts in overall public
spending. This year's has not been easy because of that.
Public spending control is not only about controlling costs. It is about
choice of priorities. That is the language of politics.
Within this year's settlement, my rt hon friend the chief secretary and I
have succeeded in producing real increases in resources for priority
programmes such as health and the police. We have also managed to protect
the delivery of public services generally by focusing our search for savings
on administrative costs.
We have avoided our tight settlement last year being turned into a wasteful
one by ensuring that success in lowering inflation does not simply increase
the volume of spending on programmes.
I am glad to tell the House that this approach has allowed us to make
overall savings which are even greater than those achieved last year.
Last year, we managed to reduce the control total by Pounds 8bn This year we
have done a bit better. Not 10, not 15, not 20, but another Pounds 24bn off
the control total over the next three years on top of last year's
reductions.
Last year we reduced public spending plans so as to reduce general
government expenditure by Pounds 15bn over a three-year period. This year,
on top of last year's reductions, we will reduce general government
expenditure by Pounds 28bn That is a total reduction over the four years
covered by my two Budgets, of Pounds 43bn.
This year, on top of last year's reductions, we will reduce general
government expenditure by Pounds 28bn That is a total reduction over the
four years covered by my two Budgets of Pounds 43bn.
These savings have allowed me to reduce my projection for the Public Sector
Borrowing Requirement. Taking into account the tax and public spending
measures, I now expect to be able to reduce borrowing from Pounds 30bn to
Pounds 21.5bn in 1995-96, from Pounds 21bn to Pounds 13bn in 1996-97, and
from Pounds 12bn to Pounds 5bn the year after that. This reduced borrowing
should provide an added stimulus to business confidence and strengthen the
recovery further.
Conclusion
This Budget keeps Britain firmly on track for growth that can last. It will
strengthen British businesses.
It will create more jobs. And it will lay the foundations for sustained
rises in prosperity.
I commend it to the House.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Comment): Give and take - John Plender looks in
vain for fiscal logic and finds politics instead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER

<TEXT>
This was clearly in-tended to be a pro-business Budget. But is that what
Kenneth Clarke actually delivered? The answer would be yes, if fiscal
handouts were all that mattered: somewhat bizarrely, the biggest single item
of tax relief in the whole package was the Pounds 605m of transitional
relief to cope with the impact of the first five-yearly review of valuations
for business rates. Yet while such largesse will no doubt be welcomed by the
business community, there remains a problem. As with Mr Clarke's first
Budget, it is remarkably difficult to find any coherent pattern in the
welter of business taxation measures that the chancellor expects to promote
a strong and thriving economy.
Mr Clarke's rhetoric puts all the emphasis on manufacturing and small
business. Many of the Budget measures do indeed point in their direction.
Exporters can expect a 10 per cent reduction in premiums from the Export
Credits Guarantee Department, along with increased cover for some developing
markets. The growth of the venture capital sector will be enhanced by
changes to the enterprise investment scheme introduced last year.
Fine tuning of the loan guarantee scheme and changes in insolvency
legislation, to be undertaken jointly with the Department of Trade and
Industry, are worthwhile, if worthy, structural changes. The reduction in
the administrative burden in relation to VAT and PAYE will, meantime, be
widely welcomed in the small business community.
The broad thrust of Mr Clarke's rhetoric is further underlined by the
contrast between what he is prepared to do for small business and what he is
happy to take from the upper echelons of the financial services sector.
Private investors in Venture Capital Trusts will benefit from income tax
relief at 20 per cent, capital gains tax reinvestment relief on new shares
of up to Pounds 100,000 a year, and exemption from tax for all income and
gains on the investments concerned. This is an undeniably generous break for
investment in unquoted companies.
Sophisticated investors in deep discount bonds and index-related securities
are, on the other hand, singled out for anti-avoidance measures. Tough, in
fact, on City folk. This is a far cry from the Thatcher era, when Mr
Clarke's predecessors rejoiced in the job-creating potential of a financial
services sector that today accounts for 18 per cent of GDP.
Yet at second glance Mr Clarke's stated bias is less pronounced than it
appears. The beer, wine and spirits industry, hardly at the small end of the
enterprise spectrum and well looked after over the years by Tory
chancellors, has escaped any increase in duty. Note, too, that reliefs from
capital gains on investment in unquoted companies are now to be extended to
another heavily cosseted group, the farmers. Also to property investors and
developers - though the property industry will complain it is also the
victim of anti-avoidance measures.
On the central issues of corporation tax Mr Clarke's instincts appear to be
fairly consistent. He has once again resisted the demands of industrialists
for an increase in the capital allowances for investment in plant and
machinery. The industrialists' argument was that an increase in the present
25 per cent allowance would encourage investment by lowering corporation tax
bills and reducing the cost of capital. Yet there is academic evidence to
support Mr Clarke's judgment, which suggests that the impact of such
tinkering would be modest. The chancellor has also decided against following
his predecessor in reducing the rate of advance corporation tax and the
associated tax credit - a pro-business measure in that companies will not
find themselves confronting higher funding costs for pension schemes because
of a reduction in pension fund dividend income.
This brings us to the central question. The chancellor boasted of the
government's record in improving competitiveness and sharpening incentives
through the development of the tax system. Yet the chief way of fulfilling
those objectives, apart from establishing a sound macro-economic policy
stance, is to ensure the overall taxation of savings and investment offers
investors and businessmen the right sticks and carrots. This the present
system signally fails to do.
The corporation tax system is not neutral as between debt financed and
equity financed investment. Investors pay corporation tax on some profits,
but not on others; they sometimes pay income tax on dividends, sometimes
not. In effect, the imputation system of tax introduced in 1973 encourages
high dividend distributions in a world where tax exempt investors like
pension funds constitute the majority of equity shareholders. There is also
a growing debate as to the potential constraints that this implies for
investment in plant and machinery given the increasing evidence that
internal finance is not a perfect substitute for external finance for
corporate investment.
The related policy issues, which were to be explored by Mr Stephen Dorrell
before his move from the Treasury to the heritage ministry, were driven off
the chancellor's agenda by the intervention of Lord Hanson, who argued that
a Tory government was being seduced by Labour-style policies.
Here, then, is the most important dog that failed to bark in the Budget
speech. All we have, instead, is a few marginal changes to Peps, Tessas and
personal pension arrangements on the savings front, and the basic assertion
that low corporation tax rates for the successful are better than high
capital allowances for all.
That is not to say that the Budget is without logic. Simply that the logic
is political rather than fiscal. Mr Clarke has no aspiration towards the
wider reforms that would be needed to deliver the robust business enterprise
he claims to want.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Comment): Just short of paradise - The financial
markets hoped for even more
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For all his repeated claims that his various pint-sized proposals were
'important' and 'substantial' Kenneth Clarke's second Budget lived fully up
to its billing as the boring one in between last year's tough book-balancer
and next year's would-be vote-grabber.
The only really interesting aspect, perhaps, will be whether the harshest of
the pre-ordained tax increases - notably the second dollop of value added
tax on domestic fuel - will actually get through a troublesome House of
Commons. As a shrewd politician Mr Clarke took a good deal of trouble to
soothe Tory MPs' consciences by tossing extra pensioner handouts.
The dullness will not be regretted by the financial markets, however. They
were relying on the government not to do anything rash, and it has not,
although the officially forecast numbers for spending and borrowing over the
next two years are not quite up to the best expectations.
For example, despite the accelerating economic boom the Treasury has only
revised its estimate of the current year's public sector borrowing
requirement down from the Pounds 36.1bn indicated in June to Pounds 34.5bn,
when some City scribblers have had their eyes on a PSBR near Pounds 30bn.
However, the vision of a PSBR as low as Pounds 5bn by 1997-98 is being
dangled before a tantalised gilt-edged market. That prospective near-balance
could provide the framework for a final pre-election Budget in November
1996, always supposing that the beleaguered government can last that long.
The risk for the bond market is that the appeal of this return to financial
prudence will be lost in another boom-and-bust exercise, as taxes are cut
merrily in the next two Budgets and the economy is allowed to overheat. The
Treasury has growth slowing to 3 1/4 per cent next year - highly convenient,
but several City economists have recently been raising their growth
projections.
Political uncertainties are important for gilts, but no more so than for
bond markets in other countries such as France or the US, let alone Italy.
As the figures stand, UK government bonds are looking better-placed than
those of most other countries. Only the UK's inflationary history is
preventing this from being demonstrated in yields.
One way for the government to cash in on the improved outlook and reduce its
borrowing costs would be for the Bank of England to find ways of making the
gilt-edged market more user-friendly for foreigners. The 'not invented here'
approach has long dominated the stuffy UK government bond market. Auctions
have been introduced; but the long list of stocks is regarded as confusing,
liquidity is sometimes inadequate because of the absence of an open sale and
repurchase ('repo') market, and there are difficulties over quixotic
withholding taxes applying to some issues and some foreign investors.
It is evident from the Bank of England's consultative paper that the
authorities are desperate to reconcile the possibly irreconcileable. On the
one hand, a repo market would attract speculative traders, increasing
liquidity but arguably not raising volatility. Yet it is 'of great
importance that gilt repo activity should take place within a
properly-regulated framework'.
Improving the mechanics of the market might help to reduce borrowing costs.
The chancellor made the observation that each basis point of yield saved -
each hundredth of a percentage point - would result in an economy worth
Pounds 25m a year. The question is whether those savings might have to be
paid for in some other way. It is difficult to imagine that an effective
repo market could be introduced without allowing gross dividends to be paid
on all issues. An attempt to restrict this tax exemption to foreigners only
would create discontinuities and threaten, for instance, to encourage a huge
trade in buying and selling coupons.
If the gilt-edged market is to be truly internationalised it will have to be
on the basis of interest paid gross. That would no doubt involve some loss
of domestic tax revenue, through deferment and, worse, evasion, creating a
big loophole to offset the closing of some tiny ones in the Budget. The tax
issue will be covered in a forthcoming Inland Revenue paper, the
separateness of which suggests that the authorities have not yet grasped the
point.
Tax inconsistencies are apparent on the domestic scene, too. For some reason
the Inland Revenue is opening up tax-exempt personal equity plans to
corporate bonds but not, it seems, to gilts. It is not clear why the
government should be discriminating against its own paper.
Is it not, anyway, a bit late to be worrying about foreign investment in
gilts? True, it may have been disappointing for the Bank of England to see
foreigners turn net sellers this year, leading to some sticky moments in the
auctions.
But net gilt issuance, some Pounds 48bn in 1993-94, is tumbling, and may be
less than Pounds 20bn next year. With the balance of payments approaching
actual balance there is no underlying need for external finance. Moreover UK
pension funds are likely to become much more active buyers of gilts because
of the introduction of a minimum solvency standard under the forthcoming
Pensions Bill. By 1997-98, if you believe the numbers, they will only be
able to buy gilts through the secondary market, so that foreigners will be
selling, while yield spreads will be shrinking and reversing.
Some might say that priority should have been given to the requirements of
UK pension funds. The Goode Committee on pension law reform asked for
special securities to match pension fund liabilities. But the authorities
are neglecting their biggest potential domestic long-term investors in
favour of solicitation of peripatetic foreigners.
Can you believe it all? The government is promising a further squeeze on
public sector pay and employment levels, which may be difficult to deliver.
It seems to have slipped at the first hurdle of PSBR expectations for
1994-95. We are entering the politically more dangerous phase of this
parliament. But we should put it all into perspective. To an Italian or
Swedish investor the UK might look like an unattainable financial paradise.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Comment): A shield to fend off the knives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the real world it would be classed as a sound Budget with exciting
political potential. It does nobody any harm, and it might do some important
groups of voters, including pensioners and the long-term unemployed, a
modicum of good.
It contains no controversial new decisions, yet it shows courage by
confirming an important old one - to increase VAT on domestic fuel by the
full 17.5 per cent. Best of all, it puts the chancellor in a position to
announce cuts in personal taxation next November, or the one after that, or
indeed in both years; anyhow in time for the next election. Preparations for
the mother of all bribes are well in hand.
Unfortunately for the government its supporters have long since floated off
the world as we know it. We saw them, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, in battle on
Monday afternoon. They were squabbling about an extra Pounds 75m
contribution to the European Union's budget. Their unearthly shrieking
shattered the party.
The chancellor snarled over his shoulder at his opponents, all at that time
recognised by the whips as Conservatives. He stood like Darth Vader,
battling for the galaxy. Improbable life-forms zoomed around his head. About
seven or eight of them were banished by the Tory whips. The question was not
whether the Conservatives would win again in 1996 or 1997, but whether they
could remain in office that long.
Yesterday we saw a quite different chancellor. Back in humanoid form Mr
Clarke droned for Britain, solid, dependable, wise, Captain Kirk. He had
nothing to say, but he said it very well. His perception, that the
government is in a deep hole, is matched by his strategy, which is that the
only route to salvation is a period of good, solid, uneventful
administration. So he began his speech by describing the Conservative
Wirtschaftswunder.
Familiar it may be, but it still sounds miraculous. The economy is growing
at 4 per cent a year, fastest in Europe. Registered unemployment is falling;
the number of people in jobs is rising. Exports are up; balance of payments
trends are positive; inflation is lower than it has been within the living
memory of two-thirds of the population. Stick with the government for just a
few more years and the budget will be back in balance, the huge borrowing
requirement wiped out.
In the real world any chancellor describing such a golden set of numbers
would simper as he did it. The benches behind him would cheer, wave their
order papers, or at least rumble 'hear hear'. Even yesterday afternoon, the
House of Commons could not be described as the real world.
Mr Clarke exchanged defensive and unscripted banter with the benches
opposite, while behind him his colleagues sat stony faced. As time went by,
some of them fell into the arms of Morpheus. They should have sat up and
paid attention. The other side did. Both the Labour and Liberal benches were
bemused, as they saw one stratagem of theirs after another emerge from the
chancellor's box, now to be used as a shield to protect the government and
the prime minister from the knives aimed at their backs. It is an intricate
device. Some of its components have been borrowed from the opposition.
What Mr Clarke called a 'set of effective policies to tackle the big problem
of structural unemployment which faces the whole western world' sounded not
unlike the welfare-to-work proposals borrowed by Labour's advisers from
President Bill Clinton's coterie. The details may not match, but the broad
methodology is similar: adjust social security where it acts as a
disincentive to take a job and subsidise employment where that might help.
Another notion - for a landfill tax - elicited smiles of recognition from
the Liberals. The patent for Mr Clarke's schemes to attract private-sector
capital in support of public ventures was claimed, vociferously, by Mr John
Prescott. Yesterday's closure of 'tax loopholes' was recognisably lifted
from Labour. None of this is quite fair: the government, through the
chancellor, has put in a lot of work in these areas. Some of Mr Peter
Lilley's ideas on social payments contain elements of originality. But the
same can be said of some Labour and Liberal proposals.
Even so, Mr Clarke is a star, and not only by the dismal standards of those
around him. His speech yesterday was dull and long, yet, as during Monday
afternoon's scrap, his delivery showed that he is afraid of no one, that his
self-confidence knows no bounds. The contrast with the demeanour of the
prime minister, who sat slumped beside him, was painful to behold.
The chancellor's career has not been without blemish. Some say he left a
trail of destruction or unfinished business at the departments he ran, not
least at health and the Home Office. It may be that he reached the Treasury
at just the right time, that he is supremely fortunate.
Those of us who would not hesitate to castigate him had he suffered bad luck
must give him credit for his handling of the blessings of fate. He has stuck
to the prime minister's counter-inflation policy, reinforcing it by allying
himself with the Bank of England. He has resisted calls to reduce taxes as
if there was to be an election tomorrow, knowing well enough that this is a
mid-term, not end-of-term, financial statement. At a time when the
government seems to wake up every morning not knowing whether it will live
out the day, he has persisted in playing it long.
We may therefore look with understanding upon his sprinkling of coins in the
direction of this or that clutch of voters. His programmes to promote
employment seem to come from the heart; in a hard-nosed world he remains a
one-nation Tory. Savers who harbour Tessas and Peps in their portfolios may
thank him for the extension of these tax-free opportunities. Cutting overall
expenditure while allowing real-terms increases for health, education and
the police is political common sense, an answer to some of the points made
by the Conservative party's Mr John Maples in his celebrated, leaked
memorandum.
To recall Mr Maples and his document is to fall back into the irrational
universe, the one that now surrounds the administration. Last week was one
the Conservatives will want to forget; there is no need to rehearse all its
events now. Monday's parliamentary mess was a spillover. We need not
describe each humiliation. The government is visibly falling to pieces,
partly over its divided attitude to the EU, and partly as a result of its
small majority. The prime minister cannot be confident that there will be no
challenge to his leadership.
If this was a normal government, operating in the mode usually adopted in
mid-term, we could be certain that Mr Clarke's Budget was a likely winner.
In these surreal times, that may be too much to ask.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Comment): Chancellor points in right direction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The move to a unified Budget in late autumn has already had one advantage. A
large part of the speech dealt with public spending. In almost every other
country national budgets are concerned mainly with spending and how it will
be financed; now the UK has at long last moved into line.
The predictability of this year's Budget measures is all to the good.
Treasury officials have been working for decades to put the public finances
on a medium-term basis. What came to their aid was the political shock of
the high 1993-94 public sector borrowing requirement (originally
overestimated at Pounds 50bn) plus the desire to correct gradually until
recovery from recession was secure.
Thus it is not surprising that the main headline tax measures are simply a
confirmation of tax increases to which the government committed itself in
the two Budgets of 1993. But because of faster-than-expected economic
recovery and lower-than-expected inflation, the public finances are coming
under control more quickly.
There are several innovations in this year's Financial Statement. As
reformers have long advocated, the Treasury now separates public sector
current from capital spending in its very first summary table, and draws up
a 'current balance'. In fact, such reform has become inevitable as the
'private finance initiative' makes the total of public sector net capital
spending a somewhat misleading indicator. For much of what would have been
called public capital spending is now disguised as private sector
investment.
The net result is that the Maastricht guideline of public sector borrowing
not exceeding 3 per cent of GDP is expected to be reached next year. The
Treasury's projections now show the current deficit disappearing around
about 1997-98. The PSBR is due to disappear in 1998-99.
The financial markets were initially disappointed that the Treasury
maintained a cautious estimate for the PSBR in the current financial year.
The big change is its reduction by Pounds 8bn, compared with the projection
in the last Budget Red Book, for both 1995-96 and 1996-97. Much the greatest
reduction has been in public spending in cash terms, due to lower inflation,
which - as widely predicted - the chancellor has allowed to be reflected in
an improvement in the public sector balance rather than an equivalent
increase in real programmes. There are, however, some modest economies,
especially from 1996 - reflecting the private finance initiative, housing
benefit reform and lower spending on roads.
Much the most interesting aspect of this Budget is, however, the widely
foreshadowed measures to improve incentives both for potential workers to
take low-paid jobs and for employers to offer them. Of course, this is
second best to high-skilled workers taking better-paid jobs. But in a
non-ideal world low pay is very much better than no pay. The chancellor has
gone rather further than I expected he would, given the departmental caution
of both the Treasury and the Department of Social Security.
The thrust towards shifting benefit from the dole to top-up payments for
those re-entering employment or working in low-paid jobs is most welcome.
The chief measures here are the increase in family credit for those in
full-time work, and the accelerated payment of housing benefit and family
credit to those moving off the dole.
We also at last have a pilot scheme to extend family credit to people
without children, who make up about two-thirds of the long-term unemployed.
The sooner it moves to a regular across-the-country basis, the better. The
0.6 percentage point reduction in employer National Insurance Contributions
for the low paid is welcome, as is the one-year National Insurance holiday
for taking on the long-term unemployed.
It is unfortunate, however, that the long-term unemployed are defined as
people who have been without a job for more than two years. In most studies
of the question, one year, or even less, is the threshold. But if these
measures work, they can be extended further by this or another government.
The Treasury has also been very cautious about the likely offsets from lower
dole payments and higher tax receipts resulting from these measures. If this
caution is shown to be excessive, the way will be open for further
extensions.
Two other detailed measures caught my eye. One was the changes to be
announced by the Department of Trade and Industry to discourage creditors
from putting companies into unnecessary liquidation. This plus the late
payment of bills is probably the greatest curse of the small business
sector. I was also attracted by the idea of a tax on landfilled waste, the
proceeds of which would be returned to industry in the form of lower
national insurance contributions. The idea of putting more tax on
environmental degradation and reducing the tax on labour is a sensible
switch and an intelligent use of the price mechanism.
There were no innovations in monetary or macro-economic policy. The most
interesting aspect is that Kenneth Clarke reaffirmed Norman Lamont's
commitment to securing inflation within the lower half of the 1 to 4 per
cent per annum target range. The Treasury's projections do indeed show most
underlying measures of inflation, such as the RPI excluding mortgage
interest, producer prices and the GDP deflator, within a 2 to 2 1/2 per cent
tunnel, despite a modest upward blip next year due to the rebuilding of
margins and higher commodity prices. If these projections are to remain
credible, interest rates will have to rise again soon.
As might have been expected, the Treasury has been quite cautious about
upgrading its overall growth forecast. Non-oil GDP is estimated to rise by 3
1/2 per cent in 1994, which - although substantially up on previous official
forecasts - is still likely to be an underestimate. From 1995 onwards, the
difference between GDP and non-North Sea GDP thankfully disappears. Both are
set to grow at 3 1/4 per cent, which again looks cautious. For later in the
decade the Treasury puts average annual growth at 2 3/4 per cent, which is
still regarded as above the underlying growth trend and sufficient to reduce
unemployment and take up slack.
The longer-term projection is for the growth of nominal GDP of slightly
under 5 per cent per annum, of which 2 per cent would be the irreducible
inflation minimum. If, however, recent supply side movements continue, and
the measures to encourage employment really work, it might be possible to
envisage a somewhat faster rate of both nominal and real growth without
re-igniting inflation.
But the credibility test will come very much earlier in making sure that
demand does not grow at excessive speed in the months ahead. There is here
an uncanny similarity with the US, where the Federal Reserve vice-chairman,
Alan Blinder (a Clinton appointee and hardly a fanatical hard-money man),
has just warned about the speed of the upturn.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Comment): Enjoying the fruits of recovery -
Leading Article
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
1994 will go down as a glorious year for the British economy. It will not go
down as the year of an equally brilliant Budget. But the combination of
unexpectedly high growth with unexpectedly low inflation has given the
chancellor of the exchequer a wonderful story to tell. It has also allowed
him to relax public spending this year without being too obvious about it.
Otherwise, the budget is noteworthy for a number of politically astute
gestures, particularly on employment and social security, a concern with
business, especially small business, an absence of overarching ideas for
fiscal reform, and determination to control the running costs of the public
sector.
What has been left until later is the tax cuts that the prospects for public
finance appear to permit and politics will surely demand. It is, of course,
absurd to raise taxes by close to Pounds 7bn in a few months only to lower
them a year or two later. But politics is another matter.
Inevitably, Mr Clarke chose to keep the bigger presents locked in his
treasure chest until later. Instead, he offered a number of relatively
modest fiscal changes - many of them desirable. But he has also tolerated a
substantial real increase in public spending this financial year, by
comparison with what had been expected, so taking advantage of the lower
than expected inflation.
The plan had been for a real reduction in general government spending of 0.1
per cent in 1994-95. The reality is now expected to be an increase of 2.3
per cent. Similarly, for the 'control total' (which excludes cyclical public
spending), the plan had been for a real reduction of 1.3 per cent, while the
reality is to be an increase of 1.4 per cent. How plausible then is the
stringency planned for 1995-96 to 1997-98, when there is expected to be
virtually no increase in the real control total and the real level of
general government spending is forecast to rise by 2 per cent?
Meanwhile, as a percentage of GDP, the public sector borrowing requirement
is forecast to fall from 5 per cent this year to 3 per cent in 1995-96 (down
from the 4 1/4 per cent forecast last year), 1 3/4 per cent in 1996-97 (one
percentage point less than forecast last year) and balance by 1998-99. Gross
general government debt is also forecast to peak at 49 1/4 per cent of GDP
in 1995-96.
Thus, on both the fiscal deficit and government debt, the UK is forecast to
be within the Maastricht treaty criteria very soon. With retail price
inflation (less mortgage interest) also forecast at 2 1/2 per cent in the
year to the fourth quarter of 1995 and the same or less thereafter, that
stout Europhile Mr Clarke has done what he can to position the UK for the
third stage of any move to economic and monetary union, should his party be
in office and permit it.
The forecast of implausibly slow growth of public spending in real terms,
although helpful, is not central to this prospect. What matters most is
continued good economic performance. The chancellor is right to claim this
year's combination - forecast economic growth at 4 per cent (3 1/2 per cent
for non-North Sea GDP), a current account deficit of only  1/2 per cent of
GDP, exports of goods and services up 8 1/4 per cent (with imports rising
only 4 3/4 per cent) and inflation at 2 per cent - as the best for a
generation. But one swallow does not make a summer and one annus mirabilis
does not make a miracle.
After all, as Mr Clarke pointed out, the UK has seen growth disappear into
excessive inflation three times in the last two decades. The experienced
observer will wonder how things will be messed up this time. The forecast is
that growth will fall smoothly to 3 1/4 per cent next year. Notwithstanding
the tax increases in the pipeline, it may take substantial interest rate
increases to bring this about. It would also be wise to avoid those widely
expected future tax cuts altogether and allow net exports and investment to
drive the economy forward.
If the overall fiscal and economic picture is what stands out in this
Budget, there is still much detail to be assessed. If inflation is kept as
low as forecast, the proposed freeze on the running costs of the public
sector is at least defensible. Less attractive is the chancellor's addiction
to fiscal tinkering. The new venture capital trust scheme, for example,
which will provide income tax relief at 20 per cent, looks like another tax
loophole. Such fiscal concessions are the wrong way to promote economically
efficient small business.
Equally, the chancellor missed an opportunity to improve taxation of savings
by combining the Tax Exempt Special Savings Accounts (Tessas), the first of
which mature this year, with personal equity plans (PEPs). Instead, he has
allowed the latter to include corporate bonds and preference shares and
proceeds of Tessas to be deposited in new accounts. Some-thing far bolder
would also have been better.
Downright peculiar is the proposal to spend as much as Pounds 605m on
transitional relief for businesses facing higher rates bills following
revaluation of properties. That such large amounts of relief are required so
long after uniform business rates were introduced is difficult to
understand.
In addition, while it is good to see the main personal allowances raised in
line with prices, the decision to widen the 20p tax band by Pounds 200
reminds one how unfortunate this notion was. Not only did it complicate the
tax system, but it also prevents the more sensible change of raising tax
thresholds.
Intellectually, however, the centrepiece of the Budget must be the measures
on social security and employment. While modest, they are welcome. The
reform of housing benefit, for example, while bound to be unpopular, was
right. There does need to be a limit to this benefit. More popular will be
proposals to increase family credit for those in full-time jobs, accelerate
payment of benefits to people taking jobs, introduce a pilot study on family
credit for those without children, reduce lower rate national insurance
contributions and introduce a rebate of the national insurance contributions
for the long-term unemployed (even though the latter are defined as those
unemployed more than two years). Future fiscal room for manoeuvre should be
used to develop such schemes rather than cut the basic rate of income tax,
as Tory backbenchers will demand.
Mr Clarke stands revealed as a sensible chap, full of good intentions, but
with limited reforming ambitions. This is not a Budget with big ideas, but
one with a few tolerably good little ones. Everything hinges, however, on
the chancellor's ability to execute his one really big idea: sustaining a
non-inflationary expansion. This is the point in the cycle when that begins
to be both intellectually difficult and politically unpopular. Mr Clarke did
show courage in raising taxes last year. But he - and the governor of the
Bank of England - will have to show at least equal courage, if the pace of
this recovery is to be kept a sustainable one.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Comment): Building the new jobs consensus - The
proposed incentives for employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke made much in his Budget speech of the gulf between the
Conservative approach to reducing unemployment and that he ascribed to the
Labour opposition.
The chancellor contrasted his approach of reducing the cost for employers of
taking on long-term unemployed with what he described as Labour's desire to
load costs on to employers through policies such as the minimum wage and the
employee rights embodied in the European Social Charter.
Yet apart from those few well-rehearsed differences between the
Conservatives and Labour, much of the package of measures announced to get
the long-term unemployed back into work is common currency among the main
political parties.
'There is a growing consensus that there is a problem in the interface
between work and benefits,' said Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the
Confederation of British Industry. 'What the government is proposing is a
set of interesting measures that together will have a reasonable impact on
the problem.'
Mr Clarke has shown himself willing to borrow good ideas from sources that
include his political opponents as well as the CBI and right-of-centre
think-tanks.
He has also quarried the final report of the Social Justice Commission of
Sir Gordon Borrie on modernising the welfare state for a future Labour
government.
Not surprisingly, Labour is unhappy at what it regards as the theft of
Labour's ideas published last week without the provision of the funds needed
to make them effective. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said last night:
'The chancellor is deluding the public if he is claiming these measures will
be enough to tackle long-term unemployment.'
Still, there is clearly a growing consensus on two assumptions: that helping
the long-term unemployed back into work is best done by giving employers
incentives to offer jobs; and that persuading the unemployed to take work -
especially in low-paid jobs - requires changes in the social security system
to provide incentives to come off benefits.
The first assumption is behind the rebate of national insurance
contributions for employers who take on someone who has been unemployed for
more than two years. For low-paid workers, this is less generous than it
appears, according to Mr Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies,
because employers' NI contributions are not very high at the bottom of the
income ladder.
'Employers' NI is less than Pounds 10 a week for employees earning up to
Pounds 200 a week,' he says. 'It would probably need a further grant to make
a real difference to employers' hiring decisions.'
One attempt to provide such grants is the Workstart scheme, already being
pioneered in four areas and now to be extended in new pilots. This pays
employers Pounds 60 a week for 26 weeks if they take on someone unemployed
for more than two years, with Pounds 30 a week for a further 26 weeks. Such
a costly scheme is being restricted to 5,000 new jobs.
The second half of the consensus job creation package is improving
incentives for the unemployed to accept what job opportunities there are -
even when they are low-paid or part-time.
One way to achieve this is by cutting social security benefits for those out
of work. Tougher rules have already been introduced for claiming invalidity
benefit, which many long-term unemployed were claiming because of the higher
rates of benefit. Yesterday's budget announced the end of the payment of
mortgage interest for the first nine months of unemployment.
'Around 80 per cent of 30-year-olds are owner-occupiers,' says Mr Alan Marsh
of the Policy Studies Institute, the independent thinktank. 'Maybe they will
be prepared to take out insurance to cover the payments, but it will be a
powerful incentive for the newly unemployed to find a job.'
For those who are prepared to accept the work on offer, however, there are
better benefits. These include help for those returning to work after a long
spell of unemployment who may need to buy work clothes, tools, transport or
childcare.
'The chancellor is prepared to tackle the hidden in-work costs that act as a
serious disincentive to accepting jobs,' said Mr Marsh.
The biggest incentive to accept low-paid work is family credit, a benefit
that tops up the income of more than 500,000 low-paid employees with
children. The chancellor yesterday announced a pilot to extend family credit
to couples without children and single people, at a potential cost of Pounds
1.5bn a year.
If the pilot is a success and the benefit is offered to everyone in low-paid
work, the UK welfare state will move closer to a negative income tax system
in which the state routinely tops up the income of those on low pay, and
taxes those further up the income ladder.
'Oddly, the result could be to end up with more people on benefits,' said Mr
Marsh, 'a surprising outcome for a Conservative government.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (What It Means For You): Advance payment of fuel
bills advised - Benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and MARTIN MACCONNOL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumers are advised to pay fuel bills in advance, in spite of the measures
introduced to offset April's rise in value added tax on domestic heating
from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent.
The main beneficiaries of the measures appear to be pensioners, although
they will also help people receiving benefit. Mr Kenneth Clarke,
compromising after recent calls for the waiving of the second phase of the
VAT increase, said the benefits would offset the tax for many people.
The government has set aside Pounds 10m for home insulation grants and
increased the cold-weather payment - the benefit payable after seven
successive days of zero temperatures - from Pounds 6 to Pounds 8.50 a week.
From next year retirement pensions will rise to help offset VAT on fuel.
Single pensioners will get an extra Pounds 52 and couples Pounds 73. The
element to offset VAT will rise to Pounds 68 and Pounds 96 respectively from
1996.
Tax experts say consumers should still try to pay as much as possible of
future fuel bills by March 31, before the 9.5 per cent rise comes into
effect.
The chancellor said that Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary,
would today announce changes in the benefits system designed to boost the
public purse.
Local authorities will be capped on the level of housing benefit they can
pay tenants renting from private landlords. Authorities will not be fully
reimbursed for benefit significantly above the average for the area and type
of property.
Mr Lilley will also announce more limits on income support for mortgages.
Support will not be available for the first nine months on most mortgages
taken out after October 1995. New mortgage holders of working age will be
expected to insure mortgage interest payments against periods of sickness
and unemployment.
The Budget also made provisions to encourage the long-term unemployed back
to work - and to encourage employers to take them on.
From April 1996 employers will have a National Insurance contributions
holiday, while the jobseekers will gain by the speeding of the payment of
family credit to those moving into employment. The back-to-work bonus,
announced by Mr Lilley in October, will be exempt from income tax.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (What It Means For You): Choices widened in Tessas
and Peps - Savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Savers and investors with Tessas (tax-exempt special savings accounts) and
personal equity plans were given wider investment choice yesterday with
moves broadly welcomed by building societies and the Pep industry.
Tessas: Savers will be allowed on maturity of their Tessa to invest Pounds
9,000 in a new tax-exempt account. These bank and building society accounts,
introduced in 1991, allow Pounds 9,000 to be invested over five years. As
long as the capital remains untouched, interest is tax-free on maturity.
In effect, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has raised the first-year
investment limit from Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 9,000.
The move puts the first-year investment limit for Tessas on an equal footing
with Peps, their tax-free equity rival. Pep investors are allowed an annual
investment of Pounds 6,000 in a general plan and Pounds 3,000 in a single
company plan.
Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies Association,
which had lobbied for equal treatment of Peps and Tessa, welcomed the
measure as 'very good news'.
Mr David Gilchrist, corporate development manager at Halifax, the UK's
largest building society, said he saw the concession as a holding measure,
particularly given the proposal to extend the investment remit of Peps.
However, Mr Brian Davis, chief executive of Nationwide, the second-largest
society, described it as 'half-hearted' because the ability to reinvest will
not apply to the quite large sums which could have been amassed in interest.
Investors who put in less than Pounds 9,000 in the first year can continue
to save over the next four years within the usual annual limit of Pounds
1,800 for year-two onwards and subject to the Pounds 9,000 overall limit.
Peps: Corporate bonds and convertibles of UK non-financial companies, as
well as preference shares in UK and European Union companies, will become
eligible investments in a Pep from April 6 1995.
This is the first time that fixed-rate investments qualify for the full
Pounds 6,000 general Pep allowance. Peps which were designed to encourage
investment in equities, are free of income and capital gains tax.
Mr Nick Nichols, secretary-general of Pepma, the Pep Managers Association,
said he was 'ecstatic' at the news.
Mr Philip Warland, director-general of the Association of Unit Trust and
Investment Funds said he was 'delighted'. He said it would mean that
investors no longer had to take the great leap from deposits to equities,
but could invest in fixed-rate instruments instead.
Gilts were not included, perhaps because Mr Clarke wanted to emphasise that
this was a measure designed to help the corporate sector develop new methods
of finance.
To qualify under the new rules, corporate bonds will need to have a minimum
term of five years to maturity and be issued at a fixed rate of interest.
Regulations will also allow open-ended investment companies, the new-style
unit trusts due to come into existence next year, to qualify as Pep
investments on the same terms as authorised unit trusts.
Save As You Earn: The tax-free government save-as-you-earn savings scheme
operated by building societies and Abbey National bank has been abolished.
This scheme for small savers, introduced in 1969, had a maximum monthly
contribution of Pounds 20 and paid tax-free interest of 8.3 per cent at the
end of five-years. Existing SAYE savings schemes will be able to run their
full course without being affected. The government said that it had decided
to abolish the scheme to simplify tax incentive savings schemes.
National Savings: National Savings will stop offering its Yearly Plan
regular savings scheme on February 1 1995. Customers with existing Yearly
Plan agreements will be able to complete the monthly payments to obtain
their next Yearly Plan certificate.
The commission on purchases and sales of gilts on the National Savings Stock
Register will be increased on February 1 1995. The scale will be 0.6 per
cent on the first Pounds 5,000 and 0.35 per cent on any amount over Pounds
5,000, with a minimum of Pounds 5 for purchases. (No minimum for sales).

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (What It Means For You): Reforms to tax-paying
pushed to the forefront - Self-assessment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Self-assessment, the biggest shake-up in the UK tax system since PAYE was
introduced half a century ago, crept ever closer yesterday with the Budget
announcement of a raft of anti-avoidance measures.
The chancellor found time in his speech to tell the House of the 'positive
response' so far to the reforms put forward by the Inland Revenue and he
promised to try to keep the burdens on employers to a minimum.
The reforms were set in train in 1993 and the progress towards
implementation is now accelerating. Eight million taxpayers will have to
take part when self-assessment comes on stream in the 1996-97 tax year. For
the newly self-employed, compliance began on April 5 this year.
'SA', as it is known, catches more than taxpayers. If you are an employer
the system will require you to provide employees with more information than
in the past. Details on what employers would have to provide were published
yesterday.
While the Revenue points out that the new system will ultimately be cheaper,
faster, simpler, and more accurate, taxpayers face changes on a big scale.
SA is a new tax system, with a new set of tax forms, and a new set of
payment dates.
Of those who currently return a tax form, and who will be caught by the new
legislation, half are self-employed and half employees. They include
business partners, directors, and employees and pensioners with complicated
tax affairs.
SA has several basic building blocks but is essentially founded on the
assessment of tax with respect to figures provided by the taxpayer. The
taxpayer is invited to carry out this assessment themselves on the forms
provided - but this is not compulsory. Everything else is.
The new system is one based on current year assessment. Your tax bill for
any year relates to your income in that same year. The new system brings
together all income, and capital gains, to be taxed at one time. The present
system has different payment dates, for different years, and different types
of income.
The new system has a set of payment dates which are fixed. Three payments
are made in a year. Two are due on January 31 in one single transaction:
they are the first payment on account for the current year and a payment, or
refund claim, to settle up on the previous year. The second payment on
account will be due on July 31.
For example a taxpayer with income tax liability of Pounds 5,200 for
1997-98, the first year of current year assessment, would pay Pounds 2,600
on January 31 1999 and Pounds 2,600 on July 31 1999. If the actual tax
liability for 1998-99 is found to be Pounds 5,600 then on January 31 2000
the taxpayer would pay Pounds 400, the balance for the previous year, and
Pounds 2,800. On July 31 the taxpayer would pay the second instalment of
Pounds 2,800. And so on.
The new tax form itself will have to be in by January 31 after the end of
the tax year it covers in those cases where the taxpayer has
'self-assessed': in other words calculated their own tax. If the taxpayer
has opted for 'revenue calculation' the return, with all the relevant
information, must be in by the previous September 30.
The system is based on 'process now, check later' in that, apart from
obvious errors, the taxpayer's figures are accepted. However all returns
will be checked and a sample reviewed and taxpayers interviewed. Such
inquiries will usually have to begin within 12 months of the due date for
the return. There is also a system of penalties.
Yesterday the chancellor announced measures to stop tax avoidance which
could come about by the moving of profits or income into the transitional
period between accounts compiled on the preceding year basis and those on
current year basis.
Because of the overlap between the periods, an averaging out of profits is
proposed and some profits will drop out of the reckoning entirely in order
to make sure there is no double taxation. The scope for manipulation is wide
and the Treasury signalled its intention to act in March this year. The
measures announced yesterday are now open for consultation.
While agents, such as accountants and other tax practitioners, are already
preparing themselves for the transition period and beyond, many individual
taxpayers may be in for a surprise. The new tax form not only looks
different but it asks different questions.
At present self-employed taxpayers who file returns can write 'as per
accounts' on their returns and post them off with the accounts attached. The
new form will require the figures to be placed in a pre-set format.
PAYE taxpayers who also file a tax return can, at present, cut corners by
referring to employer-provided documents in answer to questions, for
example, on benefits in kind. Employees will now need this information from
their employers - and they will need it in time to avoid penalty.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (What It Means For You): Personal bands to be
unfrozen - Income tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Personal allowances are to be unfrozen for the first time in two years and
age-related allowances are to be increased above the rate of inflation,
Scheherazade Daneshkhu writes.
Restrictions announced previously will still apply, however. These measures
will take place from April 6 1995:
Personal allowances will be indexed. The single person's allowance will
therefore rise from Pounds 3,445 to Pounds 3,525.
Age-related allowances will increase above the rate of inflation. The
personal allowance for those aged 65-74 will rise from Pounds 4,200 to
Pounds 4,630, those aged 75 and over will see a rise from Pounds 4,370 to
Pounds 4,800.
The married couple's age allowance will rise for those aged 65 to 74 from
Pounds 2,665 to Pounds 2,995. It will increase for those aged 75 and over
from Pounds 2,705 to Pounds 3,035. These measures were announced in the last
Budget.
The income limit for age-related allowances will increase from Pounds 14,200
to Pounds 14,600.
The lower-rate income tax band of 20 per cent will be extended from the
first Pounds 3,000 of income to Pounds 3,200 - a tax saving of just Pounds
10 a year. The threshold for higher-rate taxpayers will ris from Pounds
23,700 to Pounds 24,300. The rates of income tax are unchanged.
On CGT and IHT the annual capital gains tax exemption is to increase from
its current Pounds 5,800 to Pounds 6,000 and the threshold for inheritance
tax moves up from Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 154,000.
Increases in restricted allowances will not, however, compensate for income
tax increases which were announced in the November 1993 Budget.
Relief on the married couple's allowance will be restricted to 15 per cent
of Pounds 1,720 from the current 20 per cent, so its tax value will fall
from Pounds 344 to Pounds 258. This restriction affects the widow's
bereavement allowance and the additional allowance in respect of children.
Mortgage interest tax relief will be restricted from 20 per cent to 15 per
cent.
Individuals making maintenance payments receive a deduction from their
income of Pounds 1,720. In the current year relief is given at 20 per cent
but from April 6 1995, it will be restricted to 15 per cent.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (What It Means For You): Unquoted companies 'more
attractive' - High-risk investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investing in unquoted companies will be a much more attractive proposition
in future with the broadening of tax incentives on two schemes: Enterprise
Investment Schemes and Venture Capital Trusts. In some cases, tax relief of
up to 60 per cent will be available.
With both schemes, the chancellor has made use of an extension of the
reinvestment relief for investing in unquoted companies, which was
introduced in last year's Budget. This relief allows a capital gains tax
liability from any investment to be deferred indefinitely if the gain is
invested in an unquoted trading company meeting certain conditions.
Rules on which companies qualify as unquoted trading companies under the
scheme were also relaxed in yesterday's Budget. The main restriction to be
abolished was the 'interest in land' rule, which disqualified a company if
more than half its assets were in land and buildings at any point during the
three years after investment. Relief has also been extended to property
development and farming companies.
Enterprise Investment Schemes were introduced last year as a successor to
the much-exploited Business Expansion Scheme, to encourage direct investment
in small unquoted trading companies. They carry a basic incentive of 20 per
cent up-front income tax relief on investments up to Pounds 100,000 a year,
if shares in the company are held for at least five years.
Now the chancellor has added the possibility of combining the income tax
relief with rollover reinvestment relief for capital gains, giving a
potential total tax relief of 60 per cent for higher-rate taxpayers who have
gains to reinvest.
The reinvestment relief applies to assets disposed of on or after yesterday.
It can be used if the disposal of assets is made up to one year before or
three years after the subscription for shares under the EIS is made.
Venture capital trusts: plans to introduce a new kind of venture capital
trust were announced in the 1993 Budget, with further details given in a
consultative document published earlier this year. The trusts will take the
form of quoted investment funds, intended to provide ordinary investors with
an easy way to invest in a portfolio of very small, growing unquoted
companies.
The original proposals gave investments in the new trusts tax treatment in
line with personal equity plans: tax-free income and capital gains, but no
up-front incentives.
Yesterday, however, the chancellor said that investments in the trusts would
attract both 20 per cent income tax relief and capital gains tax
reinvestment relief, adding up to a possible total of 60 per cent tax
relief, as with enterprise investment schemes. Investors can put up to
Pounds 100,000 a year into the trusts. Again, the reliefs only apply if the
shares are held for at least five years.
The chancellor also announced details of what restrictions there would be on
the type of investment the new trusts made. Investments can include both
equity and loans (with a minimum term of five years), but at least half the
investments must be in new ordinary shares.
At least 70 per cent of their investments must be in unquoted trading
companies, with no more than 15 per cent in any one company or group of
companies. To qualify as unquoted trading companies for this purpose,
companies must have assets of less than Pounds 10m before the investment is
made.
Venture capital trusts are due to be introduced from April next year.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (What It Means For You): Improved terms will
enhance friendly societies' policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Friendly societies' policies will become more attractive to savers after May
1995, when the annual amount you can pay into these tax exempt life
assurance policies will be raised from Pounds 200 to Pounds 270, Debbie
Harrison writes.
Existing policies can be changed to allow for the increased premium without
any loss of the tax privilege.
More significant perhaps, are the improved terms offered when policies are
cashed in early. Mr Simon Philip, director of personal finance with
chartered accountants Binder Hamlyn, said: 'If the plan is surrendered
within seven and a half years, when written as an endowment policy, or
within 10 years when written as a whole-life policy, the penalties can be
severe. The maximum amount you could receive back was a return of your
premiums. You would lose all investment growth.'
By the new rules that restriction is removed. Societies are free to offer
the best possible surrender terms on their qualifying policies. Higher
earners will be relieved that the chancellor has not further restricted
their pension contributions and benefits. The 'earnings cap'  - a ceiling on
the salary taken into consideration when calculating pension contributions
and benefits - has been raised in line with inflation, increasing from
Pounds 76,800, for the 1994-95 tax year, to Pounds 78,600 for the 1995-96
tax year. (The cap was frozen for the 1993-94 tax year.) For the 1995-96 tax
year the maximum pension for capped earners in company schemes will be
Pounds 52,400, while the maximum tax-free cash will be Pounds 117,900.
The cap affects personal pensions and company pension schemes set up after
the 1989 Budget and members who joined any scheme after June 1 1989. A high
earner planning a job change will be caught. He or she may not be capped at
present - but leaving an old scheme and entering a new scheme will trigger
the earnings cap rules.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (What It Means For You): Measures already
announced will have the biggest impact - The Institute for Fiscal Studies
analyses the effects of the Budget on different sectors of the population
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new tax changes announced by the Chancellor today were minimal.
Virtually all the changes that will affect people's incomes we knew about
even before he stood up.
But these pre-announced changes still mean that the incomes of virtually
everybody in the country will fall as tax rises come into effect immediately
(for excise duties) or in April (for other tax rises). Between them, they
will impose an average loss of about Pounds 2.70 per week on households.
This comes on top of average losses of nearly Pounds 7 per week which
households have already suffered as a result of last year's two Budgets.
This year's changes will not be nearly enough to restore a feel-good factor
to a nation which, although in recovery, has seen a fall in real personal
disposable income in the last year, largely as a result of tax increases.
Overall, the new measures will reduce taxes on households very slightly.
Without them the average losses would have been about Pounds 2.90 a week not
Pounds 2.70. The main beneficiaries will be pensioners who have seen their
personal income tax allowances rise by Pounds 430, Pounds 330 more than
necessary to account for inflation. For married pensioners this extra
personal allowance will be enough almost exactly to compensate them for the
pre-announced reduction in the value of the married couple's allowance.
In the graphic, overall losses for pensioners are noticeably less than those
for other types of households and the generous income tax reduction is
partly responsible.
Virtually all taxpayers will also benefit from a very small increase in the
width of the 20 per cent lower rate band of income tax, which will rise from
Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 3,200, Pounds 100 more than necessary to take account
of inflation. However the benefit to taxpayers will be a paltry Pounds 5 per
year, just 10p a week.
For the first time in three Budgets, personal income tax allowances were
indexed for inflation, leaving them unchanged in real terms, though the
married couple's allowance was again frozen. Also for the first time in
several Budgets, the basic rate limit - the point at which the 40 per cent
tax rate comes into force - rose with inflation, so higher rate taxpayers
were not hit again.
The only other change relevant to people's pockets, that had not already
been announced, was the freezing of alcohol duties. But given how low
inflation is, this will make very little difference to anybody.
The biggest changes by far remain those announced last year by Mr Clarke
and, in the case of the second tranche of VAT on fuel, by his predecessor Mr
Lamont. It is these changes which drive the distributional pictures shown
below. The most important remains the second tranche of VAT on domestic
fuel, raising it from 8 per cent this year to 17.5 per cent from April.
Fuel spending varies very little by income range. On average, the poorest 10
per cent spend only Pounds 4 a week less on fuel than the richest 10 per
cent. Consequently a VAT compensation package was announced last year which
will mitigate the worst effects on those on the lowest incomes by raising
benefits by more than inflation.
For pensioners as a group this will in time nearly, but not quite,
compensate in full for the imposition of VAT. Last April they received an
extra 50 pence a week on the basic pension. Next April they will receive a
further 30 pence or so above normal indexation. While other benefit
recipients did much less well last year, with single parents and unemployed
families with children suffering especially badly, they are hit little
harder than pensioners this year. All these groups will be left worse off
because of VAT on fuel.
The VAT changes and the other indirect tax rises are largely responsible for
the losses among the pensioners and the unemployed, who are not much
affected by income tax rises. Not only are these groups facing VAT on fuel,
but a 3 per cent real increase in tobacco duties and a 5 per cent real
increase in petrol duties will hit at least some of them. For richer people
the absolute effect of increased petrol duties especially will be greater.
Nevertheless the main tax increases that will be felt by the better off will
be the two big income tax rises which were announced last year. These were
the further restriction in the values of both the married couple's allowance
and mortgage interest tax relief (Miras) from 20 per cent to 15 per cent.
The MCA restriction will cost every married taxpayer Pounds 86 a year or
Pounds 1.65 a week. At current interest rates, the Miras restriction will
cost those with mortgages above Pounds 30,000 Pounds 2 a week.
These two changes will mean that married people with mortgages are worst
hit. Indeed, the graphic shows that married couples in work suffer worse
than any other group, with losses of between Pounds 4 and Pounds 5 a week on
average. Single wage earners by contrast will lose only Pounds 2 a week. It
is not only in absolute terms but also in proportional terms that married
wage earners do worst. They will lose up to 1.5 per cent of their disposable
income as against just one per cent for single wage earners and rather less
than that for pensioners.
Looking at the picture for income deciles, or tenths of the population from
richest to poorest, the overall impact gives the initial impression of being
mildly progressive, with richer deciles losing more in absolute terms than
poorer ones.
The one exception is the dip between the poorest and second poorest deciles
 -the poorest are doing worse than the not quite so poor. This is because
the poorest tend to be the unemployed below pension age, while the
not-quite-so-poor are largely pensioners who have not done quite so badly as
their younger counterparts.
The overall impression of progressivity is misleading, however, in so far as
progressivity should really be measured in terms of the proportion of
people's income which is taken. The absolute tax rise differs by only 60
pence a week between the fourth decile and the richest. So as a proportion
of income lost, it is the middle deciles who have done worst, losing 1.4 per
cent of their income as against just 0.7 per cent for the richest group and
1 per cent for the poorest decile. This picture has been little affected by
any of the new measures.
This Budget of Mr Clarke will not be remembered for its effect on people's
incomes nor on the distribution of the tax burden. But everybody has still
to feel many of the tax rises that he and his predecessor announced last
year. Middle income people will feel them most keenly.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (What It Means For You): Flexible vistas unfold
for richer pensioners - Personal pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor announced the introduction of flexible annuities from May
1995, after the finance bill receives royal assent. That will allow those
with personal pensions to extend the investment period into retirement and
to draw down an annual income from the pension fund.
Currently, those who need an income must buy their annuity immediately on
drawing benefits. Once the annuity has been purchased, it is not possible to
change the terms. In most cases, on death the fund is forfeited.
Annuity rates - that is the level of income you secure for your investment -
fluctuate significantly depending on the yields on long term gilts. In
recent years the value of annuities has fallen by 30 per cent or more, so
the purchase has become something of a lottery.
Mr Simon Philip, director of personal finance with chartered accountants
Binder Hamlyn, said: 'This will completely revolutionise pension planning
for many people. Normally, the process is divided into two phases - the
build up of the fund and the draw down of benefits. Now it will be possible
to extend the investment period up to age 75.'
Mr Philip added: 'The investment risk must be assessed regularly and
carefully in the period before you want to lock in to annuity rates.'
Not everyone should consider this option. Details are awaited, but there
will be fixed costs associated with managing the retirement fund and the
draw down of income.
Mr Brian Hurl, marketing manager of independent advisers Lexis, said: 'This
will only be an option for those with funds of Pounds 100,000 or more. The
investment management will be a sophisticated process, since the aim must be
to match the income draw-down with investment growth. The self-employed and
those in certain types of occupational schemes - executive pension plans,
for example - might consider this option.'
In the wake of widespread mis-selling of personal pensions to those with
company pension benefits, the government and investment regulators are
expected to set a strict code for sales of flexible annuities.
Mr John Moret, pensions manager with Provident Life, said: 'Some controls
will be necessary. It is vital that these funds are managed professionally
and properly - there must be a framework to protect pensioners' funds from
being depleted through injudicious investments.'

<TEXT>
Bill Caswell, 66: Former export consultant and, latterly, probation officer.
Lives with a friend in a large house on the Isle of Wight, and is divorced
with two grown-up children. He has no mortgage, a small pension of Pounds
6,500 but investments producing income of Pounds 30,000.
Said yesterday: 'For a retired person like me on a reasonable income there
were no nasty surprises. The VAT increases on fuel do not really affect me,
since I anticipated them by putting in a condensing boiler. Lower inflation
does not help everybody since higher inflation wipes out debt. But I am not
complaining.
The one thing I would like to have seen was tax benefits for the disabled. I
have become disabled recently and I do need help. I am little disappointed
about the increase in fuel taxes. If you live in the country like I do,
where public transport has collapsed, this is an extra burden. On the whole,
though, there was little to worry me.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Spending rise of 1% welcomed by
department - Education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department for Education hailed the 1 per cent rise in its budget in
real terms as proof that the government regarded education as a priority
area.
However, opposition politicians said the new budget for 1995-96 - of Pounds
10.958bn, up Pounds 427m from its level this year - represented a cut from
the original plan to raise it to Pounds 11.059bn. There is also no money
specifically for nursery education, in spite of the prime minister's
'copper-bottomed' pledge at the Conservative annual conference to introduce
education for all four-year-olds whose parents wanted it.
Detailed plans also showed a significant climbdown on its policy towards
grant-maintained schools, which opted out of local authority control under
legislation introduced in 1988. Previously, only opted-out and church
schools could benefit from the scheme started earlier this year to allow
schools to specialise in particular subjects, such as languages or
technology. Now local authority schools may also benefit.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow education secretary, described this as 'another
major U-turn towards Labour's proposals'.
Part of the budget has been earmarked for specialist schools, and this will
expand from Pounds 15m next year to Pounds 25m in the education year
beginning September 1997.
The budget also showed a sharp shift of funds towards helping adults and the
less academically able. Numbers at further education colleges, which cover
mostly vocational training as well as some A-levels, are projected to rise
by 28 per cent over the five years to the year beginning September 1997.
At university level, the department says it is funding an increase in the
number of mature students, although the proportion of school-leavers moving
on to university will remain unchanged, as expected. This might mean a
slight fall in total numbers due to a decline in the number of 18-year-olds.
Students' maintenance grants will be cut by 10 per cent, as expected,
following a similar cut last year. The amount available to them in
state-subsidised loans will be increased so that the total available from
loans and grants rises by 2.5 per cent.
Mr Don Foster, Liberal Democrat education spokesman, said that
schoolteachers would lose jobs because of the squeeze on local authority
spending, which is not covered by the education department.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Ministry emerges virtually
unscathed - Defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence emerged almost unscathed from this year's public
expenditure round, having suffered heavy losses in last year's Budget.
Cuts of the order of Pounds 250m over each of the next three years are
planned because inflation has proved lower than expected, but no large
equipment programmes are threatened by yesterday's announcement.
However, plans to privatise the MoD's housing stock were still left in
doubt.
Buoyed by a painless spending round, the MoD announced new equipment orders
for frigates and missiles for the RAF.
Invitations to tender for a final batch of up to three more Type 23
anti-submarine frigates will be issued.
Favourite to win the Pounds 450m frigate order is the Yarrow shipyard on the
Clyde owned by GEC, which is currently vying with British Aerospace for
control of the submarine maker VSEL.
Yarrow has built nine of the 13 Type 23 ships so far ordered.
Two new missiles were also confirmed for the RAF. A long-range conventional
attack missile will be ordered in 1996 at a cost of about Pounds 750m.
This will allow Tornados, Harriers and Eurofighters to attack targets up to
250km away with high accuracy.
The idea for the missile came from the Gulf war where US forces used
advanced munitions to great effect with their fighters able to stand off at
safe distances.
There are several possible competitors for the contract. Leading contenders
are the French company Matra with its Apache missile, McDonnell Douglas of
the US with its GrandSLAM and the UK team of GEC and BAe offering the
Pegasus missile.
The other missile for the RAF is a Pounds 700m anti-tank weapon primarily
intended to be launched from the Tornado and the Harrier.
It is intended to knock out tanks and armoured personnel carriers in
combination with the anti-tank helicopters the army is currently
considering.
GEC is offering its version of the US Hellfire missile while British
Aerospace is offering an adaptation of its Asraam anti-aircraft missile for
the competition.
The one issue which remained unresolved for the MoD in the Budget was the
gap in its funding for next year which would be caused by its failure to
sell its housing stock.
The ministry is relying on getting up to Pounds 500m for house sales in
1995-96 but has run into technical difficulties.
Yesterday it was still confident that the money would be raised in time.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): NHS funding wins increase of
Pounds 1.3bn - Health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Health Service was picked out by Mr Kenneth Clarke as one of
the few areas where public spending would rise in real terms.
'Next year spending on the health service will grow by Pounds 1.3bn, 1 per
cent in real terms, against the 0.5 per cent increase allowed for in last
year's Budget,' the chancellor said.
'Further improvements in efficiency are expected to release at least Pounds
600m extra for patient care next year.'
The British Medical Association, the doctors' representative body, said that
'initially, the Budget looks like relative good news. But we'd like to know
where efficiency savings of Pounds 600m - about 2 per cent - can be made.
Many NHS trusts are already reporting that their costs have been cut close
to the bone.'
Mr Philip Hunt, director of the National Association of Health Authorities
and Trusts, said he was relieved that real spending would rise.
He believed the efficiency savings could be made through a reduction in the
number of patients staying in hospital along with a rise in the proportion
of outpatient treatments and lower management costs through regional health
authority mergers.
He said the increased spending and savings would allow about 4 per cent more
patient treatments to be carried out.
But he warned that this would happen only if there was no real increase in
hospital employees' wages and a minimal increase in staff numbers.
Under the Budget plan, NHS spending will rise by 1 per cent in real terms in
1995-96 to Pounds 32bn.
Within that, hospital capital spending would be cut by 6.3 per cent to
Pounds 1.8bn, compared with a rise of 16 per cent in 1994-95. This would be
offset by receipts from land sales and private investment.
'There are now over 50 health projects either approved or completed bringing
in over Pounds 100m of new capital into the NHS,' said Mr Clarke.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said that the higher spending
meant that from April 1995 'nobody will have to wait more than 18 months for
treatment'. She added there would be a new standard for outpatient waiting
times announced 'soon'.
One of the biggest beneficiaries of government spending is in Family Health
Services - general practitioners - which see a real increase of 2.5 per cent
in spending to Pounds 7bn.
This may be partly to take into account a drugs bill which is increasing
faster than the rate of inflation. Most drugs are dispensed to patients
through GPs.
Department of Health spending on administration is budgeted to fall by 8.8
per cent to Pounds 272m.
Mr Clarke said that the real increase in spending on the NHS was the result
of lower than expected inflation. This made it 'possible for us to reduce
our previous plans for health and still meet our manifesto commitment to
real growth in resources each year,' but such a reduction would not take
place.
He said that the NHS would deliver 'even better standards of patient care,
with further improvements in patients' charter standards, and more progress
in reducing waiting times'.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Spending stays level in real
terms at Pounds 1.28bn - Science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Science spending will remain exactly level in real terms at Pounds 1.282bn
next year.
'This is a good settlement,' said Mr David Hunt, the minister responsible
for science. 'After looking very carefully at all its expenditure
programmes, the government has again made science one of its priorities.'
Mr Robert Hughes, the junior science minister, added that the level outcome
was better than it looked at first sight, as the current year's science
budget was worth about 2 per cent more than in 1993-94 because of lower than
expected inflation - and Mr Hunt, unlike many of his colleagues had hung on
to the increase.
But Save British Science, a research lobby group, was disappointed. Mr John
Mulvey, SBS secretary, had expected a further rise of at least 2.5 per cent,
after a speech this year in which the prime minister said he expected
'spending on the science base to rise in real terms next year'.
'At a time when our economy is growing at 3.5 per cent a year, we can afford
to invest in the long-term future by spending more on research,' Mr Mulvey
said last night. 'This is a government with shorter term concerns.'
The government's science budget covers money spent directly by the Office of
Science and Technology through its five research councils - mainly on
university research. OST officials expected overall public spending on
research and development to decline again next year, because of cuts in
support for science and technology by the Ministry of Defence and Department
of Trade and Industry. But figures for all R&amp;D expenditure in 1995-96 will
not be available until next year.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Subsidy freeze disappoints -
Farming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Farmers' leaders last night expressed disappointment that government
subsidies to hill farmers would be frozen next year rather than being raised
after cuts of about Pounds 50m over the past two years.
The hill livestock compensatory allowances are paid to more than 60,000
farmers in upland areas covering half Britain's farmland.
The Hill Farming Initiative, a lobby group, said the government's decision
to freeze the allowances at Pounds 105m was 'a false economy'.
Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, justified the freeze by saying
overall subsidies to livestock farmers in less favoured areas, most of which
come from Brussels, would rise by Pounds 50m to more than Pounds 600m next
year.
The farmers' union also described as 'very disappointing' the abolition of
grants for waste-handling facilities, a move that will save about Pounds 8m
next year.
Farmers have received more than Pounds 148m in grants since 1989, and
serious incidents of pollution have fallen from 99 in 1991 to 63 last year.
The grants will be reintroduced in the new nitrate-vulnerable zones, but
these are expected to cover only 650,000 hectares.
Another disappointment, according to Mr Graham Latham, agriculture
specialist at accountants Grant Thornton, is that willow and poplar coppice
 -environmentally friendly crops being grown for fuel - will be taxed as
commercial woodland.
But Mr Latham identified two pieces of good news for farmers: capital gains
will be eligible for tax relief if they are reinvested in the farming
company, and farmers will be able to offset losses on farm cottages against
profits on land.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Authorities braced for a
decrease in outlays - Local government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Local authority associations braced themselves for a cut in spending, in
nominal terms, after the chancellor's announcement.
They also attacked Mr Clarke's assertion that local authorities' total
standard spending would rise by 2.2 per cent. Local authorities pointed out
that this did not take into account the extra costs created by councils' new
responsibilities for community care, or expenditure on transitional costs
created by local government reorganisation, which is due to start next year.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, admitted that if these were excluded,
the settlement represented a cash increase of only 0.8 per cent.
The Labour-controlled Association of County Councils also pointed out that
local authorities were currently spending far more than their total standard
spending assessment - a government projection used when allocating grants to
different local authorities.
At present, according to Mr Mike Grealy, the association's finance officer,
local authorities are spending about Pounds 45bn this year - so the new
total standard spending assessment of Pounds 43.511bn represents a cut of
Pounds 1.5bn.
This is before wage and price rises are taken into account. Mr Grealy also
predicted particular stress on the schools budget, which accounts for about
40 per cent of local authority spending. Demographic changes mean that local
authorities expect 110,000 extra pupils this year.
The shortfall was met in part this year by an unprecedentedly high draw on
reserves of Pounds 775m. Local authorities claim this is not repeatable, and
in a joint statement they predicted that council tax would rise by 6 per
cent next year, in combination with cuts in services.
Some authorities may receive more than they did last year because of changes
in the distribution of grant, while others may benefit from the transitional
scheme designed to smooth the introduction of the council tax in April last
year.
It is also possible that the government will loosen the criteria for
'capping' budgets, which it has used, so far successfully, to limit
increases in council tax.
Mr Gummer's decisions on both these issues will be announced in parliament
tomorrow. Local authorities are also likely to lobby the education
department to fund this year's rise in teachers' pay. Last year's rise, of
2.9 per cent, was met in full by local authorities, and they claim that
class sizes grew as a result.
Mr Gummer said that councils could maintain current spending levels by
'efficient housekeeping and efficient collection of the council tax'.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Aid funds to rise by Pounds
146m - Overseas aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Overseas Development Administration's aid budget, covering aid to
developing countries, assistance to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union, is to rise by Pounds 146m in 1997-98 from the Pounds 2.1bn in
1994-95, the chancellor announced.
A statement from the administration said aid would be concentrated on the
poorest 50 countries, which received three-quarters of bilateral aid in
1993-94.
'Aid for the poorest countries in Africa and Asia and the provision of
know-how to countries in transition remain particular priorities for the
ODA's work,' it said.
The statement was disputed, however, by the World Development Movement which
recently won a High Court challenge over the funding of the controversial
Pergau Dam in Malaysia.
It said the channeling of more aid through Europe and to commercially tied
projects would leave fewer funds for poverty-focused country-to-country aid.
Ms Harriet Lamb, development movement campaign officer, said Africa in
particular would suffer as, on the ODA's own calculations, the percentage of
total British aid to Africa was set to fall from 14.4 per cent in 1994-95 to
12.1 per cent in 1997.
Mr Ben Jackson, the movement's campaigns co-ordinator, complained that the
chancellor had had to stump up Britain's share of the Edinburgh summit's
commitment to increase European aid by 60 per cent by the end of the decade.
He said: 'Unlike some of his European counterparts, he has failed to match
this promise with extra funding for the overall aid budget.
'Britain is punching well below its weight as an aid giver. This will mean
biting cuts in Britain's aid for long-term development programmes essential
for the world's poor.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Local councils and transport
lose out - Public sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Budget promises a bleak four years ahead for public sector employees,
apart from the police and those engaged in the planned growth sectors of
education and health services such as further education.
For the rest, pay freezes, reductions in staffing levels and cuts in
programmes are the hallmarks of the Budget - although the government hopes
they will be offset by an increase in private finance for public sector
capital investment projects under the private finance initiative.
The principal winners in this year's tough public spending round are the
health and education departments, which secured 1 per cent real growth in
their budgets. For health, this comes on top of a 3.8 per cent real increase
in the current year.
The main losers are local government and transport, each set to suffer a cut
in their budget allowing for inflation.
Unemployment and social security benefit claimants will have their incomes
uprated in line with inflation. But those reliant on housing benefit may
suffer from the government's decision no longer to meet the full cost of
rents deemed to be excessive.
It may prove difficult to deliver the real reduction in spending totals
which Mr Kenneth Clarke has promised. Last year's Budget anticipated a steep
1.3 per cent real reduction in government spending in 1994-5. Now it is
forecast to have risen, in real terms, by 1.4 per cent.
Mr Clarke hopes to improve on this outcome next year, delivering a 0.8 per
cent real reduction in spending. But this year's experience may indicate
that lowering cash targets by enough to account fully for both lower
inflation and lower real spending is easier said than done.
Mr Clarke announced that the total figure for 'general government
expenditure' would be Pounds 43bn lower than previously anticipated by the
1997-98 financial year - implying a cut of about 13 per cent in projected
spending.
Much of that reduction is accounted for by lower than expected inflation,
and by the financing of an increasing proportion of public sector capital
spending projects - notably transport schemes - through the private finance
initiative.
However, in its reliance on private finance, the Budget raises the critical
issue of the freedom of public institutions to pay back their private
financiers through user charges. For instance, Mr Clarke boasted that
universities are currently meeting a third of their capital funding from
private sources. The need to repay large private loans can only increase
pressure from universities to be allowed to charge higher fees, some of
which are bound to be passed directly to students.
The number employed in the civil service and local government - outside
education - will fall sharply if the policy unveiled in the Budget is
sustained.
Mr Clarke announced a cash freeze in central government running costs until
1997-98, which means a reduction of about 10 per cent in real terms. He made
no attempt to disguise the impact on staffing, saying that he expected the
number employed in Whitehall departments and agencies to fall significantly
below 500,000.
Numbers are already falling. Every department is engaged in a review of
staffing requirements, with large cuts announced or imminent. Senior
officials are not exempt: last month the Treasury announced the shedding of
a quarter of its top posts.
Customs and Excise is set to be the next in line. Unions claimed last night
that a review to be announced today would result in the loss of more than
4,000 jobs from its 25,000-strong workforce.
The government has less immediate control over local authorities, which in
England alone employ about 2m people and have budgets totalling Pounds 45bn.
However, ministers clearly expect that by imposing a real-terms cut on local
councils - grants to local authorities in England will rise by only 0.8 per
cent in cash terms for existing programmes - town halls will be forced to
follow Whitehall's lead.
Councillors face a fraught year ahead. Despite the Budget cuts, they will
have to meet rising demand for education, their principal service, and they
are under strong pressure from local electors to provide more nursery
schools without any earmarked funds from the government. The clamour for
more law and order spending is also set to continue.
The government clearly hopes that its 1 per cent real increase in health
spending will prevent further controversy about the future of the National
Health Service. Spending will rise to Pounds 32bn, which the health
department believes will be enough to meet commitments that patients will
not have to wait more than 18 months for treatment.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Inducements to get people back
to work - Long-term jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Budget includes a wide range of measures to encourage the long-term
unemployed back into work through a mixture of incentives and new benefits.
The aim is also to improve inducements for the low-paid and the jobless with
families to secure full-time work.
From April 1996, people who have been out of work for more than six months
will be able to receive the full existing rate of housing and council tax
benefit for the first four weeks after they take a job. This will cost
Pounds 50m a year and help about 440,000 people. The Treasury said local
authorities would be consulted shortly about this change.
The provision of family credit is also to be speeded up. From April 1996, 95
per cent of family credit claims from employees will be dealt with within
five working days of the claim being received by the Department of Social
Security at a cost of Pounds 5m a year - helping about 400,000 people.
Extra money will be provided for family credit claimants working in
full-time jobs. Anyone entitled to family credit who takes a job of more
than 30 hours a week will receive an extra Pounds 10 a week premium from
July 1995 at a cost of Pounds 205m a year. This is intended to remove the
main disincentive to work longer hours after receiving family credit. The
benefit currently provides financial assistance to 580,000 families helping
them to be better off in work. An extra Pounds 10 a week will ensure that
someone working 40 hours a week will receive more in total income after tax
than someone working 16 hours.
People who also receive housing benefit and council tax benefit will be able
to keep an extra Pounds 10 of income before these benefits can be affected,
guaranteeing that they will benefit by the full amount of the extra family
credit. It is estimated 350,000 families on low incomes will be helped.
A new benefit is to be tried, aimed at couples and single people without
children over a period of three years in eight locations from October 1996.
A total of Pounds 75m will be provided for this.
'Unemployed people tell us three things make them hesitate over whether to
take work,' said Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary.
'Uncertainty about how to manage between leaving benefit and receiving the
first wage; uncertainty about meeting the rent; and uncertainty about being
better off. We are tackling all three issues.'
The Department of Employment also announced changes to encourage more people
to return to work. 'My key priority in this public expenditure round has
been to ensure the help and encouragement we offer is effective and targeted
on those who need it most, in particular the long-term unemployed,' said Mr
Michael Portillo, employment secretary.
The government's new back-to-work bonus, worth up to Pounds 1,000 in a lump
sum, will be tax-free. This proposal was announced last month; it enables
the unemployed to accumulate part-time earnings and receive the bonus when
entering a long-term job. There is to be a national extension of the
government's jobfinders grant scheme which provides one-off lump sum
payments to people out of work for over two years by helping them to fund
their transitional costs on returning to work. Up to 25,000 grants averaging
Pounds 200 will be available from next April at a cost of Pounds 5m
annually.
'Unemployed people often worry, with some justice, that delays in assessing
and paying in-work benefits can leave them temporarily short of money,' said
the chancellor. 'These measures will give people greater confidence they
will not suffer financial hardship in the first few weeks of a new job'.
Two schemes are to be introduced for 18-to-24-year-olds out of work for over
a year: Workwise, based on four-week courses, and 1-2-1, a series of
individual interviews after successful pilot schemes. These will provide
intensive help for job searchers by improving their ability to look for
work. The cost will be Pounds 10m a year. The schemes will be mandatory for
those who refuse other offers of help and replace the old jobplan workshops.
The community action programme for the long-term unemployed will continue
for the next three years, providing 40,000 job opportunities annually. This
provides work experience and a way back into work for those who need it
most. Participants receive an allowance equivalent to their unemployment
benefit plus Pounds 10 a week with an average stay of four months on the
programme. This will cost Pounds 70m a year. Mr Portillo added that the
government's main training programme - Training for Work - for the long-term
jobless is to focus more sharply on getting people into work.
'We will increase the number of unemployed people who get jobs as a result
of the programme from a reduced budget,' he said.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Sharp cuts in road building
programme - Transport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's Pounds 2bn annual road building programme faces sharp cuts
over the next three years, despite hopes of an increasing financial
contribution from the private sector.
Spending on the national railway network and London Underground is also set
to fall by an estimated Pounds 300m next year.
Public spending on roads had risen by a half in real terms over the past 10
years, the chancellor said. 'But now that the main need of the economy is
control of public spending and borrowing, we cannot carry on pumping in the
same amount of taxpayers' money.
'We have therefore significantly reduced the planned public spending on
trunk roads and motorways,' he told Parliament.
Total transport spending over the three years 1995-96 to 1997-98 will fall
to Pounds 16bn, of which Pounds 2bn will come from the private sector, Mr
Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, said yesterday. This compared with the
Pounds 16.8bn previously forecast to be spent between 1994-95 and 1996-97 in
the transport department's most recent annual report.
Spending on motorways and major roads is expected to fall from Pounds 2.1bn
in 1994-95 to Pounds 1.7bn in 1997-98, transport department figures showed.
Greater emphasis is to be given to smaller road schemes designed to
eliminate local accident and congestion black spots, Dr Mawhinney said.
Spending on these schemes will rise to Pounds 108m next year from Pounds 74m
this year.
Central government support for local authority road schemes is due to
decline from Pounds 981m this year to Pounds 863m in 1997-98.
Total spending on public transport - rail, London Transport and the Civil
Aviation Authority - will fall from Pounds 2.38bn this year to Pounds 1.83bn
in 1995-96 and Pounds 1.56bn the following year. However, the proceeds from
the sale of British Rail assets, including the rolling stock leasing
companies and freight companies, will bring in Pounds 770m next year and
Pounds 325m the year after.
In 1997-98 public transport spending recovers, however, to Pounds 1.9bn with
no contribution from the privatisation process.
Spending on London Transport's core network, excluding large projects such
as the Jubilee Line extension, will fall steadily to Pounds 382m in 1997-98
from Pounds 497m this year.
In contrast with the strong criticism made by London Transport of government
funding in recent years, Mr Peter Ford, the new chairman, described this as
'a fair settlement' though less than previously indicated.
Organisations of road users criticised the government for its spending
reduction. The RAC said the government had increased the tax burden on
motorists by raising fuel duties 'while pulling the roads out from under
their wheels'.
The Freight Transport Association said plans to bring private finance into
road building without clear income streams to repay the private sector
'could lead to crippling delays and serious inconvenience to UK industry'.
Mr Michael Meacher, Labour transport spokesman, predicted far higher fares
for travellers on public transport and a reduction in services. Funding for
the railways was being cut on the assumption that privatisation would be
successful while Britain's roads would continue to deteriorate.
Transport 2000 said private finance was a substitute for a transport policy
and forecast that the cuts in rail spending would lead to drastic cuts in
services.
Mr Mawhinney defended the decision to bring more private finance into
transport as 'a partnership between the public and private sectors'.
He said: 'I am determined to break the psychology which rules that, if money
does not come from the taxpayer, it is not real or, in some sense, does not
count. We must look at what is being spent not, just the immediate funding
mechanism.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Employers criticise 'marginal'
measures - Employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While employers' bodies welcomed some of the chancellor's Pounds 375m
package of measures aimed at reducing the number of long-term unemployed,
they were critical that they did not go far enough towards addressing
wholesale unemployment.
Apart from the changes in National Insurance contributions, the measures
directed at employers are broadly piecemeal - aimed at attacking the problem
on a variety of fronts.
The 0.6 per cent cut in National Insurance contributions for all employees
earning less than Pounds 205 a week from April 1995 will cost Pounds 250m.
At present, these contributions are in three tiers, between 3.6 and 7.6 per
cent up to Pounds 199.99. The new tiers will be respectively 3, 5 and 7 per
cent.
Employer organisations said this was of minimal importance.
'It is only going to have a marginal effect on employers. All it does is
make it a little more attractive to employ someone at a lower level,' said
Mr Geoff Armstrong, director-general of the Institute of Personnel and
Development.
Mr Jim Yuill, director of social security services at Ernst &amp; Young, said he
did not expect the measure to prove a useful incentive for employers. The
vast majority of employers pay the 10.2 per cent National Insurance rate, he
said. 'I don't think it makes a lot of difference because there is no
evidence at all that reducing National Insurance rates encourages employers
to take on more staff.'
He said, however, that a second initiative to grant National Insurance
contributions holidays of up to one year for employers of people who have
been out of work for more than two years was a 'clear saving for employers'.
The contributions holidays, starting in April 1996, will mean that employers
who take on someone who has been out of work for more than two years will be
able to get a full NI rebate for that person for up to one year.
On average, employers will save more than Pounds 300 for every person they
take on. This will cost Pounds 45m a year.
The employer measures also include expansion of work trial schemes -
three-week work trials for new recruits who have been out of work for more
than six months. The work trials will produce 150,000 places over the next
three years at a total cost of Pounds 30m. Work trials enable employers to
assess the suitability of long-term unemployed job seekers for a vacancy
before committing themselves to employing them.
The idea is that people who have been out of work for more than six months
can have the chance to prove themselves in a real job while their benefits
continue to be paid over the three-week trial period.
Some 20,000 work trail opportunities are available in 1994-95, rising to
40,000 next year, 50,000 in 1996-97 and 60,000 in 1997-98. The cost of the
provisions in each of the three years will be Pounds 8m, Pounds 10m and
Pounds 12m.
Another initiative aimed at employers is the extension and development of
workstart schemes, previously piloted in Devon and Cornwall, east Kent,
south London and Tyneside.
The pilots which started in June 1993 have been modest so far, helping 1,474
people find work, but new workstart pilots will provide 5,000 opportunities
next year.
These schemes give employers financial incentives to take on long-term
unemployed people. The Department of Employment subsidies are Pounds 50 a
week per employee for the first six months and Pounds 30 a week for the
second six months.
The pilots have varied, sometimes taking those unemployed for more than two
years and sometimes taking those who have been jobless for more than four.
The new pilots are expected to continue the variable approach on subsidy
levels, method of payment, duration of subsidy and eligibility.
Mr Robbie Gilbert, director of employment affairs at the CBI, said: 'The
measures have placed a lot of emphasis on the 500,000 people who have been
unemployed for more than two years. We wanted more done, however, for the 1m
people who have been out of work for between six months and two years.'
The CBI welcomed the National Insurance measures. But Mr Howard Davies,
director-general, said there was also a need to focus on skills training for
the long-term unemployed. 'We hope to see more emphasis on that in the
Department of Employment's programmes in future,' he said.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, director of the Institute of Directors, said he was
'disappointed' at the maze of measures to help people in lower-paid
employment. He said: 'The chancellor should have cut a swathe through the
regulations and reduced employment costs.'
The IoD, he said, would have preferred an across-the-board reduction in
employers' national insurance contributions. 'Subsidies to reduce
unemployment are no substitute for the creation of jobs,' he said.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Home Office services get Pounds
150m increase - Police
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Funding for Home Office services will increase by Pounds 150m next year to
Pounds 6.41bn, rising by a further Pounds 10m in 1996-97 and a further
Pounds 150m to Pounds 6.57bn in 1997-98.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said provision for the police service
would increase by 3 per cent next year, allowing police numbers to be
maintained if chief constables, in consultation with police authorities,
chose to do so. It would also permit police service reforms resulting from
Sir Patrick Sheehy's review to be completed.
'By abolishing central controls on manpower, I am giving police authorities
and chief officers much greater flexibility in the way they determine their
spending priorities,' Mr Howard said.
The 3 per cent rise, which will increase budgets in line with inflation, was
given a cautious welcome by the Association of Chief Police Officers.
'There is no way that any police force could have afforded to lose money
from its budget. We realise that the government is not going to throw money
at public services and are prepared to work within constraints. However, the
reality is that the demands upon the police are still increasing,' a
spokesman said.
Part of the increase is to meet the full costs of running a DNA database.
Police powers to take DNA samples from suspects were widened by the 1994
Criminal Justice and Public Order Act. Mr Howard said the new DNA database
should be operational from March 1 1995.
The government also signalled its intention to continue to increase the
number of prison places. An extra 4,000 places will be provided by 1997-98.
Almost 3,000 places would be built by the prison service but alongside this
direct public expenditure on prisons the government is evaluating tenders
for the first two privately financed prisons due to provide 1,200 places in
1997-98. Two more private prisons are planned in 1998-99, the first at
Agecroft in Manchester.
The new secure training centres for persistent juvenile offenders will also
be built using private finance.
Provision for the immigration and nationality department is planned to rise
by 4 per cent next year to deal with increases in passenger traffic and
asylum applications.
Planned expenditure on legal aid will rise from an estimated out-turn of
Pounds 1.33bn in 1994-95 to Pounds 1.46bn in 1995-96, Pounds 1.56bn in
1996-97 and Pounds 1.6bn in 1997-98. These figures represent a reduction in
legal aid provision on expenditure outlined in last year's Budget.
The Law Society said the reduction was a 'great disappointment'. Mr Russell
Wallman of the society's legal aid directorate said the chancellor promised
at the time he cut legal aid eligibility in 1993 that he would restore the
cuts when the opportunity presented itself.
'The legal aid underspend of the last two years presented that opportunity,
but instead of restoring the cuts the government has simply used the
underspend to reduce legal aid provision,' he said.
The government expects the numbers receiving legal aid to rise from 3.6m
this year to 4.4m by 1997-98.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Fund for deprived areas to
expand - Inner cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Finance for the single regeneration budget, which targets spending on
deprived areas, is to be increased to a total of Pounds 800m over the next
three years.
The budget, introduced in April, brought resources from 20 regeneration
programmes run by five Whitehall departments into a combined, regionally
administered fund. It gives priority to projects in which a range of
partners work together.
The government will make an additional Pounds 75m over three years available
for schemes that took part in the first round of bidding for support from
the budget. This means Pounds 125m will be available for new projects in
1995-96 and 1996-97, rising to Pounds 225m in 1997-98.
More than 450 bids have been submitted and the winners will be announced
shortly. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, yesterday said that the
success of the first round had prompted him to launch a second next year.
This would make more than Pounds 800m available for new single regeneration
budget projects over the next three years.
'The first round bids indicate that on average for every Pounds 1 spent
through the single regeneration budget, a further Pounds 4 will be levered
in from other private and public contributors,' he said. This would generate
a total of more than Pounds 5bn for new regeneration work, and have a 'huge
impact on many of our most run-down areas'.
By bringing the activities of all departments involved in inner-city issues
together, the new budget is widely regarded as a improvement on the previous
piecemeal approach. Community organisations are, however, concerned about
the budget's adequacy and about projects previously funded by the government
that will fall outside its remit.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Gowrie applauds Pounds 5.1m
funds rise - Arts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The arts have done rather well out of the Budget. The grant for the Arts
Council of England in 1995-96 has been raised by Pounds 5.1m to Pounds
191.5m. A year ago, the council had its grant cut for the first time, by
Pounds 3.2m, and had been told to expect stand-still funding for next year.
But the new heritage secretary, Mr Stephen Dorrell, who has been criticised
for apparent indifference to his department, surprised the arts world
yesterday and won the plaudits of Lord Gowrie, chairman of the Arts Council.
'While the restitution still falls short in real terms, the secretary of
state has made an excellent start and the additional Pounds 5.1m will enable
arts organisations to trade their way out of recession,' he said.
The council will decide next month how to distribute its grant among its
clients, but the unexpected uplift should prevent the collapse of any
important arts companies, many of which have deficits.
The arts will also benefit from the extra Pounds 750,000 allocated to the
Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme, bringing it up to Pounds 5.6m a year.
There was also good news in the chancellor's announcement that the
Foundation for Sport and the Arts would continue for at least the next five
years.
In total, Mr Dorrell managed to raise the budget of the Department of
National Heritage from Pounds 976m to Pounds 1.01bn, an increase roughly in
line with inflation.
Mr Dorrell has shown great interest in the potential of tourism to increase
the revenues of arts companies. From his budget he has allocated an extra
Pounds 2m to the British Tourist Authority over the next two years so it can
launch a new tourist marketing initiative for London.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Grant reduction draws criticism
 -Housing associations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to cut the amount of grant provided to housing associations were
strongly criticised last night by housing organisations which said it would
mean more homeless people.
Housing investment plans for England for 1994-5, including the rough
sleepers' allowance, have been cut from Pounds 1.73bn to Pounds 1.36bn; a
reduction of more than Pounds 300m.
The National Federation of Housing Associations said that would mean new
rented homes provided by associations would fall to only 10,000, against
this year's 25,000. That was in addition to a reduction of 9,000 homes
already announced, following a previous cut of Pounds 250m in the 1994-5
budget.
The federation said homes started for low-cost and shared ownership schemes
would fall from 20,000 to 12,500 next year. Reduced building programmes
could cost 4,000 construction jobs in 1994-5 and 7,900 the following year.
Higher benefit payments and lost tax revenue would cost the Exchequer Pounds
35m next year and Pounds 70m the year after, it added.
The Chartered Institute of Housing said the budget cuts would make it more
difficult for people on modest wages to find rented accommodation.
Mr Jim Coulter, chief executive of the National Federation of Housing
Associations, said: 'For three years the government has achieved falling
homeless figures, but Mr Clarke's announcement could mean that the level may
start to rise again.'
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said that falling construction costs
and increased private sector investment in association schemes had meant
that building programmes had been maintained.
From April, the government expects private investors to provide 42 per cent
of associations' finance, against 25 per cent private investment in 1989-90.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Landfill tax set for 1996 - Environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A tax on landfill was the most obviously 'green' proposal in the Budget. But
the government will proceed cautiously before implementing a measure which
could be unpopular with industry.
Mr Clarke said that the tax would be introduced in 1996 and would raise
several hundred million pounds a year.
The tax would be collected by Customs and Excise, which means it would be
added, like value added tax, to the cost of waste disposal.
But to sweeten the pill, Mr Clarke made clear that the cost would be offset
by other measures, such as a reduction in National Insurance contributions,
meaning that its overall effect on industry would be neutral.
Fuller details will be contained in a consultation document which will be
published shortly.
The tax would be levied on all waste going to landfill (licensed rubbish
dumps). The purpose would be to make rubbish more expensive and encourage
industry to minimise waste or recycle it. Mr Clarke said: 'In some cases,
taxes actually do some good, by helping markets work better and by
discouraging harmful or wasteful activ-ities.'
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, welcomed the proposal because it
would add to a string of measures by government to deal with the waste
problem.
He stressed that the proposed offset meant that it was 'not fiscal, only
environmental'.
It was also welcomed by environmentalists. Mr Charles Secrett, director of
Friends of the Earth, said this was 'the greenest Budget yet'. He
particularly welcomed the chancellor's statement that a switch in taxation
could discourage activities which damage the environment while helping cut
the cost of employment.
But industry was less enthusiastic. Mr John Cridland, environment director
at the CBI, said that businessmen would need 'a cast-iron guarantee that
this will not add to costs'.
However, he welcomed the fact that government planned a period of
consultation before going ahead with the measure.
The National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors also took a cautious
line. 'We are not convinced that this kind of measure will necessarily
produce the promised environmental benefits,' said a spokesman.
He pointed out that recent tightening of dumping regulations had already
added to landfill costs, and any tax would come on top of that. A tax could
also encourage illegal dumping.
The UK produces about 140m tonnes of controlled waste each year of which
about 100m tonnes goes into landfill. This is a higher proportion than most
countries because the UK has relatively large landfill capacity and low
landfill costs, ranging from Pounds 3 to Pounds 10 per tonne, depending on
type.
But landfill levies have been introduced in a growing number of countries
such as Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France and Germany.
The issues for the UK are whether waste should be taxed by volume or value,
and whether toxic wastes should be more highly taxed than other types.
The level of the tax will also have to be decided, though judging by the
chancellor's remarks it would be several pounds a tonne.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Capital allowance argument rejected -
Investment measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Big industrial associations last night pledged to continue the battle for
increased capital allowances for plant and machinery in spite of the
chancellor's rejection of measures supported widely by manufacturing
industry.
Manufacturing industry had made its views explicit. It was hoping for a
Budget to stimulate permanently higher levels of investment and to improve
the UK's competitiveness.
In October, leaders of seven big industry associations wrote an open letter
to Mr Clarke urging measures to prevent 'boom and bust cycles'.
They wanted the chancellor to introduce full first-year capital allowances
for at least the first Pounds 200,000 of plant and machinery, to benefit
smaller companies.
They asked for existing capital allowances for plant and machinery to be
index-linked against inflation. And they wanted capital gains tax for
holdings of corporate equity to be reformed, introducing 'tapered rates' to
encourage investors to take a longer-term view.
But the government views a modification of allowances for plant and
machinery as a distortion of the tax structure.
The argument for increased capital allowances had a 'simplistic appeal', he
said, but would distort investment decisions and not encourage the
high-quality investment needed to improve economic performance.
The Machine Tool Technologies Association, while disappointed, said it would
continue to ask for increased capital allowances next year. It said: 'So
many other countries think it is the right way to go to stimulate
investment.'
Mr Graham Mackenzie, director-general of the Engineering Employers
Federation, said that the problem of relatively poor investment in the UK
had not gone away. He noted that the Pounds 200,000 limit in the
associations' plea was aimed particularly at helping small companies - at
which some of the Budget measures were directed.
The EEF had warned in its Budget submission of the danger that recovery from
recession would be seen as evidence that no further policy changes were
needed.
But Mr Kevin Paterson of accountants Ernst &amp; Young said it looked as if the
chancellor had decided that, with the economy coming out of recession, he
did not need to encourage investment. Measures to encourage investment would
have been important for manufacturers, he said, but also to the leasing
industry.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Unequal Scottish business rate ends - Rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-running disadvantage in non-domestic rates suffered by Scottish
businesses compared with their English counterparts is to be eliminated from
April 1 1995, with Scotland achieving a uniform business rate poundage set
at the same level as England.
Scottish business organisations welcomed the harmonisation of non-domestic
rate poundages north and south of the border, which is being achieved thanks
to movements expected in rateable values. The transition will be eased by a
Pounds 72m injection by the Treasury. It will mean the achievement of an
objective the Conservative government has been working towards since 1989.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said the average Scottish poundage would
drop by 5.3p (11 per cent) to a uniform 43.2p, the same level as that for
England. In Glasgow the poundage will drop by 9.7p and in Edinburgh by 6.6p.
Rateable values are to be revalued for the 1995-96 financial year and the
Scottish Office believes this will result in an average increase of just
less than 20 per cent in rateable values in Scotland. Little overall change
in rateable values is expected in England.
The new rateable values will be assessed on the same basis as in England.
Mr Lang said transitional arrangements would ensure that no business
suffered annual increases of more than 10 per cent, allowing for inflation.
For property with a new rateable value of less than Pounds 10,000 the
maximum real increase will be 7.5 per cent.
The transitional arrangements will be partly funded by the Pounds 72m
exchequer contribution and by limiting the reductions in bills to 10 per
cent for small businesses and 5 per cent for those with a rateable value of
more than Pounds 10,000.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Revisions expected to bring down cost - VAT
on company cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Substantial changes to the company car market, with all leased and many
purchased company cars expected to be made cheaper for employers and
potentially more attractive for employees, will be brought about by VAT
treatment revisions announced by the chancellor.
The revisions will for the first time allow the leasing companies, which
provide about 800,000 of the 2.4m company cars currently on the UK's roads,
to reclaim the 17.5 per cent VAT on their car purchases.
This should allow the leasing industry to pass on to its clients significant
cuts in rental costs. The measure, which will take effect from next August,
will cost the exchequer Pounds 140m in the first year and Pounds 100m in
1996-97.
The revisions will also allow companies buying their cars, as Mr Clarke put
it yesterday, 'wholly for business use' to reclaim the VAT on their
purchases.
It was uncertain last night what criteria would be used in deciding whether
a car had been acquired 'wholly' for business. All company-leased or
company-purchased cars are expected to qualify. However, it was understood
in the industry that where purchased cars were partly for private use, a
proportion of the VAT would be non-reclaimable, depending on the percentage
of the car user's mileage for non-business purposes. In the case of leased
cars where private use is involved, only 50 per cent of the VAT on the
leasing company's charges will be reclaimable.
One of the most significant effects of the changes will be to eliminate a
VAT 'double whammy' hitherto suffered by banks, building societies and other
financial institutions unable to reclaim VAT which has effectively kept them
out of the leased car market entirely.
'Having to pay VAT, through the rental charge, once on the purchase price of
a leased car and again on the rental company's charges has effectively
debarred the financial sector from the leasing market,' Mr Neil Pykett,
managing director of Cowie Interleasing and chairman of the accounting and
taxation committee of the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association,
said last night. 'Today's changes go a long way to remedying a situation
which has rankled with the industry for years.'
According to tentative industry estimates last night, there could be a cash
saving to a company leasing a Pounds 12,000 car wholly for business use of
about Pounds 1,100 over a three-year lease period.
From employees' point of view, the revisions can be expected to discourage
some company car users from opting for cash alternatives to cars. This is
because, in cases where the cost of their provision to employers falls, so
may the value of the cash alternative offered by employers. Alternatively,
any savings could take the form of the offer of a better car. Mr Clarke said
yesterday that the main aim of the revisions was to iron out a 'distortion'
in the new car market which has arisen since 1992 when taxi, short-term car
rental companies and driving schools were allowed to reclaim VAT on their
vehicles.
However, the issue of whether businesses should be able to reclaim all VAT
on company cars as a matter of course has become controversial.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Their Budget): The tobacconist
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Watson, 52: Bought traditional tobacconist's in Newcastle with
redundancy payment from Post Office administration job in 1990 - the last
year it made a profit. Turnover in steady decline because of 'smuggled
tobacco' brought across the Channel for personal consumption, then sold
illegally in pubs, clubs and car boot sales.
Politics: A Conservative voter, he is outraged at the government's lack of
action on this revenue-loser. May not vote in next general election.
Wanted: Expected no help from the Budget, or the government.
Said yesterday: 'I'm disappointed he hasn't been more positive about tobacco
smuggling. But I'd expected maybe a bit more tax on cigarettes. The National
Insurance holiday for taking somebody out of work for two years won't affect
me. Until they get this cross border smuggling sorted out there's no
likelihood I will be able to employ anybody. Will it make me more likely to
vote Conservative next time? No, I don't think so. There's just something
not right with them at the moment.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Cigarette tax rises but beer stays put -
Tobacco/Drink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor yesterday fulfilled his commitment to a 3 per cent real
increase in tax on tobacco to support the government's aim of reducing
smoking.
From 6pm last night, tax on each packet of 20 cigarettes rose by 10p and the
chancellor promised that duty on other tobacco products would rise by a
similar proportion.
However, the tax on beer, table wine and spirits was left unchanged as the
chancellor responded to complaints from the drinks industry about duties and
the increase in cross-Channel shopping and smuggling.
The chancellor reduced the duty on fortified wine by 13p per bottle and on
sparkling wine by 27p to bring the two duties into line with each other.
Mr Kenneth Clarke's action on beer was largely expected as a Treasury select
committee last week rejected a call by brewers for beer duty to be halved to
curb cross-Channel imports.
In his speech, Mr Clarke said cross-border shopping and smuggling had 'meant
a loss of duty to the exchequer'. He said that 'no chancellor can remain
unmoved in the face of this, but neither can any chancellor simply adopt
popular measures to cut taxes on alcohol that would threaten the revenue'.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Motorists 'treated like wallets on wheels'
 -Driving costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Motorists were a prime target in the Budget with significant increases in
real terms in duty on petrol and diesel and with a further rise in vehicle
excise duty for cars.
The average price of a gallon of unleaded petrol will rise by about 11p to
Pounds 2.45.
The Automobile Association condemned the chancellor's decision to add 2.5p
to a litre of petrol and 3p to the price of a litre of diesel.
Mr Clarke said that he was sticking to the government's commitment of a year
ago to increase road fuel duties on average by at least 5 per cent in real
terms. The rise, which took effect last night, was 'an important part of the
government's strategy to return carbon dioxide emissions to their 1990 level
in the year 2000', Mr Clarke said.
However this was attacked last night by motoring organisations. 'Increasing
fuel duty by 5 per cent as an 'environmental incentive' is a sham, while the
chancellor continues to increase vehicle excise duty, which is an antiquated
tax on ownership that does nothing for the environment,' the AA said.
It estimated last night that the average motorist's costs would increase by
about Pounds 40 a year with petrol costs jumping by Pounds 35 a year and the
cost of the tax disc rising by Pounds 5 a year to Pounds 135.
'Yet again Britain's 20m motorists have been treated like wallets on wheels
. . . Drivers deserved a tax holiday after shouldering 1993's swingeing 24
per cent increase in fuel costs and 18 per cent increase in vehicle excise
duty, but we have been clobbered again.'
The chancellor also closed the differential between the duty on diesel and
unleaded petrol, by raising the duty on diesel by about 3p a litre.
The vehicle excise duty for trucks is being left unchanged, but the increase
in diesel fuel duty will hit the road haulage sector.
The Freight Transport Association estimated that this would increase
industry's costs by Pounds 250m-Pounds 300m a year.
The government is planning to reform the vehicle excise duty system by
introducing 'continuous licensing', which will tax possession rather than
use of a vehicle. A consultation paper is to be issued.
Motorists such as classic car owners, who did not pay vehicle excise duty
now because their cars were genuinely off the road, would not be
disadvantaged, he said.
Mr Clarke said the move was designed to combat evasion and to help fight
crime by enabling the police accurately to check the ownership of vehicles.
New powers are also to be proposed allowing vehicles parked on public roads
without a valid tax disc to be wheel-clamped.
Vehicle excise duty is expected to raise Pounds 3.7bn in 1994-95.
Separately the system of concessions and exemptions from vehicle excise duty
is to be simplified and modernised with the number of different
concessionary classes to be reduced from 132 to nine.
Around 75 per cent of those vehicles currently receiving special treatment
will pay no more duty, and emergency vehicles, disabled drivers and most
tractors will be unaffected. Rates on some categories such as recovery, road
construction and street cleansing and lighting vehicles could rise steeply
by more than Pounds 4,000, but increases in the first year will be limited
to no more than Pounds 1,000.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Drinkers gain respite while smokers suffer
 -Alcohol and tobacco
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The chancellor yesterday fulfilled his commitment to a 3 per cent real
increase in tax on tobacco to support the government's aim of reducing
smoking.
From 6pm last night, tax on each packet of 20 cigarettes rose by 10p and the
chancellor promised that duty on other tobacco products would rise by a
similar proportion.
However, the tax on alcohol was left unchanged as the chancellor responded
to complaints from the drinks industry about duties and the increase in
cross-Channel shopping and smuggling.
The chancellor's action on beer was largely expected as a Treasury select
committee last week rejected a call by brewers for beer duty to be halved to
curb cross-Channel imports and stimulate UK sales.
In his speech Mr Kenneth Clarke said cross-border shopping and smuggling had
'meant a loss of duty to the exchequer'.
He said that 'no chancellor can remain unmoved in the face of this but
neither can any chancellor simply adopt popular measures to cut taxes on
alcohol that would threaten the revenue and require taxes on other goods to
be raised'.
Last night the drinks industry was sceptical about Mr Clarke's claim that he
would campaign for higher duties throughout Europe. Mr Robin Simpson,
director of the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association, said: 'Frankly,
other European countries are not going to raise their beer duties to solve a
UK problem.'
Carlsberg Tetley said that 15 per cent of all beer drunk at home in Britain
was bought on the Continent. 'The differential is too huge and needs
something more drastic than just leaving the tax alone,' said a spokesman.
Mr Peter Lewis, director of the Wine and Spirits Association said: ' . . .
cross-border shopping remains a threat to the pub, off-licence and
supermarket trade.'
However, Mr Tony Greener, chairman of Guinness, the largest spirits company,
said: 'We are satisfied with the chancellor's decision not to increase the
duty on alcoholic drinks. We welcome the chancellor's promise to support the
industry when he enters negotiations on European excise duties.'
The tobacco industry was disappointed in Mr Clarke's decision to raise tax
on cigarettes. The Tobacco Manufacturers Association said: 'Tonight the
bootleggers will be celebrating with a bottle of bootlegged champagne and
lighting up a smuggled cigar.'
Mr Paul Mason, an independent retailer in Southampton and spokesman for the
Tobacco Alliance, said: 'The chancellor has put another nail in the
corner-shop's coffin.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Cover for directors granted relief -
Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insurance bought by companies to protect directors and employees against the
cost of legal actions arising in the course of their work will no longer be
taxed as a benefit in kind, the Inland Revenue announced yesterday.
The proposals, which are expected to come into effect from April at an
annual cost of about Pounds 40m, are likely to be welcomed by many
companies.
The Association of Insurance and Risk Managers had lobbied for tax relief on
such directors' and officers' liability and professional indemnity insurance
policies. The association argued these policies were a necessary business
expense and, as litigation against company directors becomes more common,
were increasingly important.
The proposals would remove the charge to tax on employees when employers pay
for employees' liability insurance or meet work-related uninsured
liabilities. They would also give relief for employees' expenditure on
liability insurance and work-related uninsured liabilities.
Uninsured liabilities will only be allowed relief when they could have been
insured against.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Premiums cut for projects with high risk -
Exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor yesterday threw further support behind Britain's export drive
by announcing improvements in the terms and cover provided by the Export
Credits Guarantee Department.
Premiums charged by the ECGD for political risk will be reduced from
December 12 by an average of 10 per cent. Rates for some markets that have
recently re-established their creditworthiness will be cut even more deeply,
and by more than 20 per cent for Argentina, Brazil, the Philippines, Egypt
and Vietnam.
As an example, the government said the premium for a typical project in
India would fall from 5 per cent to 3.75 per cent.
The government also plans to increase, to Pounds 3.5bn in 1997-98, ECGD
cover for so-called amber zone markets, where risk is either unusually high
or where the ECGD's exposure is most highly concentrated. Amber zone markets
include China, India, South Africa and Indonesia.
The figure is Pounds 300m higher than the level of cover agreed for 1996-97
and Pounds 800m above that available in 1993-94. It brings to Pounds 10bn
the total amount of ECGD cover available in the next three years for exports
for amber zone markets.
'These measures will provide an added incentive for British exporters to
play an even greater role in the most successful and rapidly growing
economies in the world,' Mr Clarke said.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the changes would
boost the competitiveness of British exporters.
This is the third consecutive Budget in which ECGD premiums have been
reduced. The cuts represent a victory for sustained lobbying by the
Department of Trade and Industry and UK exporters over resistance by the
Treasury.
Exporters have long argued that premiums for high-risk markets were
substantially above those charged by export credit agencies in other
European countries, though rates for lower risks are generally more
competitive.
However, the government warned that ECGD political risk premiums for Mexico,
Colombia, Zimbabwe and Slovakia will rise from the end of March, when
temporary rate-capping arrangements introduced for these markets in the last
Budget are due to expire.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Simpler VAT system among small business
proposals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Proposals to bring the national insurance and income tax systems into closer
alignment, to simplify the VAT system and allow more companies to pay tax
quarterly were among Budget measures aimed at small businesses in
particular.
The package was given a qualified reception by the Federation of Small
Businesses which described the Budget as offering a 'useful range of
measures'.
The Treasury will consult with traders on proposals to allow small
businesses to move to annual VAT returns and payments.
Ministers are also considering simplifying the VAT system for some traders
to link payments to turnover, rather than details of sales and purchases.
Mr Kenneth Clarke said simply running PAYE and national insurance systems
was difficult for many small businesses - as well as imposing a cost and
administrative burden.
From April, clearances given by the Inland Revenue concerning non-taxable
expenses will also count for national insurance purposes, the chancellor
announced.
Mr Clarke's decision to increase by 30 per cent the threshold below which
businesses can account quarterly, rather than monthly, for PAYE and national
insurance contributions, was welcomed by small businesses.
But there were warnings that the chancellor's proposals would not ease the
administrative cost of keeping tax records. The proposal is expected to
benefit about 100,000 employers.
The Treasury also said that it wanted to improve the administration of the
tax system by encouraging a closer working relationship between the two
revenue raising departments - the Inland Revenue and Customs &amp; Excise.
Mr Clarke also announced an increase in the VAT registration threshold from
Pounds 45,000 to Pounds 46,000.
Mrs Mavis Sargent, chairman of the Chartered Association of Certified
Accountants' tax committee, said: 'The extension of payment of PAYE on a
quarterly basis and the move towards aligning income tax and national
insurance are steps in the right direction, but they are too tentative.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Business gives broad welcome to
'deregulatory measures' - Industrial reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Industrial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor's pledge to deliver a 'strong and thriving business economy'
while keeping a tight reign on public spending was taken on trust by much of
British industry yesterday.
But while there was a broad welcome for his package of 'tax relief and
deregulatory measures', there was some grumbling over particulars. There was
disappointment, for instance, that Mr Clarke had refused to increase capital
allowances as a way of boosting investment further.
Mr Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said the Budget 'scored well' by keeping tight control of public spending
and borrowing and holding interest rates down as a basis for sustained
economic growth.
Mr Davies welcomed the chancellor's 'imaginative measures' for the long-term
unemployed, particularly the reductions in national insurance contributions,
and the extension of in-work benefits. Both measures are in line with CBI
recommendations.
At the Engineering Employers' Federation, which groups many companies hit by
the recession, director-general Mr Graham Mackenzie expressed delight with
the chancellor's plan to get people back to work through national insurance
'holidays' for employers taking on people from the unemployed register. In
an early detailed estimate of what it could mean for the shop floor, the EEF
estimates that on an average engineering salary of Pounds 17,000, the NI
'holiday' could allow an employer to invest approximately Pounds 1,700 a
year on retraining.
The EEF also said that the international competitive support which it had
been seeking had been met in part by the cut in export insurance premiums
and enhanced terms for export insurance for developing markets.
The usually more hawkish Institute of Directors welcomed the chancellor's
focus on the transition from unemployment to work. However, its head of
policy Dr Ann Robinson said Mr Clarke had not gone far enough in effecting a
much broader reduction in NI contribution rates and employment regulation.
'It's a missed opportunity. . . it's just bits of tinkering without getting
to the heart of the problem.'
Along with other organisations representing manufacturers, the Machine Tool
Technologies Association's positive response to several measures was
overshadowed by disappointment that a campaign for increased capital
allowances failed.
It said the chancellor had missed a valuable opportunity to take decisive
steps to tackle the UK's structurally low levels of manufacturing
investment. Elsewhere, it welcomed lower export insurance premiums, and
proposals for handling corporate insolvencies - although it pointed out that
these would have been more significant if they had been introduced in 1991.
The Chemicals Industries Association broadly welcomed the Budget's emphasis
on job creation and the control of public spending.
But it expressed concern about a proposed tax on waste disposal in landfills
and the likely increase in business rates in the north of England where many
of its members have manufacturing sites.
Mr Ronnie Hampel, ICI's chief executive said that the measures to help
industry were 'understandably limited'. He added that he was 'disappointed
the chancellor did not see scope to provide greater incentives for
productive investment'.
In the information technology sector, Mr Javaid Aziz, chief executive of the
UK subsidiary of International Business Machines, was encouraged by a budget
which he thought would stimulate investment: 'The government is firmly
committed to a trend reduction in its borrowing. This means that interest
rates will not rise as much as they might.' The motor industry was 'pleased'
that the chancellor was continuing to seek to maintain stability in the
economy with sustainable growth. Vauxhall said that it was a 'steady as she
goes budget', and it left its forecast for the UK new car market unchanged
for 1994 at 1.9m, an increase of 6.9 per cent, and 2m for 1995.
The computing services business expects to benefit from measures to help
small and medium-sized companies, while the introduction of electronics
methods to pay social security benefits at Post Office represents a Pounds
300m opportunity for the industry.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Mixed reaction to finance initiative -
Contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Industrial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The announcement of ambitious targets for the government's private finance
initiative prompted a mixture of hope and scepticism in financial and civil
engineering circles.
Contracts for some Pounds 5bn private sector investment are expected to be
placed next year, said Mr Clarke.
His remarks confirmed the government's commitment to its private finance
initiative, but indicated the long lead times which are necessary to get
large projects off the ground.
Industry and City sources said they were disappointed that no new schemes
were announced yesterday.
The catalogue of schemes proposed to be placed this year was described by
some construction companies bidding for the projects as 'old hat' and little
more than a 'wish list'.
There had been hopes that the chancellor would give the go-ahead for at
least one light rail scheme and for additional road schemes to be financed
and built by the private sector. None was forthcoming.
'It was encouraging that the chancellor devoted 10 minutes to the private
finance initiative so early on in his speech but surprising that no new
specific projects were mentioned,' said Mr Richard Millward, director
responsible for the initiative at merchant bankers Kleinwort Benson.
The only scheme where progress seems imminent is the modernisation of the
rolling stock for London Underground's Northern Line, valued at about Pounds
400m plus a further Pounds 300m if long-term maintenance is included in the
contract. Dr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, will announce a decision
on the award of a contract 'very soon,' Mr Clarke said.
The chancellor assured his listeners yesterday that 'significant progress'
had been made on the transport schemes referred to in last year's budget:
the Pounds 600m modernisation of the west-coast main-line railway; a new
Pounds 200m air traffic control centre for Scotland; and a Pounds 100m
extension of the Docklands Light Railway south to Lewisham.
Studies are going on into the detail of the west-coast modernisation and
bids are to be sought from the private sector for the Docklands extension
and the Scottish air traffic centre. But the construction industry, rolling
stock manufacturers and potential users are impatient for work to start and
this is likely to take some time.
'We have succeeded in developing a massive portfolio of work in progress,'
said Mr Douglas Hogg, a member of the Private Finance Panel's executive
committee. 'We will be working on this over the next six to nine months but
it is just too early to expect anything yet. These projects involve long
lead times.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Big business gives its verdict
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Andrew Buxton
chairman, Barclays Bank
'It was a low-key but constructive Budget with plenty of encouragement for
small businesses and the unemployed.
It was clear that with the economy set fair he did not want to upset the
apple cart.
The transitional relief for business rates will be particularly welcome news
for small firms.
His PSBR predictions are in line with current CBI forecasts and if he can
get us in balance in three years' time then it will have been a great
achievement and may even allow for some tax-cutting measures at the end of
next year. All this is against the backdrop of a stable, low-inflation
environment.'
*****
Peter Jarvis
chief executive, Whitbread
'I am delighted the chancellor has held duty rates for a second year and has
recognised the cross-Channel problem.
However, he cannot rely on European action and will need to go further by
actually cutting rates unless he wants to see pubs closing all over the
country.'
Simon Ward, Whitbread's strategic affairs director, said: 'The cross-Channel
issue is not going to go away. It won't be easy to convince the French to
raise their duty rates. I don't see why they should hike their rates just to
please the UK government in what is a self-imposed problem. We would have
preferred the chancellor to reduce the rate of beer duty to that more in
line with current French levels - 5p a pint, compared with over 30p in the
UK.'
*****
Sir Brian Pearse
chairman, Lucas
'Companies such as ours have worked extremely hard through the recession to
improve global competitiveness.
We welcome this 'steady as she goes' Budget that should enable us to
continue this improvement in the UK and overseas.
However, we are disappointed with the apparent erosion of the differential
on duties on diesel and unleaded petrol because of the proven economic and
environmental advantages of diesel.
Overall, the Budget strengthens our quiet confidence in the future. We were
hoping the chancellor would not treat this year as one for dramatic changes.
We wanted minimum interference from the chancellor and that is what has
happened.'
*****
Sir Lawrie Barratt
chairman, Barratt Developments
'Unfortunately the chancellor has not announced any measures to stimulate
the UK housing market.
The market had been improving until September's half point interest rate
rise. This increase was totally unnecessary and I believe the chancellor
should have taken the opportunity to reverse this interest rate rise . . .
and restore housebuyers' confidence.
Furthermore, nothing was done for the 10m homeowners with mortgages who have
suffered so greatly in recent years as their mortgage tax relief has been
eroded. This erosion has had a damaging effect on the UK housing market.
All in all, I think the government should accept that a strong and stable
housing market is crucial to the recovery of the economy in general.'

Ian Prosser
chairman, Bass
'There were no particular surprises in the Budget, although I was
disappointed that the chancellor did not reduce beer duty and that he felt
it necessary to impose gaming licence duty on amusement machines.
However, I am glad that he recognised the cross-Channel problem and that he
will address the issue with our European counterparts. I hope they will
listen.
Given the strength of the economy, I hope he will have the flexibility to
cut excise duty rates next year.
Overall, however, the chancellor's priorities were correct and I would agree
with his objective of sustaining strong UK economic growth through
investment and exports.'
*****
Sir Trevor Chinn
chairman, Lex Services
'The Budget message from the chancellor to industry was that the economy is
now heading in the right direction.
It was a 'steady as she goes' Budget and he is absolutely right to pursue a
low-inflation economy as the fruits of this will eventually feed through
into increased consumer expenditure.
This will obviously help industry and benefit businesses like our own.
His move to reduce VAT on leased cars seems to be favourable to our own
particular industry, although it is impossible to quantify its impact at
this stage.'
*****
David Simon
chief executive, BP Group
'This is a Budget which should please business. It is broadly
revenue-neutral and it proposes no changes that would jeopardise steady
recovery and the continuing squeeze on inflation.
It demonstrates that public expenditure is clearly under control and sound
fiscal and monetary policy is in place. Additional support for UK exporters
will help continued growth.
The strength of UK companies in export markets is a very encouraging feature
of current performance in the economy.
The chancellor's measures to promote the success of small companies and to
encourage recruitment of the long-term unemployed are also helpful.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Video and quiz games hit by tax extension -
Amusement machine licence duty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There will be a few long faces at today's annual general meeting of the
British Amusement Catering Trades Association (Bacta) - the trade
association for the coin-operated and amusement machine industry - in
Birmingham after the chancellor's decision to extend the scope of the gaming
machine licence duty to video and quiz machines.
Mr Alan Willis, general secretary of Bacta, said: 'This will be a severe
blow to a lot of small and family-run operators.'
Mr Clarke proposes that from November 1 1995 the operators of these machines
will have to pay a licence fee of Pounds 250 a year per machine. He
increased licence duty on gaming machines already taxed, such as jackpot
machines.
The chancellor hopes that the renamed Amusement Machine Licence Duty (AMLD)
will raise an extra Pounds 60m a year, in addition to the Pounds 100m that
gaming duty already raises.
The newly covered machines include the 75,000 video arcade games and the
20,000 trivia and quiz machines in Britain.
Mr Clarke added: 'I am sure that this measure will be welcomed by parents,
although maybe not by children.'
Revenue from the newly covered machines is expected to be Pounds 10m in
1995-96 and Pounds 30m in a full year. The chancellor did not extend the tax
to the 75,000 pool tables, 35,000 juke boxes, 30,000 pin-ball machines and
25,000 children's rides.
The licence duty on small-prize gaming machines, which have a maximum payout
per play of Pounds 3 cash, is to be increased by 19 per cent to Pounds 535 a
year per machine from Pounds 450.
The duty per machine on jackpot machines, which have a money prize of up to
Pounds 200, will rise to Pounds 13,075 a year from Pounds 11,050, up 18 per
cent. These increases will come into effect on December 1.
The duty was last increased in the March 1993 Budget by 20 per cent. The
chancellor argues that this increase restores the duty to the same value in
real terms as in 1987.
Mr Russell Smith, chief executive of Kunick, one of the three biggest
amusement machine operators along with Rank Organisation and Bass, said:
'Although the new duties are of a relatively small amount, they could have a
big repercussion for a lot of manufacturers and smaller operators.
'A lot of pubs are struggling and many small pubs are teetering on the edge.
This will be another blow for them.' He added that only 10 per cent of
Kunick's amusement machine business would be affected by the new tax.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Incentives aim to boost private investment
 -Venture capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new investment vehicle designed to encourage up to Pounds 2.5bn of private
investment in unquoted companies was greeted with enthusiasm by venture
capitalists as a measure that could substantially increase the flow of
capital to small companies.
The tax incentives attached to the Venture Capital Investment Trusts went
significantly further than most venture capitalists expected.
The chancellor did not, however, raise the maximum size of any single
investment that the Venture Capital Trust managers will be able to make
beyond the Pounds 1m level set in a consultative document published earlier
this year.
Investors will be able to claim 20 per cent up-front income tax relief on
the purchase of shares in the trusts. But they will also be able to roll
over capital gains realised through the sale of almost any other asset which
are then re-invested in the Venture Capital Trust (VCT) shares.
While this latter relief is in effect only a deferral of a capital gains tax
liability, the effect of the two incentives is to make up to 60 per cent of
any investment in the Venture Capital trust shares eligible for some form of
tax relief.
Investors will be limited to investments of Pounds 100,000 a year and the
trusts will not be able to invest in property companies.
Any capital gains or dividends made on the venture capital trust shares will
also be free of tax, giving the Venture Capital Trusts a status equivalent
to Personal Equity Plans.
Mr Michael Walton, managing director of Gartmore Venture Capital, said the
chancellor had 'really pushed the boat out' in an effort to attract
investors. The only constraint would be on finding investment opportunities.
Many venture capital houses that might consider launching venture capital
trusts will not have focused before on making investments as small as Pounds
1m and in companies with less than Pounds 10m in assets, as the trust rules
require.
Mr John Orpen, partner at accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said the measures
would bring investment in private companies within the grasp of many
ordinary investors.
The chancellor also extended capital gains tax roll-over relief to the
Enterprise Scheme which replaced the Business Expansion Scheme last December
but which has attracted very little investor interest.
The chancellor is understood to be particularly enthusiastic about the
potential for Venture Capital Trusts to attract private equity into dynamic
smaller companies that do not have access to capital markets and may not
have enough security to raise bank debt. He believes these companies are
crucial in the drive to increase the pace of job creation.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Faint praise from professionals - City
reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Financial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boring, predictable, gratifyingly unexciting - a Budget with less immediate
impact than any other in recent memory.
These were some of the reactions to the Budget from insurance companies,
accountancy firms, banks, building societies and institutional investors
yesterday.
Insurers regarded the Budget as broadly neutral. But there was relief that
Mr Clarke decided against any increase in the new Insurance Premium Tax
which came into effect in October.
'Anything at all which means premiums don't have to go up is a good thing,'
said the Association of British Insurers.
Competition in the sector means prices for many insurance products are
falling, and insurers would have been under pressure to absorb rises in IPT
above the current 2.5 per cent on gross premiums.
The association also said the encouragement the chancellor had offered for
home-owners to buy mortgage protection insurance would offer opportunities
for insurance companies.
Royal Insurance, one of the UK's largest composite insurers, described the
budget as 'part strategic, part pragmatic'. It said the decision on IPT was
'not unexpected' given that the tax had only recently been introduced. It
still expects the Treasury to increase the amount it raises from the tax
over the longer term.
Essentially good economically but disappointing on taxation, was the
reaction of Mr Ian Barlow, head of tax at KPMG Peat Marwick.
'The Budget confirmed that we are taking a sound approach and that is great
stuff. But in terms of tax the approach is very timid. Apart from being very
good on savings, on Peps and so on, it was also good on Venture Capital
Trusts which looks very attractive,' he said.
But Mr Barlow said he was 'very disappointed at the weasel words on merging
National Insurance and PAYE. I suspect that he has been fobbed off by his
officials.'
The Chancellor also appeared 'to have a penchant for new taxes and we saw a
new one with landfill,' he added.
Mr Andrew Jones, a tax partner at Ernst and Young, said the Budget was 'a
lot of talk for not very much change. Lets wait and see what the next 12
months brings. I have been watching budgets for 27 years and I can't
remember one with so little immediate impact.'
Mr Clive Standford, of Touche Ross, said:'Most of the changes appear to be
on the small business side - concentrating on attempts at deregulation and
simplification and help for cashflow which we can see in several areas. But
for big business there is not much at all.
Mr Standford said that several moves would make money more available for
small businesses: 'But it is tinkering at the edges.'
'No surprises,' was the instant conclusion of institutional shareholders.
'Boring, boring, boring,' was the reaction of a leading life insurance
investor. Overall, they said it will make little impact on the way they
allocate assets both between different classes and geographically.
However, investors said the tone of the Budget, with its lower than expected
forecast of the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement, is encouraging,
particularly for future investment in gilts.
'It makes us a little more confident in the gilts market,' said Mr Paul
Manduca, chief executive of Threadneedle Asset Management, the investment
management division of BAT industries, noting that the fund has already been
increasing its gilts purchases.
Mr Brian Davis, chief executive of Nationwide Building Society, the UK's
second largest, said that in general the Budget was tinkering at the edges
in terms of the continued delivery of economic growth.
'Mr Clarke obviously believes the continuing growth is sustainable, I hope
he's right,' he said. He added, however, that if the government were really
confident more people would be in employment, then it would not have needed
to cut some benefit entitlements. 'He seems to have hedged his bets.'
Mr Alan Davies, chief economist of Barclays Bank, said: 'There is absolutely
nothing there that wasn't predictable. Perhaps that is how things should be.
The Budget was gratifyingly unexciting. What I want to see is a budget that
is boring in the sense of being an exercise in book-keeping.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (The Economy): Suitably modest chancellor fails to
take the plunge - Alternative view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD HOLTHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Clarke was suitably modest in presentation of his Budget. He aimed, he
said, to avoid the usual transition 'from illusory boom to painful bust'.
Rather he wanted the UK 'to become a powerful manufacturing and industrial
economy'.
That is normal language from a new government but is positively confessional
coming from a politician whose party has been in office for 15 years.
No one expected fireworks in the Budget, certainly not in its big
macro-economic numbers. The PSBR for this year was slightly higher than
expected but the chancellor made up for that by promising deficits in the
next and subsequent years at the low end of City expectations. Mr Clarke's
micro-measures were also something of a damp squib.
That is a pity because many of them went in the right direction. Instead of
plunging, Mr Clarke confined himself to dipping a number of toes in the
water.
He introduced a full National Insurance rebate for one year for employees
taking on one of the long-term unemployed, although only from April 1996.
That has been proposed quite widely recently, notably by Labour's Commission
on Social Justice. The commission also proposed another couple of measures
that Mr Clarke adopted or extended.
First was the worktrial scheme whereby unemployed people are paid benefit
for the first three weeks of employment instead of normal wages  - and
therefore cost the employer nothing. The commission had proposed that the
next month should be free to the employer as well, although the chancellor
did not take that suggestion up.
The second proposal picked up by Mr Clarke is a tax-free back-to-work bonus.
There was no sign, however, of other commission proposals, namely
substantial direct subsidies to employment - which could be justified by the
cost of having people out of work - nor benefit transfer schemes, which
would allow the long-term unemployed to transfer part or all of their income
support or unemployment payment to an employer in exchange for a job.
There is, of course, a reason for the chancellor's reticence about bolder
schemes of that sort, which goes beyond mere conservatism. There is a risk
of employers 'churning' their less-skilled workers in order to take
advantage of such benefits.
But if inadequate incentives to workers are as big a problem as the costs to
employers, it is clear that such schemes would work best with a minimum
wage.
That would prevent employers simply transferring employment costs to the
state with little or no benefit to workers. Since the minimum wage is part
of Conservative demonology it is harder for the chancellor to contemplate
such measures.
While Mr Clarke's speech was notably lacking in financial detail, his
employment-boosting measures therefore appear to be small-scale palliatives
rather than a radical attack on tax/benefit disincentives to employment.
Similarly, measures to improve Family Credit look small against the needs.
Hopes that there would be a substantial extension of credits for childcare
were not fulfilled and there was even less sign of an attack on benefit
traps.
It is hard to believe that unemployment has really registered as a problem
with the government at a visceral level in view of its response.
That scepticism is reinforced by Mr Clarke's remarks on investment
incentives. In extolling the cuts to corporation tax and investment
allowances by Lord Lawson when chancellor, Mr Clarke declared that the
changes had been a great success and increasing allowances would 'distort
investment decisions'.
Evidently that line of his speech was drafted by a Treasury economist
working from the textbook model of an economy at full employment, and
probably a closed economy at that.
In a world of unemployment, the government should want as much employment
and value-added as it can get in the UK.
Unemployment creates a divergence between social and private-company
benefit. A few 'distortions' to the investment decision are then needed to
encourage domestic investment - as most other countries are clearly aware.
Levelling our playing field while others tilt theirs is asinine. The
situation is even more extraordinary in that British companies can borrow to
invest wherever they like and the interest payments are tax deductible. The
government seems positively to encourage foreign investment at the expense
of domestic.
Among the measures that the chancellor did announce to encourage
'investment' was an extraordinary 20 per cent up-front income tax relief on
investment in venture capital trusts. Dividends and capital gains of such
trusts are also to be tax-free. Peps and Tessas are also to continue.
This is an amazing collection of tax loopholes. The experience with Peps and
the notorious Business Expansion Scheme is that they provided tax shelters
without having any perceptible effect either on the reported ability of
small businesspeople to obtain finance or on the level of investment in
industry.
To give a tax break of this sort to relatively wealthy savers when tax on
simple bank accounts is withheld at source and the illusory inflation
element in interest payments is taxed too is extremely discriminatory.
It also sits oddly with Mr Clarke's claim that he would recoup Pounds 1.5bn
over the next few years by closing tax loopholes. These little gadgets, he
explained, in his bluff way, did not count as tax loopholes. Nonetheless,
there are better ways to spend the money.
Another gesture in the direction of more radical measures was Mr Clarke's
new tax on landfill in 1996. This is an eminently sensible example of a
'green' tax that if properly levied should discourage excessively wasteful
packaging and the recycling of materials.
To link the putative revenues to a further reduction in employers' National
Insurance contributions is more than a nod in the direction of European
Commission - and Opposition - proposals to replace labour taxes with taxes
on environmental baddies.
Time will tell if the government has any serious intentions in this
direction or whether this is another example of a mere gesture towards
virtue.
Mr Clarke concluded by promising a PSBR down to Pounds 13bn in 1996-97 and
Pounds 5bn in 1997-98. No-one believes it - almost certainly not Mr Clarke
himself, who hinted at tax cuts to come. A 20p basic rate, or somesuch,
would keep the PSBR around or north of Pounds 20bn.
Something like that will be needed in 1996 to retrieve the government's
fortunes - if anything can.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (The Economy): Borrowing to fall sharply despite
real spending rise - PSBR outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Budget announced a much more rapid reduction in the public sector
borrowing requirement than its predecessor, from Pounds 34.4bn this year to
only Pounds 5bn in three years.
Lower than expected inflation explains the bulk of the improvement in the
public sector finances. Mr Kenneth Clarke's first Budget predicted a PSBR of
Pounds 38bn in 1994-5, falling to Pounds 12bn by 1997-8.
The chancellor promised that lower inflation would not be allowed simply to
translate into a higher volume of spending in the years ahead. But low
inflation does appear to have made it difficult for the government to
maintain the 1.3 per cent real reduction in government spending in 1994-5
aimed for 12 months ago. Although falling in nominal terms, the public
spending total will actually rise by 1.4 per cent in real terms in 1994-5.
The Treasury is predicting much of this year's real spending increase will
be clawed back in 1995-6, when spending is projected to fall by 0.8 per cent
in real terms. This will be followed by real increases of 1/2 per cent and 1
per cent respectively, in 1996-7 and 1997-8.
Achieving these targets would imply that spending would rise at less than 3
per cent a year in nominal terms over the next three years, or by 0.25 per
cent per annum in real terms.
Most economists had expected Mr Clarke to announce a rapid medium-term
reduction in the PSBR than he predicted a year ago. Yet the prediction of a
budget surplus will raise speculation that tax rates will be lowered in the
next few years.
The cumulative effect of the reduced cash spending totals announced
yesterday is that overall spending in 1997-98 will be Pounds 9bn lower than
predicted a year ago, at Pounds 272bn.
The Treasury's lower forecasts for future inflation will eventually mean
that tax receipts will be lower than previously forecast. By 1998, general
government receipts are expected to be Pounds 8.5bn below the level
predicted last year.
The overall effect of lower inflation, however, is positive, because of the
scope for lower cash spending totals. This year's fall in unemployment also
contributed, by reducing the cost of social security.
The faster reduction in the level of the PSBR means that the Treasury now
expects net public sector debt as a percentage of GDP to peak at 42.75 per
cent in 1996, falling to 36.75 per cent by the end of the century.
The Treasury pointed out that the new forecasts implied the UK would meet
the EU's excessive deficit procedure by 1996-97. The general government
deficit is then expected to be 2.25 per cent, below the 3 per cent of GDP
laid down in the Maastricht treaty. (
The new medium-term spending plans show general government expenditure
(GGE), excluding privatisation proceeds, declining over time as a share of
GDP.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (The Economy): City welcomes bond market
liberalisation - Gilts repo plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor cheered UK government bond market participants yesterday when
he unveiled plans to further liberalise the trading of gilt-edged
securities.
The announcement of the intention to establish an open market for gilt sale
and repurchase agreements - 'repos' - was warmly welcomed, though widely
expected.
Changing the rules will bring the UK market more into line with practice in
many other big government bond markets. It will scrap the requirement that
stock can only be lent or borrowed through one of eight stock exchange money
brokers. It will also abolish the rule restricting the borrowing of gilts to
registered market makers and discount houses.
Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International, said: 'It is
exactly what the market wanted to see - long-term, I think it will be
beneficial for the gilt market.'
The Bank of England said the steps 'should enhance the liquidity and
efficiency of the gilt market, increase demand for gilts, and thereby reduce
the overall interest cost over time to the government and the taxpayer'.
However, the details of the proposed system have yet to be hammered out. The
Bank of England said it hoped for an 'intensive period' of discussion over a
consultative paper it issued yesterday. The Bank is seeking comments on the
paper from market participants by January 31, 1995. It said that the new
system could not possibly start before July 1995.
Following a spate of highly publicised problems in the US repo market in the
early 1980s, the bank decided at the time of Big Bang in 1986 that it was
easier to supervise stock lending by insisting that brokers were used. In
the paper yesterday, it said it was satisfied 'that the prudential problems
initially experienced in repo markets in other countries can be addressed'.
A repo is, essentially, a loan agreement between two parties in which bonds
act as collateral. The institution which owns the bonds sells them to the
counterparty and in return receives cash. At a set date in the future, the
original bond owner agrees to buy back the bonds for a set sum. The buy-back
sum will be higher than the original cash amount, the difference reflecting
the rate of interest on the loan.
In theory, both parties can gain from this transaction. The original bond
owner raises money at a cheaper rate than by borrowing without using
collateral. Meanwhile, the lender receives interest at a better rate than by
just depositing the cash with a bank, and has the comfort of the bonds as
security for the loan.
However, there remain risks: Mellon Bank of the US announced this week a
Dollars 130m charge to cover investment losses of customers after the fall
in US bond prices this year.
Government bond markets in other countries, including the US, France and
Germany, already have well-developed repo facilities. But although London
has long been the European centre of non-dollar repo business, the sterling
sector has lagged behind its international competitors.
In the consultative document, the Bank said the proposed changes would make
it easier for a broader group of investors to 'short' gilts, without using
futures or options markets. It said evidence did not support fears that the
liberalisation would increase gilt market volatility. The proposed changes
would also extend the sterling money markets, by in effect creating a new
money market instrument.
The chancellor said in the Budget that an open repo facility 'should improve
both liquidity and efficiency, reducing yields and hence the government's
debt interest costs . . . Each reduction in yields of one basis point will
eventually save more than Pounds 25m a year of public expenditure.'
The Bank said that changes to taxation arrangements 'might be required to
facilitate the efficient functioning of a repo market.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (The Economy): Fear of rate rises subdues PSBR joy

<TEXT>
The financial markets gave an unenthusiastic response to yesterday's Budget.
Traders welcomed the the reduction in public borrowing but the good news was
tempered by fears of interest rate rises and future tax cuts, our Financial
Staff writes.
UK government bonds fell by more than  1/2 a point on the day, while the
FT-SE index was up 14 points to close at 3061.1, although equity prices fell
marginally after the Budget announcement.
On the currency markets sterling showed little response to the budget,
rising half a pfennig to DM2.4550 after the speech, before stabilising.
Sterling lost ground against the dollar, which was buoyed by renewed
speculation of higher US interest rates.
Yesterday evening it was trading at Dollars 1.5630, compared with Dollars
1.5680 before the release of US consumer confidence figures and the Budget
speech.
Traders were disappointed by the Chancellor's forecast that public sector
borrowing for the current financial year would be Pounds 34.5bn, higher than
many analysts had expected.
However, the PSBR downward revision for 1995/96 to Pounds 21.5bn from the
current estimate of Pounds 28bn was welcomed, as were significant reductions
for the two subsequent years.
Mr Robert Barrie, economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the securities house,
said: 'By 1998-99 there will effectively be a balanced budget. That has to
be good news for the gilts market.'
Mr Barrie said the Budget marked a 'shift in the tide from the last couple
of budgets which were marked by fiscal tightening and the next couple of
budgets which will be tax-cutting'.
Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International, said
there was 'deep cynicism' about whether the improvement in the PSBR targets
could be maintained.
'It feels like we are being set up for tax cuts next year,' he said.
There were other serious causes for concern. Economists said the upward
revision in GDP growth estimates would put pressure on interest rates. 'We
are still looking for a base rate rise either early next year or even late
this year,' Mr Barrie said.
Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency strategy at JP Morgan in London, said
that the chancellor's commitment in the Budget to low inflation had 'clearly
heightened expectations of an early interest rate rise'.
Mr David Miles, UK economist at US investment bank Merrill Lynch, expects
interest rates to rise by between 150 and 200 basis points before the end of
next year.
Mr Chris Dillow, UK economist at Nomura, said: 'There is nothing in this for
the gilts market.' He added that the chancellor had 'given a clear signal
that the period of fiscal restraint has come to an end'.
Some traders were unhappy about the slow speed of the development of the
gilt repo market.
'We are now officially at the same stage we all thought we were at
unofficially a year ago,' a trader said. One senior equity marketmaker
described the Budget as 'shockingly boring'.
He said: 'Apart from the usual tobacco, brewing, spirits, petrol, diesel
stories, there seems to be nothing for us to get our teeth into.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (The Economy): Faster growth expected than
previously thought - The forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is now predicting that economic growth will be faster, and
inflation lower, than previously expected.
Gross Domestic Product is expected to rise by 4 per cent in 1994, compared
with the Treasury's summer forecast of 2.75 per cent. That is a rate last
achieved in the Lawson boom of the mid-1980s.
The forecast does assume that the pace of GDP growth will slow in 1995.
'This largely reflects much slower growth of North Sea output following the
very large increases of the past couple of years,' according to the
Treasury's Red Book.
But the pace of growth will still be 3.25 per cent, compared with the
Treasury's earlier estimate of 2.75 per cent. And if the oil and gas sector
is excluded, GDP is projected to rise by 3.5 per cent in 1994 and by 3.25
per cent in 1995.
The slight slowing in non-oil growth next year is a result of low growth in
public spending and no increase in stockbuilding.
These rates are much faster than the long-term trend rate of British growth,
which is estimated to be between 2 and 2.5 per cent.
Economic theory suggests that provided actual output growth is below its
long-term trend, the so-called output gap will reduce inflationary
pressures.
But if this gap disappears, inflation will accelerate.
The red book is optimistic on this score. 'The current size of the output
gap cannot be estimated with any certainty,' it says, 'but there is almost
certainly still a sizeable gap. In other words there is still spare capacity
in the economy as a whole.
'This should allow the economy to continue growing faster than trend without
any significant upward pressure upon prices.'
The Treasury believes that 'there are grounds for thinking that currently
reported levels of capacity utilisation represent less of a constraint on
expansion and hence less of an inflationary threat than in the past. Under
pressure to cut costs companies have probably been exploiting opportunities
to use their existing capacity more efficiently.'
Accordingly, the government is able to reduce its forecast for inflation in
1994 and 1995. Underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest
payments, is forecast to rise from 2 per cent in the current quarter to 2.5
per cent in the fourth quarter of next year. The Treasury's earlier estimate
for next year was 2.75 per cent.
The Treasury says that the pick-up in inflation next year will be prompted
by manufacturers expanding margins and by higher commodity prices. 'But the
rise is expected to be limited by the intensity of competition in the retail
sector', says the report.
Producer output price inflation is expected to rise to 3.25 per cent by
mid-1995, but fall to 2.25 per cent by mid-1996 as upward pressure on
margins eases and import cost inflation recedes.
However, the Treasury is forecasting underlying inflation at only 2.5 per
cent in the second quarter of 1996, in line with the government's aim of
between 1 and 4 per cent by the end of this parliament.
The Treasury is also optimistic about corporate investment, arguing that
companies have already repaired their balance sheets after the recession.
'Companies in aggregate are now in reasonable financial shape and have
little need to forego profitable investment opportunities for the sake of
sustaining substantial financial surpluses,' says the red book.
The Treasury forecasts that business investment is likely to grow by only 2
per cent in 1994 but by nearly 11 per cent in 1995. Fixed investment in the
economy as a whole is expected to grow by 3.75 per cent in 1994 and 5.75 per
cent in 1995.
These buoyant economic forecasts may still not result in a feelgood factor.
Consumers' incomes are being restrained. Real personal disposable income is
expected to be static in 1994 and to grow by only 1.75 per cent next year.
Despite this, consumer spending is forecast to grow as consumers reduce
their savings rate. Consumption is expected to rise by 2.5 per cent in both
1994 and 1995, and the red book says there is 'much less evidence of any
significant weakening since the tax rises in April and the trend in retail
sales remains buoyant'.
Another indicator of consumer confidence, the housing market, has been
sluggish.
The Treasury says the weakness may be the consequence of persistent negative
equity and significant, though diminishing, repossessions.
Furthermore, the 2 percentage-point rise in fixed rate mortgages may have
kept some purchasers out of the market, and the reduction in mortgage
interest relief may have had an impact. However, the red book adds: 'Housing
market indicators point to renewed recovery.' Continued economic growth
should lead to modest increases in both turnover and house prices next year.
On unemployment, the government says that various factors will increase the
number of people participating in the labour market and this means that
unemployment is likely to fall less than employment rises.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (The Economy): City welcomes bond market
liberalisation - Gilts repo plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England and Mr Kenneth Clarke yesterday cheered UK government
bond markets by unveiling plans to further liberalise the trading of
gilt-edged securities.
The announcement of the intention to establish an open market for gilt sale
and repurchase agreements - known as 'repos' - was warmly welcomed though
widely expected.
Changing the rules will mean that any institution will be able to borrow or
lend gilt edged stock. The requirement for such transactions to take place
through one of the City of London's eight money brokers will also be
scrapped.
'It is exactly what the market wanted to see. Long-term, I think it will be
beneficial for the gilt market,' said Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at
Yamaichi International.
While the authorities yesterday stated their intention to set up a repo
market, the details have yet to be hammered out. The Bank published a
discussion paper yesterday, proposing that repo transactions can be carried
out by any financial institution and not just gilt-edged market makers
(Gemms), as at present.
The requirement that stock can only be lent or borrowed through stock
exchange money brokers will also be scrapped.
The Bank is seeking comments on the paper from market participants by
January 31, 1995. Final decisions will be taken after the completion of the
consultation process, the Bank said, adding that gilt repo activity could
not begin before July 1995.
A repo is, in essence, a loan agreement between two parties in which bonds
act as collateral. The institution which owns the bonds sells them to the
counterparty and in return receives cash. At a set date in the future, the
original bond owner agrees to buy back the bonds for a set sum. The buy-back
sum will be higher than the original cash amount, the difference reflecting
the rate of interest on the loan.
In theory, both parties can gain from this transaction. The original bond
owner raises money at a cheaper rate than by borrowing without using
collateral. Meanwhile, the lender may receive interest at a better rate than
by just depositing the cash with a bank, and has the comfort of the bonds as
security.
Government bond markets in other countries, including the US, France and
Germany, already have well-developed repo facilities. Although London has
long been the European centre of non-dollar repo business, the sterling
sector has lagged behind its international competitors.
The Bank of England said it 'believes that these steps should enhance the
liquidity and efficiency of the gilt market, increase demand for gilts, and
thereby reduce the overall interest cost over time to the government and the
taxpayer'.
The proposed changes would do so, it said, by giving investors in gilts
ready access to the sterling money market, using gilts as collateral; by
enabling all of the market to borrow stock to cover short positions; by
widening arbitrage opportunities; by ensuring international investors could
use the repo mechanism with which they are familiar; by encouraging greater
participation in the gilt market; by extending the range of instruments
traded in the sterling money markets; by promoting greater integration of
the money and gilt markets; and by enhancing the position of London as a
financial centre.
The chancellor said that an open repo facility 'should improve both
liquidity and efficiency, reducing yields and hence the government's debt
interest costs'.
He added that 'each reduction in yields of just one basis point will
eventually save more than Pounds 25m a year of public expenditure.'
The UK currently has had two types of gilt repurchase agreements, only one
of which is being reformed. The type which is being left alone consists of
the Bank of England's fortnightly money market repos, under which the Bank
lends two- and four-week funds to the market against the security of gilts.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (The Economy): Rapid fall in borrowing fuels tax
cut expectation - PSBR outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Budget announced a much more rapid reduction in the public sector
borrowing requirement than its predecessor, from Pounds 34.4bn this year to
only Pounds 5bn in three years' time.
Lower than expected inflation explains the bulk of the improvement in the
public sector finances. Mr Kenneth Clarke's first budget predicted a PSBR of
Pounds 38bn in 1994-5, falling to Pounds 12bn by 1997-8.
Most economists had expected Mr Clarke to announce a more rapid medium-term
reduction in the PSBR than he predicted a year ago. But the prediction of a
budget surplus will raise speculation that tax rates will be lowered in the
next few years.
The cumulative effect of the reduced cash spending totals announced
yesterday is that overall spending in 1997-98 will be Pounds 9bn lower than
predicted a year ago, at Pounds 272bn.
The Treasury's lower forecasts for future inflation will eventually mean
that tax receipts will be lower than previous forecast. By 1998, general
government receipts are expected to be Pounds 8.5bn below the level
predicted last year.
The overall effect of lower inflation, however, is positive, because of the
scope for lower cash spending totals. This year's fall in unemployment also
contributed, by reducing the cost of social security.
Yesterday's amended public spending plans provide for spending to rise at
less than 3 per cent in nominal terms over the next three years, or 0.25 per
cent annual real growth.
The faster reduction in the level of the PSBR means that the Treasury now
expects net public sector debt as a percentage of GDP to peak at 42.75 per
cent in 1996, falling to 36.75 per cent by the end of the century.
The Treasury pointed out that the new forecasts implied the UK would meet
the EU's excessive deficit procedure by 1996-97. The general government
deficit is then expected to be 2.25 per cent, below the 3 per cent of GDP
laid down in the Maastricht Treaty.
The new medium-term spending plans show general government expenditure,
excluding privatisation proceeds, declining over time as a share of GDP. The
Treasury said it showed 'real GGE growth over the next three years averaging
between 0.5 and 0.75 per cent per annum, well below the projected growth
rate of the economy'.
General government expenditure as a percentage of GDP is now expected to
fall from 43.5 per cent this year to 41 per cent in 1998-99. Tax revenues as
a share of GDP are predicted to rise from 37.25 per cent this year to 40 per
cent in 1999.
The rise in interest rates has raised the medium-term cost of servicing the
government debt. The Treasury said government debt interest would rise by a
third in the three years to 1996-97. After that it is expected to stablise
as borrowing is reduced, from Pounds 19.2bn to Pounds 26bn, and is expected
to stay at this level for several years.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (The Economy): Current account deficit 'to halve'
 -Trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK economic recoveries all too frequently run into the buffer of balance of
payments constraints.
There were plenty of people who forecast that the current recovery would end
in tears, as rapid consumption growth sucked in imports and a weakened UK
industrial base failed to compete in world export markets.
However, the Treasury is now forecasting that the current account deficit,
which was Pounds 10.3bn in 1993, will fall to Pounds 4bn in 1994 and to
Pounds 3.5bn in 1995.
This better performance, according to the Treasury, is due to the fact that
the improvement in the UK's cost competitiveness, which followed sterling's
departure from the Exchange Rate Mechanism, has been largely maintained. The
UK's cost competitiveness is estimated to be 10 per cent better than in the
second quarter of 1992.
With changes in UK unit labour costs predicted to be the same as those
overseas, the UK's current level of competitiveness will be broadly
maintained.
UK manufacturing exports are forecast to grow by 9.5 per cent in 1994 and by
8 per cent in 1995. Next year, stronger growth in Europe is expected to
replace weaker demand growth from North America.
Meanwhile, import growth has been more subdued than would have been
expected, given the pace of the recovery. Non-oil imports are expected to be
5.25 per cent higher in 1994 than in 1993 and to grow by 6 per cent next
year.
The balance of trade on visible goods is projected to move from a Pounds
13bn deficit in 1993 to a Pounds 9bn shortfall this year, and to Pounds
6.5bn in 1995. In addition, the surplus on invisible earnings is expected to
improve from Pounds 3bn in 1993 to Pounds 5bn in 1994, before falling back
to Pounds 3.5bn in 1995. Trade in oil has also contributed to the
improvement, with the oil surplus more than doubling between 1993 and 1994.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (News and Analysis): Changes may raise cost of
issuing new shares - Tax loopholes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the tax loopholes to be closed by the Budget may raise the cost of
issuing new shares in London. Perhaps the most significant change will close
a means by which companies have avoided paying VAT on advisory fees incurred
when raising new equity capital.
Unlike other advisory fees which also attract VAT, companies may not offset
VAT charges incurred in capital-raising exercises for shares distributed
within the European Union against the VAT they charge their own customers.
In effect, this 17.5 per cent charge is non-recoverable, notes Mr George
Michie, partner at KPMG Peat Marwick. But companies have been able to
circumvent the VAT charge by creating a special tranche of shares to be sold
outside the EU and allocating all the expenses to that tranche.
Now, that loophole will be closed, effectively raising the cost of issuing
new shares.
'Anything which puts up the cost of using the City is not good for quoted
companies,' said Mr Mark Cramsie, head of corporate finance at merchant bank
Singer and Fried-lander.
Moreover, some merchant bankers said privately, the new rule is likely to
increase pressure on advisers to lower their fees.
Another change will affect the tax banks are forced to pay on the securities
in which they invest their long-term regulatory capital.
In effect, they will now be forced to pay tax on the unrealised investment
gains of deeply discounted securities which do not pay interest annually and
whose benefits will not be felt until maturity.
Mr Derek Jenkins, tax partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, notes that the Inland
Revenue has suspected that banks are placing certain types of deeply
discounted or index-linked holdings into special investment company
subsidiaries instead of carrying them on their own trading accounts.
These investment companies are not required to pay tax until maturity. Mr
Jenkins noted that it is still not clear whether banks will incur capital
gains tax or income tax on the unrealised gains.
The chancellor moved to curtail the transfer from company to company of
unused tax relief, yielding an estimated Pounds 30m a year from 1996-97.
Earlier Budgets have steadily curtailed the purchase of trading companies
for tax reasons, and yesterday's proposed applying the principle to
investment companies such as insurers. An acquirer can no longer reduce its
taxable profits by taking over an investment company and its losses,
otherwise known as excess management expenses.
Tax relief will be withdrawn if the investment company undergoes 'a major
change in the nature or conduct of its business'.
Mr Richard Piller, senior consultant at accountants Price Waterhouse, said:
'There has been a thriving market in excess management expenses throughout
this year.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (News and Analysis): Japanese and Germans face
higher charges - Subsidiaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY ALLEN and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
German and Japanese companies face higher UK tax charges on the earnings of
their British subsidiaries, as a result of changes in tax law announced by
the Inland Revenue.
The changes, to the tax liability of UK subsidiaries which have a higher
ratio of debt to equity than the Inland Revenue deems acceptable, will also
require British companies to re-examine the funding of their UK
subsidiaries.
Although the changes could be most disruptive to overseas companies, they
may provoke protests from large UK groups which have been free to create an
internal capital structure without worrying about debt-equity ratios.
Mr Jim Marshall, head of KPMG's international group in London, described the
proposals as 'very significant' and said that German and Japanese
subsidiaries in the UK would need to review debt provided by a parent
company urgently.
The new rules change the regime for 'thinly-capitalised' subsidiaries. One
reason they have been funded predominantly with interest-bearing loans
rather than share capital is in order to gain tax relief on the interest
paid.
The changes may raise the UK tax charge of German and Japanese companies for
new loans from today, and existing loans from April 1, because the existing
tax treaties do not restrict tax relief on thinly-capitalised companies.
But parent companies from countries including Ireland and Korea may benefit
because under the tax treaties with those countries, no interest is tax
deductible. The changes will be neutral for subsidiaries of US and Dutch
companies.
The changes could affect UK inward investment because the manner in which
the Inland Revenue interprets the rules will add uncertainty to German and
Japanese companies, which have been among the leading investors into the UK.
The rules replace existing thin capital rules for payments to overseas
parent companies, and impose thin capital rules for all UK companies paying
interest to a company which owns 75 per cent of its shares, or a fellow
subsidiary.
A change in the regime had have been expected for some time on UK
subsidiaries of foreign companies, but the proposal will also apply to all
companies in a UK group. This could create tax uncertainties and problems
for some large UK companies.
The proposals apply an 'arm's length' test to determine the amount of debt a
third party lender would have advanced to the borrower, given its existing
financial position, including particularly its level of share capital.
To the extent that the amount of debt exceeds that which the Inland Revenue
believe is appropriate, then the interest on the excess debt will be treated
as a non-deductible distribution, increasing taxable profits of the
borrower.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (News and Analysis): Little to bolster consumer
confidence - Retailers' reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor offered little in his Budget to bolster directly consumer
confidence in the short term which remains unusually fragile for so healthy
an economic recovery. Analysts and business leaders in the retail sector
said the message seemed to be 'wait until next year when I've got more to
give you'.
Mr Douglas McWilliams, chief executive of the Centre for Economics and
Business Research, said: 'The chancellor has written a post-dated cheque.'
Mr Clarke's strong suggestion of tax cuts next year were unlikely to spark
consumer confidence in the meantime, he added.
Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, the UK's largest electrical retailer,
said the Budget would have 'no impact whatsoever' on short-term trading or
on Christmas but was optimistic for the longer term.
He welcomed Mr Clarke's forecasts of a reduced public sector borrowing
requirement and said prospects of steady growth with low inflation enabled
businesses to plan for the future with confidence. He said he was glad the
chancellor had not tried to boost consumer confidence artificially, leading
to a 'boom'.
'The last thing we needed was another boom,' said Mr Kalms. 'Every single
boom I have lived through has been a disaster. This Budget was all about
laying down good wine, not to be drunk today, but (for) three years' time.'
Mr Archie Norman, chief executive of Asda, the UK's fourth-largest
supermarket retailer, agreed that the chancellor was right to resist the
temptation to boost short-term consumer confidence.
'We have all got used to Budgets with a bit of sizzle and this was a
no-sizzle Budget. I think the chancellor has done the right thing.
Retailers got some direct help, however, on the uniform business rates. Mr
James May, director general of the British Retail Consortium, which
represents 300,000 retail outlets, welcomed the decision to limit the
increase in business rate bills to 10 per cent for large businesses and 7.5
per cent for small businesses in any one year.
Overall, the Budget appeared to offer little to relieve the prime causes of
consumer insecurity which include the stagnant housing market, slow growth
in disposable incomes and employment uncertainty.
Low inflation is also a factor. Mr Ian Shepherdson, the UK economist at HSBC
Markets, said: 'People suffer from money illusion. They feel happier with a
10 per cent pay rise and 9 per cent inflation rather than a 3 per cent rise
and 2 per cent inflation.'
The chancellor's forecast of inflation continuing at 2.5 per cent next year
will prolong that phenomenon, which risk becoming a particular problem in
the housing market. The failure of house prices to rise still leaves some
500,000 to 750,000 people with negative equity, others with large mortgages
and renters with little incentive to buy.
Some analysts suggested that the chancellor's further reduction in mortgage
relief and capping of housing benefit could depress the rental market and
make some people less willing to take on a mortgage.
'Job security is the vital missing ingredient in this recovery,' said Mr
Peter Spencer, a Strathclyde University economist and adviser to Kleinwort
Benson. This has been induced in part by a relatively slow creation of
well-paid professional jobs, a sharp fall in real incomes for people in
menial jobs and the hiring more part-time, temporary or female employees, he
said.
Job creation measures in the Budget were aimed at getting the long-term
unemployed back to work. These were widely applauded by business leaders but
they stressed the measures were aimed more at encouraging people to apply
for jobs rather than at business to create the jobs.
In the short term, the measures will mean 'more people are competing for the
same number of jobs', said Mr McWilliams. Moreover, these newly employed
people were unlikely to have much money to spend in the retail sector, other
analysts suggested.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Their Budget): The rail controller
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alastair Fyfe, 34: Duty control manager for European Passenger Services,
supervising running of trains on UK side of Channel Tunnel. Married with two
daughters aged three and one. Earns: Pounds 26,000. Has Pounds 80,000
mortgage.
Politics: Voted Scottish Nationalist in last election. Thinks he would vote
Lib-Dem now. Wanted: More spending on pre-school nurseries and tax breaks
for users of company supervised creches. More funds for NHS and public
transport and the creation of an integrated network of roads and railways.
Incentives to transfer freight from road to rail.
Said yesterday: 'Proposals to reduce the government's direct contribution to
rail spending represent a missed opportunity and show the government only
pays lip service to green policies. I was disappointed that no extra money
was made available for pre-school nursery facilities.
'I accept the need for some increase in car fuel duty though, as a country
dweller, I am happy the chancellor did not increase it by the higher amounts
called for by some commentators.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (News and Analysis): Pilot job match schemes
extended - Unemployed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor announced the extension of one of the most novel of the
back-to-work schemes aimed at giving the long-term unemployed a second
chance.
The job matching schemes, pioneered by two Training and Enterprise Councils
at the request of the Department of Employment, give people who have been
jobless for more than two years Pounds 50 a week for six months if they
obtained a part-time job or move into self-employment.
It is called 'job match' because the Tecs unite hopeful job applicants with
employers willing to give them work.
Mr Kenneth Clarke announced yesterday that the scheme was to be extended to
other areas to take on 3,000 people a year for the next three years, at a
cost of Pounds 5m a year.
Mr David Rossington, chief executive of Lincolnshire Tec, which piloted
schemes with Aztec - which covers Kingston, Surrey - said the scheme arose
out of a Department of Employment plea for initiatives to help the long-term
unemployed.
He said: 'We aimed to encourage two things. We wanted people either to build
up a portfolio of part-time jobs that could equate to a full-time job at the
end of the day or to work their way into full-time employment.'
Portfolio working is one an employment concept of the 1990s. The thinking is
that if people cannot find a full-time job, they might build their own job
by a series of part-time and casual appointments.
Lincolnshire Tec, which has attracted 350 starters among the long-term
unemployed, paid them Pounds 50 a week for the first six months. Mr
Rossington that after 50 initial dropouts, only 14 others had gone back on
the dole. The Tec also gave out Pounds 300 worth of training vouchers.
The Aztec scheme provided 100 opportunities at Pounds 70 a week for the
first 20 weeks and Pounds 40 a week for the final six weeks.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (News and Analysis): Something for everybody and
no harm done - Birmingham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
West Midlands manufacturers gathered round the tea table in Birmingham heard
the chancellor out in silence. No exclamations of disgust, no chortles of
approbation.
'Our attitude summarises the effect he's likely to have,' said Mr Albert
Hargreaves, chairman of Apollo Metals, the aluminium processor and
distributor. Mr Rod Turner, managing director designate of Whale Tankers,
maker of waste disposal vehicles, said: 'My overall impression was that it
was a politician's gem of a budget: bits of something for everybody.'
'Nobody is violently outraged,' added Mr Jim Mundell, chairman of Woodcote
Industries, which manufactures forged components. 'The best thing for me was
the start on trying to reform the welfare system to encourage the unemployed
to seek work,' according to Mr Ed Kirk, the chairman of Frederick Cooper,
the metals finishing and architectural products company. 'It should help
companies like mine which are finding it difficult to fill the lower paid
jobs,' he added.
The issue here for the manufacturers was not whether they would receive tax
breaks. 'I don't think it's a question for the company. It's the incentive
for the individual - that's where the incentive should go. You've got to
have a better choice from the people available on the labour market. It's a
very important initiative,' Mr Mundell said of the chancellor's job creation
package.
'Imaginative,' agreed Mr Turner. 'I don't think it would give any employer
the incentive to take anybody on,' said Mr Hargreaves. That might not please
the chancellor.
What would please him was the general approval of his stance on corporate
taxation and his rejection of the demands from the CBI, the Engineering
Employers Federation and the Chambers of Commerce for changes in capital
allowances. Anticipating today's recriminations, Mr Mundell dismissed such
demands as 'part of the feel good factor - people holding off to see what
improvement there's going to be'.
Mr Kirk agreed. 'I wouldn't invest any money just because there's an
allowance,' he said. Mr Turner added: 'Anyway, it's driven by the leasing
companies. And the banks. They're the players in there.'
Mr Mundell said: 'There's been no investment in drop forging for 50 years.
You've really got to start again. The only way to re-equip is an industry
aid scheme.'
Pinioned between rising costs, like raw materials, which they have to
absorb, and downward pressure from their customers, the manufacturers
listened closely to what Mr Clarke said about inflation.
Mr Turner, sensing there was some sleight of hand in the calculation, said:
'One of the things that is disappointing - a target of 1 to 4 per cent for
inflation is pretty broad.'
'If they want to survive they've probably got to see the 4 rather than the
1,' Mr Mundell suggested, concerned about people's expectations of rising
wages and house prices.
Not that there is wage pressure at the moment. 'We have an American business
and they're not used to getting pay rises,' commented Mr Kirk.
'That's right. People get used to it,' said Mr Turner. 'I can't see a lot of
wage inflation coming,' Mr Kirk came back.
Mr Hargreaves has, however, seen the first signs. 'As you see people like
Jaguar and Rover raising their rates, we're seeing people moving on.'
'We have that problem but at the moment we can keep pulling people in,' said
Mr Kirk.
'That's all right if you haven't got 25 jobs you want to fill,' rejoined Mr
Hargreaves.
For Mr Kirk, the way to avoid cost pressures is to increase volumes. That
means, under current domestic conditions, the export markets. So Mr Clarke
got a pat on the back for reducing export guarantee premiums. And the
manufacturers went away into the gloom of the afternoon. 'No harm done,'
said Mr Mundell.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (News and Analysis): Minister in credit after
uneasy past - Profile of Jonathan Aitken, colourful chief secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, may receive the plaudits for the Budget
speech. But Mr Jonathan Aitken, the chief secretary to the Treasury, will be
hoping for much of the credit for the substantial public spending cuts
announced yesterday.
Since his appointment as Treasury minister in charge of expenditure last
summer, Mr Aitken has been in the headlines - but nearly always for the
wrong reasons. He was the subject of newspaper investigations into his
associations with Middle Eastern businessmen, including Mr Wafic Said, one
of the world's most successful arms dealers.
He was accused of breaking parliamentary rules by failing to fully disclose
a stay at the Ritz Hotel in Paris.
And, although he has escaped unscathed from these allegations so far, some
Tory MPs privately admit that the 52-year-old cabinet minister's past -
'long as your arm' as it was once described - could still cause him
difficulties.
But the substantial expenditure cuts announced in the Budget yesterday may
mark a turning point in his brief cabinet career.
When Mr Aitken was appointed chief secretary in Mr John Major's reshuffle
last summer, there was comment - and concern - at Westminster about his
colourful past.
A self-made millionaire and nephew of newspaper magnate Lord Beaverbrook,
his curriculum vitae includes exploits with which few Tory cabinet ministers
would wish to be associated. In the 1960s he campaigned for the legalisation
of cannabis. In 1970, he was prosecuted under section two of the Official
Secrets Act (he was eventually acquitted) after obtaining a confidential
Ministry of Defence document confirming that the UK was supplying arms to
Nigeria.
His later business activities included an association with the Slater Walker
group in the 1970s. In 1982 he attracted yet more controversy after rescuing
TV-AM, the breakfast TV company, in a boardroom coup.
But it is his reputation for careful diplomacy which explains why he was
moved to the Treasury in the run-up to a Budget whose main theme has been
public-sector restraint.
A firm rightwinger and free-marketeer, Mr Aitken has never hidden his
determination to see public expenditure reduced wherever possible. But he
has conducted negotiations with spending ministers in a more friendly manner
than Mr Michael Portillo, his abrasive predecessor.
Much of that experience of careful negotiation was honed in his previous job
as the defence minister charged with cutting some Pounds 750m from military
spending. It is striking that the chancellor pointed out yesterday how Mr
Aitken had carried out those defence cuts without upsetting service chiefs.
But some Tory MPs have been dismissive of Mr Aitken's performance in his
first spending round. They argue Mr Portillo had already done the groundwork
by introducing his Fundamental Expenditure Reviews and taking the 'political
pain' of signalling tough measures.
They also say the task of cutting expenditure this year will have been
easier, because of better-than-expected figures for inflation which will
reduce wage and benefit costs.
However, if the Treasury's projections for public borrowing come true, his
job will get easier. And, in his first rocky months in the cabinet, he has
proved to the press and opposition MPs that he is a tough political survivor
whom it will be difficult to dislodge.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (News and Analysis): Renewed drive to combat
fraudsters - Benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Proposals for the electronic payment of social security benefits in post
offices will be announced by Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary,
today as part of a renewed programme to tackle fraud.
Foreshadowing the plan in his Budget speech yesterday Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, said a proposed Pounds 300m package of measures against social
security fraud would save Pounds 2.5bn over three years.
He said existing efforts to prevent fraud in the social security system were
already saving Pounds 700m.
Details of the new electronic payments scheme will be revealed today.
Mr Lilley yesterday announced a general uprating of social security benefits
in line with inflation from next April.
Income-related benefits will rise by about 1.9 per cent - calculated on the
basis of the retail price index minus some housing costs - while
contributory ones will increase by at least 2.2 per cent, in line with the
September RPI.
Expenditure on social security - the biggest item of government expenditure
 -will be Pounds 86.5bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 89bn in 1996-97. It is
scheduled to break through the Pounds 90bn barrier in 1997-98 to reach
Pounds 93.5bn.
Anti-poverty campaigners reacted coldly to the Budget. The Child Poverty
Action Group said the chancellor had 'done little to stem the rising tide of
family poverty,' and would be replacing social security with social
insecurity through reductions in housing support.
Church Action on Poverty said each Budget made it clearer that those in
poverty had 'no place in the government's plans'.
The Budget's failure to take any steps towards a better financial regime for
charities brought bitter criticism from the Charities Tax Reform Group.
Mr Ian Macgregor, its chairman, said charities appeared not to exist 'except
when it comes to providing the services which the government does not want
to fund'.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (News and Analysis): Dismay at benefit cuts for
those on income support - Mortgages and income support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some of the largest mortgage lenders expressed dismay at the cuts in
mortgage benefits for people on income support in terms of both new and
existing borrowers.
The bigger blow will hit new borrowers. People taking out new mortgages from
next October will not receive help with their payments for the first nine
months if they lose their jobs and have to start claiming income support.
There will also be some scaling back of the help available for existing
borrowers, which will be detailed today by Mr Peter Lilley, the social
security secretary.
Alongside the prospect of a ceiling of Pounds 100,000 on eligible loans, is
the likelihood that the 16-week period during which only half the interest
payment is met, could be extended.
Mr Lilley will also detail the further cuts in housing benefit, signalled
yesterday, that in many circumstances local authorities will not be fully
reimbursed for the benefits paid where the rent they are paying for
claimants is above the the average for the area.
The government argues that the existing system, in which central government
pays councils in full for the benefit they administer, gives no incentive to
local authorities or private landlords to ensure that the rent is
reasonable.
Although lenders were cautious about the impact of housing benefit before
seeing today's further details, they were clear that the changes to income
support would put up the cost of mortgages, perhaps particularly for some of
the UK's most vulnerable potential homeowners. At the margin, some people
might be put off home ownership altogether.
Many expressed some scepticism whether payment protection insurance would be
available at affordable premiums as widely as the government seemed to
assume, and said the move would have a further depressing effect on the
housing market, where the recovery was already fragile.
Mr David Gilchrist, corporate development manager at Halifax Building
Society, the UK's largest mortgage lender, said the society saw it as a
surprising move since 'we thought the government was a strong supporter of
home ownership'. In the long run, by deterring some people from becoming
home owners, it would lead to increased demand for subsidised social
housing, he said.
There was also the suggestion that it might lead to a 'mini-boom' next year
followed by a slight slump, as borrowers sought to take out loans before the
benefit became more restricted.
Others thought the move less significant. Mr Charles Toner, managing
director of retail operations at Abbey National, the UK's second largest
mortgage lender, said: 'About 40-50 per cent of our new borrowers have this
insurance anyway.'
Mr Donald Kirkham, chief executive of Woolwich Building Society, the UK's
third largest, said he did not think it would have a particular impact on
the market, since only those who would be able to take out this type of
insurance were buying homes at present.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (News and Analysis): Labour delights in display of
wit and ridicule - Blair reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor's speech was ridiculed by Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader,
as a Budget designed to quell divisions on the Conservative benches rather
than lay the groundwork for long-term economic recovery.
Mr Blair delighted Labour MPs in his first Budget response as Opposition
leader with a witty speech accusing the Tories of betraying election
promises, stealing Labour policies and financial sleight of hand.
It was a performance that appeared to discomfit cabinet ministers,
especially when Mr Blair accused the chancellor of exaggerating his
additional compensation package for the second stage of value added tax on
domestic fuel.
Mr Blair said that most of the VAT package had been announced last year or
reflected the normal increase in pensioners' benefits to compensate for
inflation. 'This will go down in history as the VAT-on-fuel Budget,' he
said.
'They (the Tories) fought the last election on the specific pledge that they
would not raise VAT. They have broken that promise and they will never be
trusted on tax again.'
As Labour MPs cheered, Mr Blair sought to increase Tory embarrassment over
divisions on Europe and VAT: 'We will challenge all members of the party
opposite - both parties opposite - to keep their promise to the electorate
upon which they were elected.
'If they break that promise, then the country has been warned that the
Conservative party put VAT on fuel and power when it promised it would not,
and it cannot be trusted not to put VAT on food, on children's clothing, on
books, on papers, if it is ever elected again.'
Mr Blair ridiculed the chancellor's picture of a strong economic recovery as
evidence that the government had become divorced from the reality of
everyday life.
He welcomed the chancellor's plans to cut tax avoidance and reduce
employers' National Insurance payments for the long-term unemployed
returning to the jobs market, which he claimed were policies pioneered by
Labour.
But he accused the chancellor of exaggerating the impact of his plans for
the Community Action scheme. He said the plans amounted to an increase on
last year's forecast, but a cut in the number of people benefiting from the
scheme.
Mr Blair provoked wry smiles on the Tory benches as he admitted that the
economy was improving but noted that voters were not giving the government
credit.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (News and Analysis): Making the economy work
better - At a glance guide
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FISCAL STANCE
The Budget is designed 'to ensure that the improvements in the public
finances announced in 1993 are delivered and to introduce further structural
reforms to make the economy work better'.
Spending squeezed
Government spending plans in 1995-96 to be reduced by Pounds 7.2bn, with
further reductions of Pounds 9bn in 1996-97, and Pounds 9.8bn in 1997-98.
This reflects a fall in the projected levels of inflation and government
savings.
The control total has been reduced to Pounds 249.6bn in 1994-1995, Pounds
1.3bn below the level announced last November in current prices.
The control total is forecast to rise to Pounds 255.7bn in 1995-1996, Pounds
6.9bn lower at current prices than last year's projections, and Pounds 0.5bn
lower in 1993-1994 prices. As a share of national output total government
spending is projected to fall from 44 per cent to 41 per cent over the three
years. Page 20
Limited tax changes
Tax changes in the Budget are relatively limited. Changes in income tax
reliefs and VAT announced last year and scheduled to come into place in
April next year will raise taxes by a further Pounds 2.75bn in 1995-96 and
Pounds 0.75bn in the following year.
This will be partly offset by measures to help businesses and the
unemployed, and ease the impact of the imposition of value added tax on
fuel. These will cost Pounds 1bn in 1995-96.
As a result, the total level of taxes received by the government is
projected to be Pounds 252.5bn in 1994-95, and rise to Pounds 278.9bn in the
following year.
Taxes and social security revenues as a proportion of GDP will rise from
33.75 per cent in 1993-1994 to 35.25 per cent in 1994-1995. Page 23
PSBR cut further
Public borrowing, including privatisation proceeds, is forecast to fall from
Pounds 34.4bn in 1994-95 to Pounds 21.5bn in 1995-96.
The public sector borrowing requirement is then projected to fall further,
to Pounds 13bn in 1996-97, Pounds 5bn in 1997-98, and then return to balance
at the end of the decade.
Consequently, the PSBR as a
proportion of gross domestic product is
forecast to fall to 5 per cent in 1994-95,
and then 3 per cent in 1995-96, and then 1.75 per cent in the following
year.
Page 20
SPENDING
Public sector pay and personnel
Tight controls to be maintained on public sector pay and government
departments to offset any increase in public sector pay next year by
increased efficiency. Total civil service numbers to fall to below 500,000
over the next four years.
Central government
Total central government costs to remain constant in cash terms for the next
four years, representing a 10 per cent fall, in real terms, in the cost of
government.
Local authorities
The 1995-96 total standard spending in the UK to be 2.2 per cent higher than
this year. Page 27
Social security

introduction of electronic benefit payment systems in Post Offices. Page 27
Education
Education spending to be increased by almost 1 per cent in real terms next
year. Student grants and loans to increase in line with inflation. Page 27
Home Office
Spending on police to rise 3 per cent in 1995-96. Chief constables to be
given more control over their budgets. Further initiatives to attract
private investment into prisons. Page 26
Health
Health budget to increase by Pounds 1.3bn, or 1 per cent next year. This
follows an increase of 3.75 per cent in real terms this year as a result of
falling inflation. Further initiatives to attract private finance in health
construction pro-jects.
Transport
Public spending on motorways and trunk roads to be reduced significantly.
However efforts will be made to encourage further private-sector investment.
London Underground is expected to attract considerable private finance, as
well as Pounds 1bn of public investment in the next financial year. Page 27
Urban regeneration project
An extra Pounds 800m will be made available for new projects in deprived
urban areas in 1996-97. Page 26
MEASURES TO REDUCE UNEMPLOYMENT
Benefit system changes
Family Credit to be increased for people in full-time work. The payment of
housing benefit and Family Credit to be speeded up for people taking jobs.
Job-finding schemes such as Workwise to be extended. Experimental schemes
paying family credit to childless people to be introduced. Page 17
Employment tax changes

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget '94 (News and Analysis): Moratorium to reduce number
of receiverships - Company rescues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is pressing ahead with reforms to company rescue procedures
which have been fiercely attacked by the banks and the insolvency
profession.
In an attempt to reduce the number of viable companies going into
receivership, the government is to introduce a 28-day moratorium to give
insolvent companies time to reach voluntary arrangements with creditors.
The moratorium will be binding on all parties, including companies' banks.
The proposal, which the Department of Trade and Industry put forward in a
consultative document last November, has been attacked by the banks which
argued that it would discourage lending.
The DTI said last night that following the consultations a broad consensus
had emerged supporting the moratorium.
However, Mr Malcolm London, president of the Insolvency Practitioners
Association and a partner of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said that
applying the moratorium to banks as well as unsecured creditors could be
damaging.
He called for further consultation. 'Banks are generally sensible anyway.
This could influence their attitude to lending in future if they felt their
freedom to manoeuvre will be limited.'
In contrast, the proposal has been welcomed by the Confederation of British
Industry on the grounds that it would reduce the number of corporate
failures.
However, the Society for the Practitioners of Insolvency, the largest trade
body, has published research suggesting that it would have little impact on
company survival rates.
There have been worries that it would increase risk of fraud, but the
chancellor stressed that there would have to be 'proper safeguards to
prevent abuse' during the moratorium.
Mr Clarke also announced further consultation on a proposed mechanism that
would facilitate the substitution of equity for debt of firms in
administration or receivership. He said: 'This could have a profound
influence on behaviour during insolvency negotiations and lead all parties
to focus on the potential of business for continued trading.'
Mr London commented: 'This may have a role to play in relation to large
companies, but it is difficult to see how it would apply to small
insolvencies in practice.'
The British Bankers' Association has attacked the moratorium proposal saying
it would weaken their right to preferential treatment over other creditors
and limit their freedom to appoint receivers to troubled companies. Last
night the association said it would not comment until it had consulted
members.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94: Top-end investors get tax breaks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A package of incentives for private investors will give the richest plenty
to smile about. Investments of up to Pounds 100,000 will enjoy tax relief of
up to 60 per cent thanks to a modification of the enterprise investment
scheme.
New rules for venture capital investors, a widening of the scope of personal
equity plans (Peps) and an extension of tax-exempt savings accounts (Tessas)
are all good news for personal investors and savers.
Venture capital trusts will provide income tax relief at 20 per cent and
capital gains tax relief on investments of up to Pounds 100,000 a year. This
will mainly apply to investments in unquoted trading companies.
The chancellor said he intended the scheme to be more attractive and easier
to use. It has been made considerably more appealing since the outline
introduced a year ago. Gains on existing investments, which would normally
attract 40 per cent capital gains tax, can be rolled over free of tax into
suitable investments - such as venture capital trusts.
Investors in Peps will be allowed to invest in corporate bonds, preference
shares and loan stocks - as well as in equities and unit and investment
trusts. Peps allow investors to put up to Pounds 6,000 a year into a general
Pep and another Pounds 3,000 a year into a single company Pep free of income
tax and capital gains tax. But gilts are still not approved for Peps.
Holders of Tessas will be able to deposit Pounds 9,000 of the proceeds in a
new tax-free account when they mature.
The chancellor, however, killed one of the oldest tax-free schemes for small
savers. Save-As-You Earn, which allowed a maximum monthly contribution of
Pounds 20, paid tax-free interest of 8.3 per cent.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94: Aid for hiring long-term jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Getting the long-term jobless back to work with a mixture of benefit
incentives and new employment schemes was the centrepiece of the Budget.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announced a Pounds 680m package of new
measures mainly designed to help the 500,000 people unemployed for two years
or more return to work - and reduce the cost to employers of hiring them.
But the government also announced a 20 per cent cut in its training budget
over the next financial year with a 14 per cent reduction until 1996-97.
Mr Clarke said the employment measures constituted a very important and
carefully thought-out package of support.
He told MPs: 'It is no longer credible for some people to campaign for
reductions in long-term unemployment without having effective policies to
deal with it.'
Employers are to be provided with incentives to recruit the long-term
unemployed. There is to be a 0.6 per cent cut in employers' National
Insurance contributions for the lower-paid. Employers are also to receive a
one-year rebate from National Insurance contributions for each worker they
hire who has been jobless for more than two years.
Workstart schemes, which give grants to employers taking on the long-term
unemployed, are to be tried out, providing 5,000 job opportunities.
Other proposals involve the provision of financial support from the state in
the transition period for the unemployed moving back into work.
This is to be achieved by speeding up the provision of family credit as well
as housing and council tax benefit for those returning to employment.
Jobfinders' grants are to be provided to enable workers to buy clothes and
tools for their new employment.
Measures are also to be introduced to ensure the unemployed 'keep in touch
with the labour market'.
Mr Clarke said the aim was to 'lift people from dependency into work and to
smooth the transition from out-of-work benefits to modest in-work benefits'.
He added that the measures were also designed to tackle structural
unemployment, which he described as 'the big problem that faces the western
world'.
The chancellor said: 'The days of priming the pump to cut unemployment are
long since past. The government is building reforms on reforms to remove the
distortions and anomalies from the benefit system which discourage so many
unemployed people from taking jobs.'
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, claimed the package of proposals
to deal with unemployment would 'help bring down unemployment at an even
faster rate and create jobs'.
But union leaders criticised the package. 'Ken Clarke is tinkering with the
trimmings of the unemployment problem,' said Mr John Edmonds, general
secretary of the GMB general union. 'He is subsidising low pay out of
taxpayers' money.'
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said that while the measures for the
low-paid and long-term jobless were welcome as far as they went, the
unemployed would be asking why Mr Clarke was waiting until 1996 to implement
many of the proposals.
Mr Robbie Gilbert, the Confederation of British Industry's social affairs
director, said he regretted that the chancellor had not focused on schemes
to cover the 1m people out of work for over a year rather than limit many of
the proposals for those unemployed for more than two years.
For 1995-96, the training budget will be Pounds 578m as opposed to Pounds
693m in the current financial year. The Training and Enterprise National
Council had sought a Pounds 724m budget for 1995-96.
This will mean a drop in the number of training places from 270,000 this
financial year to 230,000 in 1995-96. The Department of Employment's overall
budget is to be cut over the next three years in real terms from Pounds
3.29bn to Pounds 3.12bn.
Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, said: 'We want to ensure our main
training programme for the long-term unemployed is focused much more sharply
on getting people into jobs. We will increase the number of unemployed
people who get jobs as a result of the programme from a reduced budget.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94: Plan for open gilts repo market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke and the Bank of England yesterday unveiled long-awaited
plans to establish an open market for gilt sale-and-repurchase agreements,
or repos.
The move was widely hailed as a liberalisation which would boost the
attractiveness of the UK government bond market, both at home and abroad.
'This is excellent news for the gilt market,' said Mr Danny Corrigan, head
of repo trading at NatWest Markets. 'It will add to market liquidity,
tighten dealing spreads and reduce the opaqueness of this major bond
market.'
Mr Kevin Adams, UK bond strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said that the
establishment of an open repo market would 'enhance the gilt market's
attractiveness to international investors and will bring us more closely
into line with international bond markets'.
Stock lending and borrowing takes place in many government bond markets
through repo arrangements in which any two market participants agree that
one will sell securities to the other and commit to repurchase equivalent
securities on a specified future date at a specified price.
A repo is therefore a flexible transaction which is effectively the
borrowing of cash against collateral for one party and stock borrowing for
the other.
Although the authorities stated their intention to set up an 'open' gilt
repo facility - one accessible to any financial market participant - the
details of that system have yet to be worked out. The Bank yesterday
published a discussion paper on the development of an open repo market,
proposing to widen repo activity beyond gilt-edged market makers and to
abolish the current requirement that stock can only be lent or borrowed
through one of the City's eight money brokers.
Government bond markets in other countries, including the US, France and
Germany, already have well-developed repo facilities. But although London
has long been the European centre of non-dollar repo business, the sterling
sector has limped behind its international competitors.
In a statement accompanying its discussion paper, the Bank of England said
it believed 'these steps should enhance the liquidity and efficiency of the
gilt market, increase demand for gilts, and thereby reduce the overall
interest cost over time to the government and the taxpayer'.
Indeed, Mr Clarke in his Budget speech to parliament, said that an open repo
facility 'should improve both liquidity and efficiency, reducing yields and
hence the government's debt interest costs'. He added that 'each reduction
in yields of just one basis point (1-100th of a percentage point) will
eventually save more than Pounds 25m a year of public expenditure'.
The Bank is seeking comments on the paper from market participants by
January 31 1995. Final decisions will be taken after the completion of the
consultation process, the Bank said, adding that commencement of gilt repo
activity could not be before July 1995.
The Bank also said that changes in the taxation of gilts might be needed to
facilitate the efficient functioning of a repo market, and the Inland
Revenue said yesterday that it would change tax rules.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94: Government faces revolt on VAT - Tory misgivings
remain on fuel compensation package for pensioners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was last night facing the prospect of a fresh backbench
rebellion over value added tax on fuel after Mr Kenneth Clarke failed to
allay Tory misgivings with a new package of compensation measures for
pensioners.
Some potential rebels said they would study the chancellor's proposals for
countering the impact of the planned increase in the rate of VAT from 8 per
cent to 17.5 per cent before forming a view. But others indicated that the
package would not be enough to persuade them to support the government.
Last night it appeared that MPs would have their chance to vote again on the
issue as soon as next Tuesday.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said Labour had tabled a resolution 'to
force a full debate on the VAT rise'. He challenged Tory rebels 'to vote to
stop the increase in the vote next Tuesday'. The effect of the Labour
resolution would be to force a debate on whether MPs should be entitled to
table amendments on VAT on fuel during the Commons' line-by-line scrutiny of
the finance bill. Unlike Monday's vote on the European finance bill, when
they supported the government, the nine Ulster Unionist MPs are expected to
vote in favour of Labour's resolution.
This leaves Labour apparently needing the support of eight or nine Tory
backbenchers to force a highly damaging government defeat.
Adding to the government's difficulties, Sir Richard Body, the Tory MP for
Holland with Boston, confirmed that he had resigned the Conservative whip,
reducing the government's notional minority to four.
Mr Geoff Hoon, a Labour whip, said last night that he was preparing to send
letters to 'at least 60' Conservative MPs in marginal seats, pointing out
how important next week's expected vote would be.
Mr Phil Gallie, Conservative MP for Ayr, said that he thought Mr Clarke's
compensation package was 'a very good one', but expected. He said it would
not reach people in the lower-to-middle income bracket and he would not
support the government if Labour succeeded in forcing a procedural vote on
the issue.
Mr Nicholas Winterton, Conservative MP for Macclesfield, said Mr Clarke had
missed 'a golden opportunity' by not announcing that he had decided against
raising the VAT rate to 17.5 per cent.
He said the chancellor's package was 'very modest' and would account for
only a 'tiny proportion' of the revenue the Treasury would receive from the
increase. He said he would 'probably' vote in favour of a procedural motion
on the issue.
Mr Bill Walker, the Eurosceptic Tory MP for Tayside North, said he thought
the package would help to 'defuse the argument'. He added: 'It will go a
long way to taking the heat out of it.'
Mr Paul Marland, Tory MP for Gloucestershire West, said before the
chancellor's speech that he would vote against the government 'provided I am
just voting against VAT'. He said he thought a Labour resolution would have
'quite a lot of support'.
One of the Eurosceptics who failed to support the government in Monday's
crucial European votes said: 'If I have the government whip, I shall
certainly vote with the government. If not, I shall have to make up my own
mind.'
The threat of a revolt over VAT took the gloss off a reasonably favourable
response from Tory backbenchers to the overall Budget package, although some
complained about its predictability. A senior rightwinger said: 'There was
nothing that set the lads alight.'
Mr John Butterfill, Tory MP for Bournemouth West, said the measures
announced were 'very useful from an investment point of view'. He said the
limit on business rates was 'probably the most important thing he has done'.
Sir Rhodes Boyson, Tory MP for Brent North and a former minister, seemed
disappointed that the chancellor had decided against lowering taxes. He
expressed reservations about VAT on fuel. He said: 'Pensioners are concerned
because interest rates are low and they are the age group that votes the
most.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Carsberg resignation follows delay in competition law reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Bryan Carsberg decided to step down as director-general of fair trading
three weeks ago, after it became clear the government would not include
competition law reform in the Queen's Speech, it emerged yesterday.
Observers said the government's failure to include in its legislative
programme the reform of restrictive trade practices, first promised in 1987,
may have proved the decisive factor in his decision to resign.
Sir Bryan and senior competition officials at the Office of Fair Trading are
known to have become increasingly frustrated by the government's lack of
interest in competition policy since Mr Michael Heseltine took over as trade
and industry secretary at the last election.
On several occasions over the past two years, Mr Heseltine has rejected Sir
Bryan's advice on referral of proposed mergers to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission. In February, Mr Heseltine ordered Sir Bryan to stop
investigation into bus services on the Isle of Arran.
However, it was the government's failure to introduce long-awaited
competition law reform which generated the most friction between the
Department of Trade and Industry and the OFT.
Speaking in Paris yesterday, where he was attending an international
competition policy conference, Sir Bryan denied there was any rift with
ministers and insisted his move to the International Accounting Standards
Committee was a positive one.
He was headhunted for the job as secretary-general of the international
financial reporting organisation by Clive &amp; Stokes, the international search
consultants.
Talks took place over summer, but it is believed Sir Bryan initially
rejected leaving the OFT, only agreeing to accept the IASC post less than
three weeks ago.
The DTI yesterday said that it would conduct a wide search for his successor
and the appointment would be made by Mr Heseltine.
Mr Heseltine, who has relaxed competition policy during his tenure at the
DTI, can be expected to choose someone who shares his views on
competitiveness and deregulation.
The DTI said it would be looking for someone with regulatory experience,
prompting speculation that the job may go to one of the present privatised
utility regulators.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, and Mr Ian Byatt,
the water regulator and a former civil servant who has just completed a
water review, are thought the most likely candidates.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Norway 'faces a tough future': Brundtland warns of
difficulties in wake of No vote on EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's prime minister, said the country faced a
tough economic and political future yesterday after voting in a referendum
on Monday not to accept membership of the European Union.
'We are in a very serious situation,' she warned. 'It will now be more
demanding for us to reach our goals, more demanding to be heard
internationally . . . We will now have to work even harder to secure our
country and safeguard our welfare society.'
Norwegians rejected EU membership by a majority of 52.2 per cent to 47.8 per
cent, in spite of approval won in Austria, Finland and Sweden, its fellow
applicant countries. It was the second time Norway had turned its back on
Brussels, having voted No to membership of the European Economic Community
in 1972.
Most EU leaders expressed dismay at the result.
Denmark, Finland and Sweden had hoped for a strong Nordic front within the
EU. 'The weight of Nordic countries will be less within the EU for defending
the issues dear to us, like the protection of the enviroment and the fight
against unemployment,' said Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Swedish prime minister.
A senior EU diplomat predicted that Norway would have to wait until the next
century for another chance to join the Union, probably at the same time as
the most advanced economies in central and eastern Europe. But the
Commission stressed that Norway's No would only mean technical adjustments
to the accession treaties negotiated earlier this year, and there would be
no need to delay enlargement to 15 members.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, said the No result
would affect the future status of the European Economic Area, the halfway
house for members of the European Free Trade Association leading to full EU
membership.
Mrs Brundtland said a priority for her minority Labour government was to
ensure that the EEA remained intact. The accord, giving non-EU members
access to the EU internal market, now applies only to Norway, Iceland and
Liechtenstein.
Financial markets reacted calmly to the vote, as they had mainly discounted
a No result. But the result provoked a chorus of dismay and concern from
Norwegian business.
Mr Rolf Saether, chief executive of the Norwegian Shipowners Association,
said the outcome had created 'serious uncertainty'. Norske Skog, the
country's biggest forestry products company, said it now had a weaker
position than its Swedish and Finnish competitors.

FT  30 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: BTR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR's trading statement contained no information so startling as to bring
the shares back into favour - that would be a tall order after three months
during which they fell 28 per cent. But the fact that it was issued at all
is encouraging: it shows that BTR is becoming responsive to investors'
concerns about its communications policy, or rather lack of it. Without such
a statement there would have been an information void between the interim
statement in September and the full-year figures next March. A trading
statement alone is not enough, however: the group needs to find a way of
improving day-to-day contact with investors and analysts without infringing
anti-insider dealing rules. If that helped to assuage the City's anxieties
about the group's future, it would be a worthwhile investment of senior
management time.

FT  30 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Venture capital
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For some years the government has been trying, with limited effect, to
improve the lot of the UK's under-capitalised small company sector. The
changes to the venture capital trust scheme announced yesterday should go a
long way to improving their prospects. The revised scheme goes further to
meet the interests of investors, venture capitalists and the growing
companies themselves. As a result, the government's target of attracting
Pounds 2.5bn investment into the sector over the next three years looks
achievable.
For investors, the scale of the tax breaks offered will prove attractive
enough to ensure a steady flow of funds. Such investments will be risky, but
the venture capital groups' expertise and broad portfolio approach should
limit the dangers. As for the companies, the scheme should fill a widely
recognised gap in their funding requirements. Fast-growing groups without
significant assets often find it difficult to borrow from banks, but are too
small to approach the likes of 3i. Now they will benefit not just from
urgently needed capital, but also from experienced venture capitalists'
advice.

FT  30 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Breweries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor's decision to leave duty on beer and spirits unchanged was
not the best the drinks industry could have hoped for. A cut in duty to help
breweries fend off the impact of cross-border shopping would have been ideal
 -but the government was never likely to yield to their special pleading.
The outcome was at least better than the feared indexation in line with
inflation, which would have added appreciably to breweries' woes. The sector
perked up yesterday, with shares in Scottish &amp; Newcastle and Whitbread
rising by 2 per cent each and Bass by 1.5 per cent.
This follows a burst of outperformance in the past few months which has left
Whitbread and S&amp;N standing on a premium to the market, despite expectations
of lower than market-average earnings growth. The re-rating reflects the
higher valuation investors are prepared to give the breweries' retailing
activities, as well as a general shift towards consumer stocks at the
expense of cyclicals. But it may prove short-lived: results from Bass and
S&amp;N next week are likely to highlight volume declines and intense
competition. Moreover, low inflation makes it hard, if not impossible,to
force through price increases.

FT  30 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Gilt repos
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Some in the gilt market were expecting the Chancellor to announce the
creation of an 'open repo' market yesterday. So there was mild
disappointment when he only announced a consultation exercise. Even so, the
Bank of England's consultation process looks a formality. Investors should
soon be able to borrow and lend government bonds freely. The gilts market
will then enjoy greater liquidity and investors will find it easier to go
short.
A parallel review by the Inland Revenue is expected to lead to interest on
gilts being paid gross of tax. Meanwhile, the Treasury's current examination
of government debt arrangements could result in a more streamlined gilts
issuing process. All in all, by the middle of next year, the UK will
probably sport a thoroughly modern government bond market tailored to the
needs of investors.
Such reforms carry possible dangers. If the government takes risks with
inflation, speculators will find it easier to punish it by selling gilts
short. But provided a firm line on inflation is maintained, the government
will benefit by shaving a few basis points off the cost of public funding.

FT  30 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Profligacy postponed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke's second Budget can easily be criticised as dull. But, as
far as financial markets are concerned, that may be no bad thing. The fall
in public spending projections - in line with lower inflation - and
consequent drop in the public sector borrowing requirement were widely
expected. The Budget was essentially neutral. This will not cause
celebration, but there should at least be some comfort that the chancellor
has not done anything foolish.
One hope is that the Budget will play well abroad. Foreign investors may
focus on the fact that the UK's public finances are in relatively good shape
compared with those of many of its peers. That could lead to some further
narrowing in the yield gap between gilts and US Treasury bonds.
Nevertheless, with the yields on Treasuries again rising above 8 per cent
yesterday, gilts will be hard-pushed to make headway in the short run.
The stock market should be mildly pleased that there were no measures to
control dividend payments by reducing the tax credit received by tax-exempt
investors. Nor was there any attempt to crack down on the potential tax
breaks associated with share buy-backs. So regional electricity companies
and other under-geared groups may still be able to hand back cash to their
shareholders in a tax-efficient manner.
The big worry remains that this year's fiscal prudence will be followed by
profligacy next year. If economic growth is stronger than the 3.25 per cent
forecast for 1995, the PSBR will drop more rapidly. Mr Clarke would then
have a ready-made excuse to bribe voters with pre-election tax cuts. Nothing
he said yesterday has reduced the likelihood of this course of action.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Leading Article: The Norse spirit prevails
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the end, the Norse spirit prevailed. Norway's rejection of the European
Union on Monday reflected the country's sense of self-reliance and many
Norwegians' fears of the disadvantages stemming from membership of the
Brussels club. The result was virtually identical to that of the 1972
referendum on European Community membership, but the longer-term impact on
Norway will be much greater than 22 years ago.
As Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the prime minister, warned last week, Norway
now risks a reduction in political and economic links with its neighbours.
The EU will be extended next year through the accession of Austria, Finland
and Sweden, but without the northern-most member of a group of countries
that can no longer be termed the Nordic 'bloc'.
Norway's population is equivalant to 1.2 per cent of that of the 15-member
Union and its GDP to 1.5 per cent. The rebuff is not the setback for
European integration that would have been caused by a No in Sweden a
fortnight ago, but it is regrettable above all in the security field.
Although Norway remains a member of Nato, rejection of EU membership by a
country that shares a frontier with Russia leaves a gap in the EU's
embryonic strategy of building a common defence policy within the Western
European Union.
As far as Norway itself is concerned, the economy is robust enough to
withstand any short-term repercussions. It continues to benefit from access
to the single market brought by the European Economic Area. However, voters
wishing to rescue Norwegian sovereignty may ultimately be disappointed.
Alone among Nordic countries, Norway will have no part in decision-making
over single market rules. Additionally, the EEA's importance will be
diminished as its main members join the EU next year. By increasing
longer-term uncertainty about Norway's economic links, the vote may deter
foreign manufacturing investment needed to shift the economy away from
dependence on hydrocarbons and fishing.
Norwegian No campaigners have drawn parallels with Switzerland, which in a
still stronger rejection of European integration turned down the EEA and by
extension the EU in 1992. However, Norway's more fragile economic base ill
disposes it to become the Switzerland of the north. In any case, many Swiss
are having second thoughts about the 1992 decision.
The EU must keep the door ajar for both Norway and Switzerland to reapply
later in the decade. Meanwhile EU leaders need to heed an important message
from all three Nordic referendums this autumn: in no country has there been
an enthusiastic endorsement of the EU. Addressing perceived shortcomings in
the Union's decision-making structures and its economic performance is now
more crucial than ever. The EU can prosper only if it wins the loyalty of
the citizens of Europe. At present, that condition is a long way from being
achieved.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Loosening of the corporate web: Japan's company networks,
the keiretsu, seem to be adapting to changing conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan has long been criticised for excluding foreign companies from its
markets by non-tariff barriers, such as allegedly cartel-like industrial
groups and opaque distribution systems.
Its US trade critics say that one of the most powerful impediments to the
entry of foreign companies into Japan's markets is the keiretsu system of
corporate families. These bind together corporate Japan in a web of mutual
protection, ownership and alliances, and make Japanese companies all but
impervious to hostile takeovers.
Now, however, there is evidence that the web is loosening, as alliances that
have lost their commercial value are discreetly severed and crossholdings of
shares sold off. The keiretsu are reorganising to make more efficient use of
management and capital in the aftermath of the worst recession since the
second world war.
These diversified families of industrial companies are often built around
banks and general trading houses like the so-called horizontal keiretsu, the
three largest of which are Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo. The other model
is the vertical keiretsu, which consists of a chain of dealers and suppliers
headed by a manufacturer such as Toyota, Matsushita or Nippon Steel.
They form a weighty elite in Japanese business life. The top six horizontal
keiretsu employ nearly 5 per cent of the Japanese labour force and account
for 16 per cent of corporate sales. Because of their vague structure, their
boundaries are hard to define, so their influence on the economy is much
greater.
The links between keiretsu family members are traditionally forged through
mutual exchanges of finance, contracts, managers and technology. These are
supported by multiple cross-shareholdings, with members typically holding
small equity stakes of less than 5 per cent of each other. No single member
has decisive control, but total holdings by members of the same keiretsu can
amount to an invulnerable 90 per cent of an individual company's equity
capital.
Keeping it in the family is generally recognised to have been a factor in
the postwar success of some of Japan's top companies. It has also
contributed to the traditional stability of Japan's capitalism, with its
lifetime employment, loyal shareholders and cheap long-term bank finance.
Foreign competitors argue that these qualities give keiretsu - by which they
usually mean Japan at large - the advantages of being immune to hostile bids
and less prone to bankruptcy than themselves. They form cosy cartels at home
and abroad and succeed in 'keeping outsiders out and insiders in', complains
a recent report for the US congress.
Japan's keiretsu appear to have something in common with continental
European conglomerates in countries such as France, Germany and Sweden, many
of which share their belief in long-term relationships - and their aversion
to hostile bidders. But the similarity is deceptive: European conglomerates
tend to have a central holding company, where strategy is formed. There has
been no equivalent centre for keiretsu since the abolition of the zaibatsu
holding companies after the second world war by the US occupying forces (an
attempt to eliminate the industrial groups that had monopolised the prewar
economy).
A consequence of having no holding company is that the disappearance or
weakening of a keiretsu member causes little damage to the rest of the
group. It resembles a hydra, with no central brain yet equipped with many
tentacles, each able to repair itself independently. The European
conglomerate has a simpler and more vulnerable design, more like an octopus.
Some of Japan's trade critics argue that the banks and trading companies
that tend to do business with most members of a keiretsu act as their nerve
centres. Each keiretsu also holds a regular, usually monthly, presidential
council, when the heads of member companies meet for a chat, another
opportunity for co-ordination.
But they are diffuse centres, and getting more diffuse at that. Japanese
banks, unlike their European counterparts, exercise little boardroom power,
unless a company is in serious trouble.
There is evidence that the keiretsu system is adapting to the globalisation
of its markets. The old corporate groups are becoming more open to doing
business with foreign partners. Mitsubishi, for example, is expanding its
ties with Daimler-Benz, the German automotive and aerospace group - these
are designed to help Daimler-Benz gain a foothold in Japan and south-east
Asia, while strengthening Mitsubishi's international competitiveness.
There are also signs of a watering down in the system of
cross-shareholdings. Keiretsu members sold Y1,550bn (Pounds 10bn) of shares
in each other in the first eight months of this year, well on the way to
beating last year's record Y2,148bn, itself more than double the previous
year, according to the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The reduction in mutual equity
stakes has been strongest in traditional manufacturing industries where
keiretsu are strong, such as paper and pulp, cable, electrical machinery and
transport equipment, says Nomura Research Institute.
Overall, the crossholdings that NRI has been able to track down fell
marginally from 29.3 per cent of the total stock market to 28.9 per cent
last year. But the institute suspects that the changes within individual
sectors are much bigger and the overall figure itself may be larger because
of unreported share sales.
If the keiretsu system is loosening up, it is doing so strictly under the
control of its main players. Most of the cross-shareholdings sold recently
were placed with friendly shareholders rather than in the open market, says
Mr Keith Donaldson, director of equity research for Salomon Brothers Asia.
Another sign that the keiretsu are changing is that they are broadening
their purchasing patterns, buying more of their materials and components
outside their groups. According to the Fair Trade Commission, Japan's
anti-trust body, the average share of keiretsu members' sales to each other
slipped from 7.64 per cent in 1989 to 6.85 per cent in 1992 and is
continuing to slide as the yen's strength makes imports cheaper.
The trend is especially strong in the car industry, which is more exposed
than most to international competition. Toyota has been reducing its
dependence on its components affiliate, Nippondenso, since instructing it to
start making parts for Nissan four years ago. Last March, Isuzu, the
truckmaker, and Suzuki, the producer of minicars, cut their business ties
after 13 years of making each other's vehicles, on the grounds that they had
outlived their purpose.
Some believe this marks the beginning of the end for the system. 'In the
next two decades, keiretsu will become a thing of the past. They were good
at rebuilding Japan and good at international competition when it was
advantageous to have a main bank at the centre of your grouping,' predicts
Mr Kazuo Chiba, counsellor to Mitsui, the oldest and most distinguished
keiretsu. 'That is now becoming irrelevant.'
Yet the pace of change is dictated by the keiretsu themselves, reflecting
the instinctive Japanese distaste for uncontrolled competition. There is
still a gulf between Japanese capitalism, where allegiance to customers,
employees and other group members is what counts, and Anglo Saxon
capitalism, where shareholder value comes first.
Even if keiretsu were to vanish, that gulf would remain, since the values
they embody are at the heart of Japanese capitalism. Much of the stock
market value of Japanese companies - keiretsu Mitsubishi or non-keiretsu
Sony - lies in unwritten loyalties between management, shareholders, workers
and a multitude of special business interests.
That is why Japanese corporate culture remains resistant to hostile takeover
bids. Such a bid would end up devaluing the company because it would wreck
those valuable links.
'Japanese companies are not to be treated as if they are commodities,'
explains Mr Katsuhiro Nakagawa, a director-general at the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry, with long experience of lecturing US
officials about keiretsu.
As for the presidential councils, Mitsui's Mr Chiba swears that they have
become blurred shadows of their former businesslike selves. 'They don't
discuss business per se, just information in a general sense. It was more
dynamic in the old days,' says Mr Chiba.
However, while keiretsu may be an ageing component of Japanese capitalism,
they appear to be adjusting to a tougher new environment, in which Japanese
business relationships are becoming more sensitive to market forces. It
would not be the first time that Japan's adaptability has surprised its
competitors.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Mitsubishi's extended family
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mitsubishi, the most tightly interwoven of Japan's keiretsu corporate
families, is a classic example of how formerly cosy group ties are being
subjected to market forces.
It is an empire of 216,000 employees, prominent in businesses ranging from
banking to beer, shipping and shipbuilding, property, oil, aerospace and
textiles. On average, the 29 companies at the heart of the group hold 38 per
cent of each other's shares, above the average for keiretsu corporate
families.
Mitsubishi companies exchange more directors than do other keiretsu and have
a long record of rallying member companies from different parts of the group
to co-operate on projects, one of the main competitive advantages of the
keiretsu system.
Tokyo's business district, Marunouchi, is dominated by the headquarters of
15 Mitsubishi group companies, known as Mitsubishi Village, a visual symbol
of their central role in Japan's industrial establishment.
Intra-group co-operation can be taken less for granted since the on-set of
recession in 1991 prompted management across the group to place
profitability, rather than gaining market share, as the prime objective,
says Mr Masayoshi Hayashikawa, general manager of planning at Mitsubishi
Corporation, the trading company near the heart of the group.
This new approach is best illustrated by the recent decision of Nippon
Yusen, a shipper in the group, to buy South Korean ships for the first time,
rather than from its usual supplier, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The yen's
rise has made Japanese shipbuilding costs 30 per cent higher than South
Korea's. 'A mutually beneficial relationship in steel and ships? That is a
thing of the past,' says Mr Tsuda Yoshida, managing director of Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries.
Similarly, MHI recently decided to use Nissho Iwai, a member of the Sanwa
keiretsu, to sell its ownheavy machinery in Indonesia.
Mitsubishi group members also have no qualms about declining requests from
Mitsubishi Estate to take space in one of the world's most expensive
buildings, the under-occupied Y270bn, 80-floor, Landmark Tower in Yokohama.
However, family members still close ranks when business interests or
opportunities are at stake.
Landmark Tower, for example, is a classic example of the kind of mistimed
property development that has brought many developers to their knees. The
project was started by Mitsubishi Estate just before the spectacular
collapse in inflated asset prices four years ago and completed in July last
year, in the depth of the recession.
An independent company might have been forced to dump the project. Yet
Mitsubishi Estate was able to carry on, confident that Mitsubishi Bank would
continue funding the project through good times and bad. Landmark Tower may
be a white elephant today, but even the most critical property analysts
believe that any company that can afford to continue owning the tower will
end up, in a few years, with one of the finest assets in the domestic
property market.
But perhaps the most enduring quality of the keiretsu system, says Mr
Hayashikawa, is its ability to pass information fast around the corporate
family.
In Mitsubishi's case, the vehicle for this is the so-called 'Friday Club' at
which the bosses of the top 29 member companies meet for a chat over lunch
on the second Friday of each month, on the top floor of the Mitsubishi
Building in Marunouchi.
It is at this gathering that intelligence can be shared, paving the way for
group companies to work together. An example of how this team-work can still
pay dividends is the co-operation between Mitsubishi's trading, oil
exploration and oil refining arms in making, off the coast of Vietnam last
June, the largest oil discovery by a Japanese company for 35 years.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Saudi squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For most of the past three decades, British chancellors of the exchequer
would have happily swapped places with Saudi Arabian ministers of finance
when it came to drawing up their annual budgets. Even at the start of the
1980s, Saudi oil revenues were still flowing so plentifully that spending
levels were decided principally by the absorption limitations of the
economy. What was left swelled the reserves. And such was the cushion of
reserves that even a poor year for oil revenues required no early policy
response.
However, the Gulf war cost most of the reserves and today the two ministers
have far more in common. Each is battling to cut spending: one, in order to
provide scope for eventual tax cuts, which might just persuade the
electorate to allow the government to continue in power; the other, to avoid
taxation, which if introduced might just persuade the public of the need for
representation.
The more drastic action has been announced, if not fully acted upon, by the
government in Riyadh. This year's budget, unveiled in January, called for
overall spending cuts of 19 per cent. Next year's, now under preparation,
aims to take another step towards achieving a balanced budget within five
years, and given the continued flatness in oil prices should involve further
sharp spending cuts.
Assessing the success so far achieved is difficult because of the manner in
which Saudi Arabia has historically approached government overspending.
Instead of wielding the knife, the Saudi government prefers to turn off the
tap. Programmes and projects tend not to be scrapped, but payments are
delayed. Within the kingdom, this is causing mounting pain for many
companies. Overseas, credit insurance institutions have been reviewing terms
of cover for exporters to Saudi Arabia, and in some cases refusing it on
short-term contracts.
Although oil prices have firmed as a result of the latest Opec agreement,
there is little sign of a significant upswing to ease Saudi budget
pressures. The fiscal deficit as a proportion of gross national product
should this year have dipped below the 10 per cent figure estimated in 1993,
but is still nearly double that of the UK.
Sooner, rather than later, the government will have to grasp the political
nettle and increase its revenues by other means. A more ambitious
privatisation programme is an obvious candidate, especially if it involves
subsidised public utilities. There is, equally, scope for a range of
indirect taxes aimed mainly at the kingdom's most affluent consumers. At
some point, however, Saudi Arabia will have to act like most other
middle-income countries and tax its citizens directly - a development with
important political implications for the royal family and for buyers of
Saudi oil. The kingdom should begin preparing its citizens for this now.

<TEXT>
The decision by Sir Bryan Carsberg to step down early as director general of
fair trading next May, just three years into his five-year term, is to be
regretted. He has carried out a difficult and important job well, and has
attempted to strengthen some of the more positive features of Britain's
competition policy. His departure raises uncomfortable questions about how
well these characteristics will survive.
Sir Bryan has cast himself as the consumer's champion, and approached cases
with the principle that markets should be freed from anti-competitive
restraints, unless such limits can be shown to benefit the consumer. He took
a particular interest in vertical restraints to trade, suggesting that
examples in ice-cream, fine fragrances and car dealerships were against
consumers' interests.
That approach increasingly put him in conflict with the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission, which has been generally more sympathetic to the
producer interest. The MMC has tended to regard vertical restraints as
tolerable provided that competition exists in a market. The onus of showing
that a company's practices are damaging to consumers' interest lies on the
shoulders of competitors or consumers themselves, in the MMC's view. One of
the frustrations of Sir Bryan's job, has been the MMC's rejection of his
views in such cases which have been referred by the OFT.
To an extent, Sir Bryan's approach also put him at loggerheads with the
Department of Trade and Industry, which has shown itself more favourable to
the MMC point of view. Maybe Sir Bryan should have struck an even louder and
more discordant note. His ability to do so has been partly restrained by the
steady shift of responsibility for competition policy from national capitals
to Brussels. This trend seems set to continue, as the development of the
single market brings ever more cases within the jurisdiction of the European
Commission.
Nonetheless, national authorities will still have important work to do,
notably in respect of mergers involving companies with purely domestic
business or where an overriding national interest is at stake. In his final
months, Sir Bryan must deal with several potentially controversial cases,
such as the bids for shipbuilders VSEL by GEC and BAe, and the proposed
merger of the Leeds and Halifax building societies.
Competition policy serves the consumer. As often as not, this is best
achieved by allowing companies to pursue profitable activities within
competitive markets. But the system also needs a gadfly to keep government
and business on their toes. This is how Sir Bryan worked: Mr Heseltine
should seek a replacement with similar characteristics: no yes-men should
apply. It may not be an easy job for the head hunters.

They must be feeling pretty flat in Newmarket after seeing the latest
official perk granted to South Africa's small but influential racing
industry. Henceforth, the purchase of a racehorse is to be completely tax
deductible. The capital cost can be written off against tax at a flat 25 per
cent per year depreciation over four years. The new legislation even allows
owners unhappy with their horses' performance to stay happy. When a
racehorse is retired from active competition, its entire purchase price
immediately becomes claimable against tax.

So what was Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, doing in Lima last
week? Well, mostly drawing imaginative parallels between 'booming Britain
and prosperous Peru' for the purposes of fostering two-way trade.
Two soccer-mad nations, Britain and Peru had 'chosen not to go to this
year's World Cup', Davies cheerfully pointed out.
In other words, both places were performing better in the economic than the
sporting stakes - even if the margin in Peru's case (growth rate: 10 per
cent plus this year) was rather greater.
But there had been another, loftier purpose to Davies' Lima trip, namely to
search out the British college, San Silvestre, where his Peruvian-born
secretary had been educated. Having duly tracked it down, Davies came away
still wondering what could possibly be meant by the school's motto: 'I am, I
can, I ought, I will'.

Brazil's usually squeaky clean Workers Party, which treats most businessmen
with ideological contempt, is trying to regain its virginity.
Two of its candidates in this month's gubernatorial elections announced
after winning that they received 40 per cent of their campaign funds from
construction companies. Worse, the two biggest donors - Norberto Odebrecht
and Via Engenharia - were accused by party radicals of being involved in a
Congressional corruption scandal last year. They were never investigated,
but the mud stuck.
The Workers' Party, Brazil's biggest leftwing group, is trying to
'modernise' itself and some moderates say it needs to start appealing to
business and to be less prurient.
The party's hardline leadership, though, was outraged at the donations, and
has ordered the money to be returned. Senator Lauro Campos, who found out
after he had been elected that he had unwittingly been funded from the same
campaign budget, summed up: 'I am a Marxist and do not accept corporate
financing.'

Calling all 'resting' actors below a certain height. With the pantomime Snow
White proving unusually popular this season - 20 plus productions around the
country - there is an awkward little supply and demand imbalance relating to
the long-tressed damsel's seven compact companions. Martin Brown, a
spokesman for the actors' union Equity, highlights the problem: 'We only
have 37 persons of restricted growth on our register.
'That's not necessarily the full list,' he adds brightly, 'because not every
performer of restricted growth wants to be pigeon-holed in that way.' What,

What does Railtrack's Bob Horton make of the reshuffle at his old shop - BP?
He could be forgiven for feeling a bit bitter at the sight of his old rival
David Simon getting the chair, while his former protege, John Browne, is
promoted to chief executive.
BP is a much happier ship than it was two and a half years ago when Horton
lost his job after upsetting everybody. Even so, both men owe a lot to
Horton. When Horton was given the job of turning round BP's poor performing
US affiliate, Standard Oil, Browne was his right hand man and encouraged to
make his mark on Wall Street.
As for Simon, he has followed most of the policies set in train during
Horton's controversial two and a half years at the top of BP. Simon has been
rewarded with the chairmanship of Britain's third biggest company, while
Horton was made the scapegoat for BP's problems and has been relegated to
running Railtrack.
As for Horton's old boss at BP, Sir Peter Walters, he goes from strength to
strength. Having exchanged the chairmanship of Midland for the deputy
chairmanship of HSBC Holdings, he has just taken on the chairmanship of
SmithKline Beecham and is an asset to any board of directors. Is there
anybody out there in the private sector who will give Bob Horton a second
chance? Otherwise, he'll just have to stick around long enough to hope he
can treble his salary on privatisation.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Challenge for German students
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms VERONIKA ROTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Lindemann's analysis of the German higher educational system
presents perfectly the government's arguments for reform (Survey of Germany:
'Expensive learning curve', November 21). To complete the picture I would
add a students' point of view.
Many German students have to work to finance their studies (and most of the
German students have to find accommodation in the private sector, which is
much more expensive than a place in a hall of residence which is guaranteed
the English students). They also have to study under conditions which are
quite different from English universities - overcrowded lectures and
tutorials, with an average number of 50 students per tutorial instead of six
as is usual at English universities.
As long as students have to cope with these conditions it is no wonder that
it takes them an average of seven years to finish their degrees. Tests after
two terms and fines would not change the situation. On the contrary,
students would have to work more to pay the fines.
That said, the quality of a German graduate is not comparable to the English
graduate. If you have finished your studies in Germany you are in many cases
on a level with a postgraduate English student.

FT  30 NOV 94 / A chance to flex some muscle: Falling tariffs and
productivity gains mean bright prospects for Brazil's industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's businessmen are rediscovering a long-forgotten mood of optimism.
Foreign investment is at record levels, some big car manufacturers are
increasing their output, industrial recruitment is rising, and consumer
goods producers are expecting a bumper Christmas.
Part of the cause is the sharp fall in monthly inflation, from 50 per cent
in June to about 3 per cent now, brought about by the introduction of the
new currency, the Real, in July. The election as president from January 1 of
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who played a leading role in planning the new
currency, has also provided a lift, as he is expected to press on against
inflation.
But perhaps the biggest source of hope is the minor revolution that has
occurred in the country's private sector over the past four years. Faced
with falling import tariffs and the threat of foreign competition, companies
have dramatically increased productivity.
'It's been a big shake-up for Brazil's business, but it has worked,'
according to Mr Carlos Eduardo Moreira Ferreira, president of the Federation
of Sao Paulo Industries. Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries and
of its Brazilian cigarette subsidiary Souza Cruz, agrees. The outlook for
Brazil was 'much better than for many years', he said on a recent visit. In
the opinion of analysts, however, much remains to be done
Contrary to international perceptions of Brazil as a mainly agricultural
producer, the country's economy has been dominated by industry since the
1950s. Exports of goods such as soya and coffee are dwarfed by sales of
mechanical equipment, cars, chemicals and textiles. Of last year's total
exports of Dollars 38.8bn, less than a quarter came from unprocessed goods
such as iron ore and agricultural products.
Brazil's steel and vehicle industries are among the top 10 in the world.
Brahma, its largest brewer, is the biggest in Latin America and is expanding
into new markets such as Argentina. Brasmotor, a consumer goods
conglomerate, is the world's second largest manufacturer of compressors and
over the coming years could surpass the leader in the field, Matsushita of
Japan. Brazil's two biggest food processing companies, Ceval and Sadia, have
combined annual exports of over Dollars 1bn, helped by the country's cheap
land and benign climate.
Despite this industrial pedigree, however, Brazilian manufacturers grew lazy
in the 1980s. They had little to fear from foreign competition because the
average import tariff was 51 per cent. Moreover, as inflation mounted, so
did uncertainty, and companies responded by cutting investment.
But this changed in 1990, when then-president Fernando Collor announced
sweeping free-market reforms that included tariff cuts and a privatisation
programme to reduce the state's previously dominant role in the economy. The
reforms, criticised for leading to increased unemployment and rising
imports, were unfinished when Mr Collor resigned amid corruption
allegations. Even so, their impact has been keenly felt.
The steel industry, hampered by price controls and overmanning, was sold to
the private sector and government price controls were lifted. The biggest
steelmaker, CSN, which made losses of Dollars 729m in 1990, cut its
workforce by a third ahead of privatisation last year. After introducing
other productivity gains, CSN last year made a profit of Dollars 70m on
sales of Dollars 1.9bn.
Average import tariffs have fallen to 14 per cent as the government has
prised the economy open to foreign competition. The process is due to be
taken a step further next year when most tariff barriers will be removed in
the Mercosul free trade area comprising Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and
Uruguay.
Falling tariffs have contributed to a 25 per cent increase in imports
between 1990 and last year. Total trade with Mercosul countries, previously
neglected by Brazil in favour of the US and Europe, has increased sharply,
rising by 38 per cent last year to Dollars 8.7bn. The threat of foreign
competition worked wonders for Brazilian industry.
Monark, one of the world's biggest bicycle makers, transformed its business
as import tariffs fell from 85 per cent to 20 per cent. It spent Dollars 15m
modernising its factories, halved staff numbers and factory space and
started sub-contracting to reduce costs. Simultaneously, it increased
production by 45 per cent to 1.9m units between 1990 and 1993 and cut the
retail price of its standard bike from Dollars 320 to Dollars 120.
'We are now making bikes at internationally competitive prices,' according
to Mr Daniel Galindo, marketing director.
Despite these encouraging signs, most analysts argue that economic reform
and restructuring must be taken further if Brazil is to close the
performance gap between it and more successful economies. They say Brazilian
companies need to improve productivity further. In Brazil's privatised steel
industry, for example, a recent study by the McKinsey Global Institute, the
management consultancy, suggested productivity was less than half that of US
steelmakers, which themselves lag behind world leaders such as Japan.
Mr Antonio Correa do Prado, economist at Sao Paulo's Dieese institute, says
industry still bears the scars of years of high inflation. During that
period, new investment was directed at protecting companies from the effects
of inflation, through improving stock control for example, rather than at
modernising production. As a result, Brazil has been slow to computerise in
such areas as product design, he points out.
Private sector analysts also argue that the government should relinquish
control of the substantial areas of the economy it still owns. State
controlled companies, which include the oil monopoly, Petrobras, and the
electricity industry, have annual sales equal to more than 10 per cent of
GDP, yet are widely considered inefficient.
Telebras, the state-controlled telecoms company, is protected from
competition by a state-imposed monopoly. But the government's cash shortage
over the last decade left Telebras without funds to invest in network
improvements. As a result, Brazil has only seven telephone lines per 100
inhabitants, compared to 13 in Argentina and 50 in Germany.
Many politicians oppose breaking Telebras's monopoly, but companies are
pushing hard for the development of improved communications and other
infrastructure, to aid their own expansion. Brazil's other infrastructure,
especially its education system, has also suffered from years of
under-investment which some economists say limits the country's growth
potential.
Private sector companies that survived the high inflation years are ready to
expand. Among the 500 biggest private companies average debt to equity ratio
fell from 57 per cent in 1979 to 40 per cent last year. Bankers say
companies can now comfortably absorb more debt to finance new investment.
Brazil is also in a strong position as the only country in South America
with a developed industrial base. Monark, for example, makes as many bikes
in a day as Argentina produces in a month.
This industrial muscle, combined with trade stimulants such as the Mercosul
free trade area, should allow Brazil to expand exports in South America of
products that are not yet internationally competitive on quality, or that
cannot yet compete with Asian producers on price. Mercosul and other South
American countries may become the testing ground for a more ambitious export
effort once further productivity gains have been secured.
Brazil's businessmen, who made profits despite high inflation and erratic
government policies, used to promise they could make bumper profits if they
had a stable economy and political system. With both prerequisites
apparently in place, they now have the chance to prove it.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Mutual building societies good for
corporate diversity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID MILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Halifax and after' (November 28), suggests that if the
proposed conversion of a merged Halifax/Leeds to plc status were to mark the
beginning of the end of mutuality in the mortgage finance sector that would
be no bad thing.
You point out that the 1986 Building Society Act imposes regulatory
constraints upon societies. Rather than advocate a relaxation of these
constraints you appear to prefer wholesale conversion of building societies.
The main argument in favour of this view is that 'the accommodating regime
of mutuality' creates an 'absence of accountability'. By implication, plcs
are made accountable by the need to create value for shareholders and the
threat of takeover as a sanction against failure.
There are two reasons for scepticism about this argument. First, mutuals
face a very real sanction from their members; building societies are obliged
to repurchase at face value the claims that depositors have on them at short
notice. Members can withdraw resources from the management of a mutual and
can do so independently, quickly and cheaply; no concerted action is
necessary. In contrast, a plc is under no obligation to buy back its equity
from dissatisfied shareholders at any price, let alone a fixed price. The
operation of the secondary market in company shares leaves the assets of the
company under the control of the managers, save in the event of a
successful, hostile take-over bid.
Second, if it is through the discipline of the threat of hostile takeover
that quoted companies are kept on their toes there are good reasons to
worry. The evidence on takeovers in the UK does not suggest that bad
performance is the most obvious cause of hostile bids (see Tim Jenkinson and
Colin Mayer's recent Hostile Takeovers, McGraw Hill); nor does it provide
much support for the view that takeovers result in efficiency gains. And
dramatic ups and downs in share prices over short periods justifies
scepticism about whether stock market valuations reflect a cool assessment
of the fundamental value of a company - surely a necessary condition for the
efficiency of the takeover mechanism.
The belief that all the resources devoted to intermediation in the market
for retail deposits and home loans should be under the control of management
who must respond to the signals from equity prices suggests a faith in the
operation of the stock market that is not justified by the evidence. There
is a lot to be said for diversity in corporate form.

mega-European conference looming in 1996. That is the first good news from
that quarter in many a moon.
This is not a joke. All can see that the 1996 inter-governmental conference
will be a large and contentious affair. Not everyone yet sees that the
agenda now being piled up ahead of the conference is liable to raise the
stakes over the future of Europe far higher than anything conceived of in
the parochial anxieties of the UK Eurosceptics. So high, that there are real
dangers it could go badly wrong, with long-term damaging consequences, and
not just for Britain.
What is needed to contain these dangers is an effort at a public debate that
will mobilise some serious forward thinking. Until now, this has been
virtually impossible in Britain: partly because John Major's government is
hamstrung by scandals, sleaze and its own weaknesses; partly because it is
mercilessly harried by the Eurosceptics on its right. If the Eurosceptics
now concentrate on 1996, perhaps the government will have the room to map
out a coherent strategic position before the conference. The dangers ahead
cannot be wholly exorcised by forethought, but perhaps they can be
contained.
One potential danger is of being taken by tactical surprise. Since the pound
was blown out of the exchange rate mechanism two years ago, John Major has
taken refuge in a posture of denial: economic and monetary union will
probably never happen, he says, and certainly not according to the
Maastricht timetable.
In fact, monetary union is once more not merely a possibility, but may be
feasible within the original calendar. It is conceivable that an an inner
group of countries could decide to go ahead with monetary union in 1996, in
the midst of the inter-governmental conference. Britain has an opt-out, but
the government would be uncomfortable if it had to use it, knowing that it
is not in the UK's long-term interests to be outside the European currency.
The more serious danger is that of strategic surprise. This would be a
logical consequence of Euroscepticism, which prefers to reduce Britain's
European dilemma to an ultra-simple antagonism of 'us' against 'them':
'they' want to create a super-state, but 'we' want to preserve the House of
Commons - that sort of thing.
The issues in 1996, will be quite different. The European Union was
originally created for political and strategic reasons: to stabilise the
western half of the continent. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, these
political and strategic raisons d'etre have been reasserting themselves as
never before, not least over what to do about eastern Europe.
In principle, the European Union is committed to give membership to up to 10
countries from eastern and central Europe, just as soon as they can meet the
political and economic conditions. They have given this commitment, because
Germany has decided - and the other member states have accepted, with
varying degrees of enthusiasm - that this is a vital political and strategic
interest of the Union.
There is just one problem: it is not obvious that such a large-scale
expansion can, in practice, be negotiated on any terms that would be
acceptable to the existing member states. The admission of so many new
states that are relatively backward economically will require radical
reforms in - perhaps even the abandonment of - existing redistribution
policies, such as the farm policy or the regional fund, because the cost
will be too great. Undoubtedly, the poorer of the existing member states
will try to hang on to their budgetary benefits from these policies; but if
they try too hard, they may prevent expansion into eastern Europe.
The dilemma for Britain is that such a large expansion would also require a
radical strengthening of the Union's central institutions, starting with
more and easier majority voting. This UK government is opposed to such
political moves towards a quasi-federal Europe. On the other hand, it will
want to increase its overall voting weight in the Council of Ministers at
the expense of the small countries, which enjoy a large voting premium.
Bringing in the eastern European countries will be an immensely complex
problem that will pit the interests of the north against the south, the east
against the west, and the large against the small. It would be a terrible
error if Britain, with its pretensions to strategic importance, were to give
some petty fixation on majority voting a higher importance than the larger
geopolitical context.
The Eurosceptics, and even the government, sometimes give the impression
they welcome expansion into eastern Europe, in the belief that this would
help convert the European Union into what it ought to have been all along: a
simple free-trade area. Such a view is only possible for those who totally
discount what has been happening in Russian and US foreign policy. Both are
quite difficult to predict, because increasingly erratic; but Moscow is
obviously giving a lower priority to co-operation with the west than before,
and the US is giving a lower priority to the Atlantic alliance. The
implication is that it would be very dangerous for Europe to disintegrate
into nothing more than a free-trade area.
The Eurosceptics and the UK government both need to come to terms with the
fact that the outside world has changed, and with it the argument about
Europe. If they both spend the next 12 months thinking ahead, and planning a
strategy, perhaps the worst will be avoided. It's not likely, of course; but
it must surely be our best hope.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sir John, the Letts family and the
Troubleshooter programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANTHONY LETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, James Buxton's article, 'Go away Sir John' (November 11), is so
imprecise in a number of details that he is more likely to encourage the
return of Sir John Harvey-Jones than to send him away. 1. Sir John was not
called in by the Letts family. The BBC approached the company to ask whether
they could include Letts in the second series of the Troubleshooter
programme and after some deliberation the board agreed.
2. The rent in the Battersea office was not Pounds 1m but about one third of
this figure.
3. Sir John did not propose a diversification into business gifts but rather
approved a course already adopted.
4. The paragraph about the roles of the Letts directors is misleading.
Martin and Timothy Letts had agreed to retire well before the refinancing,
and my responsibilities as chairman were formulated prior to the appointment
of a chief executive.
When assessing the contribution of the Troubleshooter programme it should be
borne in mind that the series was primarily intended to provide an
entertaining and lively approach to business.
Proposals inevitably were over-simplified and presented in a provocative
manner. The main weakness of this approach was that it could not put across
many of the changes taking place at that time. A particular example of this
was the modest investment in a constraint related production control system
which yielded significant productivity gains and enabled management to
control the plant during the seasonal peak activity.
The unsung heroes of the turnround are those who have put in many extra
hours over the past two years to bring into effect a host of improvements at
low investment cost.

<TEXT>
Sir, In the article 'Debate on Emu timing hots up' (November 28) it is said
that, according to me, 'it is already too late to contemplate Emu starting
in 1997' because of the long period required in the private sector to make
the necessary preparations.
In fact what I have argued in a number of reports is that it is too late for
the single currency - replacing all national currencies - to come into
operation in 1997. It is possible for Stage 3 of Emu to start without the
single currency. There are three possibilities:
Exchange rates are locked and nothing is done to introduce the single
currency;
At the other extreme we have a 'big bang' where the single currency replaces
all participating national currencies simultaneously;
Or we have a 'dual-currency' approach in which the single currency is used -
for some purposes - alongside participating national currencies.
The 'big bang' is not feasible for both technical and political reasons in
1997 but stage 3 of Emu could - from a technical point of view, leaving
aside economic convergence and political considerations - be possible in
1997.
I feel it is important to make this distinction between the start of stage 3
and the introduction of a single currency quite clear.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Arts: In pursuit of plays for tomorrow - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week 86 playwrights wrote to The Guardian (where else) with a letter
they had sent to subsidised theatres in Britain asserting that there had
been a drastic decrease in the production of new plays. This, they claim,
has sent British theatres into a decline and irrelevance - their phraseology
 -which is proved by the failure to attract audiences, and there must,
therefore, be a return to new work if subsidies are not to be withdrawn.
They ask each theatre to undertake to produce at least three new plays a
year, two of which must be in the main house (rather than some small
experimental area, presumably). They must be full scale productions of world
premieres by living writers, must not include pantomimes or book
adaptations, and must run for at least 18 performances. 'It is very little
to ask', they say.
My first reaction was to wonder why the list of signatories - which contains
such famous names as Arden, Pinter, and Wesker - lacks those of Lloyd Webber
and Ayckbourn. Could it be that the work of the latter pair attracts enough
paying customers to avoid the need for subsidies? If so, what does that tell
us about the others?
Next I wondered whether it had occurred to the playwrights that, until about
40 years ago, people had had to go out for their drama but that now
virtually everyone has the means of watching drama in their own home every
day. Can the writers not see that, in the age of television, to demand that
your work be done in the theatre is rather like demanding that, in the age
of the car, we go back to the horse and cart: more traditional and charming,
and possibly more enjoyable for those with the time and patience, but
impractical and too expensive for most. It would surely have made better
sense if the playwrights had written the following letter to Alan Yentob,
Michael Jackson, Marcus Plantin, Michael Grade, and David Elstein,
responsible respectively for the programming on BBC1, BBC2, ITV, Channel 4,
and Sky:
'There has been a drastic decrease in the number of new plays being produced
by British television and also in the proportion of your budgets spent on
new plays. We believe this shows an unacceptable set of priorities. The loss
of vitality caused by the abandonment of new work and the increasing
reliance upon stereotyped 60-minute drama series about the police, firemen,
criminals and so on, threatens to reduce British television, which had
become one of the most important channels for the introduction and
consideration of new ideas, to the level of a mundane medium of undemanding
entertainment.
'It was not ever thus. In the 1960s and 70s your predecessors nurtured our
predecessors, in some cases the very people whose signatures appear below,
for example David Edgar, David Hare, Mike Leigh, John MacGrath, Alan Plater
and David Rudkin. Their names may be widely known now, but that was not so
when they began working for television. Twenty five years ago there were
entire departments at the BBC and in ITV devoted to finding and bringing on
new talent. The result was what is now seen by many as a golden age of
television drama. In 1968 one umbrella title alone - the BBC's Play For
Today - commissioned work from scores of writers including Dennis Potter,
David Mercer, Simon Gray, Fay Weldon, Michael Frayn, John Mortimer, William
Trevor, Peter Nichols, and Alun Owen.
'Today the drama output of British television must be two or three times
greater than in 1968 and yet you have virtually turned your backs on the
sort of work done by the writers listed above. This is precisely the sort of
work which we believe we should be doing and you should be making available
to the public in addition to what television is already providing. We have
nothing against Martin Chuzzlewit: Tom Wilkinson is giving the performance
of his life as Pecksniff, and when you notice that it is not only the roads
which have been covered in horse dung but also the hems of the ladies'
dresses, you realise that the BBC is paying as much attention to detail as
it ever did in its classic adaptations. The fact remains that Martin
Chuzzlewit was written 150 years ago.
'We do not pretend that all your drama is that old. BBC2's Saturday night
'Performance' slot has just given us a new production of JB Priestley's
Summer Day's Dream which was much concerned with the interplay of ideas -
socialism, mysticism, capitalism - and was written in 1949. A week earlier
it was a new production of Paddy Chayefsky's 1954 American TV play Mother,
and three weeks ago in the same slot, Rattigan's The Deep Blue Sea written
in 1952. As playwrights we are of course glad to see that the work of some
of our predecessors is not forgotten, yet we find it odd that you should
choose to revive mediocre work such as this rather than commission new
material.
'True, your potboilers - Peak Practice, Soldier Soldier, Between The Lines -
are mostly contemporary, yet even in the best of them - Cracker and Finney -
the greater degree of ambition is concerned more with creating a slicker
product than with moving beyond the business of entertainment. Good though
Cracker is there is nothing very unusual in 1994 about shrewd psychological
insights into the mind of the criminal; it has been standard fare in modern
literature and Hollywood for decades. Finney is well enough acted and nicely
photographed; the funeral in the opening episode must surely be among the
Top 50 filmed funerals in British television drama this year. But since the
film noir of the 1940s, urban crime feuds of this sort have become another
staple of cinema and television drama.
'There is more thoughtful writing by living authors in Channel 4 films and
10-minute 'try-out' spots for new directors and writers on BBC2 and Channel
4, but those are rare outcrops. As a general rule you now seem to ignore the
sort of work that we offer, work of the kind that used to create such
interest among British viewers and gave British television such an
extraordinarily high standing in other countries. If you leave the seed corn
to rot, and never develop new strains, your crops will grow weak and fail.
Live theatre has done an amazing job in keeping contemporary drama alive at
a time when more modern media of communication have acquired overwhelming
popularity, but it is surely time for television, with its enormous budgets,
to resume its vital role as chief patron of living drama.'
Yours etcetera.

theatre
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Some parts of Stairway to Heaven] are so good that one is tempted to say it
is among the most promising, certainly the wittiest, new musicals for years.
Other parts are so derivative of, and inferior to, Cole Porter that they can
be dismissed as student pastiche. Still, it is astonishing start for Thomas
Morgan and Kevin Metchear, whose first piece it is.
The plot is plucked from a well-known movie which starred David Niven and
Marius Goring. In the last week of the second world war a British airman
bales out over the Channel without a parachute, having previously made radio
contact with an American girl at the base.
He should have died. Perhaps he did. The divine authorities had their eye
off the ball and did not record the event. Thus he is stuck in limbo, torn
between going to heaven or returning to earth with the girl.
All sorts of jokes - legal, ecclesiastical, philosophical, Anglo-American -
arise as the airman puts his case for going back to ground. There is a lot
of Kafka in his trial.
Morgan and Metchear have supplied the songs. If you like clever rhymes, here
they come: mariage a quatre with Cleopatra, haikus with IQs, for examples.
Best of all, and entirely in context, is 'running my department' with 'what
Descartes meant'.
Conductor 71, the role played in the movie by Marius Goring, here goes to
Martin Connor who has a splendid French accent and terrific zest: a touch of
Maurice Chevalier.
The piece won this year's Vivien Ellis prize for new musicals. At the King's
Head Dan Crawford directs. I have noticed before that he has a fondness for
the period: for instance in putting on Sir Terence Rattigan's Flare Path. He
also has a talent for putting a large cast on a small stage.
Whether Stairway is transferable depends on finding a bigger theatre where
the words, especially of the songs, would all come through. It is worth a
try. Meanwhile the King's Head beckons.
Besht Tellers is an itinerant Jewish company which made a marvellous London
debut with Telling Tales in 1991. It was an anecdotal, episodic piece that
combined pathos and wit and appeared to go down well in any language and any
tradition. Before London there was a hugely successful tour of the former
Soviet Union, playing in Russian.
Since then the company has moved on, not automatically for the better. Far
Above Rubies is so ethnocentric that one hesitates to recommend it to anyone
without a knowledge of rabbinical law.
This is the story of Bruriah, who was both the daughter and the wife of a
rabbi. Male supremacy was the order of the day, whether in the bedroom or in
the study. The rabbis made up the law as they went along. Bruriah stood up
to them, putting new interpretations on the Old Testament. In so doing she
may have been one of the world's first feminists: clearly the piece struck a
chord with the audience at the Tricycle.
The trouble is that Rubies is not much of a play. It is performed in a
statuesque Greco-Roman-Egyptian style where actions seem scarcely to matter.
One hopes that this is an aberration, not a deliberate retreat into
introversion, especially since the original talents in Besht Tellers are
still there. Rubies is written by Robbie Gringras who helped devise, and
performed in, Telling Tales. Danny Scheinmann, the co-star in Telling Tales,
appears again now. Rebecca Wolmann, a co-founder of the company, continues
to direct and does so with great confidence: perhaps too much.
Rubies was commissioned and funded by the British Arts Council. In a
slightly disconcerting programme note Ms Wolmann writes: 'Had funds been
available, I would have cast 50 women watching silently from the back of the
stage'. Such ambitions can be dangerous. Telling Tales worked because it was
simple, wise and touching: Rubies is none of those.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Arts: Mozart and Schmidt - Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the weekend we had the 25-year-old Mozart's Idomeneo conducted by Colin
Davis, now almost venerable, with the London Symphony, and then Mozart's
last work and Franz Schmidt's last symphony conducted by young Franz
Welser-Most with the London Philharmonic. It was curious to think that
Welser-Most is only a year younger than Mozart was when he wrote his Requiem
 -whereas 'old' Schmidt was considerably younger than Davis is now.
First mention must go to W-M's Schmidt; for the Fourth Symphony is a
compact, strangely moving masterpiece, but neither it nor the oeuvre that it
crowned is familiar to any London audience. On Sunday most of the
well-filled house would have come for the Requiem, and found themselves
unexpectedly gripped by the unknown Schmidt.
He was a deeply conservative Viennese composer (1874-1939, of mostly
Hungarian forbears). Like Mahler - who demanded that Schmidt should play the
cello solos whenever he conducted the Vienna Opera - he found his time for
composing sharply constricted by his professional commitments. Except in
Austria, he was forgotten after the second world war; the music of
Schoenberg and his disciples was what excited younger musicians.
For this breakthrough alone, W-M deserves kudos. His reading of the Fourth
was insistently speedy, of course, and tight-lipped - never quite relaxed or
spacious enough to let his players expand with the music (though it was good
to hear the Scherzo taken at a bristling Molto vivace at last, unlike any
recorded performance I know). But it was intelligent, cogent, even soignee;
Schmidt's grave tenderness made itself felt no less than his ingenious,
old-fashioned formality. In these post-modern days, the time is ripe for
discovering his radiant Third Symphony too, and some luminous chamber music.
The time that W-M took for Mozart's Requiem broke all records. Instead of
the elevated, slightly disembodied music we usually hear, this Requiem was
pressingly dramatic and spikey: the 'Dies irae' became a furious virtuoso
exercise. The soloists and the London Philharmonic Choir rose bravely to
W-M's frenetic demands. Mozart cannot, surely, have meant quite that - but
we were forced to ask ourselves whether the orthodox serene sanctity in this
work may not be factitious, even sentimental.
At the Barbican the night before, Davis conducted a noble Idomeneo. It is a
work close to his heart (he has recorded it twice), and here he had sterling
soloists: above all Francisco Araiza's ripely sensitive hero, Susanne
Mentzer as his unlucky son (straight-backed, sober, affecting), and Maria
Bayo's verdantly pretty voice for Princess Ilia. Nancy Gustafson, whom we
know from gentler roles, flashed and snarled as Electra, and Robert Tear
weighed in briefly but powerfully as the High Priest.
Davis seems untouched by the 'early music' trend - he used a fairly opulent
band, and let his singers linger indulgently (and anachronistically) over
their recitatives. His sympathetic grasp of the score, however, is second to
nobody's. Simon Rattle's memorable South Bank performance a few years back
was meaner and leaner; but the gracious breadth of Davis's reading told
beautifully in its own terms. In Mozart it is always a special pleasure to
hear the music sing with unforced naturalness, whatever debate there may be
about 'period' manners.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Arts: 'Don Quixote' in Stockholm - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Swedish Ballet has just acquired Nureyev's staging of Don Quixote,
and is dancing it splendidly. The company is not as well known here as it
should be. Tours take it round the world, but not to London. It boasts more
than 200 years of tradition, and a fine school. And the virtues of this
schooling provide a buoyant strength for the new Don Quixote. There was a
verve and enthusiasm to the performance I saw at the weekend which made the
old ballet sparkle.
The production was the more delightful by contrast with our own Royal
Ballet's exercise in corpse-washing which was passed off under the same
title. The Nureyev text is crammed with dances which insist upon a happy
bravura. The story is cleverly told. John Lanchbery's edition of the score
is jolly, and was driven spankingly along by the Russian conductor Renat
Salavatov. Nadine Baylis's designs are fetchingly Hispanic. The production
encourages its cast to fling any vestige of Nordic caution to the winds, and
this the Swedes joyously do.
Nureyev re-jigged the old ballet and inserted dances, yet never lost sight
of the fact that though the piece is a theatrical war-horse, it is no
spavined Rosinante, and can still gallop. So the first act bursts with
toreadors, street-dancers, classical variations, knives, pas de deux, and
every kind pimento-flavoured merriment. The second act offers gypsies,
puppets, a classical dryad scene - and a very good one, too - and a
windmill. The last act zips along. It is the most enjoyable of farragos.
The Swedish dancers cope delightfully with all this, demonstrating a nice
mixture of jokiness and academic good manners. Only the Kirov and Bolshoi
know how much too far you can push the classic dance in being wildly
Spanish. But the Swedes know how to flash and dash, and their 'school' means
that movement is clear, generous. The ranks of soloists and corps de ballet
are secure - variations were very well done, notably by Eugenia Zetterstrom
as the Dryad Queen - and Madeleine Onne was a bright, endearing Kitri. She
set out the choreography with a beguiling vivacity, and she pouts and flirts
delightfully, striking sparks off character and dances with prettiest ease.
Her Basilio was Jan-Erik Wikstrom, who is astonishing. A dancer in his early
twenties, Wikstrom, has a physique rather like Nureyev's, and he takes to
all the devilish complications that Nureyev stuffed into the role as if
specially made for him. There results a reading that Nureyev might have
envied. Wikstrom has a beautifully smooth technique. Nothing is forced,
everything is fully stated, and steps, poses, melt into the ground or into
the next phrase. He offers a physical cantilena as serene as that in Jussi
Bjorling's singing. There is a bloom to what Wikstrom does, and a masculine
grace devoid of mannerism. I thought at first he might prove too 'quiet' as
an interpreter for a role that is about showing-off; but when the dance
seizes him, he is a marvel, not least because of the elegance of his means.
His reading has charm, and moments, as with Nureyev, when classicism is
audacious, proud. Wikstrom's is a rare and beautiful talent.
I have reported before on the Royal Swedish Ballet, with pleasure. This
staging shows its artists at their admirable best. We really must see the
company in London soon.

Wildlife Showcase (8pm BBC2) and Survival Special (9pm ITV) remind us of
what television has come to do uniquely well. The latter, a look at the
perpetually embattled Serengeti, is especially riveting. Wildlife of a less
predictable nature gathers in the jungle clearing of The Midnight Hour
(12.05am BBC2). This political forum has the uncertainty of a safari in
search of a threatened species. Those elusive creatures, politicians, have
grown wary of the attention they once courted and are correspondingly hard
to pin down. Their mimicry can be splendidly entertaining, particularly when
making the noises they think we like to hear. How much of it learnt
parrot-fashion? Sometimes you could swear these shy beasts, with their
mixture of evasiveness and bouts of exhibitionistic showing off, are human.
Long lunchers or job-sharers can catch up with the urban jungle of those
women cops in Cagney and Lacey (2.15pm BBC1), their blend of heart and
toughness brilliantly acted. They make LA Law (12.10am Channel 4) look plush

FT  30 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: Amazon's saviour - A project
that provides constant monitoring of the world's biggest rainforest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By early next century, if the government and a handful of private
contractors finish the job in time, Brazil will be ready to tackle its
biggest public relations problem - a reputation for abusing the Amazon.
Environmentalists claim that illegal logging, delays in marking out Indian
lands and environmentally-damaging mining are likely to continue, but the
Brazilian government will have a trump card to play against any critical
environmental lobbyists: Sivam.
Sivam, or the System for Vigilance over the Amazon, is one of the most
ambitious environmental projects in the world. Set to cost about Dollars
1.39bn (Pounds 840m) and take five years to install, it is a network of
radars, satellites and ground sensors which will be linked to provide
constant monitoring over Brazil's share of the Amazon basin, an area which
accounts for nearly 60 per cent of the country and is about 10 times bigger
than France.
Sivam will, for the first time, provide accurate and widespread information
on the Amazon's environment and how it is changing. It will provide evidence
to counteract what the Brazilian government considers exaggerated or
misleading reports about sensitive subjects such as deforestation. It will
also, thanks to improved air traffic and radar systems, help in the fight
against drug smuggling and unlicenced mining.
These measures are likely to be welcomed by environmental groups. But
Sivam's ultimate aim is more controversial. The information gathered by the
system will form the basis for Brazil's development of the region into the
next century.
Brigadier Marcos Antonio de Oliveira, who will be appointed president of the
commission overseeing Sivam, says that accurate information is vital if
Brazil is to plan for the 'sustained development' of an area as vulnerable
as the Amazon. He adds that Brazil wants to match the wealth enjoyed by
countries in the north, and it is not feasible to make the Amazon immune
from development.
'The Amazon's resources will be used sooner or later, whatever happens. What
we need to do is develop it rationally. But it must be left to Brazil to
decide when and how to use these resources,' he says.
The Sivam project, announced at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, was designed
partly to deflect criticism over Brazil's environmental record. Its
supporters said better communications could strengthen the government's hand
in the Amazon, where edicts to stop environmental damage were rarely carried
out, mainly because of the region's size and poor communications.
Government, environmental and Indian rights agencies were often blocked by
local leaders involved in illegal activities.
The tender for installing Sivam was won in July by a consortium led by
Raytheon, the US group. Raytheon will start work on a project plan with its
main Brazilian partner, computer and control company ESCA, once the contract
is signed with the Brazilian government. Antonio de Almeida Filho, an ESCA
director, said he hoped the contract would be signed this year, once
financing is approved by the Senate.
Sivam's main weapon will be at least 300 monitoring stations - de Oliveira
says the number could double - which will monitor up to 17 characteristics
such as air and water quality or humidity. The stations will transmit
regular readings via radio or fixed telecommunications links to three
regional processing centres, in turn co-ordinated in the capital Brasilia.
Monitoring will have several immediate uses. Soil traces in the Amazon's
river systems could be analysed to track down illegal mining, and to measure
damage caused by legal excavation. Water and air pollution from large towns,
such as Manaus, will be assessed. The Amazon's weather systems, which are
still poorly understood, will also be recorded in detail for the first time
and climatic change across the area will be measurable.
A network of long-range radars will be installed to watch Brazil's borders
and to improve air traffic control over main air corridors. In other areas,
especially those close to drug shipment sites near Colombia and the
Brazilian state of Acre, air movements will be monitored by airborne radar
likely to be installed on aircraft made by Embraer, the Brazilian
manufacturer.
Aerial detection will also be important for monitoring forest fires. Brazil
currently uses satellite photographs provided by its space research
institute. However, de Oliveira says three spotter planes will photograph
fires so that information can be gathered and assessed more quickly to help
provide evidence against individuals accused of starting them. Fires are
often used to clear an area of forest for agriculture or other purposes.
According to some specialists, 0.5 per cent of the Amazon basin is cut down
or burnt a year.
Government critics argue that Sivam will make only a limited difference
because, even when the government has information about the Amazon, it
rarely acts. For example, wildcat miners operate illegally in several
demarcated Indian areas, sometimes with the apparent knowledge of local
authorities.
One environmental adviser says Sivam will be constrained without a
government commitment to prosecute illegal activities in the Amazon, and
crack down on corruption in local justice and police departments.
De Oliveira argues this is not the case. The problem, he says, is that when
the government does have reliable information, it is not co-ordinated within
public departments, a failure Sivam will resolve. 'Sivam, by providing
better information, will strengthen the public institutions in the Amazon.
We want to strengthen the communities living there, not just the indigenous
people, but the workers living there and the immigrants who have settled
there,' he says.
At the same time, facts and figures for assessing how best to develop the
area will be stored and analysed. 'The Amazon will have to be developed, but
what we have to do is respect its fragility,' he says.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: Green groups merge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International business is hoping to bolster its influence on environmental
policymaking with a merger between the two most active industrial lobbying
groups - the Geneva-based Business Council for Sustainable Development
(BCSD) and the World Industry Council for the Environment (Wice) in Paris,
reports Frances Williams.
The new World Business Council for Sustainable Development, to be based in
Geneva from January 1, aims to mobilise business behind 'sustainable
development' and promote high company standards of environmental management.
Rodney Chase, a managing director of British Petroleum and chairman-to-be of
the WBCSD, says the new grouping will give industry a more effective voice
on these issues in the future.
'Going green' could create more than 700,000 jobs in the UK over the next 10
to 15 years rather than destroying businesses and costing jobs as is
generally believed, writes Deborah Hargreaves.
According to a report published last week by pressure group Friends of the
Earth, adoption of environmental protection measures could save the
government Pounds 3bn a year in unemployment benefit.
'One of the main reasons why government and industry won't go forward with
environmental protection policy is because they believe it will cost money
and jobs. We want to tackle those misconceptions and show that sustainable
development can bring real economic benefits,' says Charles Secrett,
executive director of FoE.
Secrett says the report's findings were based on experience in other
countries with a realistic, pragmatic approach. For example, the report
suggests that if Pounds 500m were channelled into rail investment instead of
road building, the net creation in jobs would range from 3,000 to 8,150.
This is based on research in Germany which shows that for every DM100m spent
on public transport instead of roads 1 1/2 to two times more jobs are
created.

FT  30 NOV 94 / People: Improved infrastructure for Aerostructures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The six-week hunt for a new chief executive for the troubled Aerostructures
Hamble ended yesterday with the appointment of Christopher West.
Southampton-based Aerostructures, which makes aircraft parts, last month saw
its shares collapse to 24p after a second profits warning following
production problems. Andy Barr, the chief executive who led the flotation at
120p a share in June, took early retirement, citing stress-related illness.
West, 46, has been acting as an independent consultant with a special
interest in aerospace since leaving Westland Helicopters in 1992 after two
years as operations director. Most of his working life has been spent in the
aerospace industry. From 1968 to 1990 he was with British Aerospace, former
owner of Aerostructures and still its principal customer.
At one time, West was flight test engineer for the Tornado. He eventually
became managing director of BAe's Kingston and Dunsfold unit, responsible
for marketing and developing the Harrier, with a turnover of Pounds 400m and
a staff of 5,200.
Lord King of Wartnaby, Aerostructure's chairman, says West, who takes up his
post on January 2, has a wealth of experience, valuable 'both in terms of
manufacturing techniques and customer relationships'.
David Ring, who has acquitted himself well as acting chief executive since
Barr retired, will revert to his role as commercial director.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: Between a rock and a hard
place - One quarry's fight for planning permission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MARTINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the heart of Dorset in southern England an argument is taking place over
the happiness of sand lizards.
The lizards are indigenous to an area extensively quarried by ARC, the
Hanson subsidiary and one of the biggest aggregates-providers in Britain.
ARC, along with a local conservation group, claim the lizards are content to
live in areas of excavated sand created by large-scale extraction.
The Council for the Protection of Rural England, however, picked the ARC
sites at Hyde Heath and Portland as two of five quarries which illustrated
the danger to the environment caused by planning permissions dated before
environmental legislation passed in the 1980s.
ARC's reaction to its inclusion on the blacklist was both speedy and
furious. The company's good relations with the local wildlife trust - ARC
claims it has handed two-thirds of Hyde Heath, designated a site of special
scientific interest, over to the trust - and its general restoration of
quarried land were featured in the local media and trade press.
But ARC's response was based on larger national issues than the plight of
reptiles. CPRE's chief demand, set out in its response to a government
consultation paper on old planning permissions earlier this year, is that
such permissions should be updated to comply with modern standards. Where a
company fails to update the sites, planning permissions should be revoked.
The companies should pay for the updating or suffer the closure of the sites
without compensation.
The issue of compensation is set to prove the most contentious before the
paper is made law. The government is proposing that compensation be paid
where changes to comply with new planning regulations affect asset values by
restricting the scope for excavation. It says that there will be no
compensation in some cases, where changes are made to meet modern
regulations. It says this would apply to 'sensory' conditions, such as noise
levels at an excavation site, where the change does not affect earnings.
The CPRE, however, says the compensation proposals are too complicated. 'It
is particularly on the issue of compensation that we fear the proposals will
founder.'
Lilli Matson, CPRE's minerals campaigner, calls the proposals a 'recipe for
muddle'. 'There are going to be long legal wrangles over what constitutes a
sensory condition and what should be compensated.' The aggregates industry
enjoys better conditions over environmental regulation than many others, she
says.
The government proposals are contested by industry groups which claim they
make a nonsense of cost predictions at the start of construction. The
British Aggregate Construction Materials Industries, the trade federation,
says the cost of complying with the 1990 Environmental Protection Act alone
will be Pounds 100m and that this can hardly be seen as special treatment.
'How,' it asks, 'would householders feel if their
planning rights and thus their houses were taken away without compensation?'
At the heart at the issue lies the estimated demand for aggregates. The
government's own predictions suggest that demand for construction aggregates
will rise from 240m tonnes in 1991 to between 330m and 365m by 2006.
Environmentalists such as the CPRE and Friends of the Earth argue that the
government's road-building programme - which they oppose - makes up a large
amount of that total. They believe that more material could also be provided
by recycling.
ARC seems to have won the war locally - the Dorset CPRE campaigner has
applauded the company's conservation work and 'the lizards are happy'
according to the local paper - but its sites are still on an environmental
blacklist.
John Mortimer, ARC group operations executive, fears that moves by groups
such as CPRE have a 'dripping tap effect' on government policy and public
opinion, however. The government paper - likely to become law in the next
parliamentary session - will reveal how strong the drip is.

FT  30 NOV 94 / People: Conron puts wings on his heels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Conron, newly appointed director of planning and financial controls at
Mercury Communications, clearly believes in his company's products.
Yesterday he was closeted for several hours in a video-conference with
colleagues across the Atlantic as he put the finishing touches to measures
to cut costs and improve performance at British Telecommunication's largest
competitor.
Conron's appointment is part of a shake-up at Mercury designed to cut up to
2,000 jobs in a bid to boost competitiveness. Conron, 44, essentially
replaces Jeff Phillips, director of finance, who in Mercury's words: 'is now
being considered for other opportunities within the Cable and Wireless
group'. C&amp;W owns 80 per cent of Mercury.
The telecoms operator has been suffering declining profitability with the
entry of new competitors in the UK market and no longer enjoys privileged
duopoly status with BT.
Conron, currently vice-president of finance at Cable &amp; Wireless Inc, worked
for C&amp;W in the US for 10 years and for Arthur Andersen, the management
consultants, before that. There has been no honeymoon period at Mercury. He
arrived from the US last Sunday, went straight to his desk and has been
there virtually ever since, working on the details of the cost-cutting
scheme which is expected to be announced next week. He reports directly to
Duncan Lewis whose appointment earlier this month as chief executive was
also part of the shake-up.
Rod Attwooll, group managing director, has also left his post at Mercury and
is looking for a new position within the group. Attwooll was a major force
behind a programme of change and revitalisation at Mercury whose first phase
'Ignition' finished in July.

FT  30 NOV 94 / People: Piol puts Acorn in his school
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Elserino Piol, who takes over as chairman of Acorn, the UK schools computer
maker, from Ernesio Musumeci, this week, is one of the stalwarts of the
European computer industry.
Now 63, Piol (right) has spent his working life keeping pace with a computer
industry which has continued to change at ever increasing speed; he has been
with Olivetti, the Italian computer manufacturer which has a majority stake
in Acorn, all that time.
His latest responsibility is a further indication of the importance Olivetti
is attaching to multimedia and the infor-mation superhighway.
Piol is chairman of Olivetti Telemedia, a grouping of the company's
international ventures in the multimedia area. Omnitel-Pronto Italia, the
mobile phone consortium in which Olivetti has a significant stake is not
part of the group.
It includes Acorn, however, and its subsidiary Online Media, launched this
year to exploit the market for interactive multimedia. Online Media is part
of a consortium which has mounted an experiment on Cambridge Cable in the
UK's fenlands. The project, started this year, involves a range of services
including home shopping and home banking. Its chief executive, Malcolm Bird,
has been named an Acorn director.
It is all a far cry from the computer industry Piol enteredin 1953, when he
joined Olivetti-Bull, an Olivetti subsidiary, after studying economics and
business at the Catholic University of Milan.
From 1959 to 1963 he was director of marketing and sales for Olivetti's
computer division and in 1966 became director of group marketing. After a
spell in the US as senior vice-president of Olivetti Corporation of America,
he served in a number of top positions and was elected to the Olivetti board
in 1987.
As chairman of Olivetti Telemedia, he has responsibility for Olivetti's
operations in a market which could eventually be worth Dollars 3bn.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Management: Black to the future - US companies are finding
that racial diversity among staff is a business imperative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The guest list of companies at the top table could have been culled from
Fortune magazine's top companies in the US. One by one they took turns at
the podium to declare before the 3,500 dinner guests how much their company
would be donating. The loudest cheer was reserved for the single biggest
contribution - Dollars 168,000 (Pounds 102,500) - from Ford Motor.
This was no run-of-the-mill fund-raising event or political gathering, in
spite of an earlier video-taped greeting from Ron Brown, the US commerce
secretary. For, like him, almost everyone at the San Francisco Hilton that
evening in September was black, and this was the closing banquet at the
National Black MBA Association's 16th annual congress.
That evening's donations to the NBMBAA's scholarship fund was a clear sign
of the way US corporations have started to embrace the issue of racial
diversity among employees.
Such moves began in earnest with the publication in 1987 of Workforce 2000,
a report by the Hudson Institute, a think-tank based in Indianapolis. Chief
among the projections was that by 2000, only 15 per cent of people entering
the workforce would be American-born white males, compared with 47 per cent
in 1987.
The figures took corporate America by surprise, as many businesses realised
they were ill-prepared for the labour market in the new millennium.
While labour force researchers say some of the Workforce 2000 report's
conclusions may have been exaggerated, attempts to recruit and promote
minorities are gathering pace and growing more sophisticated.
'There is no corporation in this country today that can afford not to take
the issue of diversity seriously. It is not only a moral issue or even a
legal one. It has become a business imperative for the whole of the US,'
says Bernard Milano, partner in charge of recruitment and personnel
administration at KPMG Peat Marwick in the US.
Milano speaks from experience. Two-and-a-half years ago 'a very important
client, let's just say a Fortune 100 company, told us they were not happy
when we sent four white males to a meeting with senior management'. He
admits 'we'd had messages in the past, but this one really hit us'. With
only seven black partners out of 1,500, KPMG has been forced to sub-contract
work to minority practices where clients have indicated a strong preference
for dealing with a racially diverse team.
The firm has now instituted a Dollars 4m diversity programme. Attempts to
recruit suitably qualified blacks have met with little success, so KPMG's
strategy is to hire people it can train for careers in accountancy and the
financial sector generally. Scholarships have been extended to students from
minority organisations, which has encouraged traditionally black colleges to
accredit themselves with recognised industry bodies.
A PhD project has been established by KPMG to help blacks in business move
into academia - the first group of potential recruits is to meet at a
conference in Chicago in the middle of December - an initiative that KPMG
believes should encourage black students to consider business and finance
courses. Finally, a professional body has been created for African-American
PhD students, designed to help them share experiences and avoid being
isolated.
Over the past few years professional groups have provided one of the main
points of contact for US companies. Organisations similar to the NBMBA
Association, which has a membership of around 3,000, have also been
established for Hispanics and Asian minorities. 'What we are about is
creating economic and intellectual wealth for the black community,' says
Antoinette Malveaux, executive director of the NBMBA Association.
Apart from serving as a networking forum, its main goals are getting
African-Americans into the higher echelons of the US corporate sector and
increasing the level of business education at all levels.
Twenty eight per cent of NBMBA Association members earn between Dollars
50,000 and Dollars 75,000 a year; 18 per cent claim earnings of Dollars
75,000 to Dollars 99,000 a year and some 19 per cent earn more than Dollars
100,000 a year.
This helps explain the presence of more than 150 corporate exhibitors at
this year's conference in San Francisco, among them Coca-Cola, American
Airlines, Ford, Bank of America, IBM and Eastman Kodak.
'We know that by being here we can pick up good qualified people who will
suit our company and its aims,' says Janet Maderious, vice president and
manager at Bank of America, which hosted a reception at the start of the
conference.
'It's all about self interest', adds Keith Cooley, director of strategic
planning and issues management at General Motors. 'These are the type of top
customers we must get if we are to succeed.'
Over the past 15 years, companies have discovered that targeting products
and services to a particular racial group, using imagery and signals
commonly used by that group, can make a significant contribution to profits.
'When we started marketing Pampers (disposable nappies) in the 1970s, little
or no attention was paid to inner city areas where many black people lived,'
says an executive at Procter &amp; Gamble.
'The thinking was that these people would not be able to afford them. Not
having blacks in the relevant departments and levels who knew about the
lifestyle of many blacks meant that for a long time P&amp;G missed out on big
profits - few knew that although the product was expensive, many blacks had
no washing machines at home. Thus they were an ideal market for such a
product.'
Stephen Lewis, national president of the NBMBAA and associate director of
new business development at Ford, says: 'A person may look at a company like
Ford and say: that company supports my community so I will support it with
my dollars. Diversity is also about making sure your products sell in all
the markets.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Management: Adding value to the UK's tax system - Public
Services Management / John Willman meets a civil servant who initiated a
radical overhaul of the Inland Revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Change management, partnership sourcing, empowerment and benchmarking -
terms in the argot of modern management science that few would associate
with Britain's civil service. Yet the Inland Revenue, one of the oldest
government departments, is in the middle of a change programme to rival the
most ambitious private-sector corporate re-engineering projects.
It will turn upside down the assessment and collection of income tax and
other direct taxes, totalling Pounds 77bn in the last financial year, with
the aim of hugely improving the quality of service to the public.
In the 1980s, the department pulled off one of the most successful
large-scale computerisation projects in Europe, without the disruption to
service normally associated with such projects in both public and private
sectors. It also cut staff numbers from 84,000 in 1979 to around 63,000
today.
Now the department is involved in a change programme that by the end of the
1990s will provide every taxpayer with a single tax office, a simple
statement of tax paid each year, and access to high-street offices to sort
out tax problems.
'The aim is to create a flexible, efficient and responsive department that
stands comparison with the best service organisations in the public and
private sector anywhere in the world,' says Steve Matheson, deputy chairman
of the Board of Inland Revenue, the de-partment's top management body.
Matheson has been at the sharp end of the Revenue's organisational
development since the late 1970s when he devised a strategy for
computerising the tax system. He implemented it during the 1980s, and two
years ago launched the current change programme.
Until 1977, his Inland Revenue career followed a conventional civil service
pattern, when he became a trainee tax inspector in 1961, on graduating from
Aberdeen University. After running a Croydon tax district, he moved into
policy, working on the reform of corporation tax at Revenue head office.
Like many promising young civil servants, Matheson spent two years in the
Treasury working in ministerial private offices. Back at the department, he
reviewed the Revenue's computerisation plans and managed what was then
Europe's largest computer project.
In 1989 he became director general of management, effectively in charge of
the day-to-day running of the department. He realised that improving the
service to the public would have to be paid for from the existing budget.
Hence a root and branch reorganisation of the Revenue, with changes to the
tax system to refocus the department on the taxpayer. Reforms such as
letting taxpayers calculate their own tax bills and changes in taxation of
the self-employed will end many cumbersome procedures required to assess and
collect tax.
To make this possible, the Revenue has forged a unique outsourcing
partnership with the private sector that will allow it to use the most
up-to-date information technology. Some 2,000 Inland Revenue IT staff will
transfer to EDS, the US computer services company, which will take over
responsibility for processing tax data.
The plans are controversial because confidential tax data will be processed
by a foreign company. But Matheson believes that without private-sector
skills and capital, it would have been impossible cost-effectively to make
the changes needed to improve the service. 'Our IT plans will empower the
frontline staff so they can deal with taxpayers' problems on the spot,' he
says. 'This requires changing from a culture that is procedural and
instruction-based to one based on leadership, delegation and empowerment.'
Despite recent criticisms of the use of management consultants in Whitehall,
the Revenue has relied on consultants in change management. 'We couldn't
have done so much without them,' says Matheson. 'They can clear blockages
and help us to achieve what we want to do. You can't hand over
responsibility to them, however - consultants have to be managed.'
With such a track record, it is hardly surprising that Matheson has often
been headhunted by the consultants he uses. But although he sometimes gets
frustrated, he has never been tempted to join the private sector. 'It's the
scale of the challenge in the civil service that is attractive.'
This concludes the series. Previous articles have appeared on October 19,

FT  30 NOV 94 / Recruitment: Overseas gravy train may be running out of
steam - Preparing expatriate packages is challenging the expertise of human
resource management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Expatriate employment deals - once one of the best ways for individual
employees to get rich on their own account - appear to be undergoing
something of an upheaval across Europe among many multinational companies,
according to the findings of some recent reports.
Renting out your house while you are away, living off expenses and paid
schooling for the children have all been traditional ways of saving money
when on expatriate assignments. But companies, increasingly aware of such
costs and savings, are becoming more interested in taking them into account
when preparing expatriate packages.
Prof Chris Brewster, professor of European Human Resource Management at
Cranfield University School of Management, said: 'People are realising that
the whole deal is negotiable and that factors other than cost of living may
be involved.'
Expatriates, he said, tended to cost four times more than the outlay for
local staff.
'These are the most expensive of employees but probably less time is spent
strategically thinking about their roles than on anyone else in the staffing
system,' he said.
An Ernst &amp; Young report, drawn from a survey of some 427 multinational
companies with operations across Europe, found many employers were cracking
down on the packages as they expanded their expatriate workforces.
A third of the employers said they expected to be changing the basis for
paying their salaries, mostly moving towards paying host country rates often
lower than those at the home base. Almost half the employers said they
expected more of their expatriate employees to accept host country contracts
within the next three years.
Michael Kaltz, a partner at Ernst &amp; Young specialising in expatriate
services, said companies were placing 'tremendous emphasis' on reducing the
cost of traditional expatriates. He said: 'The normal practice of retaining
expats on home country packages will become a thing of the past as employers
integrate expats into the local workforce.'
About 40 per cent of the employers wanted policy changes on expatriate
career development to address such issues as cost containment, dual careers,
repatriation, moves within Europe and taxation. 'Companies have to give more
thought about what their individual expatriate employees are going to do
when their assignment is over,' said Kaltz.
Ernst &amp; Young also gave an insight into some of the other deals made
available to expatriates. Of the companies offering a pre-assignment trip,
62 per cent included the partner and 21 per cent the whole family. Almost
all the employers provided home leave visits, with 15 per cent of them
offering more than one paid home visit per year.
Nearly six in 10 of the employers expected their expatriates to contribute
to their housing costs abroad. However, more than three-quarters of
employers said they did not adjust pay to reflect a lower cost of living in
a host country. Most provided additional health care and the vast majority
provided educational assistance.
The underlying message from the study is that companies are at last waking
up to the changing nature of expatriate employment and its strain on the
corporate budget.
Managements working on overseas assignments are also beginning to display
greater awareness of the need to balance the social demands of families, not
least those of the working wife. The costs of getting it wrong, both in
potentially wrecked careers and to the company in moving people back, can be
alarming.
A Europe-wide survey carried out for Mobile Europe by Employment Conditions
Abroad, consultants on overseas assignment packages, found employers
increasingly more willing to recognise the social and domestic concerns of
employees sent abroad, such as care of elderly parents and children's
schooling. Foreign postings were becoming shorter and employers more
flexible in the way they put their packages together, it said.
Some 72 per cent of almost 200 who replied to the survey said they would now
pay the cost of transfering non-married partners overseas, although no more
than a quarter were yet willing to accept same-sex partners when staffing
assignments.
Cranfield has found that many of the largest multinationals, including the
oil companies, are trying to reduce their reliance on expatriate staff,
recruiting more local expertise where they can. At the same time, more
smaller companies are expanding overseas, adding perhaps one or two
expatriate posts on staff.
The type of people taking expatriate assignments is changing too. Still
predominantly male, they are tending to have better qualifications than
previously, often possessing Master of Business Administration
qualifications. Many also have wives pursuing careers, who do not see why
they should drop their own jobs to follow their husbands abroad.
Such developments are leading to far more businesslike discussions between
managements and prospective expatriate staff. Bargaining is becoming more
common and market forces can have a decisive influence in recruitment
decisions. For example, bio-technology graduates are in short supply in the
UK compared to those in Italy; so at least one UK-based company is taking on
Italians for bio-technology posts. It can get them for less than it would
need to pay UK candidates.
A need for better human resource management in the preparation of expatriate
employees emerged in recent research carried out by Cranfield and the Centre
for International Briefing at Farnham in Surrey. It discovered 'a serious
lack of knowledge about local business environments' among 205 large company
senior managers moving overseas. About 70 per cent of them wanted more
pre-departure training on local business law and practices. Most of those
going outside western Europe and English-speaking countries were worried
that they had received no host country language training.
While you have to wonder at the advisability of appointing anyone who thinks
it is easy to ask a Moslem his Christian name - an admission of one of the
respondents - one can sympathise with the manager who arrived in Tokyo and
found to his consternation that a crash course in Japanese prior to going
there was essential for such basics as shopping and travelling.
Managers were asking for 'nuts and bolts' training covering law, dealing
with business partners, local nationals and ordinary business etiquette.
They stressed that preparation was equally or even more important for
transfers to similar cultures, often because of different bureaucracies. The
paperwork and permits demanded in the US were a common source of anguish.
A manager summarising a common lament in a part of the survey questionnaire
left for general remarks, wrote: 'One learned much on arrival. If we had
known about some of it before, we might not have come.'

Swansea Cork Ferries last night began an inquiry into why its 8,797-tonne
vessel Superferry was stranded on a sandbank with 346 passengers and crew
for more than four hours yesterday.
A tug pulled the Greek-registered ferry from the sandbank in the Irish Sea a
mile from Swansea harbour. Coastguards said there was no danger to
passengers but lifeboats and RAF helicopters were put on standby.
Coastguards said the ship's master alerted them by radio after the ferry
from Cork ran aground on the edge of the channel at low tide at about
6.30am. It was not known yesterday whether a local pilot was on board.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Disabled scheme gets partial reprieve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government last night announced a partial reprieve for the priority
suppliers scheme for disabled workshops scrapped earlier this year by Mr
Michael Portillo, employment secretary.
The scheme was discontinued by Mr Portillo immediately after he was promoted
to employment secretary in the July reshuffle of Mr John Major, the prime
minister, on the grounds that it was illegal under European Union
regulations.
Ms Ann Widdecombe, junior employment minister, told MPs in a Commons written
answer that the European Commission, which initially claimed there was no
reason to scrap the scheme, had accepted that it was illegal.
However, Ms Widdecombe said the scheme would be reintroduced under a fresh
title, the special contracts arrangement, with two changes designed to
comply with European Union rules and the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
These will extend eligibility to workshops in other EU and European Economic

FT  30 NOV 94 / Nuclear Electric sale hope recedes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Executives at Nuclear Electric, the state-owned power utility, are close to
abandoning hopes that the company can be privatised before the next
election.
In spite of confident statements at the company's interim results
presentation yesterday, executives concede privately that the chances of a
sell-off being agreed as part of the government's nuclear review are small
and declining.
One executive said: 'Unless there is a significant change in government
thinking in the next few weeks, there will not be enough time for ministers
to steer through privatisation before an election.'
However, the company is still hoping that the government will accede to its
request for a restructuring of the business, with perhaps the Magnox
stations being hived off into a separate company.
That would increase the chances of privatisation of the rest of the business
later in the decade. The review is expected to leave open the possibility of
this happening.
In the six months to September 30, Nuclear Electric made an operating loss
of Pounds 126m (Pounds 118m a year earlier) before adding the nuclear levy
on consumers. With the levy, operating profits rose Pounds 2m to Pounds
499m.
Part of the reason for the flat performance was the cap on prices in the
electricity pool which Nuclear Electric estimates will reduce profits by
about Pounds 100m this year, mostly in the first half. The cap was also
responsible for an 11 per cent fall in turnover to Pounds 779m.
Mr John Collier, chairman, said the company was showing its underlying
strength by maintaining its forecast of being profitable before the levy
next year in spite of the effects of the pool cap.
He said the company had reduced unit costs by 8 per cent to 3p during the
half year and achieved record productivity, up 20 per cent. It had also
become the second-largest generator for the first time in any half year by
capturing 25.2 per cent of the market, up from 23.3 per cent in the first
six months of 1993-94.
Mr Bob Hawley, chief executive, said PowerGen could overtake it for the full
year but next year Nuclear Electric could be back in the number two position
because of the forthcoming full commissioning of Sizewell B.
Manpower fell 57 to 9,397 during the six months. Mr Hawley said the company
was on target to become the lowest-cost generator by 1997.
Mr Collier said the company's case for privatisation lay at the heart of its
submission to the nuclear review. 'Whether it happens, how or when it
happens, is of course strictly a matter for our shareholder.' But Nuclear
Electric was poised to be another privatisation success story.
The chairman said the company would only build Sizewell C, the planned
station on the Suffolk coast, if it added to shareholder value. The company
believed it would be possible to fund the station entirely in the private
sector.
Mr Hawley said there were grounds for optimism on contract negotiations with
BNFL, the reprocessing company.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Sinn Fein barred from forum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, will not be allowed to attend an
important Belfast investment conference. The decision emerged yesterday as
cabinet ministers involved in the Northern Ireland peace process met in
London for the first time since the collapse of the Dublin coalition.
The move reinforced the mounting impression at Whitehall that preliminary
talks between the government and Sinn Fein are unlikely to start before the
conference, which will be held on December 13 and 14 and is to be launched
by Mr John Major, the prime minister.
The Northern Ireland Office denied that yesterday's decision had any bearing
on the starting date for the talks, which the government has promised would
begin before Christmas.
But Sinn Fein attacked the move, saying it was 'another stalling tactic by
the British government in its efforts to reduce the momentum of the peace
process'.
Meeting at Downing Street, ministers are understood to have discussed both
the prospect of talks with Sinn Fein and progress on the so-called UK-Irish
framework document which will form the basis for future talks involving
Ulster's main political parties.
Senior civil servants have continued to make headway on the document in
spite of the power vacuum in Dublin. But they are understood to have gone as
far as possible with-out further ministerial guidance.
Three main sticking points remain:
Article two of the Irish Republic's constitution, enshrining Dublin's
territorial claim over the province.
The so-called 'European dimension' dealing with how relations between the
north and south of the island and the rest of Europe are handled.
The so-called 'default mechanism' dealing with the handling of reservations
about decisions made by the planned Ulster assembly.
Dublin is understood to have argued that this mechanism should take the form
of a joint committee of the Anglo-Irish conference. London wants both
governments to be able to examine such reservations separately.
Meanwhile in Dublin, another adjournment of the Irish Republic's parliament
seems likely today with political parties still unable to agree terms for a
new coalition in the wake of the collapse of the 22-month Fianna Fail and
Labour government and the resignation of Mr Albert Reynolds as prime
minister.
Fianna Fail, the largest partner in the outgoing government, last night
seemed close to initiating formal negotiations with Labour.
However Mr Bertie Ahern, Fianna Fail leader, is coming under pressure from
within his party to take a tough line with Labour.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Carsberg anticipates a return to his roots: John Ridding on
why the OFT chief is resigning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sipping wine in the French economy ministry, Sir Bryan Carsberg appeared
relaxed yesterday about his decision to resign as director-general of
Britain's Office of Fair Trading.
'There is less to it than meets the eye,' he said, referring to his move to
head the International Accounting Standards Committee. 'It is not because of
problems in my present job. I haven't had a row with ministers or anything
like that. The move is entirely because I was offered a job which I want to
do.'
In Paris for a meeting on international competition policy, Sir Bryan
described his move - which will take effect in six months - as a natural
progression. 'Accounting and accounting standards are a central theme of my
career,' he said, referring to his academic experience in accountancy and
the three years he spent with the Financial Accounting Standards Board in
the US between 1978 and 1981. It was only in March last year that he left
the British Accounting Standards Board.
For Sir Bryan, his next step is consistent with the job he is doing now.
'The more the idea of free trade becomes internationally accepted, the more
desirable it will be to have convergence on competition policy. For global
competition policy we need common accounting standards.'
During the next six months, however, it will be business as usual. At the
top of the agenda is the sensitive issue of the rival bids from British
Aerospace and GEC for control of VSEL, the warship builder. Sir Bryan will
not be drawn on a decision on referring the proposals to the government.
On the subject of UK competition policy, Sir Bryan appears largely
satisfied. He defends the establishment of bodies to monitor competition in
newly privatised utilities.
According to Sir Bryan, however, further steps are needed in competition
policy. One concerns the restrictive trade practices law. Under the present
system, no trading practice is automatically prohibited. A review is
required to determine whether cartels or other practices are in the public
interest.
A second reform proposed by Sir Bryan involves a toughening of the Fair
Trading Act. He says there is a case to extend provisions against so-called
'rogue traders' - who have broken either criminal or civil law - to other
malpractices that do not necessarily break the law.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Best Travel goes into liquidation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Best Travel, the UK's seventh-largest tour operator, went into liquidation
last night. It was the travel industry's biggest collapse since Mr Harry
Goodman's International Leisure Group failed in 1991.
Plans by Airtours, the second-largest tour operator, to purchase Best
Travel's brand names failed yesterday. Mr Nick Lyle of accountants Touche
Ross, who were appointed liquidators, last night strongly criticised the
Association of British Travel Agents for what he alleged was its failure to
ensure that at least some of the Best Travel business was saved.
The Civil Aviation Authority said the collapse would not affect the 3,000
Best Travel holidaymakers currently abroad. The company has a Pounds 14m
bond, which will be used to repatriate customers abroad and ensure those who
have booked holidays are compensated.
Although rumours about the health of Best Travel had been circulating for
weeks, the first firm indication of trouble came yesterday morning when
Ambassador Airways, the company's airline, was put into liquidation and its
fleet of six Boeing aircraft grounded.
Mr Lyle said the aircraft had played a significant part in dragging the rest
of the company down. He said the cash requirements of the airline during the
winter months would have been high.
Mr Lyle said he was instructed on Saturday to try to find a buyer for Best
Travel. He approached large tour operators over the weekend and found
Airtours the most positive.
He said an agreement was reached that Airtours would buy Best Travel's two
brand names, Cypriana and Grecian Holidays. Mr Lyle said that while this
would not have saved Best Travel itself or the airline, it would have
ensured that customers who had booked holidays could continue to go on them.
Airtours' payment for the brands would also have increased the amount
available for Best Travel creditors. Mr Lyle said the amount would have been
'several million pounds'.
He said, however, that when the deal was taken to Abta for its approval, the
association replied that it could not reach enough members of its Tour
Operators' Council yesterday. Abta said the council would be meeting
tomorrow. Mr Lyle said, however, that this was too late and Best Travel went
into liquidation.
He said: 'The whole transaction has been frustrated by the unresponsive
approach of the people who regulate the travel industry.' Airtours declined
to comment.
Abta agreed that it had told Airtours yesterday that it would not be able to
reach enough members of the 20-member Tour Operators' Council to reach a
decision. The association added, however, that Airtours did not require the
council's approval to purchase the brands. All Abta could do was decide
whether holidays sold under the brands would be accepted into its
jurisdiction.
Following the introduction of new consumer protection laws, Abta no longer
has the power to prevent companies selling holidays which fall outside its
jurisdiction.

since it began carrying fare-paying passengers.
The 8.23am train from London to Paris developed a technical fault in
northern France and stopped at Haute Picardie station. The 633 passengers
were transferred to another train and arrived in Paris two hours late. They
would receive a refund, French rail authority SNCF said.
A total of 100,000 Eurostar tickets have been sold since sales began four
weeks ago, European Passenger Services, the British partner in the
three-country project, said.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Du Pont closures under question
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A report by consultants on the decision by Du Pont, the world's biggest
nylon maker, to close recently acquired plants on Teesside, says it could
not detect any unexpected change in market conditions which would have
prompted the move.
The report, by chemical industry consultants Chem Systems, says the
recession from which the petrochemical industry is emerging started well
over two years ago, so nothing 'new' had taken place.
The research was commissioned by Cleveland County Council because of the
controversy over Du Pont's plans, announced in June, to shut five plants and
shed 520 jobs.
It will be discussed by councillors tomorrow. It will also be submitted to
the European Commission as part of its investigation into Du Pont's plans to
shut down the Teesside plants and invest in new adipic acid production in
Chalampe, France, in a joint venture with Rhone Poulenc.
Du Pont took over the former Imperial Chemical Industries' Teesside nylons
capacity, and 920 former ICI Teesside employees, in 1992.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Customs faces 'big staff losses'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Customs and Excise is to shed more than 4,000 jobs, unions said last night.
The cuts form part of a 24,000 reduction in civil service jobs announced by
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in his Budget speech yesterday.
Mr Clarke said civil service jobs would fall below 500,000 during the next
four years, to their lowest level since the second world war.
According to CPSA and NUCPS, the two main civil service unions, value added
tax inspectors, anti-smuggling officers and support staff throughout the UK
will be affected by the job losses.
Customs refused to comment last night in advance of an announcement to staff
today. The unions say the department plans to shed some 16 per cent of its
25,500 workers.
It is understood that the jobs will go during a period of about six years,
most of them eliminated by natural wastage, retirement, and non-recruitment.
Mr Geoff Lewtas, CPSA's national officer for Customs, said the cuts would
make it more difficult for workers to stop bulk drug imports. 'These jobs
cuts will do serious damage,' he said.
Last week the Commons Treasury committee recommended that the Customs
service should deploy 'substantially increased' staff to try to stem the
illegal import of alcohol and tobacco.
Unions said the measures would affect 2,215 VAT staff, 755 support staff,
600 frontline officers, 355 EU revenue staff and 148 employees who compile
trade statistics.
NUCPS called the cuts 'short-sighted'. Mr John Sheldon, general secretary,
said: 'The government prefers to run down our services, sack the staff, and
sell off the profitable parts to their friends in the private sector.'
The union said cuts in spending announced meant a freeze on pay for the next
four years.
Mr Lewtas said: 'We will now travel around the country seeking the views of
our members, but as far as I am concerned, industrial action is on our
agenda.' Staff plan protest rallies in London today.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Cuts in job loss payments unlawful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government deductions from protective awards to redundant workers were
declared unlawful yesterday by an industrial tribunal.
In the first successful challenge to the Department of Employment's policy
of cutting payments to redundant workers, 1,500 workers who lost their jobs
at the Swan Hunter shipyard will receive extra money as a result.
The Newcastle upon Tyne tribunal has also referred two other issues raised
in the case to the European Court of Justice. These cover the government's
policy of restricting protective awards to a maximum of eight weeks and
limiting a week's pay to Pounds 205.
'This decision will affect thousands of workers made redundant in other
industries,' said Mr Stefan Cross, the solicitor representing Swan Hunter
workers.
The Department of Employment said the case raised complex issues concerning
linkages between UK law and European Union directives.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Roy Wright: force behind RTZ - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Roy Wright, who with Sir Val Duncan and Sir Mark Turner formed the troika
that transformed the former Rio Tinto Company into the RTZ Corporation, the
world's biggest mining company, has died aged 80.
He joined Rio Tinto in 1952 in answer to an advertisement for an overseas
manager. Over tea with the then Mr Duncan, who had recently been appointed
Rio Tinto's managing director, Mr Wright pointed out that the company had no
overseas business to manage. 'That's quite true,' came the reply, 'but we
will have.' Mr Wright accepted the post and became a key figure in the
geographical diversification of Rio Tinto and its merger in 1962 with
Consolidated Zinc.
One of the outstanding conceptual thinkers of his generation, Mr Wright was
among the first to recognise the potential availability of government
funding for big resource projects. From this he developed the concept of
'project financing' and a 'floor price' formula that facilitated the
financing of big projects. An early project to benefit from this innovation
was Hamersley Iron in Australia.
He worked closely with Mr Duncan and described the relationship as 'almost
telepathic at times'. However, the relationship became strained towards the
end of his career as Mr Duncan's interests outside RTZ developed and the
corporation's operations became more diversified.
With characteristic good grace, Mr Wright stood down from his duties as
deputy chairman and deputy chief executive in May 1975, only months before
Sir Val died. When Sir Mark Turner took over, Mr Wright gave him his full
support and remained a non-executive director of RTZ for another 10 years.
Mr Wright was born in Chelmsford, Essex, on September 10 1914 and died on
November 23. He was educated at King Edward VI School and Faraday House
College. He then worked for Crompton Parkinson in the UK and for Brush
Electric in South Africa. During the war he served in the South African and
Royal Navies, leaving with the rank of Lt Cmdr.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Blow for Names over cover ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's underwriters being sued for alleged negligence yesterday won the
right not to reveal the total amount of insurance cover available to meet
claims against them.
The Court of Appeal ruled that while the underwriters' insurers should
disclose to Names the wording of relevant 'errors and omissions' policies,
they should not have to reveal the extent of their total cover or the
premiums paid.
The ruling is a setback for some Names who could have used the information
to improve the strategies of their legal campaigns. Full disclosure of the
sums available for damages claims could also have acted as a catalyst for
possible out-of-court settlements.
The Court of Appeal partially overturned an order made by Mr Justice
Phillips, the trial judge for the Gooda Walker and Feltrim actions, that the
insurers should make full disclosure of the details of their cover to help
the courts decide how damages should best be paid.
At the centre of the issue is the acknowledgement by all involved that the
total damages claimed against underwriters - thought to approach Pounds 3bn
 -might considerably exceed the amount of insurance cover available.
Following the victory of the Gooda Walker Names, who won damages initially
estimated at Pounds 504m, the courts have begun considering how best the
damages should be paid.
Mr Justice Phillips had been considering whether damages should be paid on a
'first come first served basis' - with the Gooda Walker Names heading the
queue - or on another basis intended to spread damages among all successful
Names, no matter when their cases come to court.
Giving judgment, Lord Justice Saville said the insurers should not have to
disclose the total amount of their cover since this was not relevant as a
matter of law.
However, he continued: 'I do so with regret for it seems to me that in the
circumstances of the Lloyd's litigation, there is much to be said for the
view that the sooner the parties know where they stand as regards likely
recoveries at the end of the road, the sooner and cheaper will be the
resolution of this litigation, which can only be for the benefit of all.'
Clyde &amp; Co, solicitors acting for the errors and omissions insurers, said a
figure for the total cover available would anyway have been 'misleading'.
It would not have corresponded to the cover available for individual claims
against particular Lloyd's agencies.
In a statement, Clyde &amp; Co said the insurers were 'firmly convinced' that
the insurance cover for damages awarded to Gooda Walker Names would be
'significantly less' than was available under the Lloyd's settlement offer
rejected by Names earlier this year.
It also revealed that at the time of the settlement offer Names' action
groups - including the Gooda Walker action group - had been offered the
chance to verify, on a confidential basis, the level of errors and omissions
cover available. The Gooda Walker group had not taken up that offer, Clyde &amp;
Co said.

FT  30 NOV 94 / China urged to cut inflation

China is suffering from lack of monetary restraint, according to a top
Chinese bank official. Mr Dai Xianglong, a deputy governor of the central
bank, has blamed this for contributing to high inflation and has urged the
government to curb excessive money supply growth.
In the People's Daily, the Communist party newspaper, he said M1 growth  -
cash in circulation - had risen by 32 per cent in the first nine months of
the year compared with last year. This exceeded a target of 20-25 per cent.
Mr Dai's warning about the need to curb excessive money supply growth is
part of a continuing public campaign by the People's Bank to reinforce the
case for restraint. Mr Dai warned last month M2 monetary growth for the
September quarter of 37.1 per cent was much too rapid and was fuelling
inflation. This year's M2 target is 24 per cent.
Consumer prices in China's 35 main cities rose by 27 per cent in the year to
October. This compared with a rise of 27.5 per cent the month before.
Mr Dai blamed unauthorised lending by non-state financial institutions for
excessive monetary growth. The issuance of Yn500bn of corporate bonds in the
first six months of the year had exacerbated the problem.
Another factor was direct foreign investment, which had leapt by 55 per cent
in the first eight months to Dollars 20.5bn (Pounds 12.5bn). Wages to state
employees had jumped by 41.34 per cent in the year to October.
Capital construction had continued to rocket ahead on the back of relatively
easy credit.
Mr Dai sharply criticised lax monitoring procedures by state banks which had
failed to prevent loans for the upgrading of enterprises being diverted to
real estate or stock trading.
Close to Mr Zhu Rongji, China's senior vice premier in charge of the
economy, the top banker was also highly critical of a wages blowout. 'Some
of these companies have lost control of wages and costs,' he said. Mr Dai
called for a slowing of development and a reduction of funds devoted to
fixed assets.
'The central government's share of GDP is too low, its share of tax revenue
is too low, so it is unable to provide extra funds to state firms,' he said.
China is seeking to calm an overheating economy without causing an abrupt
slowdown which might add to unemployment. Chinese officials fear a 'hard
landing' and have thus been selective in applying credit restrictions.
Germany's Hoechst chemicals group has signed a contract to set up a Dollars
29m joint venture in Shanghai to make polyester products for the building
industry.

Maoist guerrillas have killed nine people, including seven policemen, with a
landmine in southern India but missed a state minister they were trying to
assassinate, a police official said. The guerrillas detonated the mine when
a lorry carrying the policemen approached Warangal Town, a Maoist stronghold
in Andhra Pradesh. 'They were aiming at Mr Narasimha Reddy, following in a
car,' the official added. Mr Reddy, a staunchly anti-Maoist minister in the
state government, is a candidate for Warangal in the December 1 and 5 state

FT  30 NOV 94 / Police charged in Thailand
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Thai authorities said yesterday they had charged a police general and
eight others with conspiring to kidnap and murder the wife and son of an
important witness in a long-running scandal involving jewels worth Dollars
20m (Pounds 12.1m) stolen from a Saudi prince. Those charged include police
Lt Gen Chalor Kerdthet, who first headed the investigation into the theft of
gems from a Saudi Arabian palace in 1989, and four other policemen. Gen
Chalor has already been accused of embezzling some of the jewels.
Thailand's Office of the Attorney General dropped plans to charge two other
police generals of involvement in the murder. The case has aroused intense
interest in Thailand because of growing frustration with corruption in the
country's police force. At least 10 people are believed to have been
murdered in connection with the case. Angered by the slow pace of the
investigation, Saudi Arabia has refused to grant new visas to Thai migrant
workers and stopped Saudi tourists from visiting Thailand.
The Thai gardener who stole the jewels in Saudi Arabia was arrested after
his return to Thailand, but the gems returned by the police to the Saudi
prince turned out to be fakes copied from the originals. Most of the real
gems are still missing.

<TEXT>
A better export performance caused Australia's trade deficit to narrow last
month, bringing relief to the Keating government and lessening chances of
another interest rate rise before Christmas. Latest figures showed a current
account deficit for October of ADollars 1.65bn (Pounds 750m), seasonally
adjusted, higher than the ADollars 1.27bn in October 1993, but below the
deficits of ADollars 1.8bn and ADollars 2.1bn in September and August this
year.
Exports rose 5 per cent seasonally adjusted in October, with commodities
such as gold, wool and coal contributing strongly. Imports, on the same
basis, were 2 per cent higher. Economists had been predicting an October
deficit of ADollars 1.8bn-ADollars 1.9bn. As the prospect of a further early
interest rate rise ebbed, the Australian dollar drifted lower.
A sharp decline in building approvals last month suggested the recent
housing boom has peaked. Figures for business investment were more
complicated; new capital expenditure for the quarter declined overall, but
spending on plant and equipment was 3.4 per cent higher (27.6 per cent above
that seen a year ago). Mr Ralph Willis, treasurer, claimed there was 'a
continuing strong recovery in business investment'.
Attention will now shift to the September quarter's GDP figures, to be
released today and expected to show growth running at 5.5 per cent
annualised. Mr Bernie Fraser, governor of the Reserve Bank, said the
government should consider raising taxes to cut its budget deficit and
warned that lack of wage restraint would mean higher interest rates.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Japan's unemployment rate stubbornly refuses to fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's jobless rate hovered at 3 per cent for the fourth month running in
October, as a fall in manufacturing jobs was absorbed by a rise in service
sector workers, reports William Dawkins from Tokyo.
The unemployment rate's refusal to decline from its seven-year high of 1.99m
marks a potentially disturbing break with previous, job-creating recoveries.
In earlier economic upturns, unemployment started to fall six to 12 months
after the first signs of recovery, according to the government's Economic
Planning Agency. Yet the agency believes the recession touched bottom in
October last year, 13 months ago. This requires careful monitoring, said Mr
Manso Hamamoto, labour minister.
The number of job offers for every 100 applicants also stagnated in October
at 64, for the second month in a row, well under half the number of jobs per
applicant two years ago.
This ratio is likely to stay low, because of a backlog of new graduates,
which pushed up the number of applicants by 7.7 per cent in the year to
October, much faster than the 1.5 per cent rise in the number of job offers.
Total employment was almost stable at 64.8m workers, within which the
manufacturing workforce fell by 3.3 per cent year on year, the sharpest drop
since April 1987. This is a sign manufacturing industry is continuing to
shed workers through a freeze on recruitment and failure to replace retired
staff. Service sector jobs rose 1.6 per cent over the same period.

The World Bank has agreed to extend a Dollars 58m credit to Palestinian

The deal will be signed in Brussels today by Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO

they would put pressure on donors, who are to begin a two-day meeting today,
to pay out urgently money already promised to the Palestinians. The donors'
last meeting broke down in a row over the Palestinians' inclusion of
Jerusalem in projects to be backed.
In October last year, aid donors pledged more than Dollars 2bn over five
years for projects to support Palestinian self-rule, with Dollars 700m to be
paid out this year. Only about Dollars 60m had so far been received.

Mr Ralph Willis, treasurer, focused mainly on the capital expenditure
figures, claiming these supported 'a continuing strong recovery in business
investment'. But some economists said they expected the full-year current
account deficit to reach ADollars 21bn-ADollars 22bn, well above Mr Willis's
ADollars 18bn forecast. Attention will now shift to the September quarter's
GDP figures, to be released today, and expected to show growth running at
5.5 per cent annualised.
Mr Bernie Fraser, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, said the
government should consider raising taxes to cut its budget deficit, and
warned that lack of wage restraint would mean higher interest rates. 'It's
time we faced up to the fact that trying to manage the budget without the
capacity to vary taxes is not a winning strategy. There are always areas
where government spending can be trimmed but possible tax increases should
not be ruled out.'
Some unions had recently submitted big wage claims, but it was essential
settlements should not run ahead of productivity gains. 'Once a wage
breakout has occurred, it becomes largely a matter of where the damage is
sustained, in higher unemployment or higher inflation, or both'. A case
existed for cutting the current account deficit to around 3 per cent of GDP,
against the 4-5 per cent seen recently. 'That is not a target so much as a
judgment about what is comfortably sustainable over the long term.'

FT  30 NOV 94 / Zimbabwe's hopes of equality have yet to take root: Alison
Maitland finds the gap between white farmer and black smallholder as wide as
ever after 15 years of independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Zimbabwe there is a saying: where you see a Mopane tree, there is no
water.
Mopane trees are plentiful in Masvingo province, in the semi-arid southern
half of the country. Maize seedlings planted in small neat rows wilt in heat
of more than 40 degrees and the few scrawny cattle feed on scrub as
villagers wait for the next rains.
Here the population is still suffering the effects of the worst drought in
more than 100 years. Some 60 per cent of Masvingo's oxen died in the 1992
drought. The poorest families, often headed by women, have less than two
hectares of land and no irrigation.
Three hours' drive further north, in the rich, mainly white-owned commercial
farmlands around Harare, a healthy crop of young maize flourishes under
water sprinklers. Flowers and vegetables for export grow in greenhouses
where plentiful irrigation is funded out of earnings from tobacco
plantations extending over thousands of hectares.
Fifteen years after independence, the gap between Zimbabwe's commercial
farms and its poor rural smallholdings is as wide as ever, made bigger by
drought and economic reforms.
During the colonial period, the best land was reserved for whites while
blacks were concentrated in 'tribal trust lands' - now known as communal
areas - which are home to half the population. Some 74 per cent of communal
area farms lie in the two poorest 'natural regions', where annual rainfall
is 60cm (24in) or less.
By contrast, 4,800 predominantly white commercial farmers own or operate 59
per cent of the land in the regions with the highest rainfall - and nearly
84 per cent of all irrigated land. This means that in a country normally
self-sufficient in maize, the staple food, 420,000 rural households still
cannot be sure of producing enough to eat.
Government agricultural strategy in the post-independence 1980s was designed
to change this, but yielded disappointing results, according to the World
Bank. Yield improvements, greater crop plantings and better marketing
produced sharp increases in output of cotton and maize. But agricultural
growth did not extend much beyond the commercial sector and the top 10 per
cent of smallholders.
'The bulk of Zimbabwe's rural population has participated minimally in the
expansion of national output of food and cash crops,' it says.
The government has lifted most state marketing controls on agricultural
commodities as part of the structural adjustment programme begun in 1991.
But this has benefited the well positioned commercial sector most, while
smallholders have lost out in the parallel squeeze on public services.
Land reforms, under which 57,000 households have been resettled on land
formerly belonging to commercial farmers, also failed to deliver the desired
results, largely because restricted tenure and capital have prevented the
beneficiaries from taking a long-term stake in their farms, the bank
believes.
Land redistribution remains a political football, especially with elections
approaching next year. But not all black Zimbabweans are eager to force
white farmers off the land. 'The commercial farms do the country a lot of
good,' said one. 'The farmers have experience, producing food on a large
scale and employing a lot of people.'
Instead, smallholders plead for fair treatment. Solutions appear simple. By
having an animal to plough, a smallholder can treble the amount of land
tilled to as much as 3.5ha.
But delivering is easier said than done in the current economic climate. For
the past two years, 41 farmers in the village of Binda, 115km south-west of
Harare, have benefited from a credit scheme backed by the International Fund
for Agricultural Development, a UN organisation. As a group, they were able
to borrow to buy fertiliser, seed and oxen to recover from the drought. They
are the envy of other villagers.
But while the fund provides the government with soft loans at 0.75 per cent
interest, the farmers are still at the mercy of exorbitant domestic rates as
the money is on-loaned through the agricultural credit system. They had to
pay 23.5 per cent on their annual loan this year - well below commercial
rates but still too high to borrow for the tractor that would transform
their lives.
The World Bank and donor agencies urge greater targeting of public
agricultural services at smallholders, making credit more available and
encouraging community-based irrigation schemes. The bank argues that
long-term leases on land, or even grants towards land purchase, would
encourage smallholders in resettlement areas to farm commercially -
especially if they could produce under contract to private sector farmers or
agri-businesses.
Other solutions involve diversification. Many small farmers already weave or
crochet, carve wood and soapstone figures for tourists, or participate in
wildlife management schemes to supplement their incomes. The fast growing
horticulture sector offers opportunities to smallholders where there is
irrigation: about 200 are involved in three export projects producing
tomatoes for paste and fruit for canning under contract to commercial farms.
Where there is no water, trials are taking place of drought-resistant
varieties of maize, and of the tougher staple crops, sorghum and millet.
Lack of expertise, capital and transportation remain huge barriers. But the
need for change is widely recognised as urgent. 'The real poor are not
getting anywhere,' said one white farmer. 'We do have a conscience. It's not
nice living in a place where the gap is not going to narrow.'

In Katsuta city, just north of Tokyo, the head office of Suzuki
Manufacturing, a medium-sized maker of printed circuit boards, is buzzing
with activity.
The brisk pace of business Suzuki has seen over the past two years contrasts
with many of its fellow manufacturers in the industrial heartland of Ibaraki
Prefecture. The region is dominated by subcontractors that have long
depended on jobs created by Hitachi, Japan's largest electric machinery
maker, and its group companies.
As Japan's economic slump and the 24 per cent appreciation of the yen
against the dollar have squeezed profits at Hitachi, many of the region's
smaller companies are finding themselves having to look elsewhere for work.
Unlike the majority of suppliers in the region which have suffered from
tying their fortunes too closely to a Japanese parent company, which in turn
has been hurt by the high yen, Suzuki is riding a wave of success by
exporting most of its output.
Indeed, over the past several years Suzuki (no relation of Suzuki Motor) has
reduced its dependence on Japanese customers and in spite of the high yen
environment has been able to sell 99 per cent of what it makes to overseas
customers.
'In the home market business began to drop off about two years ago,' says Ms
Man Ling Chang, manager of the overseas sales section. 'There is no business
in Japan,' she says.
While demand in Japan has dried up, Suzuki has been able to take advantage
of strong demand overseas, specifically for the printed circuit boards for
cellular phones that the company specialises in. Its main customers include
world-famous names in the cellular phones market such as Motorola of the US
and Sweden's Ericsson.
The company's success in supplying overseas customers has been such that at
a time when the majority of internationally active Japanese companies have
embarked on wide-ranging rationalisation measures and have shifted
production to lower-cost countries, Suzuki has not had to cut its workforce
nor move production overseas.
'We manufacture everything in Japan,' proclaims Mr Yoshihiro Koyama,
director of Suzuki's Sawa plant.
Suzuki has found strong overseas demand even in the high-yen environment
because it had a product and technology that few others in the world can
provide. The specialised printed circuit board it makes through a demanding
process 'is something that can be made in no other Asian country yet', says
Ms Chang.
Four years ago, the company had a very different structure. Then, Suzuki
made hard disk drives and printed circuit boards for computers and 50 per
cent of its business came from domestic customers.
These products, however, have low value added and are price competitive.
Prices in the hard disk drive market, for example, are negotiated four times
a year, Mr Koyama says.
With the yen's appreciation Japanese makers of hard disk drives and PCBs for
computers have been devastated by competitors in Taiwan and Korea, where
labour costs are one-third those in Japan.
Suzuki Manufacturing avoided the fate of many in the industry by shifting
quickly to higher value-added PCBs for the cellular phone market. The speed
with which it acted on that decision has given it a lead in a market that is
surging on the back of growing demand for cellular phones in industrialised
markets.
Suzuki's management also had the foresight to look outside Japan for growth
at an early stage, rather than follow the common Japanese practice of
targetting the home market first.
It helped that Mr Katsuzo Suzuki, president, began building business ties in
the US, where he had studied, long before the yen rose above Y100 to the
dollar.
The latest corporate results from Japanese companies indicate that many
Japanese companies much larger than Suzuki Manufacturing have likewise
benefited from the strength of demand overseas.
In the electronics industry, for instance, manufacturers from NEC to Sharp,
have been able to report improved profits thanks in large part to strong
demand for semiconductors and liquid crystal display panels triggered by the
buoyant US and south-east Asian economies. Japanese motor companies have
also been helped by the strength of the US economy.
The shift to a higher value-added product is not enough to beat the impact
of the yen's appreciation, Mr Koyama says. To remain competitive against
Korean and Taiwanese manufacturers it is necessary to make higher
value-added products in volume, he says.
With the yen's rise forcing many companies to move production overseas,
'Japan's manufacturing industry is in chaos', Mr Koyama says.
But if the example of Suzuki Manufacturing is anything to go by, the
challenge presented by the yen's appreciation is forcing many Japanese
manufacturers to become even more competitive than ever.

About 70 prisoners were on the run from a Venzuelan prison yesterday, amid
unconfirmed reports of deaths after a mass jail break, authorities and local
radio said. Union Radio, quoting police sources, said between 30 and 40
prisoners had died in the escape and ensuing fighting with guards at
Tocuyito jail in the eastern state of Carabobo, 160 miles from Caracas. Some
100 prisoners escaped in the early hours of Tuesday morning when an
electricity failure allowed them to dodge guards. Police recaptured about 30
of the inmates.

The World Bank yesterday named Mr Richard Frank to join the troika of
managing directors who hold sway over its operations under the presidency of
Mr Lewis Preston. Mr Frank, vice president for finance and planning at the
International Finance Corporation, the World Bank affiliate responsible for
private sector investment, will succeed Mr Ernest Stern, viewed as the most
powerful figure in the Bank's hierarchy. The World Bank's president is
traditionally an American. Mr Frank will take the American slot, joining Mr
Sven Sandstrom from Europe and Mr Gautam Kaji from Asia. Mr Frank's skill in
tapping capital markets may prove useful in an environment in which donor
governments, and especially the US Congress, are increasingly reluctant to
provide new funds. In a separate announcement, the International Monetary
Fund named Ms Burke Dillon to be director of its administration department,
and Mr Alan Tait as its special trade representative in Geneva.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Easy victor Zedillo faces an uneasy future: Damian Fraser
reports on the Mexican president's 'chaotic' inheritance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three months after his easy victory in Mexico's presidential election, Mr
Ernesto Zedillo prepares to take office tomorrow in a turbulent and
uncertain political environment.
The infighting within the government that has followed assassinations of two
senior politicians, the continued unrest in the state of Chiapas and
volatile financial markets have led some to conclude that the Institutional
Revolutionary Party is facing its most serious crisis in 65 years in power.
'The legacy of Salinas to Zedillo: a country in chaos, a political system in
disintegration,' said Proceso, Mexico's weekly political magazine, in this
week's cover story.
Many businessmen, investors, and government officials, although their
confidence has been shaken by recent events, point out that the last four
Mexican presidencies having all ended in turmoil, only for stability to
return as the new president assumes control. They take comfort from the
resilient economy and the recent return of investors to the stockmarket,
reckoning that the worst is over.
Much will depend on Mr Zedillo's actions in the first weeks. After being
quiet for three months, he will over the next month have to establish
leadership within government, set out his policy objectives and appoint
ministers able both to implement his programme and keep the party unified.
His first task will be to heal divisions in the PRI that have arisen over
allegations that the two most senior figures of the ruling party, Mr Ignacio
Pichardo, the president, and Ms Maria de los Angeles Moreno, the
secretary-general, conspired with the attorney-general, Mr Humberto Bentez
Trevino, to block the investigation into the assassination of Mr Jose
Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the number two official of the PRI. The accusations,
made by Mr Mario Ruiz Massieu, the former deputy attorney-general and the
brother of the slain politician, caused a bombshell in Mexico, and have
fuelled suspicions that Mr Ruiz Massieu's murder was ordered by senior
figures in the government, who are being protected by those still higher up.
The allegations could present Mr Zedillo with an awkward dilemma. If he does
not push for a thorough investigation, then his own credibility would be
tarnished and his proposals for legal and judicial reform would meet with
cynicism. But if there is some truth to the allegations  - so far strong
evidence has been lacking - and if he moves against Mr Pichardo or Mr
Bentez, he risks alienating a powerful political faction in the ruling party
that has been among his staunchest backers.
Mr Zedillo's cabinet appointments, especially that of attorney-general, are
likely to give some indication on his approach to the investigation, to
political reform and his willingness to fight corruption and illegality
within his own party and government.
Many observers are hoping that Mr Zedillo appoints to the attorney-general's
position a respected figure independent of the ruling party as a sign that
he is serious about implementing far-reaching legal reform that would
subject everyone to the rule of law.
The second critical test Mr Zedillo will face in December is in the southern
state of Chiapas, where the leftist opposition and the Zapatista peasant
rebels are seeking to prevent the PRI governor from taking office on
December 8. The Zapatista rebels, who launched an armed uprising in January
this year, have predicted war if the PRI governor is allowed to take power;
the leftist opposition has made political concession in the state an
important condition for talks on national democratic reform.
However, the election result in Chiapas has been ratified by the local
congress and Mr Zedillo is unwilling to follow President Salinas's habit of
deposing legally elected governors as a way of consoling the opposition.
Instead he appears ready to begin negotiations with both Zapatista rebels
and the leftist opposition on local and national political reform.
But it seems unlikely that such negotiations could produce results in the
time available, raising the prospect of conflict in Chiapas over the next
few weeks and casting a cloud over efforts to secure all-party consensus
over the next stage of democratic reform.
What is fortunate for Mr Zedillo is that the economy has recovered strongly
from the recession of last year, with third-quarter growth of 4.5 per cent
compared with the same period last year.
If the economy continues its recovery, then Mr Zedillo can afford to push
for a relatively conservative budget on December 15 without endangering his
target of 4 per cent growth for next year. An orthodox budget, and continued
commitment to pro-market economic reform, may help stabilise financial
markets, and give Mr Zedillo more breathing room on the political front.

Mr Ernesto Zedillo is this evening expected to name reform-minded
politicians to many of the key positions in his cabinet, writes Damian
Fraser. Rumours were circulating yesterday that Mr Esteban Moctezuma, a
close aide of Mr Zedillo who has established good relations with the
opposition, would be appointed to the powerful post of interior minister.
Top positions also seemed assured for pro-reform economists such as Mr Jaime
Serra Puche, the current trade minister, Mr Luis Tellez, Mr Zedillo's main
adviser on government policy, Mr Guillermo Ortiz, the deputy finance
minister, and Mr Jose Angel Gurria, the former debt negotiator.
Mr Pedro Aspe, the finance minister, has decided not to accept a position in
the cabinet for personal reasons, according to a report in yesterday's El
Universal newspaper.
After President Carlos Salinas, Mr Aspe was the leading figure in pushing
for economic reform over the past decade.
Expectations that many of President Salinas's reformist government ministers
would remain in office has contributed to the recent rebound in the stock
market. Yesterday short-term interest rates fell by 10 basis points to 13.85
per cent.

<TEXT>
Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's president, has asked the US government to
allow its troops to become active in disarming criminal gangs and renegade
army units which he fears pose a threat to the country's stability.
However, the request is unlikely to be entertained by the US government,
diplomats in Haiti said this week, as the move could bring the 12,000 troops
in the country in direct confrontation with armed Haitians, leading to US
casualties and fatalities, and increasing pressure for the troops'
withdrawal.
Mr Aristide's request suggests growing concern about the security situation
in Haiti, which has been generally quiet since the president was reinstated
last month after three years in exile. However, Senator Robert Dole, who
will lead the Republican majority in the new Congress, has said disarming of
Haitians should be done by the Haitian police.
There is yet no adequate local constabulary to do this as the reorganisation
of Haiti's armed forces, one of the first tasks of the recently reinstalled
government, will take longer than was first assumed. This has raised
questions about public security and the timing of the pullout of the US
troops who are currently responsible for law and order.
Haitian and US officials say the recruitment and training of the security
forces, mainly a new constabulary, is already proving more difficult than
first thought. The unpopularity of soldiers and policemen, repeatedly
accused of widespread abuses during the three years of the military
dictatorship, is deterring many prospective officers.
With a likely rise in pressure from Republican legislators for an early
pullout of US troops, Haitian officials fear a security vacuum in the
country if the refashioned army and police are not ready by the time foreign
troops leave. Such a situation would be 'destabilising' as it could be
exploited by 'anti-government forces and bandits,' said one official.
A programme agreed by Mr Aristide will see the dismantling of Haiti's 7,000
member army, and creation of a new militia of 1,500. The police force of
1,500, which is an arm of the military, will be placed under civilian
control and increased to about 10,000 members.
Concerns about security led Mr Aristide to bring forward the appointment of
new chiefs for the army and the police. He appointed Brig Gen Bernadin
Poisson, the former head of the military's fire fighting unit, as the army's
new commander-in-chief. The fire services are part of the military.

FT  30 NOV 94 / US calls for new Bosnia peace conference: Boutros Ghali to
visit Sarajevo in 'critical high stakes' mission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The US yesterday called for a new international conference to seek peace in
Bosnia, as diplomatic contacts intensified in the Bosnian capital of
Sarajevo.
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said he would formally
propose the new round of talks when ministers from the 'contact group'
nations of the US, Russia, France, Germany and the UK meet in Brussels on
Friday.
Contact group envoys travelled to Bosnia yesterday for talks aimed at
getting the warring sides to agree to come back to the bargaining table,
while Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, also came to
Sarajevo in a bid to salvage the battered credibility of his organisation.
In what a UN official decribed as a 'critical, high- stakes' mission, Mr
Boutros Ghali will meet Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic and lay out the conditions for the continuation of
the UN operation in Bosnia.
He will try to broker a ceasefire in the war-torn territory, and, in
particular, around Bihac, the north-western Moslem enclave, where infantry
clashes yesterday were reported to the west of the UN 'safe area'.
Mr Boutros Ghali is expected to meet an angry reception in Sarajevo, where
many resent the UN's failure to lift the 32-month Serb siege. His last visit
in December 1992 is remembered bitterly for his remarks that he could think
of a dozen places even worse than Sarajevo.
His visit coincides with intense diplomatic efforts to overcome deep splits
in the international community over Bosnia and the peace process.
In a bid to get the Bosnian Serbs to return to the bargaining table,
meanwhile, envoys from the five-nation contact group yesterday also
travelled to Sarajevo, for talks with the Moslem-led Bosnian govern ment.
The representatives were also due to meet Bosnian Serb leaders for the first
time since they rejected a western peace plan - a partition of Bosnia - in
July. This meeting followed talks with President Slobodan Milosevic of
Serbia in Belgrade on Monday.
The contact group has been split in recent days by sharp disagreements over
policy, but the US has shifted its position towards that of its European
allies in an effort to salvage Nato unity.
The international mediators appear to hold out hope of reviving their peace
plan to divide Bosnia roughly in half between the Moslem-Croat federation
and the Bosnian Serbs, who control 70 per cent of the war-torn country.
The peace process will get an additional boost when Serb rebels from Croatia
sign an agreement on Thursday on restoring economic links with Zagreb, the
Croat capital.
A close associate of Mr Milosevic yesterday said Belgrade would maintain a
direct link with Serb-held territory in Croatia, which would step up
pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to sign a peace deal.
But the Bosnian Serb leadership, which over the past two weeks has revelled
in the eruption of a serious transatlantic feud over Bosnia, is waiting for
territorial concessions.
James Blitz adds: Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, highlighted the
fears of European governments over the growing violence in Bosnia by raising
the possibility that UN troops might have to be withdrawn from the region.
Mr Major told MPs in the House of Commons that he had been angered by 'lurid
and misplaced criticism' of Unprofor which had appeared in the US press in
recent days. He said the protection forces in Bosnia were not a combat force
and had not been equipped for such a role.

how to proceed until at least the middle of next year. At a meeting in
Brussels, ministers agreed to investigate whether a French proposal for
liberalising energy markets would bring the same benefits to consumers and
industry as the Commission's plans for allowing power companies access to
other countries' transmission systems, so-called negotiated third party
access. Although the idea of a study looks like yet another stalling tactic,
it at least breaks the deadlock that has prevailed on energy liberalisation
for two years.
Under the French proposal for liberalisation - known as the 'single buyer'
proposal - power companies would negotiate access to transmission systems in
other member states via an operator in the buyer's country. The operator
would be responsible for running the system and meeting new demand for
electricity. The idea was criticised earlier this week by Mr Karel Van
Miert, the commissioner responsible for competition policy, who argued that
it would allow power companies in certain member states to preserve a
monopoly on imports and exports.

Belgian flights and train services were paralysed yesterday by a 24-hour
strike over privatisation which affected public service companies. The
national airline, Sabena, said strike action by air traffic controllers
early yesterday and firemen later in the day grounded flights at Zaventem
national airport. Some European flights were diverted to regional airports,
while some long-haul international flights left from Luxembourg with
passengers travelling by bus to the Grand Duchy.
The strike, which is also hitting telephone and postal services, was called
by unions to protest about the reorganisation of the companies, which they
fear will involve job losses and greater job insecurity. Among the four
public companies involved in the strike, the telephone company Belgacom is
the first due to be partly privatised, possibly in 1995, but plans to sell
up to 50 per cent of the company have been held up by a reported dispute
among top management and rows in parliament.

Red October, a Moscow-based confectionery company, yesterday launched
Russia's biggest public share offering for cash as part of a broader
government-sponsored effort to encourage industry to raise equity finance.
The issue, which has been underwritten by Russian companies and financial
institutions, will raise Rbs70bn (Pounds 13.8m) for new investment. Red
October, or Krasny Oktyabr, is one of the best known companies in Moscow,
occupying an imposing red-brick site on an island opposite the Kremlin. Its
250 confectionery lines, including Clumsy Bear chocolates and Lobster Tail
sweets, have been popular with generations of Russians.
The issue is being part-financed by the UK government's Know-How fund. Mr
Richard Wilson, adviser to the fund, said the first stage of the Russian
privatisation programme had created a large secondary market for trading
shares but had not established a primary market for companies wishing to
raise equity finance.
Of the 3.5m shares being offered, 1m will be allocated to Russian retail
investors, 1.5m to local institutional investors, with the rest being
marketed to international investors in London. Unlike most Russian
companies, Krasny Oktyabr has maintained stable production levels in the
past few years and made profits of Rbs16.6bn on turnover of Rbs71.2bn in the
first six months of 1994.

Russia yesterday sharply raised the stakes in the civil war in the North
Caucasian republic of Chechnya by threatening to use 'every means' to quell
the conflict if the republic's government did not disband its forces, hand
over all weapons and release Russian prisoners. President Boris Yeltsin said
the hope of an independent solution had been exhausted. He gave the Chechen
authorities until 6am tomorrow to comply with the conditions.
President Dzhokar Dudayev of Chechnya - who has claimed independence since
the end of 1991 - said that the conflict which brought opposition forces to
the doors of his palace in the capital, Grozny, on Sunday had been quelled.
He said no 'repressive action' would be taken against the Russian soldiers
captured in the fighting - which Chechen sources put at 70 but which
independent sources say number no more than about 12.
The Chechen authorities have claimed that Russia is supplying weapons and
men to the opposition forces, one of whose leaders is Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov,
former speaker of the Russian Supreme Soviet until its suppression by
President Yeltsin last October.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Unions force Iberia to scale down planned cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The management of Iberia, Spain's loss-making national carrier, yesterday
scaled back ambitious cost-cutting measures in the face of fierce union
strike action.
Iberia, which had wanted a 15 per cent pay cut over two years as part of a
viability plan to stem heavy losses, accepted the unions' offer to cut wages
by 8 per cent.
The company also agreed to make up back pay totalling Pta10bn (Pounds 49m),
owed under earlier salary agreements, which it had previously said it was
not in a position to honour.
As part of the agreement, two union officials who sat on the airline's board
will also join its four-member executive committee. A number of joint
management and union committees have been set up to monitor the viability
plan.
The settlement was welcomed by the industry minister, Mr Juan Manuel
Eguiagaray, who said it set the stage for the injection of fresh public
subsidies to the airline.
The aid package, likely to total Pta130bn, has to be authorised by a
sceptical European Commission.
Brussels permitted Madrid to pay a 'final' subsidy of Pta120bn to Iberia in
1992 but much of this has since been lost in ambitious but unprofitable
acquisitions in Latin America.
Analysts believe Iberia has now bowed to union pressure and failed to
address Iberia's uncompetitive cost structure. 'The agreement looks like a
climbdown,' said Ms Alexandra Perricone, Spain country analyst of brokers
James Capel in London.
Wildcat strikes by the company's 25,000 employees on Monday closed 40
domestic airports, stranded more than 100,000 passengers and incurred Pta1bn
losses for the airline.
Air traffic returned to normal yesterday but Iberia, which has accumulated
losses of Pta150bn, is on course to lose Pta44bn this year.
The agreement increases the number of redundancies, through incentives and
early retirement, from 2,200 over two years to 3,500 over three years.

<TEXT>
Italian prime minister Mr Silvio Berlusconi last night headed off a break
with his coalition partner, the populist Northern League, by winning limited
approval for a document outlining the main objectives of the six-month-old
right-wing coalition. The move followed threats by Mr Umberto Bossi, the
League leader, to pull out of the coalition once the 1995 budget had passed
through parliament. The document, prepared by Mr Berlusconi over the weekend
and presented at yesterday's cabinet meeting, centred on plans to create a
more decentralised administrative structure, deferring to the League's
demands for greater federalism. Other elements included acceleration of the
reform of public administration, a shake-up of the justice system and the
introduction of anti-trust laws to avoid the prime minister's conflict of
interest with his Fininvest business empire. The cabinet session also gave
Mr Berlusconi authority to negotiate an agreement on pensions with the trade
unions - but keeping reform of the pension system inside the 1995 budget
legislation. The talks with the unions will be held today in an effort to
avert their plan for a general strike on Friday in protest against the
budget.

Spanish industrial production was up 7.5 per cent in September against the
same month last year, underlining a stronger than expected economic
recovery. Over the first nine months of the year industrial output has risen
6.7 per cent against 1993. The breakdown for September showed growth evenly
distributed between intermediate goods which were up by 7.2 per cent,
consumer goods which rose by 6.1 per cent and capital goods which increased
by 6 per cent. The main contributor was the car and car components sector
where industrial production surged 20 per cent. The government has upgraded
its 1994 growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.3 per cent at the start of
the year and from 1.7 per cent in the summer.
Swedish producer prices rose 0.5 per cent in October from September, and 5.8
per cent year-on-year.
Italian wage inflation stood at an annual 2.1 per cent in September after
2.2 per cent in August. The September rise compares with an annual growth of
3.9 per cent in consumer prices.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Balladur calls for a more flexible Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government yesterday fired its first salvo of proposals for
constitutional reform of the European Union in 1996, calling for more
flexible integration in a non-federal Union and for reform of EU
institutions to make them more democratic and efficient.
The proposals, timed to produce some German reaction during the
Franco-German summit which began in Bonn yesterday, came in newspaper
articles by prime minister Edouard Balladur and his European affairs
minister, Mr Alain Lamassoure.
Writing in Le Monde, Mr Balladur made clear that France would seek to retain
its central position in the new variable-speed Europe he envisages.
He wrote: 'To avoid being shifted off to the west, and therefore
marginalised by the enlargement of the EU to the north and east, France must
set itself several objectives - to deepen further the Franco-German
relationship, to develop co-operation with the UK particularly in defence,
and to tighten its links with Italy and Spain', as well as promoting EU
policies towards the Mediterranean.
While a deepening of the Paris-Bonn axis might justify a new version of the
1963 Elysee treaty between the two countries, Mr Balladur said an enlarged
Europe 'could not be federal', and warned some members of Germany's ruling
Christian Democrat party against seeing in the Brussels Commission 'the
beginnings of a federal executive'. A federal state 'would mean that one
would expand considerably majority voting. Therefore the five big states
representing four-fifths of the (Union's) population and wealth could be put
in a minority'. This would be unacceptable for France.
In comments that will appeal to Eurosceptics in the UK as well as in France,
the French prime minster said enlargement would require the Union to be more
modest in its funding and its calls on the resources of member states. He
also complained that the European Court of Justice's rulings were too
expansive in extending the powers of the Union.
Mr Lamassoure was even more specific. Writing in Le Figaro, the minister
said 'subsidiarity', or taking more decisions at national and regional
levels rather than in Brussels, would have to be rewritten in 1996 'in a
more precise, more homogenous and more restrictive way'. Bringing more
states into the Union would 'reduce the subjects of common interest' between
them, he said.
In an effort to meet France's main worries about a bigger Union's
decision-making efficiency with Germany's desire for greater democracy in
the EU, Mr Lamassoure suggested hiving off the Council of Ministers'
management role from its legislative function.
Mr Lamassoure broke new ground by suggesting a two-tier executive, along the
lines of German corporate structure.
The Council would remain the Union's supervisory board, but under it might
come either a 'directorate' (composed of bigger states, plus some smaller
ones on a rotation basis), or a 'more personalised' system around the person
of a secretary-general, as at the United Nations or Nato.
Indeed both models could be tried, the directorate for internal Union
business and a secretary-general to steer EU foreign and defence policy.
France and Germany agreed at their summit meeting last night to study giving
the Ukraine EU funds from its regular East European aid budget instead of
proposed loans that EU ministers have blocked. Britain and France have
resisted support for Ukraine until it agrees reforms with the IMF.
But yesterday France agreed with Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl that the
EU should give Kiev money out of its Tacis aid programme.

FT  30 NOV 94 / The country that went out into the cold: Norway's prospects
outside the EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A cartoon in the popular newspaper Verdens Gang yesterday morning captured
the mood of Norway's defeated pro-European campaigners: As the big ship
Europa steams towards the horizon, a rope towing a little dinghy snaps. In
the dinghy, a jubilant Norwegian shouts 'Hurrah]'
The threat of isolation - of Norway being cast adrift from its Nordic and
European neighbours - was supposed to have been the trump card in the
attempt of Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Labour party prime minister, to
win Monday's referendum on joining the European Union.
But the threat fell on too many deaf ears. Twenty-two years after Norway
voted against joining the then European Economic Community, the electorate
again decided by only a marginally smaller majority - 52.2 per cent this
year against 53.4 per cent in 1972 - to go it alone.
In many regions, an even bigger majority voted against membership than in
1972. Crucially, Mrs Brundtland failed to deliver a clear Yes in her
governing Labour party and lost the women's vote.
She failed in her strategy of winning over the vital northern fishing
communities through an agreement with Brussels on fish resources endorsed by
Mr Jan Henry Olsen, the fisheries minister who previously had been a
Euro-sceptic, and by obtaining for Norway the EU fisheries portfolio.
Yesterday there was little doubt that the No vote had placed Norway in a
more precarious economic and political position than it faced in 1972. This
will be all the more difficult for the government to manage now that its
domestic political authority has been undermined by the referendum defeat.
'This means that our economy faces new and demanding challenges,' said Mr
Sigbjorn Johnsen, the finance minister. 'The situation calls for a continued
stable course in economic policy to strengthen confidence in the Norwegian
economy.'
In the short term, Norway's oil-dependent economy is strong, with growth of
4.5 per cent expected this year. But growth is expected to weaken to under 3
per cent next year. In the longer term, the problems are much deeper.
In 1972, the country was entering an oil bonanza that was to make Norway one
of Europe's richest countries and its biggest oil producer; now oil revenues
are due to fall sharply from 1997 onwards as oil runs out.
Natural gas will take up a good deal of the slack, but the country, which
relies on oil and gas for 16 per cent of gross domestic product, will have
to depend increasingly on its hitherto weak onshore industrial base for
employment and government revenues. Manufacturing industry currently
accounts for 15 per cent of GDP, considered a minimum level for modern
industrialised economies.
Norwegian industry, which has its main markets in the EU, has the benefit of
the European Economic Area trade accord with the Union. But now that fellow
members Austria, Sweden and Finland have elected for full EU membership, the
EEA only applies to Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, raising a question
mark over the EEA's long-term status. Norway will also stand outside the
economic policy-making process in Brussels.
Already yesterday, Norway was in the awkward position of being excluded from
an EU energy ministers' meeting, despite its predominant position in the
energy sector.
'The No we have gotten means that we lose the possibility to be in the place
where the important economic framework conditions are made for the
development of industry and value creation for Norway. The result will be
uncertain jobs, reduced value creation and thereby weakened economic
fundamentals for our welfare system,' warned Mr Diderik Schnitler, president
of the Confederation of Norwegian Business and Industry.
A big fear is that Norway will now lose out on investment. Outside the oil
industry, Norway already attracts very little direct foreign investment and
foreign oil companies such as Shell, Esso and Mobil are diverting capital to
new petroleum provinces which offer better incentives.
At the same time, local industrial giants Norsk Hydro, a diversified
conglomerate, Kvaerner, the engineering and shipbuilding company, and
Hafslund Nycomed, the pharmaceutical specialist, have warned that their
tendency to invest overseas over the past decade will be reinforced.
Politically, Mrs Brundtland's worst fears have been realised by the No vote.
With Norway staying out of the EU while Sweden and Finland join Denmark as
members, a split has opened up within the ranks of the four principal Nordic
countries. Inevitably, the priority for Denmark, Finland and Sweden now will
be to co-ordinate first on EU-related issues.
More seriously, Norway as a Nato member bordering Russia will not be able to
become a full member of the Western European Union, which is set to become
the new pillar of western European security policy. Mrs Brundtland fears
that Nato's commitment to Norway's security will be downgraded or at least
weakened.
Domestically, the No vote has raised a question mark over the future of Mrs
Brundtland, who is in her third term as prime minister. Although she has
pledged to stay in office, she may in the months to come have to consider
retirement after failing to achieve what would have been her crowning
triumph.
Her government is not under immediate threat, despite being in a minority,
thanks to the divisions within the opposition parties. Ms Anne Enger
Lahnstein, leader of the main opposition Centre party and the principal
winner of the referendum campaign, has made no serious play to unseat the
government. But Mrs Brundtland is likely to come under pressure from anti-EU
ranks within the Labour party for a cabinet reshuffle to include their
leading figures.

<TEXT>
Norway's No to membership of the European Union means that the EU will have
to act quickly if it is to meet its target of January 1 1995 for entry of
its three other new members - Austria, Finland, and Sweden.
The immediate threat is Spain's insistence that it receive improved fishing
rights won during accession negotiations with Norway last March,
specifically entry into the Common Fisheries Policy with Portugal by January
1 1996.
The negative result of the Norwegian referendum will also mean less money
for the EU budget.
Preliminary calculations in Brussels yesterday suggested that the EU coffers
faces a shortfall of Ecu378m (Pounds 297.5m) next year, rising to more than
Ecu1bn by 1998.
Norway's No also leaves a question mark over the future of the European
Economic Area - the halfway house which links the EU and the European Free
Trade Association. With Austria, Finland and Sweden about to join the EU
club, the EEA looks a lot less robust with the remaining membership trio of
Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.
In Brussels yesterday, the public mood was one of disappointment. But most
diplomats said they had already discounted a No vote, mindful of the
Norwegian public's negative response in an earlier referendum in 1972.
'Enlargement can still be considered a success,' said one Commission
official, 'because we got three out of four countries to join.'
EU ambassadors will start work later this week in making technical
amendments to the accession treaties including fisheries, voting rights in
the Council of Ministers, and the budgets. The goal is to reach agreement at
a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels on December 19, so that all 12
member states can deposit ratification instruments in Rome by midnight on
December 31.
The most serious obstacle concerns Spain's insistence that the EU integrate
the Spanish and Portuguese fleets into the common fisheries policy in 1996.
The concession was part of a deal to allow fish-rich Norway to preserve its
own conservation rights in its own waters.
Spain's demands have run into opposition from the UK and Ireland which are
reluctant to allow the Iberian fleets into the 'Western Waters' around the
'Irish box' in the Irish sea. But the Spanish parliament is refusing to vote
on the accession treaty unless there is a legal guarantee on entry to the
CFP.
A Commission official said yesterday that the issue may have to be settled
at the European Council summit in Essen on December 9 and 10.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Clarke pledges curbs on spending: Budget offers boost for
long-term jobless and help for small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, promised sharp cuts in future government
spending and borrowing in a workmanlike Budget yesterday designed to put the
long-term jobless back to work and help small businesses.
Delivering his second Budget as chancellor, Mr Clarke announced measures,
eventually costing Pounds 680m a year, to encourage the long-term unemployed
to seek jobs and make it cheaper for companies to hire staff.
Mr Clarke also set out to make his Budget appeal to financial markets, which
fear government profligacy as the election, which must be fought by the
spring of 1997, draws nearer.
Mixed reviews followed his promises to take a total of Pounds 28bn off
general government expenditure over the three financial years starting next
April and reduce the public-sector borrowing requirement to Pounds 21.5bn in
1995-96 from the previous target of Pounds 30bn.
The markets gave the Budget a lukewarm response, with UK government bonds
ending the day  1/2 a point lower and the FTSE-100 index up only 14 points
at 3,061.1. Sterling showed little response, rising  1/2 pfennig to DM2.4550
after Mr Clarke's speech.
The chancellor said the government remained on course 'to eliminate
government borrowing entirely by the end of the decade'. The Treasury Red
Book, issued after he sat down in the Commons, included illustrative
projections of the future path of the PSBR leading to budget surpluses of
Pounds 1bn in 1998-99 and Pounds 9bn in 1999-2000.
But other Treasury figures showed that the government, rather than cutting
its 'control total' of departmental expenditure in real terms in this
financial year, now envisaged a real, inflation adjusted, increase. This
fuelled City suspicions that Mr Clarke was not as rigorous on public
spending as he professed.
The chancellor insisted that his aim was to avoid new boom-and-bust cycles
in the UK economy. But his observation that the Tories 'are tax-cutters by
instinct' served only to remind City analysts of past pre-election
give-aways. Yesterday's Budget lacked such fireworks. As expected, income
tax rates stayed unchanged at 20 per cent, 25 per cent and 40 per cent
respectively. Mr Clarke left unchanged the government's controversial plans
to increase value added tax on domestic fuel and power to 17.5 per cent from
8 per cent next April.
However, reaping a first harvest from the improvement in the government
finances, he announced the first indexation of personal income tax
allowances since 1992 and a widening of the 20 per cent income tax band to
Pounds 3,200 instead of the Pounds 3,100 required by indexation.
In a Budget that focused on micro-economic measures, the chancellor also
sought to address many sources of discontent with the government in the Tory
party, among businesses and the electorate.
He outlined measures to help small businesses and promote investment in
growing companies.
In a move to allay discontent among Tories in parliament, he targeted
pensioners for special treatment, adding to the compensation announced last
year to offset the effects of the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel and
power, and easing their income tax burden.
While announcing large cuts in overall government expenditure targets, Mr
Clarke said the government would boost health spending in real terms, in
this financial year and next, and provide more money for the police.
In a speech that seemed often to steal Labour's clothes, he promised a
crackdown on tax avoidance, to yield Pounds 1.5bn in three years.
The purpose of the Budget, Mr Clarke said, was to build sustained growth
with low inflation on unexpectedly strong growth this year of 4 per cent and
the low, 2 per cent, annual rate of underlying inflation. For next year, he
forecast growth of 3 1/4 per cent.
However, he said underlying retail price inflation, which excludes mortgage
interest payments, was set to rise slightly next year. After reaching a
plateau of 2 1/2 per cent, it should resume its downward trend. Mr Clarke
reaffirmed the government's goal of underlying inflation in the lower half
of its 1 per cent to 4 per cent target band by the end of this parliament.
The chancellor and Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Treasury chief secretary, used
this year's low inflation to push down future public expenditure.
The control total for 1995-96, which covers departmental expenditure but
excludes most cyclical social security outlays and debt interest, was cut by
Pounds 6.9bn to Pounds 255.7bn from the Pounds 262.6bn announced last year.
Control totals for 1996-97 and 1997-98 were pared by Pounds 8.3bn and Pounds
8.9bn respectively to Pounds 263.5bn and Pounds 272.1bn.
However, the control total for 1994-95 was trimmed by only Pounds 1.3bn to
Pounds 249.6bn, disappointing analysts who expected a cut of about Pounds
3bn. The Budget plans should bring down general government expenditure,
excluding privatisation proceeds, to 40 per cent of gross domestic product
in 1998-99 from a recent peak of 44.5 per cent in 1992-93.
Spending cuts and faster growth will sharply reduce the PSBR - the most
closely watched indicator from the financial markets' viewpoint. That is now
expected to be Pounds 34.5bn in the current financial year, whereas a year
ago, before Mr Clarke's first Budget, there were fears that it would balloon
to Pounds 50bn. At Pounds 21.5bn in 1995-96, the projected PSBR will meet
the Maastricht criterion of 3 per cent for government deficits. The Treasury
expects the PSBR to fall to Pounds 13bn in 1996-97 and Pounds 5bn in
1997-98.
Mr Clarke said the government had saved on most spending programmes. To
reduce waste, he said cash running costs in civil service departments would
be the same in 1997-98 as in the past financial year.
As part of attempts to control social security costs, he announced changes
to housing benefit to curb councils' payment of excessive rents. The
government will also limit its support for mortgage interest payments when
people are unemployed.
The most innovative part of the Budget was the large package of measures to
help the long-term unemployed back to work. The package, which will involve
Pounds 375m in enhanced benefits and Pounds 305m in lower employers'
national insurance contributions in 1996-97, is intended to avoid the
emergence of an underclass - 'a class of people who are excluded from
economic activity', the chancellor said.
Besides reforms of training and housing benefit, employer national insurance
contributions will be cut by 0.6 per cent for employees earning less than
Pounds 205 a week. Any employer taking on someone who has been unemployed
for two years will have a one year 'holiday' from national insurance
contributions.
The support for businesses built on last year's similar measures. The
government will spend Pounds 605m in 1995-96 to ease the cost of new
business rates.
The Budget will also implement a venture capital trust scheme, that was
foreshadowed last year. This will offer big income tax and capital gains tax
concessions on investments up to Pounds 100,000 in trusts that will invest
mainly in unquoted companies.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Tory ranks pin hopes on tax cuts before election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers and Tory MPs last night grasped at the prospect of income tax cuts
before the general election as Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget drew a respectful
but less than ecstatic reception on the government backbenches.
The deep cuts in spending announced by the chancellor - and the parallel
falls in his projections for public borrowing - raised the morale of a party
battered by the latest infighting over Europe.
But Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, signalled that the opposition would
next week try to kindle a Tory backbench rebellion over the imposition of
full rate value added tax on domestic fuel.
Mr Clarke's emphasis on restoring order to public finances, building
confidence in the economic recovery and reviving work incentives for the
unemployed were applauded by senior Conservatives as a sensible medium-term
strategy.
The chancellor enhanced his reputation as a politician with the confidence
to shrug off short-term expediency and to plan for the medium term.
Amid widespread fears, however, that the Budget would do little to boost the
government's popularity in the short term, other cabinet ministers suggested
that its success would depend on reinforcing discipline on the back benches.
Senior ministers are resigned to a crushing defeat in next-month's Dudley
by-election, a result that might add impetus to a threatened Conservative
revolt over VAT on domestic fuel.
Mr Clarke's announcement of help for the elderly to meet the costs of the
increase in the tax from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent in April failed to
dispel disquiet over the rise among the government's supporters.
After confirmation yesterday that eight Tory MPs had been suspended from the
parliamentary party after Monday's revolt on Europe and that a ninth had
resigned the Conservative whip, Mr Major signalled he wanted to avoid
another confrontation.
In spite of the chancellor's insistence that the VAT increase was an
essential part of his overall tax measures, Mr Major refused to elevate it
into an issue of confidence.
His enemies on the right of the party appeared unable last night to muster
sufficient support to mount a challenge before today's deadline for a
contest. Nevertheless, ministers remain in doubt as to whether the
government will be able to delay an election until 1997.
Meanwhile, rightwing hopes that the government will seek to bridge Tory
divisions by agreeing to a referendum on further European integration were
boosted by Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Treasury chief secretary.
In a Budget interview, Mr Aitken said a decision to join a single European
currency would prompt a decision on whether to use 'the normal channels of
parliamentary democracy, or whether we should go to a referendum'.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Big rise in US consumer confidence: Bond prices fall sharply
on fears over pace of economic expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US consumer confidence leapt this month to its highest level for four years,
alarming stock and bond markets which had assumed that consumer spending and
the pace of expansion would cool in the months ahead.
The Conference Board, a New York-based business grouping, said its widely
watched monthly index jumped to 101.3 in November, up an 'imposing' 12
points from October.
The index, based on a survey of 5,000 households, showed sharp increases in
confidence levels in all regions of the country except the south, although
even there confidence improved slightly.
Financial markets took fright at the signal of economic strength, which
comes despite the Federal Reserve's decision to raise short-term interest
rates by an unexpectedly fierce  3/4 of a percentage point on November 15.
Bond prices fell sharply yesterday just after the board's announcement,
while the dollar rose.
In late trading, the 30-year Treasury bond was half a point down at 94,
yielding 8.026 per cent. The stock market ended flat, although earlier in
the day it had followed declines in the bond market. The Dow Jones
industrial average finished 1.01 down at 3,738.55.
Most economic forecasts predict a slowdown in growth next year after the
Fed's 2 1/2 -percentage-point increase in short-term rates so far this year.
But Mr Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's consumer
research centre, said the level of the index suggested that the economy
would continue expanding.
'The latest consumer confidence readings strongly suggest that fears of an
imminent slowing of the economy are unrealistic,' he said.
A survey of 47 economists published yesterday by the National Association of
Business Economists forecast that gross domestic product would grow by 2.5
per cent in 1995, slowing from 3.8 per cent this year.
However, some Wall Street economists voiced caution about the reliability of
the consumer confidence signal.
Mr Bruce Steinberg, manager of macroeconomic analysis at Merrill Lynch,
warned that consumer confidence had not proved to be a very accurate
predictor of consumer spending trends or economic activity in recent years.
'While it may reflect mood shifts, it doesn't necessarily anticipate
spending shifts,' he said, noting that the most obvious explanation was the
election result.

FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Akzo Nobel's hydro-power
operations put up for sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Akzo Nobel, the Dutch-Swedish chemicals group, is planning to sell its
hydro-power operations to Stockholm Energi, Sweden's third-largest energy
producer.
Analysts said the deal could be worth more than SKr2bn (Dollars 160.7m) on a
debt-free basis.
The move will end a century-long involvement by Nobel in the energy business
and is in line with its strategy of focusing on core businesses.
Akzo Nobel, formed this year through the merger of Sweden's Nobel Industries
and Akzo of the Netherlands, has a 40 per cent stake in Njordkraft, which
owns four medium-sized and three smaller hydro-power plants in Sweden with a
combined production capacity of 940 gigawatt hours. The plants have
traditionally met about 50 per cent of the group's Swedish energy needs.
The remaining Njordkraft shares are held by financial investors, mainly
pension funds and insurance groups. Akzo has options to purchase these
shares next year, enabling Stockholm Energi to gain full control of the
concern.
Mr Dag Stromqvist, managing director of Eka Nobel, said: 'We are not in the
power business. We are in the chemicals business.' He declined to disclose
terms, saying talks were at an early stage.
Stockholm Energi produces around 13 terawatt hours of electricity a year.
Half its output is generated by nuclear power and 35 per cent by
hydro-electric power.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Saudi loses asylum bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mohammed Masari, an opponent of the government in Saudi Arabia, is to
appeal against a British decision not to grant him political asylum, he said
yesterday, Our Foreign Staff reports.
Mr Masari, who arrived in Britain in April on a Yemeni passport, said he
learned last week his application had been turned down.
The British government, which values its links with Saudi Arabia, has come
under pressure from Riyadh not to allow Mr Masari to remain.
A founder-member of the Committee for the Defence of Legitimate Rights, Mr
Masari was imprisoned for six months in Saudi Arabia last year.
On his release from prison, Mr Masari travelled to Yemen, then on to London,
where he has made repeated accusations against Saudi Arabia's ruling family.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Refugee zones scheme urged for Rwanda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINSHASA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The presidents of Rwanda and neighbouring Zaire and Burundi called for
internationally supervised security zones to be set up in Rwanda to
encourage the return of hundreds of thousands of Hutu refugees, Reuter
reports from Kinshasa.
Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, Rwanda's Pasteur Bizimungu and Burundi's
Sylvestre Ntibantuganya added that refugees remaining in Zaire would be
relocated further from the border with Rwanda, according to a statement read
on state television yesterday. 'Refugees refusing to return to their country
of origin will be moved away from the frontier,' it said.
The three men agreed on the need for the zones at a summit on Saturday at
Mobutu's northern palace at Gbadolite. It was the latest of several meetings
aimed at resolving the crisis caused by an exodus of more than 1m Rwandans
who fled the advancing Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) in July.
The new Tutsi-dominated Rwandan government sees the presence in eastern
Zaire of the refugees, discouraged from returning by the former Hutu militia
leaders, ex-ministers and army chiefs in their midst, as a serious security
threat .
Burundi, where there are escalating clashes between local Hutus and Tutsis,
believes that an influx of 200,000 Rwandans into its territory is fuelling
ethnic hatred.
Zaire, a close ally of the ousted Hutu leaders, is deeply concerned about
deteriorating security in the squalid camps along its border with Rwanda.
Zairean troops shot dead at least 18 people and wounded 70 in the Katale
camp on Thursday and Friday after a soldier was killed in a quarrel over a
refugee's car registration.
Zaire on Sunday expelled 37 Hutus from the teeming Goma refugee camp,
handing them over to RPF troops at the border in what an official said was a
crackdown on crime.
Mr Mobutu, hosting the Gbadolite summit, was quoted as calling the security
zone idea a great step forward and saying he hoped it would win
international backing.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (18): 'Still pushing strongly' -
Colleagues Direct Marketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One industry which has expanded in Bristol and the west of England is direct
mail, as exemplified by Colleagues Direct Marketing, the award-winning
private company based in Bath, writes Roland Adburgham.
Mr James Robson, chairman of Colleagues, which he and his wife started in
the city in 1987, has grown rapidly to have a likely turnover this year of
Pounds 40m, a leap of Pounds 12m on the previous year.
It is, he says, 'still pushing very strongly' and he expects sales to reach
Pounds 57m next year.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 2m in 1993 are targeted to reach just over Pounds
3m this year. 'We have made a profit from day one,' says Mr Robson, 'and it
has risen by leaps and bounds.'
There are plans, subject to market conditions, to float the company on the
stock exchange.
Mr Robson and his co-directors have a controlling interest in the company,
but all 80 employees are shareholders. 'The sense of participation in the
company is very important.'
Charterhouse, the venture capital group, has a 20 per cent stake.
Colleagues specialises in high-volume direct mail for clients such as
Barclaycard, British Telecom, Reader's Digest, Sun Life, Vernons Pools and
leading charities.
The company offers a service of 'recruitment activity' - finding potential
customers - and designs and organises mail-shots and analyses the response.
Mr Robson attributes Colleagues' expansion, despite the recession, to a
combination of two factors.
Companies have become less indiscriminate in their advertising and are
increasing their use of direct mail to have a more targeted approach, giving
better value for money.
Secondly, there are new clients which have never previously used direct
mail.
The unusual name of Colleagues was chosen to reflect that 'a company is a
company - not one or two egos - and we want to work with our clients almost
as if we were on their payrolls.
'Our clients see us as genuine partners - more as colleagues than as an
agency.'
Mr Robson says that both he and his wife have always felt as if the west
country were their natural home.
'Bath has been an excellent choice for us. It has worked very well. The only
problem is the great difficulty in finding office accommodation to match our
growth - we are now in three buildings.'

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (19): Aiming for impulse purchases -
Parragon Book Services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Avonmouth is not Bloomsbury, and Parragon Book Services, with its premises
next to an M5 motorway junction, may not be as familiar a name as Thames &amp;
Hudson or Macmillan. But last year, it sold 12m books and this year expects
to reach sales of 20m.
PBS was set up only six years ago by Mr Guy Parr and Mr Paul Anderson, both
of whom had worked for WH Smith.
Their philosophy is simple: to sell books at such low prices that they will
be bought as impulse purchases in large quantities at supermarkets, motorway
service stations, newsagents and bargain bookshops.
The company now employs more than 80 people. Pre-tax profits dipped in 1993
to Pounds 404,000 but Mr Anderson says: 'We have tightened up the running of
the business.'
He expects profits of more than Pounds 1m this year on turnover of about
Pounds 20m.
The company, which contracts out its printing, supplies books to Asda,
Co-operative Retail Society, Presto, Safeway and Tesco supermarkets.
'By doing large print runs, we can get the cost-price down,' says Mr
Anderson. 'We are very much a sales-driven company.'
One element of this is computerised stock control - 'We had our own software
written for us from day one.'
This year, it set up a publishing division to produce its own titles, with
3i, the venture capital group, investing Pounds 1m to take a 10 per cent
equity stake.
Mr Anderson says the company has no immediate intention of seeking a
stockmarket flotation, 'but we keep open our options for the future.'
Its publishing division will specialise in cookery, gardening, art and
children's books.
The most recent titles are a series called 'Quote Unquote', featuring
Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, the Beatles and Laurel and Hardy. And it has
published a series called 'life and works' of famous artists, selling at
just Pounds 1.99 a copy.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (17): Taking stakes in other companies -
GWR Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few radio listeners in the west of England will not have heard the slogans
'Better music mix' and 'No rap, less chat,' writes Roland Adburgham.
Remorselessly, they are repeated on GWR-FM, the commercial radio station. Mr
Chris Scott, station director in Bristol, describes them as 'positioning
statements.'
In terms of position, GWR Group, based in Bristol and Swindon, has
established itself as the UK's biggest commercial radio company after
Capital Radio. Earlier this year, it took over a clutch of Midlands and East
Anglian stations and now holds the permitted maximum of 20 radio licences.
While lobbying the government to raise the limit, it has been taking stakes
in other radio companies. It holds 17 per cent of Classic FM, the national
commercial station, and has shareholdings in various companies from Plymouth
to York.
In July, GWR, which is quoted on the unlisted securities market, won Price
Waterhouse's award for the West of England business of the year. In the six
months to March 31, it had a turnover of Pounds 7.8m, an increase of 90 per
cent on the same period last year. Pre-tax profits nearly trebled to Pounds
930,000.
In the west, GWR-FM, together with its sister AM station Brunel Classic
Gold, lifted the combined market share to 30 per cent this summer, based on
Radio Joint Audience Research, compared with 20 per cent in the same period
last year.
Mr Simon Cooper, area director for GWR South, stresses the group's policy of
'listener-responsive radio' for increasing audiences. Output is heavily
influenced by telephone interviews, in which listeners are asked to rate
songs on a scale ranging from 'haven't heard it' or 'dislike it' to 'I
really like the song.'
The format of news bulletins is also influenced by listener research. There
is strong interest shown in local and UK news, but very little in reports
about the royal family. Mr Simon Cooper, area director, explains that this
is because royal stories are mainly visual in appeal.
The group's ambitions now include expansion in eastern Europe. In Poland, it
has taken a stake in Inforadio in Warsaw, in partnership with BBC World
Service. It has also a 48 per cent holding in Radio FM Plus in Sofia,
Bulgaria.
Back in Bristol, at GWR's studios at the Watershed media centre, a
'positioning statement' jingle has been recorded for the Sofia station. In
Bulgarian, it means 'Only hits.'

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (16): Set for expansion - Company profile
of Badgerline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The headquarters of what has become Britain's second-largest bus operator
might be assumed to be utilitarian offices next to a noisy depot. Instead,
it is to be found in a renovated farmhouse six miles from Weston-super-Mare,
surrounded by fields and approached across a cattle grid.
Badgerline employs 10,700 people and runs 3,900 vehicles. But at the
headquarters - renamed Badger Manor after the company moved there in 1989 -
there is only a dozen staff.
From this modest base, Mr Trevor Smallwood, the executive chairman, and his
fellow directors saw the company floated on the stock exchange in November
last year, raising Pounds 35m.
The company was established in 1986 when it was bought out by its management
and employees - Mr Smallwood was the managing director - from National Bus
Company as part of the government's privatisation programme.
Badgerline then had an annual turnover of Pounds 15m and 400 vehicles.
For the half-year to June 30, it reported a turnover of Pounds 93.3m and
pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.4m, up from Pounds 2.6m in the same period last
year.
The flotation, with the Bristol offices of KPMG Peat Marwick and Burges
Salmon, the law firm, as advisers, was intended to provide funds for
expansion and acquisitions.
As a result, PMT Group, based in Staffordshire and Cheshire, was bought for
Pounds 23m and the Yorkshire-based Rider Group for Pounds 38m.
The two companies, which have a total fleet of nearly 1,600 vehicles, have
already boosted profits.
Mr Chris Carr, marketing director, pronounces the company as 'very
satisfied' with its decision to float.
In Bristol, Badgerline is known for its City Line subsidiary, which has
1,000 staff, a fleet of 353 vehicles, and a turnover of some Pounds 23m.
Mr Smallwood says that, since deregulation, the number of buses in the area
has risen from 207 to 319 and operating miles have increased greatly. More
than half the fleet has been replaced in the past four years.
Overall, Badgerline has bought 370 new vehicles this year.
This summer, it placed orders for 900 vehicles at a cost of almost Pounds
60m, believed to be the largest order yet placed by a non-publicly-owned bus
company.
Mr Smallwood, whose career began with Yorkshire Traction in 1966, comments:
'There is public recognition that we cannot continue in urban areas to use
the car ad infinitum - the only way is to develop and improve public
transport.'

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (15): Information 'highway' to stimulate
regeneration - Community enterprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first sight, the electronic world of the information 'superhighways' is
far removed from the unemployed of Hartcliffe, a deprived part of south
Bristol which gained national notoriety in 1992 because of rioting, writes
Roland Adburgham.
Hartcliffe is not a typical inner-city suburb. When its post-war housing
estates were built by the local authority, the planners might have believed
they were creating a desirable environment. Set within sight of fields and
hills, Hartcliffe has wide streets, green spaces, houses with gardens and
only a handful of high-rise blocks.
In common with many other imposed ideas, it was badly flawed. Hartcliffe
lacked shops and community facilities. It was isolated by several miles from
the city centre with no rail service and poor road connections. Crucially,
there was no social mix of housing.
There was also over-dependency upon a single employer, a Wills tobacco
factory. When that closed four years ago, about 4,000 people lost their
jobs. No alternative use for the factory has yet been found by Hanson, the
owner. Despite the establishment of a business park in Hartcliffe, attempts
for large-scale job creation are handicapped by the inadequate transport
links. Unemployment is above the Bristol average and rates of economic
activity are low.
It is against this background that an innovative project has been launched
as a stimulus to regeneration. The South Bristol Learning Network (SBLN)
intends to develop a cable-based telecommunications infrastructure not for
commercial gain but community gain.
The concept is that cable, by linking houses, businesses, schools and other
organisations, helps to circumvent transport problems and provides access to
local, national and international information sources.
The network has potential for use as a billboard, for interactive TV
programmes, public access broadcasting and teleworking. The hope is that it
will improve the skills of the labour force, encourage lifelong learning and
help to rebuild a sense of community.
Funding of Pounds 750,000 has come from Avon training and enterprise
council, which secured the money last year under the government's Tec
Challenge competition. The partnership project, developed jointly with South
Bristol College, is using a cable network laid by United Artists.
Mr John O'Hara, the evangelistic project leader, sees the network as a
prototype which can be replicated across the country. Considerable interest
has already been shown in the US. He emphasises how the SBLN contrasts with
the usual 'top down' development of information superhighways, with little
involvement at community level. 'The potential for cultural change is
immense,' he says. 'While the first responses of local people are usually
negative, subsequently they become more positive as they see how they can
shape the technology for their own ends.'
Staff for the SBLN have been recruited locally from among the unemployed,
who mostly lacked skills in new technology. More than 50 employees have been
trained, more than half of whom had been previously out of work for at least
six months. They come from a variety of backgrounds and ages, ranging from
19 to 60. An assessment of the project for Avon Tec reported: 'They have set
about their tasks with enthusiasm, drawing on previously untapped energy and
expertise.'
This month, the SBLN started 'cyberskills' workshops at ICL's offices in
Bristol to create a city-wide awareness of the potential of multimedia. Mr
Malcolm Napier, ICL's business development manager responsible for the
company's lifelong learning strategy, describes the workshops as 'giving
first-hand experience of what the superhighway means.'
The workshops are being run by SBLN's staff and undergraduates from the
computer science department of Bristol University. They are sponsored by ICL
in association with Avon Tec, BT, CompuServe and South Bristol College. Over
the next few months, the workshops will demonstrate to 1,000 people,
identified as 'community influencers', how to use the Internet, e-mail,
CD-Rom and video-conferencing.
In job-creation terms, the SBLN will have limited impact on Hartcliffe, at
least in the short-term. But it is indicative of a realisation that there is
no single or simple solution to the area's problems.
A separate partnership scheme to raise the Hartcliffe skills base and
improve the community is the Gatehouse Centre. This Pounds 1.5m building, to
open next year, is being funded by the government with a Pounds 500,000
urban partnership grant, the city council and the private sector, which has
so far donated Pounds 350,000. Initiated by Hartcliffe &amp; Withywood Ventures,
it will include a training centre with a nursery, light industrial units,
meeting room, cafe and shops.
Another local community project, to help young people, is Hartcliffe
Leisure. This is a company set up in partnership with the Bristol Chamber of
Commerce and Initiative to organise a range of after-school activities. One
of the grants which helped to establish it came from the Greater Bristol
Foundation. A charitable trust set up in 1987, the foundation provides a
professional service for donors who want to support local causes but who
need advice on identifying potential beneficiaries.
The foundation now has an endowment fund of more than Pounds 2m, contributed
by a wide range of companies, organisations, charitable trusts and
individuals. It has distributed more than Pounds 700,000 to more than 300
schemes and groups. The priorities are projects for young and disabled
people, the homeless and those disadvantaged by isolation.
Penny Johnstone, the director, says that the outside view of Bristol as a
prosperous city does not tally with the evidence of areas of deprivation.
But within the city, she says, there have been large strides in the past few
years in the willingness of people to collaborate in supporting such
projects.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (14): City centre versus outskirts -
Businesses are moving out of town
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When John Lewis, the department stores group, announced this year it would
close its Bristol store in 1997 and move to Cribbs Causeway, an out-of-town
regional shopping centre, it sent shock waves through the city.
It reinforced fears that Bristol was in danger of succumbing to the
'doughnut' effect, with retailers and companies moving to the city fringes
and leaving a hollow centre.
To the north of Bristol, in particular, there has been substantial
development.
This includes a Pounds 254m procurement headquarters being built for the
Ministry of Defence. At more than 1m sq ft and designed for 5,700 staff,
this is said to be the UK's largest current office development.
Another big project nearby, on the Parkway business park, is a 600,000 sq ft
headquarters for Sun Life which will house 2,400 staff. The staff will
relocate from separate buildings in the city centre, reinforcing the
'doughnut' fears.
Cribbs Causeway itself is north of Bristol, next to the M5 motorway. A
development by Prudential Assurance and JT Bayliss, it is planned to have
650,000 sq ft of retail space, with John Lewis and Marks and Spencer taking
a total of 230,000 sq ft.
After two public inquiries, the shopping centre was approved by the
environment secretary in 1991, before his department's tardy awareness of
the effect on town centres of out-of-town stores.
John Lewis's existing store is a mainstay of the city's principal shopping
centre, Broadmead. It is a post-war centre, showing its age, with a dreary
environment and poor access.
As a result, it is calculated that Bristol attracts lower retail spending
than should be expected of a regional capital.
What John Lewis's decision has achieved is a concentration of minds. This
has been further encouraged by the retail aspect of Bristol Development
Corporation's proposed Quay Point, which is also perceived as a threat to
Broadmead. For its part, the BDC argues that Quay Point, by improving the
city's range of shopping, will help to arrest Broadmead's decline.
There is now a positive intention to improve Broadmead by the council, which
is the landlord, the retailers, and Bristol Chamber of Commerce and
Initiative. 'Broadmead is not dead but it is sick - it needs revitalising,'
says one leading chamber member. 'But I think with co-operation between the
chamber and city it can be solved.'
A new retail occupier is being sought for the five-storey John Lewis
building.
One improvement already has been the Norwich Union development of the
Galleries' enclosed shopping centre near Broadmead. Although it opened
during the recession, it has let reasonably well.
For companies, the attractions of being north of Bristol have been the
liberal planning policies of Northavon district council plus access to the
M5 and M4 motorways.
For example, the long-established Aztec West business park, managed by
Arlington, has more than 80 companies. Pearce Developments has started
infrastructure work for a second Parkway business park on 40 acres.
At Bristol Business Park, a 38-acre site in north Bristol, contracts were
exchanged this month between Bristol &amp; England Properties and Barclays Bank
Pension Fund for the funding of its second phase. The Pounds 11m scheme is
described as one of the largest speculative fundings in the Bristol area for
five years.
Longer-term, there is the prospect of commercial development on 400 acres at
Emer sons Green.
In contrast, companies have complained of transport and parking difficulties
in the city centre and, at least until recently, of an unhelpful attitude by
Bristol council.
Hartnell Taylor Cook, the property consultant, describes the council as
having hitherto taken a regressive attitude towards office development. Car
parking was restricted to a ratio of one space per 5,000 sq ft. 'This policy
has proved commercially unacceptable,' it remarks.
Under its draft local plan, the council has revised that to one space per
2,000 sq ft.
Mr Edward Cussen of King Sturge, comments that there is now a positive
spirit of co-operation between the public authorities and private sector.
'Coupled with this are some outstanding development opportunities and signs
that demand is increasing.'
The doughnut effect may prove to have been exaggerated. Demand for space in
the centre has not dried up, as indicated this year by Midland Life taking
30,000 sq ft of offices and Direct Line, the insurance company, occupying a
50,000 sq ft block.
'Instead of the city centre vacuum which was feared, big employers have
moved in this year, bringing hundreds of new jobs with them,' says Mr Mike
Henry, of Chesterton, the property consultant.
King Sturge reports rents remain below Pounds 20 per sq ft but incentives to
tenants are disappearing. In fact, there is a severe shortage of large, good
quality offices in the centre.
One plan is for Stonecutter Court, where Chesterton seeks an occupier for a
proposed 113,000 sq ft building.
Eaglebrook Properties has consent for Marlborough Gate, with 47,000 sq ft.
Helical Bar has a speculative scheme at Venturers House, funded by Norwich
Union. And Courage has applied for planning consent for 93,000 sq ft of
offices on a disused part of its brewery.
One deal just completed is the sale of the 26,000 sq ft Armourers' House for
nearly Pounds 3.2m to clients of Henderson Property Fund.
While Quay Point is a heavyweight project, it is rivalled in its ambitions
by plans - promoted by the council - for Harbourside, a mixed-use scheme on
the waterfront. The site is potentially one of the finest of any British
city but has remained largely derelict for many years. At long last,
agreement has been reached among the landowners and English Partnerships,
the government's regeneration agency, has indicated support.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (15): The cost of making your voice
heard - Voting rights / A look at the procedures for shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is one thing for institutional investors to flex their collective muscles
under the gaze of companies whose shares they own, but it is quite another
to deliver the knock-out punch that sends an entrenched, inefficient and
profligate management into the history books.
For that, investors say, what you need is a really good custodian,
particularly if you are talking about making your voice heard at companies
you own abroad.
Since 1988, the US Department of Labour has interpreted the Erisa laws,
setting out the rules under which US pension schemes are to be administered,
to mean that there is an obligation to scheme members to exercise their
rights at companies in which they have a stake.
As a result, custodians estimate that US pension funds vote nearly all the
time and on every issue which is laid before shareholders at domestic
corporations.
Investors in other countries are far less diligent about voting their
shares, but are increasingly interested. In the UK, the National Association
of Pension Funds, through its Voting Issues Service, is calling shareholder
attention to contentious items on corporate agendas at the annual general
meeting. The NAPF says the incidence of corporate voting has risen
dramatically from the less than 20 per cent level recorded just a few years
ago.
Voting on foreign shares by British shareholders, however, remains sketchy.
In July, the US Department of Labour clarified the obligations of US pension
funds to vote their foreign proxies, saying that there is the same
obligation to vote shares abroad as there is to vote them at home.
'What do clients want?' asked Meade Reynolds, manager of global corporate
actions in the global custody division of Mellon Trust. 'Basically they want
a vote in every single market and at every annual general meeting in every
market they are in.'
Clients not only want to vote, they want to know the substance of issues
they are voting on. For instance, Mr Reynolds said, if a new firm of
auditors is appointed, clients want to know more about the previous firm.
Also, clients want to see proof that their votes were actually cast.
Service of this type is clearly likely to be costly.
Steven Davis of the Washington DC-based Investor Research and Responsibility
Center (IRRC), says the Department of Labour does offer one caveat. 'The
Department said that pension plan officials can properly decline to vote a
proxy where they judge that the costs would outweigh any benefits,' he said.
However, because several of the large public sector schemes had been
actively - and successfully - prodding their custodians to cut the cost of
overseas voting for several years, there are few markets where it can be
said there is no obligation to vote, Mr Davis said. Indeed, Americans have
been found to outnumber domestic shareholder voters in markets such as
Australia and the Netherlands where locals do not have the instinctive urge
to vote their proxies so conscientiously.
Among large schemes, the state of Connecticut has been successful in working
with its custodian for the past few years and is now able to vote in most
markets in which it invests.
An IRRC study found that the percentage of non-US proxies voted has risen
dramatically in the past few years from 24 per cent of all shares held in
1991 to 71 per cent.
Mr Reynolds said that Mellon Trust, which operates in 48 foreign markets,
takes the view that corporate actions and proxy voting are part of the
entire package of services which a sub-custodian takes on when a contract is
negotiated. Therefore, there should not be additional significant costs
associated with it.
State Street Bank has also been successful in negotiating contracts with
sub-custodians which envisage no additional charges for proxy voting
services.
Mr Davis notes that until recently, many sub-custodians had to be dragged
'kicking and screaming' to perform the task of proxy voting abroad. However,
given growing client demand, some are now helping to alter rules in several
countries which make the costs of voting unacceptably high.
Mellon Trust has compiled a list of the seven most expensive countries in
which shareholders can exercise their voting rights, with Sweden leading the
pack. There, an institutional investor must pay Dollars 300 to cast a proxy
ballot at a meeting.
Mr Reynolds explained that in Sweden, the authorities insist that the
beneficial owner of shares be the actual voter. This requires the custodian
to obtain a power of attorney to vote on the pension fund's behalf.
Also ranking among high-cost centres is Greece, where a proxy vote costs
Dollars 214, Finland, where the cost is Dollars 213 and Italy where the cost
is Dollars 128. In Italy, physical representation at an AGM is required so
the sub-custodian also incurs the cost of air fares and/or hotel bills in
proxy voting.
Other expensive countries are Argentina, Portugal and Venezuela where the
cost is Dollars 100 each.
'Only these seven countries appear to feature proxy voting costs high enough
to raise questions about whether the effort is worth the expense,' the IRRC
said.
Other countries such as the UK, Australia and Hong Kong have made proxy
voting easy and cheap, Mr Reynolds said.
But Mr Reynolds says that nowhere is it as difficult to exercise voting
rights as in Japan. 'In Japan, 85 per cent of all companies hold their AGM
on the same day. Information is given out only two weeks in advance and
instructions on voting must be lodged 10 business days before the meeting.'
Given the difficulties of translating a large volume of documents, sending
the translations to shareholders and collecting the ballot cards, voting in
Japan is a logistical nightmare. In June this year, on the day when most
AGMs were held, Mr Reynolds said he travelled to Japan to hand-deliver the
proxy votes and to attend one AGM.
But Mr Reynolds says that US funds generally believe proxy voting is worth
it. 'In Singapore and Malaysia, where companies pass these outrageous
compensation packages for former directors, the Americans are saying 'No
way',' he noted.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (16): New areas where
traditionalists fear to tread - Sub-custodians / Who bears the risk? Norma
Cohen considers the options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

There are probably as many ways to spread the risk in dealing with
sub-custodians as there are sub-custodians to share it, says Alistair Reid,
of Barclays Global Securities Services.
The question of who bears the risk and how much it should cost is provoking
increasing interest among clients, particularly as they move their
investments into new markets where traditional custodians fear to tread.
'In the area of risk, the question of sub-custodian risk has taxed the
market for some time,' said Valentine Feerick, head of global trust and
custody at Mellon Trust Europe. 'There isn't another business in the world
where you hire someone to do a job who isn't responsible for the work of a
sub-contractor.'
For the UK's Prudential, which has excited the global custody industry by
deciding to outsource its Pounds 40bn portfolio of UK and international
securities, there was only one answer to the question.
'Sub-custodian risk is something we want nothing to do with,' said David
Hanson, a director of Prudential Portfolio Managers, the fund management arm
of the UK life insurer.
In coming up with a short-list of 10 international banks to compete for the
contract, Mr Hanson said it was made clear that a condition of winning the
contract would be that the bidder assume the risk of any failure to perform
on the part of sub-custodians. Any bank which was not prepared to go some
way towards that goal was removed from the short-list, he said.
Of course, the Pru, with one of the world's largest global custody contracts
to award, is in a secure position to demand exacting conditions of any bank.
However, not all customers are in such an enviable position, nor are all of
them sufficiently well-informed about the issue to make such a demand.
At Barclays, Mr Reid said, the bank stood behind its sub-custodial network,
indemnifying clients against losses. Typically, Barclays uses its own branch
network where possible, so that the number of sub-custodians is limited.
The most dangerous markets for investors are the emerging markets, where
local banks which could act as sub-custodians may not be subject to
sufficient regulation, or may not have the administrative capability to
handle client custody.
Mr Reid noted that banks viewed some new markets as simply too risky to
operate in successfully. They feel that clients wishing to invest in those
markets may do so but at their own peril, and must be responsible for
selecting the sub-custodian, and live with any losses.
Where a Barclays branch is used, the bank offers clients the opportunity to
check their assets in the relevant country, he said. Where a sub-custodian
is used, Barclays asks that bank's auditors to provide a 'comfort letter'
assuring Barclays that it is fulfilling its contractual obligations.
At Mellon, the bank will assume all the sub-custodian risk with the
exception of events falling under the force majeure clause. 'That means
things like military coups,' Mr Feerick explained. However, he notes, there
is a price for assuming that risk. 'You might quote a slightly lower price
for the service if the client assumes the risk.'
Bank of New York, one of the world's largest global custodians, stands
behind the sub-custodian for all operational errors, said Richard Crampton,
managing director at BONY. 'We will see our customer harmless and sort it
out with the sub-custodian.'
One of the big concerns about sub-custodians is the local jurisprudence  -
the extent to which local law governing assets held in trust is likely to be
upheld by the courts. 'Once a year we get a lawyer to opine on the
predictability of the courts in any country in which we operate,' Mr
Crampton said Mr Crampton notes that the only law which forces custodians to
monitor their sub-custodians is Rule 17-S-5 of the US Mutual Fund Act. This
stipulates a minimum capital requirement for sub-custodians, and insists
that they operate in environments where trust law is comparable with that in
the US. As a result, Mr Crampton said, 'there are some central African
countries where US mutual funds cannot invest', because they cannot find
appropriate sub-custodial arrangements.
However, he said, it would be unreasonable to expect BONY to guarantee the
solvency of any sub-custodial bank. In any event, he added, most countries
recognised the legal distinction between proprietary assets and those held
in trust for others. Trust assets might not be claimed by a bank's creditors
or regulators in most jurisdictions.
The only danger to clients comes through their cash balances, which may be
held at a bank which suddenly becomes insolvent, Mr Crampton says. However,
he offers the comforting thought that 'in most of the really diabolical
markets of this world, you wouldn't have much cash on deposit anyway.'
Moreover, he says, in the newer emerging markets - and indeed, even in
several mature markets - clients are at far greater risk from the clearing
and settlement of securities transactions than they are from their local
custodian. The dangerous period is while a securities transaction is still
waiting to settle, rather than afterwards.
At Morgan Stanley, the issue of sub-custodial risk is a significant one,
because the investment bank has almost no custody branches outside the US
and the UK. 'We will indemnify clients against fraud, negligence and wilful
misconduct,' said Ross Whitehill, head of global custody. 'If you don't do
that, you miss out on most of the larger mandates.'
Morgan Stanley says that, short of that, it will do everything it can to
sort out operational errors, some of which are the result of the client
failing to instruct the sub-custodian on time.
'We try to help,' Mr Whitehill explained. However, the extent to which
Morgan Stanley is prepared to bear its clients' sub-custodian losses is
often a function of the value of the total account. 'It gets down to how
good the relationship is,' he explained. For a client who had been squeezing
the fees and routing other business elsewhere, Morgan Stanley would be less
willing to cushion the loss.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (13): Where 'dead souls' and fake
shares abound - Russia / Nicholas Denton discusses the challenges of the
final frontier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Custody services tend not to be noticed when they work. They are the poor
cousins of the securities industry, consigned to the back office and out of
the spotlight.
Only when safekeeping of securities and settlement of transactions are
flawed does it become clear how vital they are to functioning markets. And
in few places is custody less developed, and more of an issue, than in
Russia. Observers call it 'the single biggest deterrent' to western
investment in Russia.
None of the usual assumptions apply. Russia has no paper traded system
because share certificates do not exist. Instead, the evidence of ownership
is a name in a registrar's book. For a share transaction to take place an
agent, or agents, for both buyer and seller have to go physically to the
company's registrar and re-register ownership.
That is easier said than done. There are about 3,000 registrars and those
for many of the most attractive companies, the energy giants, are far from
Moscow and St Petersburg.
This logistical morass has given rise to a mini-industry in the sale of
shares by brokers who do not actually own them. Apart from physically
inspecting a share register, the only evidence a purchaser has that he is
buying shares from their rightful owner is an extract from the official
share register.
But, as a western banker in Moscow explained, 'if you are willing to pay for
an extract, you can get as many as you like'. So, although none admit to
having been duped themselves, Russian bankers say that some businessmen,
particularly in the provinces, are doing a steady trade in fake extracts.
The unfortunate buyers learn they have been deceived only when they try to
add their names to the official register and discover that their vendor does
not appear.
These fake extracts are coming to be known as 'dead souls' in a reference to
the eponymous 19th century Russian novel by Nikolai Gogol, whose hero bought
up documents establishing his ownership of serfs who were no longer living.
After the liberation of the serfs the Tsarist government compensated their
former owners, a scheme which Gogol's hero cashed in on, using his proofs of
ownership of 'dead souls'.
But even for careful investors, who avoid buying fake shares by sending
their agents to personally inspect the share register in Siberia, or
wherever it happens to be located, the difficulties have only begun. A
registrar is allowed to take up to three days to alter the books and the
agent may have to hang around and queue. The official is allowed to charge a
transaction tax and the rate can reach as high as 5 per cent of the value of
the deal.
That is, if the buyer is lucky. The official will sometimes decide that a
piece of paperwork is missing and send the agent back to Moscow. Some
companies such as Gasprom, the Russian gas giant, can obstruct by exercising
its right of first refusal and offering a laughable price to the seller.
Getting hold of shares is difficult enough; safeguarding them is a more
fundamental problem. According to Russian law, any enterprise with more than
1,000 shareholders is obliged to entrust its register to a 'separate'
organisation. But, in practice, many of the registers of Russia's largest
factories are controlled directly by the company and are often located in
the company's headquarters.
The overpowering fear of western investors is that their shares will
disappear from the record. A registrar, influenced by the issuer, could in
theory just say that an investor had sold its shares. The registration book
could be stolen or destroyed in a fire. 'It could be an effort to defraud,
to lie, or just a simple error,' says Ms Yvonne Rogers, head of settlement
for Chase Manhattan in Moscow.
That is precisely what Transworld, a London-based company which dominates
the Russian metals trade, alleges occurred at the Krasnoyarsk Aluminium
Smelter, one of the world's largest aluminium producers. Transworld alleges,
and factory officials confirm, that a 20 per cent stake in the smelter
(worth Dollars 300m) controlled by Transworld proxies, was deleted from the
records by factory administrators.
Officials at the Krasnoyarsk smelter say they deleted Transworld holdings
from their books because of irregularities in Transworld's initial purchase
of the shares. But western investors are troubled by a system which gives
factory directors - who are often hostile to outside buyers - the unilateral
authority to alter shareholder registers.
This danger can be minimised by regular audits by the custodian of the
registrar and confirmation of the shareholding. But that does not prevent
over-issue: whereby the registrar arbitrarily creates new shares and dilutes
an existing owner's stake.
Regulators, rather than custodians themselves, ought to be dealing with
abuses by registrars but they do not. One custodian says: 'The regulatory
regime is appalling. It has as many holes as a piece of cheese. And the
authorities don't enforce any of it anyway.'
The problems do not stop there. Collection of dividends, a customary
responsibility of custodians, adds a new layer of work. Some Russian
companies, lacking liquid assets, offer their products as a dividend
payment. A vacuum cleaner company would issue a dividend in vacuum cleaners.
Money dividend payments are complicated by the inadequacy of the banking
system. A bank transfer does not generally make clear the source of the
dividend payment which can be confusing for an investor with a varied
portfolio.
An investor, or its custodian, faces a challenge, too, in learning of
shareholder meetings. The postal service is inefficient and often
notification arrives after the event takes place. Companies are obliged to
publish details of shareholder meetings in a widely-read publication but
many print the information in the local works newspaper and leave it at
that.
No wonder one custodian says: 'You need a good sense of humour.' But many
serious investors are not laughing. Paul Greatbatch, of emerging markets
fund manager Genesis, says: 'We have chosen not to go into Russia on the
basis that there is no suitable custody. There is no one there that can
guarantee you title to the shares that you own.'
Pension fund investors are even more cautious and US-based institutions have
a legal requirement to ensure that custody and settlement are secure. 'We
clearly need proper custody for the big institutions to move in,' says Nancy
Curtin, head of emerging European markets for Barings Asset Management.
The hunger of western institutional investors for Russian shares, together
with their concern about custody, give birth to a significant opening for
providers of custodian services. CS First Boston, the leading international
investment bank in Moscow, has built its dominant market position on the
comfort it provides for western investors.
But CSFB's custodian services are secondary to its broking operations and
institutions prefer to deal with independent custodians. Banks such as Chase
Manhattan, Citibank and ING Bank are now responding to demand and exploring
the establishment of asset servicing units.
Costs will be high. Chase Manhattan expects to hire six staff just to fly to
distant corners of Russia and register shares. A flight from Moscow to
Vladivostok can cost Dollars 650 and hotel bills for extended stays add up.
Nevertheless fees will be commensurately above western levels. Custodians in
any case say they are setting up Russian operations to provide a full
service for international clients rather than to make fat profits.
Then there is also the challenge. Russia is the final frontier. But Yvonne
Rogers, of Chase, is not so sure that custodians, much-maligned for being
boring, will find excitement in the east. 'Custodians are a conservative
bunch. I'm not sure whether this thing is good for their heart rate.'

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (14): Unravelling the nightmare -
The Pacific Rim / The eastward-bound stampede
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Barton Biggs, Morgan Stanley's global strategist, turned maximum
bullish on Asian markets, he sparked an eastward-bound stampede into a part
of the world which was ill prepared for floods of foreign money. Paper-based
systems buckled, bottlenecks expanded and, in some cases, custodians caught
in the middle were forced to close their doors to new business.
As Darwin Doo, director of institutional services with Standard Chartered
Equitor Group, says: 'The good fortune of markets turns out to be a
nightmare for custodians.'
Standard Chartered Equitor Group, like Hongkong Bank, operates in the region
as a sub-custodian handling on-the- ground execution for the globals who do
not themselves have an agency network, such as State Street.
'If it is a paper-based market, then as a sub-custodian you are always
vulnerable to sudden increases because those markets are less efficient. In
other places where there is a central depository, such as Hong Kong and
Thailand, it is relatively easy to absorb large volumes,' says Jeremy
Davies, senior manager for Asia Pacific Securities Services at Hongkong
Bank.
On the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange, turnover on April 15 1993, just before
the boom, was a typical USDollars 0.96bn. Less than a year later, during the
peak at January 5, it had surged to USDollars 2.02bn - higher than Wall
Street.
Equitor Group was closed to new business in Malaysia for six months, after
expanding the local staff base to 225 at the peak (in March this year) from
45 at the beginning of 1993. Citibank, after closing its doors in Malaysia,
is now open on a selective basis.
Even worse problems were encountered in India, where a USDollars 250,000
deal can translate into a truckload of scrip, bringing an 'unduly high'
degree of risk to the custodian and his clients.
Says David Handmaker, vice-president at JP Morgan in Hong Kong: 'The western
institutions are the most demanding investors the Asian markets have met.
They invest huge amounts of money, they come from mature markets and expect
things to look as clean and as easy through the global custodian on a new
market as happens on the stock exchanges of New York or London. Their job is
to seek returns and they cannot sit and wait for custodians to make the
markets efficient.'
But the markets are becoming more efficient, as governments - often advised
by the custodians - seek to eliminate the problems of the past years. In the
Philippines briefs have already gone out to tender and Indonesia plans to
move to a central depository system starting from the middle of next year.
In Kuala Lumpur automation is already under way.
Other Asian markets were quicker off the mark, including Hong Kong,
Thailand, Taiwan and Sri Lanka, which last put in fully automated and
clearing systems before the floods of money came rushing in.
Among the emerging markets, China scores highest in terms of efficiency as
the country's two exchanges started life with scripless systems. Custodians
such as Citibank worked with the stock exchange in Shanghai to devise
processes and procedures when it set up its central depository.
Christine Tam, vice-president of Citibank in Hong Kong, says: 'In China we
sat down with the stock exchange officials and went through the procedures
with them and explained international investors' perspective and perception
of risk. Then we helped develop a system to box in those risks. This is the
advantage of China over a paper-based system - it started with a blank piece
of paper, so there was not masses of paper, registrars or existing processes
to work with.'
A further demonstration of the global custodians' role in weaning emerging
markets towards maturity came when the Malaysian central bank, in a bid to
quell speculation in the ringgit, insisted foreign banks with big ringgit
deposits pay a reserve on those deposits - a move tantamount to telling
foreign depositors their money would earn negative 3 per cent interest.
For the banks who were holding cash on behalf of investors waiting to buy
stock this was a nightmare. Mr Handmaker says it was down to the global
custodians to explain the situation to investors, to absorb the 3 per cent
levy, and to sit down with officials of Bank Negara and explain that not all
deposits added up to currency speculation, but were instead a symptom of the
settlement system then operating in Kuala Lumpur.
The flip side of greater sophistication and automation in emerging markets
is that new entrants are enticed in and customers expect to pay less for the
custodians' services.
Competition in Asia has grown, and custodians talk of pitches where the
contract is carried off by the manager quoting zero fees (looking to earn
his living from added services such as stock lending).
Mr Doo says: 'From what people are saying in the market place, there might
be a big shake-out among the big global custodians in the coming two years.
There are just too many competitors.'
For the global custodians it has also become more competitive, says Mr
Handmaker. 'Any pressure the sub-custodians are seeing, the global
custodians see first. It is common for people to say to global custodians:
'You are just the conduit, why am I paying you so much money?' So the global
custodian goes to the sub-custodian and cuts him down. Both the global and
sub-custodians are always running to catch up.'
Custodians are responding to this pressure by ensuring pricing is
competitive and beefing up the services offered; both vanilla services such
as information and trade settlement, and newer added value services such as
proxy voting (as pension funds, especially American ones, play a more active
shareholding role), catering for individual investment decisions within
pension funds, contractual income and settlement or stock lending. Demand
for custody of fixed income instruments in the Asia Pacific regions is also
expected to grow.
State Street, like Citibank one of the world's top five biggest global
custodians, adds value in the area of technology, which it uses to produce
high value custody services such as performance measurement and portfolio
analysis, which looks at investment returns, risk, currency attribution,
trade execution (for example comparing broker commission against strike
price over a period of time to see how efficient brokers are), soft dollar
information, currency overlay management and universe comparisons.
Robert Williams, managing director of State Street in Hong Kong, says: 'Very
few clients only use us for custody. That cross-selling is what tends to
protect your margins as your product matures. But part of it also is to keep
the product young, to keep enhancing it.'

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (12): A paper mountain - India /
Naazneen Karmali discusses antiquated procedures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Inadequate custodial capacity is a significant road block to foreign
portfolio investments in India's stock markets. The value of such
investments, which have been permitted by the Indian government since
January 1993, were Dollars 2.75bn at the end of September 1994. While this
figure represents only a small percentage of the total market capitalisation
of Dollars 100bn, it is expected to increase steadily. It is estimated that
portfolio investments and Euroissues by Indian companies would amount to
Dollars 6bn-8bn by March 1995. The number of foreign institutional investors
registered with the Securities Exchange Board on India (Sebi), the
regulatory authority, has increased from 136 to 229 since January this year.
The entry of these large investors has put tremendous pressure on the few
banks that provide custodial services. They find that their sophisticated
systems cannot deal with India's antiquated settlement and transfer
procedures. Transactions are heavily paper-oriented and require physical
delivery of shares. Each share certificate has to be individually signed
along with a transfer deed. What makes it more cumbersome is that marketable
lots are small. The Bombay Stock Exchange, for example, which accounts for
70 per cent of the trading in the secondary market, recognises lots no
larger than 50 or 100 shares.
'The problem in India is that there's paper, paper and more paper,' says
Steve Page, senior manager securities services, Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation. 'It is a retail system that finds it difficult to cope
with the demands of wholesale investors.'
Last December, when foreign portfolio investment touched Dollars 1bn,
custodians were overwhelmed by the masses of paper flooding through their
doors. Confronted by a huge backlog in processing, they imposed strict
trading limits on their clients. New business was turned away.
To cope with the increased workload, custodians have been building capacity
by hiring more vault space and staff. Hongkong Bank and Citibank, the two
biggest providers of custodial services to foreign clients, have more than
doubled capacity. Mr Page says that Hongkong Bank's vault space is 200 per
cent larger and the number of people in his department has increased from 40
to 180. Some work has also been sub-contracted out.
All this has only been enough to meet the demands of existing clients.
Trading limits have been revised upwards, but still exist. Custodians are
not open for new business as yet. Mr Page says that there is a direct
correlation between the number of shares and the number of people necessary
to process them. The infrastructure costs of a custodial service in India
are inordinately high and have kept other custodians away. Now service
providers are slowly entering the market. Deutsche Bank began operations
last month and ABN Amro has announced that it will be in business shortly.
Standard Chartered Bank's Equitor Group began in a limited way last week. It
now concentrates on servicing a small group of 15 important clients. The
banks put a bar code on every share certificate to track it at every stage
of processing. Colin Beattie, regional head of custody, south Asia, says:
'We had to put such innovations in place before we reached a critical level.
Bringing off-the-shelf systems are not any good for Bombay.
Indian banks and financial institutions such as the Unit Trust of India and
the Housing Development and Finance Corporation, are keen to establish
custodial services. The State Bank of India, the country's largest public
sector bank, has opened a securities services branch in Bombay that is
custodian to some offshore, country-dedicated funds.
The custodian with the largest capacity is the stock Holding Corporation of
India, a company launched by Indian financial institutions in 1988. It could
take on more business but is constrained by its small capital base of Rs210m
from seeking foreign clients. The corporation's custodial assets of Dollars
23bn belong to domestic mutual funds and Indian financial institutions, Last
year, it processed transactions worth Dollars 2.3bn and Mr R.
Chandrasekaran, managing director, expects business of Dollars 5bn this
year. He says that by the third quarter of 1995 a new depository will be
constructed near Bombay with a capacity to hold 350m share certificates.
This will have an automated storage and retrieval system on a par with
international standards. The corporation is keen to collaborate with a
global custodian as that will allow it to take on foreign clients. Morgan
Stanley is a possible partner.
Foreign custodians believe that solving problems is at best a temporary
measure and does not address the more systemic issues. One way forward, they
have suggested, is to introduce institutional board lots of 1,000 or more
shares. While the idea finds favour with Sebi, fund managers and brokers
have been resisting it. They fear that their holdings would become illiquid
and this would result in the additional headache of having to split large
certificates into smaller ones.
To ease the paperwork, custodians were earlier allowed to introduce jumbo
transfer deeds that covered each transaction. Companies have also begun
issuing jumbo share certificates, though the Bombay Stock Exchange does not
accept these as good deliveries. Sebi has recently approved the proposal
that custodians trade institutional board lots between themselves.
This would bring down the risk factor relating to bad deliveries which
amount to 20 per cent at present. Delays in settlement, which occur eight
times out of 10 would get eliminated. Mr Page says that in a few cases,
shares are rejected by registrars and have to be sent back to the brokers.
This increases risks to investors who have to wait six months before shares
are registered in their names. A two-tier market would reduce problems all
around. Custodians say that if the institutional market does kick off then
it would lead to a paperless trading system and a central securities
depository.
The government is expected to introduce legislation on a central depository
by the year end. The option of multi-depositories, one for each region, is
also being considered. The stock-holding corporation would like to be
appointed as central depository and is working towards it. Fund managers do
not expect this to happen quickly.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (11): Frontier areas pose problems
 -Emerging markets / The risks encountered in some countries
</HEADLINE>

Although the flow of funds into the world's emerging markets has eased in
1994, following a phenomenal burst of activity during 1993, their
attractiveness as long-term asset investments remains undiminished.
According to Standard Chartered Bank the size of emerging markets in terms
of market capitalisation is set to double in five years, from its present
level of around Dollars 2,000bn; while other commentators point to the fact
that if the economies of the world's emerging markets continue to develop at
the rate of growth witnessed recently then, in about 20 years' time, they
could account for around half the world's equity market capitalisation.
No wonder then that custodians have, in general, not seen a significant
slowing in the generation of business, particularly as fund managers explore
the possibilities of entering hitherto uncharted countries.
While risks remain in many markets custodians note that in some cases
settlement can actually be easier to execute than in some developed markets.
For instance, says Paul Bellamy, manager in custody operations at Robert
Fleming, some emerging markets are already Swift-orientated, particularly in
the Middle East, and have already moved to paperless trading systems.
Nevertheless, it is clear that significant problems arise when investing in
such frontier markets as Russia. Citibank raises a cautionary tale regarding
Russia where demand is not necessarily supported by the accessibility or
availability of securities. There is no traditional equity market at present
with a voucher system in operation. 'The only way of ascertaining whether an
investor owns vouchers is to obtain a photocopy of the investor list from
the registrar,' says the bank. 'A photocopy provides no comfort that one is
actually the beneficial owner of the vouchers and the law is unclear on
these issues. On the one hand, there are huge potential returns to be had,
but these could prove to be worthless if the voucher is also owned by three
or four other investors.'
Mark Mobius, of Templeton Emerging Markets Fund, notes that the question of
risk allocation and control has not been fully and completely addressed.
'In the corporate arena the challenges are great indeed. The first
difficulty is identifying the existence of those corporate actions, when
they are taking place and what are the 'ex dates' and 'pay dates'.
Information flows about such matters are not ideal in emerging markets so
that the custodian's task moves to a high level of difficulty necessitating
an extra degree of care not normally associated with custodial
responsibilities.
'Co-mingling of client accounts by custodial banks presents another
challenge to emerging market investors. It is clear that in many accounts in
emerging country sub-custody banks, assets of different investors are
co-mingled so that in the event of mishap such as counterfeit securities,
tracing the actual owner of the worthless securities becomes a major
problem. Clients should demand separated accounts to ensure the viability of
their holdings.'
Another important problem is the lack of foreign exchange convertibility.
Venezuela is a typical example where there is no procedure for repatriation,
while in South Korea, since the currency is not traded in London, for
instance, conversion can only be done in Seoul, and custodians are dependent
on a sub-custodian.
Karen Janes, vice-president, regional network manager at Chase Manhattan
Bank, also illustrates the example of Morocco.
'Morocco is an old-fashioned physical market, and the main problem here is
to do with foreign exchange. For instance, settlement on the stock exchange
is T+1 but there is no way that an investor can get foreign exchange process
in that time - it is more like T+4. The way round this is that people agree
to trade a few days ahead, agree a price and book the trade for a few days
later when the forex deal has been completed.'
She remarks that growth in activity has been seen this year in eastern
Europe and Africa, both north and south. In Africa the most prominent
countries attracting investment have been Morocco, Egypt, South Africa,
Zimbabwe and Botswana.
In eastern Europe there has been an increasing interest in Hungary and the
Czech Republic. The latter has not been an easy market to open, but having
managed to get into place, Ms Janes says, Chase has seen a growth of
interest, even though it will be some time yet before the country is ready
to open for foreign investment.
Chase has been working with a local bank in the Czech Republic, although
there are some basic problems in the way the market is structured. 'For
example,' she notes, 'the local sub-custodians are not able to have accounts
in the central depository: it has to be the investors themselves.
This means that you have to set up powers of attorney allowing the
sub-custodians the legal right to settle the trade when they physically go
to the central depository.
'In the Czech Republic the majority of trading happens off market, with a
few large trades. It is supposedly a scripless system, but to ensure that
you are actually getting settlement you have to physically go to the central
depository and witness the confirmation. However, this process should change
over time and there will eventually be on-line settlement.'
India has long been a significant problem for institutional investors.
Sanjit Talukdar, head of the India desk at Foreign &amp; Colonial, observes that
problems with custody have been one of the biggest obstacles to the
development of the Indian markets.
This year, for instance, close to Dollars 100m has been turned away because
of custody problems. International fund managers cannot use local custodians
because often they do not meet international regulations.
With deregulation of the market, foreign institutions and private sector
mutual funds have become active, largely interested in block deals off
market in B shares, which have a seven-day account cycle.
Since these trades are not executed through the exchange, prices are not
transparent. Paradoxically, therefore, India is one market where
transparency has fallen with the rise in turnover, he says.
Another problem endemic to India is the sheer volume of paper work
generated, the main reason why more and more trade has successfully moved
off-shore into global depositary receipts GDRs, which the Indian authorities
have been happy to see take place.
There are vested interests against change, such as the establishment of a
central depositary system. This would, in western terms, be the best
solution to the current difficulties.
Next best would be instead of trying to get rid of the system as it stands,
trying to tweak it at the edges.
An attempt to do this has been the introduction of so-called 'jumbo
certificates'. Typically, Indians deal in small lots, that is 50 to 100
shares. The jumbo is a deal of at least 1,000 shares, but because the retail
market is not used to dealing in such large amounts a different price is
fixed.
Many custodians expect to see an increase in volume, since the allocation of
funds to emerging markets is rising regardless of whether the markets
themselves are going up or down. Citibank, for instance, has plans to expand
its custody network to include 20 more countries by 1996, including the
opening of a safekeeping facility in Moscow and custody services in a number
of African countries.
Chase's Karen Janes suggests that investors have to be open-minded regarding
investment in new emerging markets and to work with them. Chase, she says,
spends a lot of its time training sub-custodians.

FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (10): Getting the right message
across - Technology / A common language
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Holy Grail of the custody industry is a universal language that will
enable operators to talk to each other across the globe unhindered.
Armies of people representing custodians, fund managers, and a host of other
groups have been meeting in Europe and the US in an attempt to establish
common messaging standards in the way trades are confirmed and settled. They
want a language to carry the billions of pieces of information, or messages,
about transactions daily between custodians and their clients.
Most people in the industry agree that the need to speed processing through
a universal language is urgent, particularly as settlement periods become
shorter.
'When 30 per cent of your messages are on free format (unrecognised
universally), and you're having to interpret them and then rekey them, that
is what the urgency is about,' says John Gubert, senior manager of group
securities services at HSBC Holdings.
'A universal language allows you to receive messages and read them without
human intervention. It takes out the time needed to manually load messages,
and it removes an element of error when messages are being rekeyed. It
speeds processes at a time of faster and faster settlement.'
Mr Gubert predicts that by the end of the decade, 50-60 per cent of trades
will be settled on the day of trade, and the rest within three days.
Lee Adams, a vice-president at Citibank responsible for product development,
echoes Mr Gubert's view: 'A fund manager told me recently that they dealt
with 40 different custodians - unless those 40 custodians agree to use the
same format, the poor fund manager is going to be receiving messages
possibly in 40 different languages.'
Mr Adams also believes a universal language will save money, increase
efficiency, and reduce risk. It will 'close the loop' in the industry's
automation.
The main industry body working on standards is the Industry Standardisation
for Institutional Trade Communication (ISITC), an independent forum of
representatives in the US and Europe. The ISITC works closely with Swift,
the dominant message network provider, in looking at building on Swift
messages, extending their use across the industry and creating new
standards. A primary role is to develop formats for messages that can be
used across a range of networks throughout the global industry.
The ISITC is making progress, according to one analyst, 'but it is a bit
like watching a swan on water - it is serene on the surface, but its feet
are working away underneath'.
The ISITC's work, and that carried out by other groups, is co-ordinated by
the Securities Standards Advisory Board, which was set up two years ago to
bring together the various strands of work already under way.
Mr Gubert fears that attempts to create a universal messaging system are
being hampered by the perceived need for consensus. He believes the industry
needs to find a fast-track route, which means 'in some ways being
dictatorial'.
'The trouble with consensus is that if custodian A wants to use eight
characters as an ID code and B wants to use 12, there is no possibility of a
consensus, so you need an arbiter/dictator,' he says. 'Inevitably that will
be the big boys, and people will squeal like mad, but they are the ones
handling the bulk of messages. You have to do it with a small group of
operators to get standards on networks which are then used. That's
effectively what the ISITC is doing to a great extent.'
Many in the industry acknowledge there is much co-operation between the
various bodies involved in creating messaging standards, but some also fear
the process is bureaucratic and slow moving, and that work on standards is
being fragmented and duplicated. Rivalry between different standards groups
has created a 'bugger's muddle', according to one custodian.
Simon Pilkington, chairman of the ISITC in Europe, says he believes some of
the criticism stems from 'misunderstandings and confusion' about the
position of the various groups in the process and with each other.
The ISITC agreed an equity and fixed income standard in September last year,
and its working groups are now looking at the other main areas:
reconciliation and corporate actions, derivatives and foreign exchange. Lee
Adams, at Citibank, sits on the ISITC's corporate actions working group. He
says a draft standard for a type of mandatory corporate action should be
agreed by the end of this year, before going to the implementation stage.
Mr Gubert believes any one of three outcomes is likely by the end of the
decade: the status quo; a technical solution that is too technical for the
users; or a fast-track solution dominated by the largest operators.
'World number one is the one in which there is total confusion - as there is
at the moment - as to what a precise standard is.' Different custodians
communicating in their own, proprietorial, language is costing the industry
'millions of dollars', says Mr Gubert. Each message has to be translated, by
computer or manually. For small operators, the big costs could come on the
capital side as new standards are implemented and systems have to be
upgraded or replaced.
'The second world is where we see the emergence of a massive data dictionary
 -a bible - which people find very difficult to understand and to implement.
So we will have a technical solution but the solution will be too complex.'
Mr Gubert's third, and favoured option, is the emergence of a fast-track of
a limited number of operators that already handles most of the business. 'It
has to be a very prescriptive mechanism to implement standards that will
cover the vast bulk of our message requirements.'
He acknowledges this could create culture and status problems: 'People don't
like being left off the list.' But he believes it is the only realistic
approach and the one most likely to satisfy the needs of the largest portion
of the business.
Yet others argue that consensus, while hard to achieve, is the only way the
industry as a whole can embrace new standards and make them work.
'To make this work we need to get as wide an agreement and as wide a
participation as possible,' says Mr Adams. 'Everyone's got everything to
gain. If we don't do this, we will be just right back where we started, so
we tend towards the 80-20 rule: If you try to automate everything you're
going to fail, and fail big-time. You've got to concentrate on what is
really important.'
