FT  30 DEC 94 / Mercury comes up with new number
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury One-2-One, the mobile phone company, was yesterday offering
compensation to the hundreds of new subscribers who could not take advantage
of an offer of free calls on Christmas day because its network was
overloaded.
One-2-One, a sister company to Mercury Communications, had promised
customers buying its phones between November 8 and December 24 an unlimited
number of free calls to anywhere in the world on December 25.
The mobile phone operator said that 80 per cent of new customers
successfully made calls. But the level of demand, which surprised the
company, meant that hundreds of subscribers were unable to make calls,
mainly to numbers abroad.
One-2-One is thought to have received more than 500 complaints and was
yesterday dealing with them on a case-by-case basis, offering free call
credits worth up to Pounds 40 to new subscribers shown on its computer to
have been unable to make calls. It calculated that the average value of
calls by new customers on Christmas day was about Pounds 41.
The company said: 'We would not have launched a promotion if we thought we
could not fulfil it. The company's reputation is very important. We did not
anticipate some people spending the amount of time they did on the phones.
Our forecasts were exceeded dramatically by a number of people.'
At least 20 customers spent more than 12 hours on the phone, while another
20 made more than 2,000 calls between them.
In total, 1.5m calls were made on One-2-One on Christmas day, totalling more
than 6.3m call minutes (105,000 hours) - equivalent to 75 per cent of call
traffic in a typical week. Free calls under the promotion accounted for 4.1m
minutes - for which customers would otherwise have paid more than Pounds 2m.
Some 2.3m minutes of international calls were made, 12 times the Sunday
average.
The operator, a joint venture between Mercury Communications' parent Cable &amp;
Wireless and American company US West, insisted that it had remained within
its Pounds 5m budget for the promotion. The number of One-2-One subscribers
is thought to have risen to almost 200,000, from 140,000 at the end of
September.
It was unclear yesterday whether One-2-One would face regulatory action over
the promotion.
Oftel, the telecommunications watchdog, said Mercury had not breached any of
the conditions of its licence. However, Oftel would take up any complaints
it received about the promotion with One-2-One. It had received two by
yesterday.
Mr Andrew MacKinlay, Labour MP for Thurrock, said this week he was writing
to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to complain about the
promotion.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Life sector is set data standard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life insurance companies will have to provide information on a standard
basis about how many people buying long-term policies give them up early,
according to rules published yesterday by their regulator.
The move will mean figures will be collected across the financial services
sector in a common format for the first time, enabling comparisons to be
made between different companies and different methods of selling. The first
statistics from this exercise are likely to be out in the autumn.
If investors surrender policies in the first few years, it does not
necessarily mean that they were badly advised. But there would be questions
about whether suitable advice was being provided if many of a company's
customers gave up long-term investments soon after buying them.
The Personal Investment Authority (PIA), the watchdog to protect the private
investor, has so far stopped short of insisting that figures for individual
companies be published, but it is now moving in that direction, in the teeth
of opposition from some companies.
Next year it will consult member companies on requiring life offices to make
their statistics publicly available. In the meantime, it will encourage them
to do so.
Until now there has been no authoritative basis for calculating lapse rates,
which has made it easier for life companies to avoid being put on the spot.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that lapse rates reached their highest levels in
the early 1990s but are coming down slightly as companies develop more
flexible products.
Even so, life companies still sound apprehensive about a report expected
next month from the Office of Fair Trading on endowment policies which will
highlight both lapse rates and the poor values that some companies provide
to people who surrender a policy prematurely.
By the end of June this year, life companies will have to provide the PIA
with lapse rates broken down by five types of life and pensions policies and
by four methods of selling, such as through a sales force or through
independent advisers. From 1996 onwards, the returns will have to be
provided by the end of April.
The PIA's move comes against a background of regulatory pressure for greater
openness in retail financial services. From the beginning of next year,
sales agents and independent advisers will have to give customers more
information about the policies they sell, their charges, and the commission
earned on the sale.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Hope for a gaming industry down on its luck: Liberalised
rules will help to offset the effects of the Budget and the National Lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's government move to liberalise gaming machine regulations was
welcomed by an industry still reeling from the Budget proposals to tax video
and quiz machines and increase duty on fruit machines by 19 per cent.
The industry, which is also facing new competition from the National
Lottery, had been lobbying in particular for an end to the payment of prizes
in tokens, which it says are unpopular with customers and involve high
administration costs.
The past few years have been tough for the industry. The number of gaming
machines in use has fallen from 60,000 four years ago to about 40,000,
according to the British Amusement Catering Trades Association (Bacta).
Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget measures have been criticised as potentially
counterproductive. Mr Russell Smith, chief executive of Kunick, one of the
UK's three biggest operators of amusement and gaming machines, said: 'There
will inevitably be some shrinkage of the market. The chancellor will not
raise as much money as he thinks.'
Mr Tim Moon, whose Arrow Leisure runs two arcades in Croydon, south of
London, said the Budget had angered operators. 'Things are very tight at the
moment as it is, without having this as well.'
As a result of the Budget, the duty on small-prize gaming machines has gone
up from Pounds 450 a year to Pounds 535. Jackpot machines, which have a
money prize of up to Pounds 200, had their licence fee increased to Pounds
1,375 a year. A monthly instalment payment scheme was also introduced.
Video and quiz amusement machines face an annual duty of Pounds 250 from
next November. Customs and Excise estimates that 65,000 premises will be
covered by the new tax.
Mr Clarke hopes these measures will raise an extra Pounds 55m a year -
Pounds 30m from the new tax. He argues that the increase brings the duty
back into line with its 1987 level.
Mr Roger Withers, president of Bacta, describes the new tax as 'ill
thought-out and ill-conceived' and argues that it could lead to the loss of
up to 15,000 jobs.
Mr Withers is managing director of BLMS, the Bass subsidiary which supplies
amusement machines. Bass has estimated that the Budget proposals will cut
its profits by Pounds 500,000 this year.
The biggest impact will be at the bottom end of the market. Many cafes, fish
and chip shops and country pubs may decide to hand back their machines,
according to Mr Smith. Others say some small seaside arcades, which have
maybe 50 video machines, could face closure if they are hit by a tax bill
running into thousands of pounds.
Mr Moon's two arcades have about 40 gaming machines and 10 video machines.
'We already pay VAT,' he said. 'New taxes hit the coin-slot industry
particularly hard because they come straight out of revenue. Unlike
Sainsbury, say, we cannot pass on the cost straight to customers because the
prices are fixed.'
Mr Moon estimated that he would have to reduce the number of machines he
operated by between 30 per cent and 40 per cent as a result of the tax
increase. His maintenance department would also have to be scaled down.
Many operators claim to be confused by the rule changes. Customs and Excise
says the new tax exempts juke boxes, snooker and pool tables, bar billiards,
football games and rides for children. But video games, pinball machines and
'skills-with-prizes' machines, such as trivia games, will be included.

<TEXT>
British Airways will today announce its biggest batch of ticket bargains
since its World Offer programme was launched in March, with cut-price fares
available on more than 200 routes.
The move brought an immediate response from Mr Richard Branson's Virgin
Atlantic airline, which said it would undercut BA's prices by Pounds 1 on
all routes which the two airlines both operate.
BA said savings on the usual lowest return fares range from Pounds 10-Pounds
20 on domestic routes to Pounds 454 for flights to Manila.

<TEXT>
The Milton Keynes Chamber of Commerce and the Milton Keynes and North
Buckinghamshire Training and Enterprise Council have merged in a move aimed
at streamlining business services and training on a local level.
The move is the first of its kind, though it is understood that at least 10
other chambers and Tecs - the employer-led bodies which administer
government-funded training in England and Wales - are considering similar
partnerships.
The merged body will pool the memberships and provide the central services
that were administered by both individual bodies.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Labour demands sacking of Eggar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday demanded the dismissal of Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister,
for his failure to act when British Gas decided to cut its annual budget for
checking leaks from Pounds 9m to Pounds 1m.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, shadow consumer minister, accused Mr Eggar of knowing
nothing about the possible threat to public safety until it was highlighted
by the media.
Mr Eggar said yesterday he was 'determined that high standards of safety'
would be maintained.
British Gas, meanwhile, committed itself to widespread consultation with the
safety authorities and other interested parties before introducing new
practices for leak detection.
Transco, the company's pipeline subsidiary, will consult with employees, the
Health and Safety Executive, the Gas Consumers' Council and the industry
watchdog Ofgas before making the changes, scheduled for next spring.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Saunders upbeat over appeal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman jailed for his role in the
1986 takeover of Distillers, yesterday expressed confidence that his
convictions for theft and false accounting would be overturned.
He welcomed the decision by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, to refer
the cases of himself and the three other City figures convicted over the
affair to the Court of Appeal.
Mr Saunders told BBC Radio the Guinness trial was an 'over the top' and
'politically expedient' prosecution driven by the government's desire to
tackle 'so-called white-collar crime'. He denied reports that he had
suffered from Alzheimer's disease. His release from prison after serving 10
months of a 2 1/2 -year sentence was in line with all prisoners who received
full remission for good behaviour, he said.
The appeals of Mr Saunders, Mr Gerald Ronson, the property developer, Mr
Anthony Parnes, the former stockbroker and the businessman Mr Jack Lyons
will be heard next year.

<TEXT>
Rover Group has increased output of its Land Rover four-wheel-drive vehicles
by 39 per cent this year to a record 94,716 from 68,159 in 1993, Kevin Done
writes.
Rover, a subsidiary of BMW, has raised production of Land Rover vehicles
from 1,800 a week in January to 2,600 a week this month. At present levels
output is set to rise next year to about 120,000.
Production has been increased in particular to meet rising worldwide sales
of the Land Rover Discovery. This year production of the Discovery has risen
by 53 per cent to 54,499 from 35,620 in 1993, while Range Rover output has
increased to 17,952 from 14,949. Production of the utility Defender range
rose to 22,265 from 17,590.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Hualon charge dismays backers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government officials yesterday appeared to be backing away from their
unequivocal endorsement of the controversial plan by Hualon Corporation of
Taiwan to build a Pounds 160m textile plant outside Belfast.
The Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board is seeking information
from Taiwanese officials about the repercussions for the Hualon Corporation
of the indictment on Wednesday of Mr Oung Ta-ming, the effective head of the
Hualon group, and 33 businessmen linked to him on share manipulation and
other fraud charges.
A British official said yesterday: 'The Hualon project is clearly fraught
with problems, no doubt about that. We said we were dealing with a
respectable and successful company. Now we have this.'
The development board confirmed it was delaying giving approval to the
start-up of construction of the plant until the outcome of legal action in
the European Court in which European textile and clothing manufacturers are
challenging a Pounds 61m government grant to Hualon. The case is expected to
take about 18 months. Construction was originally due to begin by autumn
this year.
The development board said it was 'monitoring developments in Taiwan
closely' and 'seeking clarification' to establish what involvement, if any,
those indicted had with the Hualon project in Northern Ireland.
It added that the indictment of Mr Oung was expected to be among factors
'taken on board' by the European Court.
Mrs Jennifer d'Abo, a former development board director who resigned last
month in protest at the project, said last night that it should now be
scrapped.
Mrs d'Abo said that before she resigned she had written to senior officials
of the development board asking for information about pending criminal
proceedings against Hualon executives, but had never received a satisfactory
answer.
The Hualon Teijran Corp, which announced the Northern Ireland investment
earlier this year, was not named in indictment documents. Mr Oung is thought
to control the company, however, and was present in June at a ceremony
marking the announcement.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Stress case sends a shock through employers' systems: Macho
managers are being told that caring can work out cheaper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When a social worker last month successfully sued his former employers for
stress, business leaders treated the case as a potential catastrophe.
Mrs Ann Robinson, head of the Institute of Directors policy unit, said:
'Most of us who employ people had better shut up and go home. It will make
people think very carefully about employing anyone at all.'
Mr John Walker had a nervous breakdown in 1986 after his workload grew with
a rising number of child abuse cases. When he returned to his office, he
found paperwork had built up and help promised by his head office was
withdrawn. He suffered a second breakdown and was later sacked on the
grounds of ill-health.
As Mr Walker prepared to claim Pounds 200,000 damages from Northumberland
County Council, the Health and Safety Executive was drawing up its first
advisory notes on occupational stress.
The guidance, to be published early in the new year, argues that stress is
no longer simply the employee's problem. Alongside the Walker case, it
confirms that stress can be treated as a work-related injury, with employers
shouldering a duty of care.
The executive says: 'Good communications are very important between employer
and employee. The worst thing to do when someone's stress threshold has been
crossed is to let the situation continue, because the problem will get worse
and worse.'
The Walker case has led lawyers to weigh the risk of personal injury damages
against the cost of dismissing staff suffering from occupational stress.
Solicitors Dibb Lupton Broomhead are holding a seminar in March at which
personnel officers will be reminded that their last resort is to sack
stressed staff. The firm argued that even unfair dismissals are less costly
than personal injury damages.
However, solicitors Booth &amp; Co said the Walker case demonstrated how
employers should listen to employees' concerns to prevent personal injury
claims.
Mr Tom Flanagan, head of the firm's employment unit, said: 'It is dangerous
to take the macho view. Employers should adopt procedures to check people's
workload and pick up potential problems like this early.
'An employee under stress, just like any employee who has suffered a
work-related injury, would be able to recover damages only if the injury and
its results were reasonably foreseeable.'
The Association of British Insurers highlighted concerns about
stress-related claims, including repetitive strain injury (RSI), at its
annual seminar on employers' liability earlier this year.
A former Inland Revenue typist was awarded Pounds 79,000 compensation in
January after losing her job because of RSI. Sedgwick, the risk management
company, says stress-related claims in California are now running at more
than 3,000 a year.
Some larger companies, such as Marks and Spencer, have adopted their own
strategies to help staff cope with stress. In May the retailer piloted a
'managing pressure' programme, designed to teach employees - from senior
management through to the shop floor - how to cope with an 'unprecedented'
set of pressures from both inside and outside the job.
According to the Institute of Personnel and Development, which publishes its
own study of occupational health in February, dealing with employees' stress
can be an effective way of managing companies efficiently.
Mr Doug Gummery, the institute's policy adviser, said: 'There is a trend
towards less people doing more work for a little bit more pay. Organisations
will have to do all they can to foster a different culture from the
de-layering and rationalisation of the 1980s and early 1990s.
'They will have to look after the health of people at work because that is
where they are going to get economic benefit - otherwise they are likely to
find themselves in costly court cases.'

FT  30 DEC 94 / Hanson to attend Labour seminar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hanson conglomerate, Marks and Spencer and National Westminster Bank are
among scores of blue-chip companies and trade associations that will attend
a ground-breaking Labour seminar in Brussels that is likely to make a
sizeable contribution to the party's fighting fund for the next general
election.
Conference organisers said almost 100 organisations had booked places at the
event, entitled Labour Working in Europe, which will be held on January 10.
Other organisations that will be at the seminar include media group News
International and the Chemical Industries Association trade body.
The extent of corporate interest in the Pounds 500-a-head event is being
seen as a further boost to Labour's attempts to be taken seriously by the
business community. The Chemical Industries Association said yesterday: 'We
are interested in meeting leading figures in all political parties. We are
looking forward to an interesting and useful seminar.'
One conference organiser said Labour's profit from the event - to be
attended by more than half the party's 62 MEPs - was likely to be tens of
thousands of pounds.
Labour claims the seminar will be the biggest event yet organised by a
British political party in Brussels.
Mr Wayne David, leader of Labour's MEPs, said the conference was designed to
establish 'close working links' between business and the party at a European
level. Labour plans to follow up the seminar with regional events in the
spring in Scotland, Wales and England.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Call for gaming machines to pay out all prizes in cash
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gaming machines should be able to pay out all their prizes in cash instead
of tokens, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, said yesterday.
He also suggested that betting shops should be allowed to install gaming
machines and that maximum cash prize limits should be changed.
The proposals, in a consultation paper to be issued by the Home Office early
next year, were welcomed by the fruit machine industry.
Prizes are currently paid partly in tokens that can only be used to play
more games or to buy drinks from a pub where the machine is installed.
Mr Howard said: 'Players feel cheated when they win on the machines and only
get tokens which cannot be exchanged for cash.
'A new all-cash machine would dispense with tokens, allowing players to keep
their winnings rather than being left with tokens for the machine.
'The proposals will provide greater flexibility and choice over what type of
machine may be installed in different venues.
'In making these changes it is sensible to allow betting shops to install
the new machines.'

French banks raised their base lending rates by three-tenths of a percentage
point yesterday, passing this month's increase in money-market rates on to
their customers. Societe Generale was the first to announce it would rise
its base rate to 8.25 per cent from 7.95 per cent with effect from today.
Credit Lyonnais and the CIC banking unit of insurer GAN followed suit.
Banque Nationale de Paris and Credit du Nord said they would increase their
rates next Tuesday. Most other French banks are expected to follow suit.

<TEXT>
The US official index of leading indicators rose 0.3 per cent last month,
providing further evidence that economic growth is likely to remain robust
in the first half of 1995. The increase in the index, intended to give early
warning of changes in economic trends, exceeded most analysts' expectations.
It followed a revised 0.1 per cent decline in October and a gain of 0.1 per
cent in September. Officials said the index had been boosted by positive
contributions from indicators including orders for plant, equipment, orders
for consumer goods and materials, claims for unemployment insurance, and
commodity prices. Other indicators, including share prices and money supply,
contributed negatively.

<TEXT>
Standard &amp; Poors, the rating agency, has raised its credit ratings for
Thailand and Malaysia's long-term foreign-currency debt. Malaysia's rating
was raised to single-A-plus from single-A while Thailand's rating was raised
to single-A from single-A-minus, with a stable long-term outlook for both.
Malaysia's upgrading reflects the country's steady progress in diversifying
its export-based economy, prudent macroeconomic management and a political
system that balances the demands of its multi-ethnic society, the agency
said. Thailand's upgrading reflects the maintenance of the country's
external payments position and the consolidation of civilian-led democratic
rule since 1992.

The US told more than 4,000 Haitian refugees at its naval base at Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba, yesterday they would all have to return home and offered them
Dollars 80 (Pounds 52) - up from the Dollars 16 previously on offer - to do
so, the State Department announced. The statement in Creole to the Haitians
at the base said that since the return of elected President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide on October 15, 'Haitians in safe haven can now return home'. The
announcement appeared to have been met with acceptance by the 4,468 Haitians
in the refugee camps. The refugees fled Haiti by boat last year to escape
life under a military junta then ruling the country.

Israel's economy outperformed all 24 Organisation for Economic Co-operation

domestic product, according to Israel's central bureau of statistics. Israel
also led the field with a growth in per capita income of 4.3 per cent,
although income remains low by western standards at Dollars 13,730 (Pounds
8,880). Fuelled, among other things, by an influx of 600,000 immigrants from
the former Soviet Union over the past five years, the economy has expanded
at an average of 5 per cent a year since the beginning of the 1980s. Israel,
however, registered the highest trade deficit and the second highest
inflation rate. The trade deficit rose to Dollars 8.3bn, compared with
Dollars 6bn last year and the increase in the consumer price index climbed
to 12.3 per cent from 11.2 per cent in 1993.

FT  30 DEC 94 / US passes Japan in car output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US has overtaken Japan this year to become the world's top motor vehicle
producer for the first time since 1979. According to Automotive News, the
authoritative US weekly, vehicle production in the US has risen by 13 per
cent this year to 12.28m from 10.87m in 1993. Vehicle output in Japan has
fallen by 2 per cent to 11m from 11.23m in 1993. Production in Japan has
fallen for four years in succession because of the domestic recession and
declining exports. New vehicle registrations in Japan have shown the first
signs of recovery in recent months, but for the full year vehicle output has
fallen to the lowest level for 12 years. Japanese vehicle production peaked
at 13.49m in 1990 after first overtaking the US in 1980.
The new ascendancy of the US as the world's leading vehicle producer owes
much to the far-reaching restructuring of the world vehicle industry that
has taken place in the past decade. Japanese vehicle producers themselves
have contributed greatly to the shifting balance with the transfer of more
and more production out of Japan during the past 10 years, first to North
America, and more recently to Europe and to south-east Asia.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Mexico struggles to win back confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's new finance minister, Mr Guillermo Ortiz Martinez, has a big task
in front of him. Before investors return to the Mexican market in force, he
will have to convince them that the country has a credible plan to combat
the disastrous short-term effects that devaluation of the peso has brought
to the Mexican economy.
Beyond being appointed to head the finance ministry, Mr Ortiz got little
help from the Mexican president's address to the nation yesterday.
For more than a week, the international financial community has been
impatiently awaiting details of what President Ernesto Zedillo called an
'emergency economic plan'. But after the speech, they are still waiting, as
Mr Zedillo focused on explaining the reasons for the devaluation and on the
resignation of Mr Jaime Serra Puche as finance minister.
Investors want to know the government's projection for economic growth and
inflation. Will Mr Ortiz concede the possibility of 15 per cent inflation
and recession, as many economists are predicting? Or will he be more
optimistic, as some government officials are indicating, thereby running the
risk of being wrong?
According to the government's own figures, to maintain a balanced budget,
spending will have to be cut by 2-3 per cent of gross domestic product, or
Dollars 7.5bn-Dollars 15bn. There are no firm indications yet of where such
cuts will come from, although the government promises complete answers next
Monday.
Further privatisation is touted as one of the cornerstones of the
government's plan. But estimates of privatisation income are not yet firm,
nor are sales plans. In addition, the level of the international financial
backing made available to the Mexican government may strike investors as
being too low.
Though the problems are enormous and complicated, Mr Ortiz has the
credentials for the job. An economics PhD from Stanford, he was chief deputy
for six years to Mr Pedro Aspe, the hugely successful former finance
minister.
More importantly, Mr Ortiz had since November 1993 been the most eloquent
voice within the former administration of President Carlos Salinas arguing
in favour of a devaluation, so he comes into his new position already having
thought the measure through.
But the success or failure of Mexico's economic stabilisation plan does not
rest on Mr Ortiz's shoulders alone. He will need assistance from an
inexperienced and seemingly mistake-prone administration on the politically
delicate issues of wage demands and price controls, which the president is
currently negotiating among business and the labour unions.
'We are going to introduce some strong and quick medicine,' says an official
familiar with the developing plan. 'But a lot depends on whether people
adhere to what we are negotiating.'
Finally, government officials recognise that the whole strategy may not work
unless the war in Chiapas province is resolved and political stability is
restored. In fact, since the financial crisis began nearly two weeks ago,
more progress has been made towards reopening negotiations in Chiapas than
on the economic front.
'In terms of restoring confidence in this government, a solution in Chiapas
would be worth 100 cabinet changes,' says a government official.
As for the luckless Mr Serra, Wall Street wanted his head. US brokerage
houses and mutual funds, which have lost billions of dollars in the Mexican
market, had accused him of mismanaging the crisis. Money managers have been
adamant that confidence in Mexico could not return until Mr Serra's
departure.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Populist who struck it lucky in Brazil: President Franco is
set to hand over peacefully
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the film Being There, Peter Sellers played a nobody whose simple
philosophies enchanted the public and nearly propelled him to the White
House. In Brazil, where real life often seems stranger than Hollywood, the
story came true.
Mr Itamar Franco, a small-town politician almost unknown outside his home
state of Minas Gerais, was picked as running mate for Mr Fernando Collor,
who at first appeared to have little chance of winning 1989's presidential
election.
After Mr Collor won, then resigned two years ago, Mr Franco was swept into
the presidency and has appeared startled by the television lights ever
since.
After a disastrous beginning, Mr Franco has won over many Brazilians. In
July, his government launched a new currency, the Real, which brought
inflation tumbling down and greatly helped the poor.
Instead of being booed during walkabouts, as happened earlier this year, he
is now applauded. When he leaves office on January 1, he will hand over to a
successor he helped elect.
Explaining these successes is as complicated as Mr Franco's unpredictable
character. Brazil's economic and political outlook improved under his
leadership, but historians may decide this was due to luck rather than
presidential judgment.
A populist who took office with a poor understanding of economics and few
political allies, and prone to lose his temper, Mr Franco, 64, often
appeared to have little appetite for the job.
After probably his most embarrassing moment, when he was photographed
flirting with a knickerless actress at this year's carnival, he compounded
the error by telephoning her the next day. The actress, who was trying to
revive her career rather than pick up the president, let the press listen in
on the conversation.
Despite such setbacks, Mr Franco's two-year presidency will be remembered as
a time of opening for the protected economy, and for the Real, which looks
to be the country's best chance yet to kick its inflationary habit.
Sadly for Mr Franco, his predecessor Mr Collor will probably gain the credit
for the first of these achievements, while his successor Mr Fernando
Henrique Cardoso will be praised for the second.
It was Mr Collor who cut average tariffs from more than 50 per cent to 14
per cent and told industry to improve productivity. Mr Collor also agreed
with President Carlos Menem of Argentina that the Mercosur customs union
linking the two countries with Paraguay and Uruguay should be accelerated
and come into effect on January 1 1995 rather than five years later.
The opening of the economy, as well as disastrous shock measures from 1990
designed to combat inflation, sent Brazil into deep recession.
When it started to recover in 1993, helped by a more competitive private
sector and rising commodity prices, Mr Collor was out of office and Mr
Franco was in place to take the credit.
Although he was criticised for appearing to have no overall economic policy,
and for losing three finance ministers in seven months, Mr Franco's first
full year in office saw gross domestic product grow by about 5 per cent,
compared to zero or negative growth since 1990.
This year, helped by the Real's success, growth should be about 4 per cent.
Mr Cardoso's appointment in May last year as Mr Franco's fourth finance
minister was the real turning point for the government's fortunes.
Mr Cardoso, a former academic and skilled politician, assembled a team of
economists to launch a new currency specifically designed to stop inflation
and elect him as the next president.
Mr Franco also agreed, for the first time since becoming president, that he
would cede control over the economy to the finance ministry.
'Other than personal friends, the president only fully trusted Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, who was also the only man alert enough to (Mr Franco's)
sensitivities,' according to an outgoing government member.
After the Real's introduction in July, popularity ratings for Mr Franco and
his government rose as quickly as inflation fell.
Mr Cardoso's votes also mounted, and he comfortably won October's election.
In Brazil's turbulent politics, Mr Franco is one of the few presidents to
have handed power peacefully to his chosen successor.
Mr Franco said recently that a big regret was his failure to increase the
minimum wage, because of a lack of funds. Critics are harsher, pointing out
that his prickly character and style of management often left the government
leaderless, with different ministries unaware of each others' actions.
His refusal to back much needed constitutional reforms earlier this year
ensured their failure.
His occasional outbursts, such as a threat to ignore an unfavourable Supreme
Court ruling, reinforced international perceptions of the fragility of
Brazil's institutions.
Yet, as at the end of Being There, Mr Franco's supporters are already musing
about his chances of running for the presidency in 1998.

FT  30 DEC 94 / CIA chief who quit the troubled world of spying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jim Woolsey, who resigned late on Wednesday as CIA director, has personal
qualities that do not quite fit with the conventional image of espionage
shaped by real spies. He is gregarious, fond of sailing and singing, and
quite willing to talk about his trade.
Indeed, these days old spies tend to talk a lot. Earlier this week Mr
Aldrich Ames, the unearthed Soviet 'mole' who was the heaviest cross Mr
Woolsey had to bear, went on television to discuss his treachery quite
freely. Earlier this month, a whole gaggle of past and present spies and
scholars convened at Harvard for a public forum which saw one former
director, Mr Stansfield Turner, confess that intelligence estimates of the
Soviet threat he provided to President Jimmy Carter 'were not much help'.
Even the cost of intelligence is no longer the closed book it was. In
November, a congressional sub-committee inadvertently released details of
the Dollars 28bn (Pounds 17.9bn) national intelligence budget, of which the
CIA's particular slice was disclosed at Dollars 3.1bn, half as much again as
the State Department's (military intelligence, much of which is electronic
and to which the CIA has access, accounted for Dollars 23.6bn).
Not since the 1970s, when past CIA activities from Cuba to the Congo were
made public, has the agency been so much in the spotlight and subject to so
much analysis and criticism. This year Congress got into the act by setting
up a bipartisan commission under Mr Les Aspin, President Bill Clinton's
first defence secretary, and Mr Warren Rudman, the Republican ex-senator
from New Hampshire, to define new missions and purpose for America's spies.
From all this comment, much pre-dating examination of the political entrails
surrounding Mr Woolsey's resignation, a composite picture of a troubled CIA
emerges. Salient points include:
An 'old boy' culture protective of its own. This was most evident in the
failure to detect Mr Ames's activities in the face of what now looks like
overwhelming evidence, such as a personal lifestyle out of kilter with his
modest salary. Yet Mr Woolsey, in the hope that miscreants could be
reformed, gave them the disciplinary equivalent of a wrist-slap. A sexual
harassment suit brought by a highly regarded woman case officer denied
promotion was so strong that the agency settled out of court.
Deep divisions between the new breed of intelligence analysts and the old
operational cold war warriors, described at Harvard by Mr McGeorge Bundy of
the Kennedy and Johnson administrations as 'hard-boiled, activist,
give-us-the-job, anti-Communists'.
It was the latter school who went to great lengths to besmirch the
reputation of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti, thus immensely
complicating administration efforts to restore him to power, and who
continued to produce reports on leftwing dissidents around the world or
Russian crop estimates, often duplicating the work of the media and
academia.
No real consensus on a post-cold war mission in the face of proliferating
demands for intelligence both because of old targets (Moscow, Beijing and
Pyongyang) and new ones dotted around the world (Algeria being merely the
latest).
Mr Woolsey's supporters argue that he had quietly done much to rationalise
electronic surveillance, including a controversial extension into commercial
intelligence-gathering, and had improved the quality of CIA analysis. But
this never satisfied his congressional critics, especially when he sought
exemption from budget cuts or tried to explain why he had not hung up by the
thumbs those implicated in the Ames affair.
All this is a far cry from the last heyday of espionage under President
Ronald Reagan when Mr William Casey more or less did with his CIA what he
liked and if blocked, as over the Iran-Contra scandal, found other ways of
doing it, like recruiting Colonel Oliver North. But Mr Casey never felt
accountable to anyone, even, it seemed, his president. This is not the
fortune of today's CIA.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Syria call to Israel supported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Syria yesterday won the public backing of Egypt and Saudi Arabia for its
demand that Israel must fully withdraw from the Golan Heights and south
Lebanon as part of a comprehensive Middle East peace agreement.
After a two-day meeting in Alexandria, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt,
President Hafez al-Assad of Syria and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia issued a
statement which also called for Iraq to abide by United Nations Security
Council resolutions and for the removal from the region of all weapons of
mass destruction, a reference to Israel's nuclear stockpile.
The surprise summit was held at Syria's request after growing concern in
Damascus that Israel was winning wider recognition in the region despite
continuing to occupy Arab land. Mr Assad is understood to have been
particularly concerned at the visit earlier this week to Oman by Mr Yitzhak
Rabin, Israeli prime minister.
The Syrians hope that yesterday's statement by Saudi Arabia, the dominant
nation in the Gulf Co-operation Council, will put pressure on the other five
members to await progress in the peace negotiations before establishing
links with Israel.
The summit may also herald a concerted effort to rebuild Arab bridges after
the divisions caused by the 1991 Gulf war and the unilateral decision by the
Palestine Liberation Organisation to sign a separate peace agreement with
Israel.
The three leaders said they 'highly appreciated Syria's serious efforts' to
make the deadlocked peace process a success and urged the US and Russia, the
co-sponsors, to work towards 'removing the obstacles the Israeli side puts
in the road to peace'.
They also urged Iraq to abide by all UN resolutions 'to alleviate the
suffering of the brotherly Iraqi people and provide a suitable atmosphere
for stability in the Arab world'.

over the past two weeks say the country's finance minister has mismanaged
the currency crisis. Confidence in Mexico will not return until Mr Serra
goes, the money managers say - always adding a quick 'don't quote me on
that'.
These foreign investors are unlikely to get their wish. As the economic team
surrounding President Ernesto Zedillo yesterday crunched out an economic
stabilisation plan, Mr Serra is looking increasingly secure.
Ahead of the announcement of the plan, government officials and political
analysts said Mr Zedillo would attempt to ride out the crisis without making
any immediate modifications in his cabinet and that the new president would
try to restore investor confidence by changing policies, not people.
'So far Zedillo's response to this crisis has been tactical, making moves
day by day. But he and his people know that to succeed they need to put
together a real strategy,' says Prof Guillermo Garduno, professor of
political science at the Mexican Institute of Technology. 'Replacing Serra
only makes sense as a tactic, but it wouldn't be very strategic less than
one month into the government.'
A two-pronged political strategy is beginning to emerge. The first part is
to blame ex-president Carlos Salinas and Mr Pedro Aspe, his former finance
minister, for much of the current crisis. This move would follow a tradition
in Mexico of the new president coming down hard on the predecessor who
hand-picked him.
Specifically, Mr Salinas and Mr Aspe will be taken to task for not
devaluing, even when they saw compelling economic reasons to do so. Several
senior government economic officials, including Mr Guillermo Ortiz,
communications and transport minister, had been privately explaining the
need for a devaluation as early as November 1993.
But these officials were overruled by their superiors for political reasons,
namely the fear that a devaluation would cause the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary party to lose votes in last August's election and because it
take some lustre off Mr Salinas' campaign to become head of the World Trade
Organisation. Mr Salinas' dwindling chances of a move to Geneva, and a
post-devaluation poll showing the PRI likely to be crushed in February's
state elections, show just how right the two former officials may have been.
Obviously, should Mr Zedillo launch such an attack, it would cancel the
possibility of every foreign investor's dream come true, namely the return
of Mr Aspe to the finance ministry. Most political analysts say bringing Mr
Aspe back would be damaging to the presidency. 'Zedillo needs to consolidate
power or this is never going to work. Aspe's return would be a recognition
that Zedillo is weak and not in control of the situation,' says Prof
Garduno.
The second part of the president's gambit will be to keep the cabinet
intact, but to redistribute finance responsibilities among various
ministers. Although Mr Ortiz was the most elegant advocate of devaluation in
the Salinas administration and is therefore a prime candidate to replace Mr
Serra, Mr Zedillo desperately needs him at communications and transport in
order to carry out many of the privatisations that will be a key component
of the stabilisation plan.
Keeping Mr Ortiz in place would also protect him, leaving open the
possibility of him taking over at the finance ministry in the future. Many
analysts believe an already devalued Mr Serra will be kept around to do the
dirty work of implementing a severe austerity plan and then be dismissed at
the end of next year.
'In all wars there are deaths,' says Mr Federico Arreola, a political
columnist. 'And in the Zedillo's war against economic difficulties, Serra
will eventually have to be sacrificed. . . even though he might not be at
fault.'
Yet government officials recognise that this strategy will not work unless
the war in Chiapas province is resolved and political stability is restored.
In fact, since the financial crisis began nearly two weeks ago, more
progress has been made towards reopening negotiations in Chiapas than on the
economic front.
'In terms of restoring confidence in this government, a solution in Chiapas
would be worth one hundred cabinet changes,' says a government official.

FT  30 DEC 94 / US investors nurse bruises from peso crisis
</HEADLINE>

The devaluation of the Mexican peso and the country's financial crisis have
left US financial institutions - the largest investors in Mexico - nursing
some nasty bruises.
Economists are worried that US mutual funds, banks, and securities houses
may shy away from investing in Mexico. There is already evidence that some
are withdrawing altogether, at least temporarily.
One US mutual fund is said to have decided to liquidate its peso-exposed
investments after seeing the value of its Mexican holdings decline as much
as 20 per cent. According to a debt trader at one US bank, the fund is
selling the securities in anticipation of redemptions that may come in after
the fund sends out its year-end statement in several weeks.
The trader said that the fund had bought at least Dollars 150m of the debt
of a large Mexican company at an issue price of Dollars 102. After the
crisis broke, it tried to sell the paper for Dollars 92, but had trouble
finding buyers.
For another fund group, Massachusetts Financial Services of Boston, the
currency crisis meant a loss of about Dollars 11m across several funds with
total assets of more than Dollars 3bn. Mr Jeffrey Kaufman, who manages
emerging market debt for several of the company's mutual funds, said that in
the wake of uncertainty about the government's economic plan the company
pulled all its peso-exposed debt out of Mexico.
But, he added, 'I don't view our exit as permanent because I think the
Mexican government can take steps to rebuild its credibility.'
According to the latest figures from the Securities Industry Association, US
investment in Mexican stocks totalled more than Dollars 1bn in the middle of
this year. In the Mexican debt market, US investors held more than Dollars
2.2bn as of last June. On the equities side, analysts calculate that the
dollar value of US investments in Mexican stocks would have declined more
than 30 per cent if they had been held throughout the week-long crisis.
Lipper Analytical, a research firm, said that open-ended Mexican equity
funds in the US declined an average 25 per cent between December 16 and
December 23 and open-ended bond funds fell by an average of 16 per cent over
the same period.
In spite of these losses, however, most US funds dedicated primarily to
Mexico or emerging markets appear to have decided to see out the crisis.
Mr William Truscott, assistant manager of the Scudder Latin America Fund,
which held about 30 per cent of its Dollars 726m in assets in
peso-denominated securities, said he would stay the course in Latin America
although the fund had lost about 20 per cent since the first devaluation on
December 19.
Like many other managers, Mr Truscott expressed anger over the way the
month-old administration of Mr Ernesto Zedillo chose to execute the
devaluation.
'There is general shock,' he said. 'The handling of this problem by the
current administration stands in stark contrast to the Salinas
administration where there was always a plan and a contingency plan if that
plan didn't work.'
Mr Truscott and others are now waiting to see the economic plan Mr Zedillo
is scheduled to outline on January 2.
Mr Lawrence Goodman, an economist who specialises in Latin America at
securities firm Salomon Brothers, warned that investors should expect
volatility in the markets until the plan is announced.
'What we are seeing now is that, independent of a programme, there are waves
of speculation that are leading to massive swings both in the currency and
the equity and fixed income markets. There is a fair amount of concern among
investors related to credibility that has been jeopardised,' said Mr
Goodman.
For US commercial and investment banks, meanwhile, the immediate fallout
from the peso devaluation has been the losses incurred on their portfolios
of Mexican debt securities. Mr James Hanbury, banking analyst at Wertheim
Schroder in New York, said the peso's decline ensured that a difficult
trading year for banks ended on a suitably bleak note. 'In a quarter where
securities trading and bond trading profits have been terrible, this will be
another piece of bad news.'
Not all US banks suffered trading losses. Although shares in Citicorp fell
last week after the peso was floated because of concern about the earnings
of the US bank with the biggest exposure to Mexico, analysts said the bank
was protected because it had a big local currency business in Mexico and so
did not need to take risks trading Brady bonds and Latin American debt in
New York.
Bear Stearns, a big trader in the secondary market for Mexican securities,
was also said to have fared well last week. One analyst said the firm told
him that it had broken even on its Mexican debt trading during the crisis.
Although he was not sure how the firm managed to survive the devaluation
unscathed, the analyst said of Bear Stearns: 'They're smart. Also, this (the
devaluation) did not exactly come as a total surprise to everybody. They
could have been short, or flat. And they could have been lucky.'
Now the big questions are, said Mr Hanbury, 'What happens to Mexican credit
in 1995? What will the economy do? How will Mexican companies pay their
debts when their earnings are in pesos and their debts in dollars? What is
the knock-on effect of all this? We just don't know.'
The crisis also had serious implications for Mexico's capital-raising
ability, he said. 'A good deal of Mexican stocks and bonds are owned by
outsiders. That puts them at risk in raising capital, because foreigners
will be frightened for a while.'

<TEXT>
A severe newsprint shortage and steep price increases have led some North
American publishers to cut their paper consumption. The shortages, most
acute on the West Coast, have been exacerbated by a strike at Fletcher
Challenge Canada's three mills in British Columbia which began last week.
Fletcher normally produces about 3,000 tonnes of newsprint a day.
Publishers' inventories are typically low at this time of year. Strong
demand, especially in the southern US, and exports to Europe, south-east
Asia and Mexico have also tightened supplies.

FT  30 DEC 94 / A Year of Corruption: Brave judges pursue ministers - France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A wave of French corruption scandals this year has led to the resignation of
two ministers, the detention of a third and of a senator, the investigation
of the presidents of Alcatel and St Gobain as well as of lesser company
bosses, and widespread pressure for a divorce between corporate money and
politics.
As a result, just before Christmas, the French parliament passed a law
banning company donations to political parties and candidates.
Though he was later forced by public opinion to back new legislation, prime
minister Edouard Balladur's initial reaction was to argue that the very fact
that scandals were surfacing was proof that existing political financing
laws were adequate.
To a large degree, he was right. Magistrates are without doubt bolder in
their targets and their tactics than they were. A Lyons magistrate had
little hesitation in detaining Mr Alain Carignon, the former communications
minister, in prison on charges relating to the award of a water contract to
Lyonnaise des Eaux by the city of Grenoble, of which Mr Carignon is still
mayor. A judge from Rennes has relentlessly pursued Mr Gerard Longuet, the
former industry minister, over allegations concerning his personal finances
and those of his Republican party.
One particular politician-businessman, Mr Bernard Tapie, has complained of a
witch-hunt, noting that over the past 18 months investigation of his tangled
affairs has involved 60 fraud squad officers detaining 74 people and taking
no fewer than 230 sets of fingerprints. Yet it could be argued that it was
only Mr Tapie's inclusion in the last Socialist government that prevented
these investigations from starting earlier.
However, it appears that the the volume - not just the visibility - of
corruption may be on the increase, for several reasons. One is that the
crackdown on the Mafia in Italy has led organised crime to branch into
neighbouring regions, such as the French Riviera. French magistrates now
meet regularly with their Italian counterparts to tackle this.
A more general problem is the consequence of the past 10 years of devolving
more power from Paris to the country's 22 regions and 95 departments. This
puts more power to award contracts into the hands of local politicians. And
they have used this power.
Part of France's new anti-corruption legislation is designed to make the
award of public contracts more transparent and therefore less open to
suspicion of sweetheart deals between contractors and local politicians.
But the law's total ban on corporate contributions to political parties and
candidates will return the country to its pre-1988 situation when such
contributions were illegal - in theory punishable as a misuse of corporate
funds, but in fact widespread and tolerated.
'This will just bring back the era of the bag men,' predicts Mr Guy
Carcassonne, a Paris law professor who helped the Rocard government design
its 1990 law. This legalised limited corporate political contributions and
required them to be reported to a control commission. It has hardly had time
to work, and the fear now is that corporate money will continue to flow to
politicians, but in envelopes and suitcases.

FT  30 DEC 94 / A Year of Corruption: Reforms may prove to be a backward
step - Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
If corruption means the exchange of favours for cash, it is part of the
fabric of Japanese society.
It has been increasing this year and is likely to go on rising in 1995. A
new electoral system and elections for regional governors, mayors and part
of the upper house this year suggests that the traffic in political
influence, the root of most Japanese corruption, will get busier.
The definition of corruption in Japan is as relative as the country's own
moral code. Prosecutors tend to pounce only when they believe the behaviour
of a company or politician has gone beyond the limits of public
acceptability.
To take only its most celebrated incident, the past year has seen the
resignation of a prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, over allegations of
borrowing from a parcel delivery company linked to gangsters.
He was not prosecuted. It was a minor offence by the standards of the
Lockheed bribery scandal of the 1970s and the Recruit shares for favours
scandal of the 1980s.
More spectacular than Mr Hosokawa's fall was the arrest last year and
continuing bribery trial of a former construction minister, Mr Kishiro
Nakamura. The case is linked to bribery cases involving 30 construction
company executives and local politicians - the largest such affair since the
war.
On the corporate scene, there were revelations of bid rigging for overseas
civil engineering contracts funded by Japanese development aid, plus insider
dealing charges against 25 drug company employees.
All this has corresponded with a steady rise in public aversion to
politicians. The latter have sought to improve their image by a sweeping
reform of the political and electoral system, which took effect on Christmas
Day. Ostensibly, the change is designed to make politicians less beholden to
special interests. Many believe it will, at least in its teething stages,
have the opposite effect.
It will make politicians fight harder for seats by replacing a multi-seat
system, under which it was possible to get a seat with as little as 15 per
cent of the vote, with a mixture of UK-style first-past-the-post single seat
constituencies and European-style proportional representation regions.
Corporate donations are to be curbed now and eliminated in five years' time,
with a state subsidy for political parties, worth Y30.9bn (Pounds 198m)
annually, thrown in as compensation.
However, analysts believe the new system will have the effect of increasing
politicians' need for cash. Vote-buying has been an important part of
Japanese politics since the formation of the Liberal Democratic party in
1955, and the main reason its top people have been so frequently caught
breaking the law.
Under the old multi-seat system, LDP members often had to compete against
one another to win seats. They were unable to offer voters a choice of
policies, unless they had the good fortune to be one of the few LDP men
standing against a Socialist. So an envelope stuffed with cash had to do
instead; even better, a construction contract for a local company or a new
swimming pool or road for an influential district.
A sitting member needed to spend Y200m to Y300m in the six months leading up
to an election, and Y50m to Y200m in routine annual running costs, depending
on the size of the constituency, just to stay in business, estimates Mr Dan
Harada, a political consultant.
Under the new system, the average politician will need to collect nearly
twice as many votes as before to get elected. He will have to be top of the
poll, rather than in the first five or six.
He or she will also be under just as much pressure as before to buy those
extra votes with cash, rather than policies. The recently formed main
opposition party, the New Frontier party, espouses policies largely
indistinguishable from the LDP, while the Socialist party has dropped most
of its left-wing baggage to forge a coalition with the LDP.

FT  30 DEC 94 / A Year of Corruption: Politics, money and crime: a world on
the take - 1994 has seen corruption making headlines across the globe.
Andrew Adonis explains why
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This has been a year of concern about corruption the world over. Gone are
the days when developed countries could smugly believe they had outgrown
endemic corruption or the Anglo-Saxons that they were not like the southern
Europeans and Latin Americans.
Three broad categories of illicit practice are evident. The first could be
called 'sleaze' - dubious practice on the margins of impropriety, involving
relatively small sums and favours. Congressional scandals in the US and the
'cash for questions' furore in the British parliament belong here.
In both cases, offenders took advantage of lax rules or found themselves in
the darker grey regions of tolerable practice. In the UK, it was not
previously clear that MPs should declare all outside income in the Register
of Members' Interests, while there was no clear divide between 'acceptable'
consultancy fees and 'unacceptably' pocketing fees for posing parliamentary
questions.
Sleaze is readily tackled by tighter rules and more effective policing,
though if parliamentarians and officials feel themselves underpaid, some are
bound to seek dubious earnings.
The same applies to the second category - corruption associated with
're-inventing government'. As executive restructuring advances, with
contracting-out, privatisation and devolution at its heart, new institutions
are thrown up without the cultural or regulatory safeguards of the old.
France and the UK are the year's foremost cases, France with scandals
involving new regional councils and the contracting-out of municipal
services, Britain through dubious practices in new state agencies,
particularly in the health sector.
The moral is clear: it is rash to assume that safeguards against corruption,
however deeply embedded in existing institutions (such as the elite national
civil services of Britain and France), will take root elsewhere without
strenuous inculcation.
The third category of corruption - the endemic, enjoying a wide measure of
social tolerance and flourishing despite rules to prevent it  - is the most
difficult to address. This is because it is the most deeply rooted, and
comes in a wide variety of forms.
In some cases, such as Japan, the exchange of favours for cash is a common
practice. In others, notably Yeltsin's Russia, extortion and racketeering
are widespread and the rule of law weak; with dictatorships, the economy
often becomes little more than a private fiefdom.
Furthermore, the exposure of such corruption often has more to do with a
change in circumstances - such as, in Italy, the rise of assertive judges -
than with an increase in corruption per se.
The past year has shown that where corruption is endemic it is hard to
tackle. France, India, Japan, Italy and Brazil - to take the most notorious
cases - have seen governments elected with the eradication of corruption as
prime objectives founder helplessly, in some cases with 'reformist'
ministers - even prime ministers - charged with complicity in corruption.
Endemic corruption has an impact outside the countries immediately concerned
because those doing business with them are almost invariably sucked in.
Strict controls, such as those imposed by the US on its companies abroad,
are not panaceas, although Dr Mark Pieth, chairman of the OECD working group
on international business bribery, would like to see them more widely
adopted. In Africa and Asia-Pacific, it is an open secret that many western
companies use local joint venture partners to engage in the bribery needed
to win contracts.
So what is being done? Where the reliance of politicians on corporate cash
has caused scandals, state funding of political parties is a stock response.
According to Dr Karl-Heinz Nassmacher of Oldenburg university, such funding
has grown 'dramatically' in the past 10 years.
State aid can help substitute for big corporate donations, but it rarely
gets to the root of the problem, which is the expense of election campaigns.
Dr Michael Pinto-Duschinsky, an expert on party finance at Brunel
university, says: 'Anti-corruption policies largely focus on management
techniques, rather than on limiting campaign expenditure - and therefore
reducing the debts which politicians have to pay.' France, where the launch
of generous state aid in 1988 did nothing to avert this year's scandals, is
a case in point.
Where institutions exist - such as the Milan magistracy in Italy - prepared
to tackle endemic corruption, the process may start internally. Where such
forces are weak, the task is far tougher. In extreme cases, such as Nigeria,
all of whose key institutions are generally regarded as tainted, it means
starting practically from scratch.
Encouraging multinationals to observe codes of non-corrupt conduct is one
course. External publicity can also help; so can aid in establishing new
legal and administrative systems, particularly with those governments
anxious to make a fresh start after democratisation.
To the fore in such efforts is Transparency International, a Berlin-based
group founded 18 months ago which calls itself the 'coalition against
corruption in international business'. Led by a group experienced in aid,
commerce and development, TI has no illusions about quick fixes. It is
pioneering an evolutionary approach, relying on a combination of judicious
publicity, and the promotion of tougher laws, tighter monitoring, and
technical assistance.
TI's campaign focused at first on five or six governments in developing
countries and central and eastern Europe which were prepared to participate.
Ecuador has been in the vanguard, restricting tendering for big state
contracts to corporations which have signed an anti-bribery pledge.
Yet it is a slow process. For as long as bribery is the path to contracts,
companies are bound to engage in it. The US is a telling case in point.
After cases such as the Lockheed scandal in the 1970s, US corporations are
more circumspect than many of their foreign counterparts. But past trauma,
and tougher laws, do not explain everything: with the Clinton administration
campaigning worldwide on their behalf as never before, the incentive to
bribe is reduced.
What of those without the clout of the US behind them? 'It's business as
normal,' replies one cynic.

Anti-corruption investigations have decapitated Italy's post-war political
elite and discredited hundreds of businessmen and civil servants.
Yet after almost three years of investigations spearheaded by Milan
magistrates, the impetus is beginning to wane and public interest to
decline. The magistrates' battle to stamp out the worst aspects of
corruption is also degenerating into a conflict between the judiciary and
the executive branch of government.
The most spectacular instance of this conflict is the move by Milan
magistrates to incriminate Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the outgoing prime
minister, for permitting corrupt practices in his Fininvest business empire.
Mr Berlusconi's government countered by sending inspectors from the justice
ministry to check on the activities of the Milan magistrature.
Mr Berlusconi claims he is the victim of a judicial vendetta and says he has
done no wrong. He moreover defends his younger brother, Paolo, who has
admitted paying L330bn (Pounds 128m) in bribes to the Guardia di Finanza,
the financial police, to ensure favourable inspections of Fininvest
accounts.
In one sense Mr Berlusconi is right about the vendetta. Milan magistrates
have picked upon him: as owner of Italy's second largest private company,
they want to make an example of him in what might be called the second phase
of the anti-corruption investigations.
The first phase ended with the collapse of the old political parties and the
success of Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement in the March 1994 general
elections. That phase was intended to expose the incestuous and corrupt
relationship between business and politics.
Businesses funded the political parties with illicit contributions to
individuals, internal movements and party secretaries. How much of this
money was used for political activities as opposed to lining individual
pockets is still a mystery. People have only admitted to what has been
proven against them and most of the money was channelled outside the Italian
banking system (mostly to Switzerland, Monaco and Luxembourg). In return the
businesses were allowed access to state subsidies, were awarded rigged
contracts and were protected from external competition.
The most detailed expose has concerned the Ferruzzi-Montedison industrial
group which spent more than L150bn (Pounds 58m) between 1989 and 1992 in
ensuring political protection. However, the Ferruzzi family and former top
executives insist their pay-offs were involuntary - a defence raised by
every business involved in corruption scandals. In other words businessmen
were the corrupted not the corruptors.
The second phase of investigations is intended to demonstrate that the
distinction between corruptors and corrupted is spurious. The core proof is
emerging from an investigation into the Guardia di Finanza. This involves 50
members of this force plus many prominent business names.
The Guardia di Finanza are accused of taking bribes to turn a blind eye to
poor or dishonest accounting and in return for low tax assessments. In Italy
it is common knowledge most companies keep two sets of books and that tax
evasion is widespread. Pervasive corruption is encouraged by large sums of
'grey' money that escape the tax net. If companies pay large bribes they can
be dressed up as fake consultancy fees but more simply they are never
registered in the formal books.
This lack of transparency is encouraged by the existence of a huge criminal
world, which has enjoyed a degree of political protection and which needs to
launder money on a vast scale and by the fact that the bulk of 'legitimate'
business is carried out by very small family concerns which are not easy to
monitor.
Businesses claim it is simpler to bribe the Guardia than face difficulties.
The Milan magistrates argue the businesses have put themselves in a position
where they have things they wish to keep quiet and are therefore willing to
pay. The magistrates are out to break this relationship and demonstrate that
bribing a public servant - one in uniform who polices the most sensitive
aspects of the nation's finances  - is a serious crime and not something
'that everyone does'.
The Guardia inquiry has shown public servants and businessmen brazenly
continuing corrupt activities, even when the nation has been convulsed by
corruption scandals. In part this is because corruption has become so
pervasive the practice carries no stigma. But people are also encouraged to
feel immune from prosecution by judges who have proved corruptible and by a
judicial system that can be tied in knots by a jungle of contradictory laws.
The issue has perversely become not how to stop the practice but how far the
magistrates should be allowed to go in their investigations. The
investigative process - let alone the passage through the courts - could
last well into the next century. Politically such an open-ended timetable is
highly destabilising. Yet any government that seeks to find a political
solution risks being accused of letting the thieves go free and undermining
any subsequent attempt to impose new moral standards on society.

FT  30 DEC 94 / A Year of Corruption: Rules of the game become ever tighter
 -United States
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
It was only about 30 years ago that an intrepid reporter summoned up the
nerve to ask Orval Faubus how it was that since he was born dirt poor and
had never earned more than Dollars 10,000 a year as a multi-term governor of
Arkansas he was able to retire to a splendid mansion. 'I was parsimonious,'
was the reply, and that was pretty much the end of the story.
He could not have got away with the answer today. Hardly a week passes
without an elected or public official coming under the investigative gun of
the media and a federal, state or independent counsel.
This year two Washington heavyweights bit the dust. Mr Dan Rostenkowski,
quintessential product of the Chicago Democratic political machine that
always used money to grease its efficient political wheel, was forced to
step down as chairman of the House ways and means committee after being
indicted on several counts of misusing congressional funds. (He was later
defeated at the polls.) Mr Mike Espy, agriculture secretary, resigned
because it was alleged he had accepted sports tickets and other favours of
fairly nugatory value from agribusinesses he was supposed to regulate.
It is said, with some accuracy, of Mr Rostenkowski and Mr Espy that they
failed to understand there had been changes to the once lax rules of the
game applied in Congress where often modest favours (such as hospitality)
were received and dispensed.
At the heart of the Whitewater affair is the suspicion, still unproven, that
money flowed in a clandestine manner from business interests to then
Governor Bill Clinton's campaigns in Arkansas and, perhaps, subsequently at
the national level.
Congressman Newt Gingrich, the next Speaker of the House, is the subject of
persistent questions about the funding and uses of his political action
committee, the legal device through which so many politicians channel
contributions.
Congressmen are also, by definition, beholden to powerful constituent
interests. Senator Jesse Helms from North Carolina and Congressman Thomas
Bliley of Virginia, for example, have never disguised their protection of
their home state tobacco farmers, who have returned the favour with campaign
money and, equally important, jobs for voters. In an era of ever more
expensive elections, disappointing such interests can be costly.
Indeed, the rules of the anti-corruption game are forever changing, with the
appearance of impropriety seeming to take precedence over the act itself.
The Clinton administration came to power having campaigned against
Republican 'sleaze' and promised the highest ethical standards. Under its
rules, no government official, high or low, may accept gifts or
entertainment worth more than Dollars 20 per occasion or Dollars 50 per year
from any single source, which has put a bit of a crimp in the Washington
lunch trade, if nothing else.
Those who leave government now face tougher than ever curbs on their ability
to walk through the revolving door into related commercial activities,
especially if run by non-American interests. The restrictions may seem
petty, even a disincentive to public service, but the climate of the times
and voices such as that of Ross Perot demand them.
The administration also touts reform of campaign financing and lobbying as
effective antidotes to the appearance of an unhealthy relationship between
politics and money. But two bills to this effect foundered in the autumn on
the rocks of Republican filibusters. Lobbying reform, which had enjoyed
broad bipartisan support, may resurface in the next Congress with new
ceilings on entertainment and travel and possibly a mandatory register of
lobbyists and fuller disclosure of their activities.
But public financing of congressional elections, the simplest way of
levelling the financial playing field and already in effect in the race for
the presidency, profoundly divides the two parties. Experience of previous
experiments in campaign finance reform - which do now place limits on
individual and special interest contributions - merely prove that money will
find its way to its destination regardless.
Curiously, US politicians may be held in low regard for their ethical
standards but the evidence of endemic and wholesale political corruption
remains relatively thin. The main difference is that any American hand
caught in the cookie jar, no matter how small the haul, may end up raised in
front of a grand jury.

FT  30 DEC 94 / China's foreign minister to visit UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, will visit the UK next year in
what British officials hope, but do not expect, will mark an improvement in
relations.
News of Mr Qian's proposed visit, which is not expected until the late
spring or summer, came amid expectations of another Sino-British row - this
time over a multi-billion-dollar plan to replace the sewerage systems in
Hong Kong, which the local government says is urgently needed.
China has requested that the Hong Kong government defer plans to start a big
part of the HKDollars 20bn (Pounds 1.67bn) project pending discussions about
its environmental consequences.
The government claims that as stage one of the project - a treatment plant
on Stonecutter's Island - is self-contained and can be completed before Hong
Kong's handover to China in 1997 it does not need Beijing's approval. It may
let contracts this week for construction of the treatment plant.
Mr Qian confirmed his plans to visit the UK to a group of local Hong Kong
politicians visiting the Chinese capital. In a phrase which underlined the
frostiness of bilateral relations he said that China had 'no objection' to a
proposed visit by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
Mr Heseltine is expected to go China in the spring. Last year he was forced
to withdraw from a trade mission to China when, in the middle of a row,
Beijing informed London that he was not welcome.
Mr Qian's planned visit to the UK is one in a regular series of meetings
which Britain and China agreed to as part of their 1991 pact to build a new
airport in Hong Kong, and comes in spite of the very poor atmosphere
surrounding Sino-British relations over Hong Kong. At a meeting earlier this
month in London, British and Chinese negotiators made little headway on
important issues relating to Hong Kong's legal system and the development of
the colony's container port.
On the port, the Hong Kong government appears to be stymied. A proposal from
Beijing this week that the colonial government build the port extension
itself and leave to the post-1997 administration the question of its
ownership has been rejected.
A far more difficult judgment which the government will have to make in the
New Year concerns the colony's court of final appeal. The government says it
is committed to establishing the court - which will be Hong Kong's highest -
before 1997.
In spite of a 1991 agreement with China on the structure of the court,
Beijing has been dragging its feet in approving the agreement in legislative
form. It has had a copy of a draft bill since May.
In the meantime Hong Kong's legal profession has emerged divided on the
government's draft bill. Its representatives in the local parliament have
vowed to oppose the government.

FT  30 DEC 94 / N Korea frees pilot after US 'regrets' border intrusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
North Korea early today released a US airman whose helicopter went down over
the communist state nearly two weeks ago.
His release appeared to defuse the fresh diplomatic row that flared up
between Pyongyang and Washington only two months after they had finalised an
accord on the North's nuclear programme.
The pilot, Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall, crossed the border at Panmunjom
into South Korea. His release came after the US sent a senior envoy, Mr
Thomas Hubbard, to Pyongyang on Wednesday for negotiations.
A Washington official said the US had expressed 'sincere regret' for the
helicopter's violation of North Korean air space. It agreed to hold contacts
with the North in an 'appropriate forum' to prevent similar incidents in the
future.
The US believes the existing Military Armistice Commission, set up after the
Korean War, should be the forum for such contacts. But North Korea could
well press for separate bilateral talks.
The North Koreans have insisted that the two US pilots - one of whom was
killed when their helicopter came down - were on a spying mission and they
published a 'confession' from Mr Hall.
In his ambiguous confession, Mr Hall admitted that his reconnaissance
helicopter made an 'intrusion deep' into North Korean airspace, adding 'this
criminal action is inexcusable and unpardonable'.
But any further delay in his release might have increased chances of the new
Republican-controlled US Congress trying to block implementation of the US
nuclear accord with North Korea. Under this accord, Pyongyang agreed to
dismantle its nuclear programme in return for US diplomatic ties and
international economic aid.
The pilot's apology may have provided a face-saving means for his release
while allowing North Korea to exploit the incident for propaganda purposes
and justify its downing of the helicopter.
The statement, if it was dictated by North Korean officials as many believe,
did not offer much support for Pyongyang's allegation that the helicopter
was on a spying mission and that its intrusion was deliberate.
Mr Hall's statement said his helicopter 'deviated' from its planned flight
route within South Korea, but gave no explanation why it strayed across the
demilitarised zone into the North. This could imply support for the US claim
that the helicopter lost its way due to a navigational error.
But some South Korean government analysts believe Mr Hall's statement that
it was on an 'observation reconnaissance' mission could be interpreted as
espionage if North Korea decides to press the affair.
North Korea may possibly exploit the incident to support its demand that the
US sign a formal treaty ending the 1950-53 Korean war and begin withdrawing
its 37,000 troops from South Korea.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Beijing plans to overhaul bankruptcy law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By A Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China plans to overhaul its eight-year-old bankruptcy law next year to
accelerate the streamlining of loss-ridden state companies. According to the
New China News Agency, a draft law to be presented to the National People's
Congress, the nominal parliament, will tighten existing legislation and
bring it into conformity with market reforms and international practices.
At a session of Chinese legislative leaders which ended yesterday, the
standing committee of the People's Congress also called for tighter control
by the legislature and the State Council, or cabinet, over the People's Bank
of China and its monetary policy.
Under a draft law that has to be ratified by the legislature next year, the
central bank will no longer engage in commercial or policy-related lending
and will have to report regularly on money supply, credit balance and other
issues.
The People's Bank of China has been trying to modernise and make the
transition from acting as the funding source of a planned economy to being a
market-oriented institution.
The legislative committee also cleared a new prison law aimed at curbing
China's rising crime in a move that extends legislative supervision and the
reach of Mr Qiao Shi, the powerful congress chairman, considered a contender
to succeed Mr Deng Xiaoping, the ailing paramount leader.
'The tasks in the coming year remain very heavy,' Mr. Qiao was quoted as
saying in a speech urging other legislative leaders to 'promote the
sustained, fast and healthy development of the national economy as well as
political and social stability of the country'.
Despite the proposed changes in bankruptcy legislation, western economists
questioned whether the government will carry out its bankruptcy programme.
However, Mr Cao Siyuan, a bankruptcy consultant and the architect of the
proposed legislative changes, predicted the draft law would speed the rate
of bankruptcies. Although the government admits that more than 40 per cent
of the 72,000 state-owned industrial enterprises are in the red, only about
2,000 have been allowed to go into default.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Dynamic Asians join top ten rich nations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three Asian nations count among the world's 10 richest countries when
measured in terms of national output per head, adjusted for the purchasing
power of their currencies in their home markets, the World Bank reported
yesterday.
For the first time, the Bank has published gross national product figures
for a majority of the earth's countries in terms of purchasing power parity
(PPP).
As a result, Hong Kong and Singapore, two of the so-called dynamic Asian
economies, join Japan in the top 10 of the world's richest nations. Two Gulf
oil producers, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, also appear in the top
10, displacing Kuwait, which appears 10th in the traditional country
rankings measured by GNP per head.
The World Bank believes that GNP per capita figures give a better indication
of relative standards of living when converted into 'international dollars'
at purchasing power parity. It defines PPP as the number of units of a
country's currency required to buy the same amount of goods and services in
the domestic market as Dollars 1 would buy in the US.
Using PPP, Luxembourg emerges as the world's richest country with an output
per head of Dollars 29,510 in international dollars in 1993. The US, the
world's strongest economic power, appears second in terms of GNP per head
measured in terms of PPP but only seventh in terms of GNP per head. As the
benchmark nation, US GNP per head is Dollars 24,750 (Pounds 16,000) on both
measures.
Britain is 19th among the 129 countries for which the Bank has calculated
output per head in terms of PPP, with per capita GNP of Dollars 17,750 in
international dollars, and 20th among 209 countries measured by GNP per head
only. On the traditional measure, UK output per head dropped in 1993 to
Dollars 17,970 from Dollars 18,110 in 1992.
The traditional measure makes Switzerland the world's wealthiest nation,
with a GNP per head of Dollars 36,410 - down Dollars 320 from 1992.
Mozambique is the poorest, with a GNP per head of Dollars 80, although this
rises to an estimated Dollars 380 in international dollars using the PPP
calculation.
The PPP calculations have the effect of lifting GNP per head sharply for
most developing countries and former communist states.
China, for example, had a GNP per head of Dollars 490 last year but, using
PPP, this rises to Dollars 2,120.
In Russia's case the PPP calculation yields a GNP per head of Dollars 5,240
for 1993 against Dollars 2,350 using traditional measures while the World
Bank, using PPP, calculates India's GNP per head at Dollars 1,250 last year
against Dollars 290 using the normal method.
The PPP method shows that Mexico, which formally joined the ranks of the
industrialised countries last year when it became a member of the
Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, is less
wealthy than several nations that are still considered developing countries.
Mexico's GNP per head was Dollars 7,100 in international dollars in 1993
against Dollars 8,630 for Malaysia and Dollars 8,130 for Venezuela.

<TEXT>
An ambiguous 'confession' signed by a US army helicopter pilot captured by
North Korea almost two weeks ago could further complicate efforts to secure
his release.
Analysts were divided over whether the statement by Chief Warrant Officer
Bobby Hall would speed his release or provide Pyongyang with new grounds to
detain him in return for possible concessions from the US.
If his return is delayed further, it is likely to increase prospects that
the new Republican-controlled US Congress will try to block implementation
of the recent US nuclear accord with North Korea. Under the accord,
Pyongyang agreed to dismantle its nuclear programme in return for US
diplomatic ties and international economic aid.
Mr Hall admitted that his OH-58 reconnaissance helicopter made an 'intrusion
deep' into North Korean airspace, adding 'this criminal action is
inexcusable and unpardonable'.
'I only hope, and it is my desire, that the (North) Korean People's Army
will leniently forgive me for my illegal intrusion so that I may return to
my home and be with my family again,' he concluded.
The apology may provide a face-saving means for his release, while allowing
North Korea to exploit the incident for propaganda purposes and justify its
downing of the helicopter.
The statement, if it was dictated by North Korean officials as many believe,
does not offer much support for Pyongyang's allegation that the helicopter
was on a spying mission and that its intrusion was deliberate. Mr Hall's
statement said that his helicopter 'deviated' from its planned flight route
within South Korea, but gave no explanation for why the helicopter strayed
across the demilitarised zone. This could imply support for the US claim
that the helicopter lost its way after a navigational error.
But some South Korean government analysts believe that Mr Hall's statement
that the helicopter was on an 'observation reconnaissance' mission could be
interpreted as espionage if North Korea decided to press the affair.
Whether North Korea will try to use the issue to gain concessions from the
US is still unclear as it negotiates with a senior US diplomat who has
travelled to Pyongyang to gain the pilot's release.
North Korea may possibly exploit the incident to support its demand that the
US sign a formal treaty ending the 1950-53 Korean war and begin withdrawing
its 37,000 troops from South Korea.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Peseta hit by Basque claims
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Accusations of government involvement in a secret 'dirty' war against
separatist Basque terrorist sympathisers shook Spanish markets again
yesterday, sending the peseta to an historic low against the D-Mark.
Increased fears of political instability drew Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime
minister, into giving a rare press conference yesterday, but he failed to
settle market nerves. The Madrid Bolsa fell to its lowest level since the
European currency crisis in the autumn of 1992.
Mr Gonzalez, who is facing the most testing period of his 12 years in power,
rejected allegations that his government had been involved in a shadowy
death squad and said he had no intention of resigning or of calling early
elections.
'There is a majority that prefers the stability that comes from serving out
the full legislature,' said the premier who won a fourth successive
four-year term in 1992, although he fell short of an overall majority.
But as a relaxed looking Mr Gonzalez dug in his political heels, the Bolsa
came under sharp selling pressure and its general index closed at 280.33
points, 3.26 points down on Wednesday. The index has lost nearly 6 per cent
of its value since the government was rocked last week by allegations that
linked it to an undercover war against Basque separatists in the mid-1980s.
The peseta, which had stood at Pta84.64 against the D-Mark on Wednesday,
dropped to Pta85.20 before steadying to close at Pta84.94. The yield on the
Treasury's 10-year bond was pushed up to 11.88 per cent from Wednesday's
11.72 per cent.
The government, which has been shaken by a string of scandals and corruption
allegations this year, is highly embarrassed by a well publicised legal
probe into a group of mercenaries who fought members of the Basque Eta
organisation in southwest France 10 years ago.
Three former security chiefs were remanded in custody last week in
connection with the dirty war, and more indictments are likely.
Questioned over the death squad allegations, Mr Gonzalez said his government
had 'acted strictly within the framework of the law in what was an
extraordinarily difficult situation'. He rejected opposition calls for his
resignation as 'out of the question' and said his government had
'sufficiently solid support' to continue in office.
Assurances of continued backing came from the Catalan nationalist leader, Mr
Jordi Pujol, whose party has provided Mr Gonzalez with a parliamentary
majority over the past 18 months. In an interview with a Barcelona newspaper
yesterday, Mr Pujol said the prime minister could count on his 'wholehearted
and firm support'.
Stability is unlikely to return to domestic politics, however, until the
judicial investigation into alleged illicit activities by the security
services is concluded. A separate legal probe, that is proving equally
damaging, concerns alleged widescale embezzlement of public funds by senior
officials at the interior ministry.
The politically-driven market nervousness that is battering the Spanish
markets meanwhile contrasts with clear signs of domestic economic recovery.
Mr Gonzalez said the recovery was 'taking on spectacular characteristics',
that there would be net job creation this month and that Spain's growth
would be above the EU average in 1995.

FT  30 DEC 94 / OECD struggles to adjust to harder times: Heavier workload
and resource constraints are straining the organisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Jean Claude Paye, secretary-general of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, returned to his desk last month one of his
first tasks was a fax. In a politically tactful move, he sent a message to
Mr Donald Johnston, the Canadian recently selected to succeed him, offering
congratulations him on his appointment - and any advice he might need.
In usual circumstances, the move might have seemed unremarkable. But as Mr
Paye surveys the scene from his elegant offices in the OECD's Paris
headquarters, both his position and the organisation's situation look
anything but normal.
Earlier this year the OECD was shaken by a bruising diplomatic row over
whether Mr Paye should continue in the post he has held for the past 10
years, or be replaced. The issue was finally resolved by agreeing that Mr
Johnston will succeed Mr Paye after 17 months.
The dispute, however, has highlighted new uncertainties about the future of
the group, which promotes co-operation among 25 of the world's leading
industrial economies. For with the OECD's workload surging, budgetary and
political constraints are threatening to leave the organisation hamstrung -
and Mr Paye and his successor facing an increasingly difficult task.
'We are not stifled yet but we are in a difficult position in reconciling
this wish for more work and sufficient resources,' Mr Paye says. 'One of our
concerns is that in some areas we are thinly spread now.'
In the short term, Mr Paye's first challenge is to smooth over the
diplomatic split between the European and non-European members that was
generated by his reappointment.
'It certainly was an unfortunate period, the battle for the secretary
generalship,' admits Mr Paye, a discreet and dapper French diplomat. 'But to
some extent I welcome this because it proves that there is a conviction in
member countries that the organisation matters.'
Indeed, back in his office, he insists that all is business as usual. In his
remaining time he plans to press ahead in the two main areas of change that
have emerged in recent years: the enlargement of the organisation to include
countries such as Poland; and its move into new areas of social policy
research, such as the OECD's celebrated recent jobs study. And he shrugs off
suggestions that his moves will be hampered by the Americans who opposed his
reappointment.
'I don't see the interest the Americans would have in blocking something. .
. . If they were to do so they would provoke retaliation later on,' he says,
insisting that this would go against the 'culture' of the organisation.
But the real question that now hangs over the OECD is whether Mr Paye's
cautious 'business as usual' approach will be enough to tackle the broader
problems it faces.
The OECD started life as an overseer of the post-war Marshall Plan, and was
established in its present form as a meeting place for governments and
source of economic research almost 30 years ago. But rapid changes in the
world economy have called this role into question, as groups like the
European Union have come to serve as an alternative source of co-operation.
Meanwhile, the OECD's claim to promote co-operation in the industrial world
appears increasingly anomalous, given that countries like the so-called
Asian tigers are not members.
As Mr Paye points out, these problems of geopolitical change also dog other
institutions like the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe or
the Nato alliance. But the OECD's distinctive culture of polite peer
pressure and consensus means that pushing through radical reforms is
particularly difficult.
Although Mr Paye believes, for example, that further changes are needed to
the OECD's internal structure, this is proving sensitive because its members
demand that the organisation should mirror the structure of their
governments. Attempts to fuse some computing, industry and science
committees earlier this year were blocked.
Meanwhile, moving funds from lesser known programmes like tourism research
to new projects is hard. 'We have tried to chop some programmes, but it
proves very difficult to get unanimous agreement. We almost scuttled the
budget discussions one year because one country insisted on maintaining the
activities on pulp and paper,' he says.
One solution, Mr Paye says, might be to end the requirement of unanimity in
the budget discussions. But pushing this through may be difficult, not least
because some members are already grumbling about the OECD's budget,
currently about FFr1.3bn (Pounds 155m).
The UK, for example, recently decided to stop funding the OECD Development
Centre, complaining that its budgetary contributions had surged by 40 per
cent in the past four years. The OECD insists that the real increase is 28
per cent, with most of this due to new research into east Europe. But Mr
Paye admits that Britain's move could prove the tip of an iceberg if the
organisation were 'unable to adjust and develop to meet its challenges'.
With Mr Paye hoping that the four Visegrad countries (Poland, Hungary, the
Czech Republic and Slovakia) will join the OECD in 1996, and South Korea
already having announced its intention of becoming a member, he insists that
the organisation still has a future.
Indeed, he argues that the development of such regional trading blocs as the
EU and North American Free Trade Agreement means the OECD should now aim to
play a vital role as a 'meeting point for policy dialogue between those
groups.'
But if the OECD is to achieve this role, it will require a new clarity of
vision from both Mr Paye and Mr Johnston. And with the former now planning
to meet the latter for exploratory talks next spring, it appears that the
two men will have much to discuss - irrespective of the previous diplomatic
dispute.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Economy hostage to war, oil and Yeltsin: The desperate
struggle waged by reformists over three crucial issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government's proclaimed aim of stabilising the economy next year
 -a move seen as indispensable to bringing stability not just to the economy
but to politics - now rests on the outcome of a desperate behind-the scenes
struggle by reformists over three critical issues: the war in Chechnya; a
system of domestic oil quotas; and the support of President Boris Yeltsin.
The 1995 budget assumes loans from the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank totalling nearly Dollars 13bn, which will account for a third of
budget income. But this lending is now in the balance because of a series of
massive problems, any one of which might throw such a programme off track.
The cost of the Chechen war is estimated to be running at some Rbs3,000bn a
week, and mounting. The final bill, including rebuilding the severely
damaged capital, Grozny, and other towns, had been put initially at
Rbs1,000bn but all estimates are now much higher. In addition, the military
will demand greatly increased expenditure as the price for their engagement
in the war.
A system of domestic oil quotas is now in draft form, and would replace the
quotas on oil exports which remain in force until January 1. Mr Yevgenny
Yasin, the pro-reformist economics minister, said yesterday that the draft
had not yet been signed, but he expected a decision from Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, the prime minister in the next couple of days.
'Our view in the economics ministry is that fears that ending quotas will
lead to a shortage of oil in the domestic market are insufficiently
grounded, and that a decision to liberalise is absolutely essential.'
Abolition of the quotas is seen by the IMF and the World Bank as vital to
the liberalisation of oil prices, which in turn is seen as a necessary
condition for economic stabilisation. IMF sources said yesterday that the
decision was a crucial test of the government's good intentions.
The position of the president on these issues is presently unknown. Mr
Yeltsin has formally backed the budget strategy, but has in the past
insisted on his own freedom of action to issue decrees and approve laws
which contradict budget strategy. The reformists now fear that unless he
explicitly endorses the 1995 budget itself, it will fail to command domestic
and international support. Mr Yeltsin has recently approved a law abolishing
a profit tax paid by banks, and is said to be in favour of signing
legislation raising minimum wages.
Government officials admit that the first quarter of the new year will be
exceptionally difficult as revenues are traditionally low at that period and
the costs of the Chechen war are mounting. However, they also believe that
the budget deficit of 8.2 per cent of official gross domestic product
(estimated at Rbs925,000bn) can be brought down, in part because the GDP
forecast is too low.
They also believe that if the IMF can agree on a standby loan in the middle
of January, inflation now running at around 15 per cent a month can be
swiftly lowered as expectations are reduced.
Mr Jochen Wermuth, head of the group of experts working with the finance
ministry, said last night that 'given recent positive developments in
revenue collection and additional revenue measures which the government can
implement without the agreement of the Duma (lower house of parliament), it
is likely that the government deficit could be as low as 5 per cent,
sufficiently low to allow for a credible policy of stabilisation - if
supported by a stabilisation fund'.
He added, however: 'Given the constraints on the budget in the first
quarter, quick IMF support for the programme is central.'

FT  30 DEC 94 / Italian parties take hard line in government talks: Scalfaro
plans further round of negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's main political parties have staked out intransigent positions in the
initial round of consultations held by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to
resolve the country's government crisis.
As the president winds up today his preliminary soundings, it has become
clear that he will insist on further extensive discussions with political
leaders before taking a decision. He will also be anxious to test whether
there is any flexibility in the hardline positions adopted by the parties.
Political commentators were saying yesterday that he was unlikely to reveal
his hand before the end of next week. The prospect of a long drawn-out
crisis put renewed pressure on the lira yesterday and it fell through the
psychological floor of L1,050 against the D-Mark to a new record low.
Following last Thursday's resignation of the eight-month-old Berlusconi
government, the parties are split between those for and against early
elections. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the out-going premier, told the president
bluntly this week that he had no option but to dissolve parliament and call
a snap election.
'We see no other solution but going to the polls,' Mr Berlusconi said after
seeing the president on Wednesday. The premier claims that he and his
rightwing coalition were given a mandate to govern which can be usurped by
no other political alliance. This view is shared by his allies.
Mr Berlusconi has even backed up the call for a quick electoral test by
suggesting the end of March as the polling date - exactly a year after he
scored his triumphal success with his Forza Italia movement less than three
months after entering politics.
But yesterday Mr Massimo D'Alema, the leader of the former communist Party
of the Democratic Left and the effective head of the opposition, voiced a
completely contrary view after meeting President Scalfaro. 'We have told
Scalfaro he cannot dissolve parliament so long as the majority of deputies
believe a new government must be formed,' he said.
In the chamber of deputies Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia, plus its remaining
allies - the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, the Christian Democratic
centre and the Radical reformers of Mr Marco Pannella - can muster 277
votes. Even with the backing of some members of the populist Northern League
which has left the coalition, Mr Berlusconi falls short of the 316-vote
majority. In contrast the combined vote of the opposition is close to 360 if
the full League contingent is included.
Mr Berlusconi knows the longer the delay in elections the more he is likely
to lose a sympathy vote. His opponents are meanwhile determined to place as
many obstacles in his path as possible to prevent him returning to
government.
The opposition also shares President Scalfaro's view that early elections
without further reform of the electoral system and some fresh budgetary
adjustments would be damaging to the country.
However, these measures could not easily be forced upon Mr Berlusconi and
his allies, who might retaliate by resigning en masse to demonstrate the
lack of legitimacy in the continued life of the parliament.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Russian call for state takeovers: Plan for control of key
enterprises jolts reform drive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The new head of Russia's State Property Committee, the main agency for
privatisation, said yesterday he was preparing a law to renationalise
enterprises in the central sectors of the Russian economy - oil and gas,
aluminium and the military-industrial complex.
Mr Vladimir Polevanov, appointed last month as head of the committee in
succession to Mr Anatoly Chubais, now a first deputy prime minister in
charge of the economy, told a group of Russian journalists it was essential
to 'change the economic course of the government' and impose 'strict state
management of enterprises'. He claimed he had the support of President Boris
Yeltsin and 'a part' of the government.
This is Mr Polevanov's most open statement of his aims since his appointment
 -though a series of muffled conflicts have been obvious between him and Mr
Chubais, the government's leading reformist, over the course of
privatisation. However, in claiming the president's support, Mr Polevanov is
also claiming that his line is winning out in the struggle over reform.
The threat to enterprises in sectors most attractive to foreign investors -
which include such companies as Lukoil and Gasprom, now actively seeking
foreign investment - is a move of the kind most feared by investors
considering putting money into a country still seen as politically volatile.
However, Mr Polevanov is being strongly opposed behind the scenes by Mr
Chubais, who is fighting to keep reform and privatisation alive by working
with Mr Polevanov's reform-minded deputies.
Mr Polevanov said he was 'very concerned' that in auctions of enterprises in
the fuel, energy and aluminium sectors, foreign investors had secured
packets of shares of up to 15 per cent of a company's stock and thus the
right to seats on the board. 'This directly threatens the security of
Russia,' he said.
He claimed that a senior official on Mr Yeltsin's staff had produced a
report on the threat to national security of privatisation and foreign
investment and that his actions were conforming to the lines of the report.
The privatisation committee, he said, was now drafting a law in co-operation
with the heads of the Duma's privatisation and budget committees, to bring
back the strategically important companies within state control. He said any
loss of foreign investment as a result of such a law would be compensated by
imposition of higher import tariffs.
Earlier this week, Mr Maxim Boiko, head of the Privatisation Centre - an
independent institute close to the government - acknowledged that Mr
Polevanov's ideas were in contradiction to the reform course but said he was
'new in the job'.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Upbeat Blair hails Labour as 'party of the people'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair yesterday hailed Labour's return to the mainstream of British
politics and claimed the government had 'run out of ideas'.
The Labour leader used an exceptionally upbeat new year message to launch a
blistering attack on the Conservative party's 'feeble' leadership and to
seek to capitalise on the cool response of Tory Eurosceptics to Mr John
Major's latest appeal for unity.
As Mr Jeremy Hanley, the Tory chairman, attempted to hit back, claiming
Labour was still 'rooted in the past', Mr Blair said the Conservatives were
'so obsessed with their own internal divisions' that they were incapable of
governing.
Labour was back as 'the people's party, back in the mainstream, speaking up
for the majority'. The Conservatives, meanwhile, were devoting their
energies to 'attacking us, misrepresenting our policies and attacking each
other'.
Meanwhile, despite the prime minister's call on Wednesday for an end to the
party's infighting over Europe, the battle with rebel MPs raged on.
Sir Teddy Taylor, MP for Southend East, who was among those suspended from
the parliamentary party for failing to support the government in a
confidence vote on Europe last month, said: 'The real tragedy is that the
parliamentary party appears to be out of touch with its supporters in the
constituencies and also with the majority of the general public.
'Mr Major could not only unite the party, but also have a much better chance
of winning if he would identify the real issues in Europe and take a
strongly Euro-sceptic line on them.'
Another Eurosceptic MP, Mr Tony Marlow, said it was up to Mr Major as leader
to prevent the party tearing itself apart. 'He knows the feelings of the
people, he knows the feelings of the Conservative party. It is up to him to
harness those feelings to the necessary policies,' Mr Marlow said.
But Mr Hanley dismissed the rebels, saying: 'There are nine MPs saying that
they're the only ones in step and that the 321 others are out of step.
That's a very small tail trying to wag a very big dog.'
Launching a Conservative document dismissing Mr Blair's so-called 'new'
Labour party as a 'cynical if elaborate exercise in public relations', Mr
Hanley said Labour was 'reactionary' in its opposition to privatisation and
industrial relations reform. 'Dogma still rules in the Labour party,' he
said.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, in his new year message,
warned that the European Union was 'in danger of dying'.
In contrast to his attack on the Conservatives, Mr Blair spoke warmly of the
prime minister's efforts to secure a lasting political settlement in
Northern Ireland.
He said the government deserved 'great credit' for its role in the peace
process in the province.
Mr Blair said Labour would aim to use the year ahead to draw up a new
constitution, stating in terms which 'cannot be misrepresented what we stand
for and how we intend to govern'.
The party would also accelerate its work on policy development in important
areas such as the economy, law and order and education.
It would seek to build on what he described as the 'stunning' growth in its
membership.
The party claims to have recruited an extra 56,000 party members since July,
taking its total membership to more than 300,000.
Mr Ashdown echoed Mr Blair's concern about the consequences of Tory
divisions, saying Britain was governed by a party 'so riven by civil war and
aflame with factionalism that it is incapable of governing effectively'.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Airbus clinches Dollars 1.8bn US order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Airbus Industrie, the European aerospace consortium, has won orders and
options for 40 aircraft worth an estimated Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.15bn)
from International Lease Finance Corporation, the California-based aircraft
leasing group.
The order, announced yesterday, is the biggest received by Airbus this year,
and reflects the improvement in the international aircraft market after the
sharp recession of the past few years.
An official at the four-nation Airbus consortium said: 'It confirms that
things are looking up, although there is still some way to go.'
The deal caps a much better year for Airbus in its fiercely competitive  -
and often acrimonious - battle with Boeing of the US for airline orders.
Before yesterday's announcement, Airbus had received more than 80 orders for
its airliners this year, compared with 38 in 1993.
The two aircraft manufacturers have always disputed market share figures.
But industry observers said they were running neck and neck in the number of
firm orders this year, demonstrating the inroads that Airbus has made on
Boeing's traditional dominance in the sector. Boeing has won 111 orders this
year, including seven for Air Berlin, the German charter operator, and one
for Lufthansa, announced just before Christmas.
ILFC is ordering 30 aircraft and taking an option for a further 10. The firm
orders include eight A319s, 13 A320s and nine A321s. The options comprise
three A319s, three A321s and four A320s.
All the aircraft have single aisles and are generally used for short and
medium-haul flights. Deliveries will run from February 1996 until the year
2000.
Mr Jean Pierson, managing director of Airbus, said the deal reflected the
confidence of ILFC in the single-aisle aircraft produced by the European
consortium.
ILFC, part of American International Group, the US insurance and financial
services group, is the world's largest aircraft leasing company after GPA,
the Irish aircraft leasing company rescued from collapse last year.
ILFC is the single largest customer of Airbus, which groups Aerospatiale of
France, Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) of Germany, British Aerospace and Casa of
Spain. It has 115 Airbus aircraft on order, while 40 others have already
been delivered.
But in recent years ILFC has also ordered about 300 Boeing aircraft, of
which about 180 are still to be delivered. No ILFC officials were available
for comment yesterday, but it is believed within the industry that ILFC may
be placing another big order with Boeing soon.
ATR, a joint venture between Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy, is
to sell five turboprop aircraft, worth an estimated total of Dollars 60m.

FT  30 DEC 94 / Macho managers are bad for health, say guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers should renounce the macho management style of the 1980s and
attempt to understand their employees' feelings, according to official
guidelines to be published early in the new year.
The Health and Safety Executive says many employers need to pay more
attention to their relationships with employees to prevent stress-related
ailments in the workplace.
The guidance is the first official health and safety advice to deal with
occupational stress.
'In the 1980s in this country, many employers shared the unfortunate
attitude that admitting to stress was admitting to a personal weakness,'
says the HSE.
'But we all have a threshold - even the tough guys have a threshold which,
when crossed, can become a negative factor. We want to promote the
preventive approach through education.
'There are certain features in the workplace that can aggravate stress, such
as noise and bad lighting. But a very important feature is having good
communications and a sympathetic approach.'
About 80m working days are lost every year because of stress, according to
Department of Health figures published at the Confederation of British
Industry conference last month. Mental health troubles, such as headaches,
irritability and indecision, are estimated to cost the UK economy Pounds
3.7bn annually.
The HSE guidance, mainly aimed at small to medium-sized businesses, comes
after a former social worker last month successfully sued his employer for
negligence over his heavy workload.
Mr John Walker was the first person in the UK to win an action against his
employers after his workload drove him to a nervous breakdown. Mr Walker is
now seeking Pounds 200,000 damages from Northumberland County Council.
Stress at work has risen alongside the fear of redundancy, according to a
survey of 426 private and public sector companies. Research by the
white-collar union MSF, published last week, showed that 43 per cent of
employees feel poorly treated by their employers.
The Institute of Personnel and Development recommends that managers develop
an occupational health strategy to deal with stress. In a study to be
published in February, the IPD advises employers to monitor stress levels
and counsel employees to cope with their work-load.
Mr Doug Gummery, policy adviser, said: 'Stress is a symptom of either a very
unhealthy organisation or a healthy one going through a period of rapid
change or growth, which must be managed properly if the organisation is
going to come through.'

<TEXT>
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo announced yesterday that as part of an
'emergency economic plan' to be implemented in January he had accepted the
resignation of Mr Jaime Serra Puche as finance minister.
Mr Serra will be replaced by Mr Guillermo Ortiz Martinez, minister of
communications and transport and former chief deputy to Mr Pedro Aspe at the
finance ministry during the presidency of Mr Carlos Salinas.
The emergency plan will seek to mitigate the negative effects on the economy
caused by the 29 per cent devaluation of the peso over the past two weeks
and the resulting financial crisis threatening the country.
In Washington, meanwhile, President Bill Clinton said he backed reform
efforts in Mexico and was looking into 'what we can do' to stabilise the
peso: 'It is something that I take seriously . . . We're talking to the
Mexican government about what we can do.'
Earlier in the day, the Mexican peso stabilised as investors were reassured
by reports that an emergency economic plan would receive backing from
leading industrial countries and international financial institutions.
Mexican reports suggested that the international backing might range from
approval from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations of Mr Zedillo's
proposals to funding of up to Dollars 10bn to ease fears over repayment
obligations.
A delegation from the International Monetary Fund arrived in Mexico City
late on Wednesday night and was reported to have met Mr Zedillo and Mr
Serra, who had been criticised for poor handling of the peso crisis.
In a speech long on explanations of why the devaluation was necessary and
short on details of what concrete economic measures will be taken next year,
Mr Zedillo said last night the new economic plan would include four main
elements: an accord between labour and business that 'prevents falling into
a race between devaluation and inflation'; a fiscal adjustment that would
reduce the country's dangerous current account deficit and imply an
important reduction in government spending; a series of measures to deepen
Mexico's structural reform and international competitiveness, including
further private participation in infrastructure development and ownership;
and the establishment of an international assistance fund 'large enough to
permit financial stability in the shortest time possible'.
At the close, the rate for the peso was 4.875 to the US dollar, slightly up
from Wednesday's close of 4.975, while the Mexican stock market was up 3.14
per cent. Mexican equities in New York continued a slow climb that began on
Wednesday.

FT  30 DEC 94 / World News in Brief: Copper price reaches six-year high
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Copper prices, already boosted by strong industrial demand, traded at their
highest level for nearly six years in London as speculative buyers took
advantage of thin end-of-year business to push the market above Dollars
3,000 a tonne. Prices touched Dollars 3,022, 2 per cent up from
pre-Christmas levels and the highest since April 1989, before closing at
Dollars 3,012, up Dollars 18. Demand is forecast to grow by more than 3 per
cent next year but copper stocks should fall because no new mine or refinery
output will be on stream until the second half of 1995. Commodities, Page 21

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
First Choice Holidays, the UK travel group, is in talks with German bank
Westdeutsche Landesbank, which has an indirect stake, that could lead to
boardroom changes.
Among options under consideration are the resignation from the First Choice
board of Mr Christopher Rodrigues, chief executive of Thomas Cook, which has
a 21 per cent stake in First Choice. He would be replaced by a director from
WestLB, which owns 90 per cent of Thomas Cook.
Mr Francis Baron, First Choice chief executive, has made no secret of his
desire to strengthen links with WestLB. The latest talks on boardroom
changes are seen as a means of developing the liaison.
Thomas Cook bought the stake in First Choice last year, helping it to fight
a hostile takeover bid from Airtours, a rival tour operator.
First Choice, known as Owners Abroad until August this year, had hoped the
link with Thomas Cook would enable it to make substantial savings through
co-operation with LTU, the German travel company 34 per cent-owned by
WestLB.
By October, however, relations with the German bank had been soured by a
succession of cancelled strategy meetings and the failure of planned joint
projects.
Few of the expected benefits of the link between First Choice and LTU had
been realised.
It is understood that the 'strategic alliance' has failed to win cost
savings through shared aircraft maintenance, fuel buying and spares
purchasing. Further, it has failed to give First Choice greater muscle in
booking holiday accommodation.
The part of the link which has so far proved successful is with the retail
side of Thomas Cook, which has delivered a significant amount of business.
However, some industry observers have said the link has hampered First
Choice's efforts to sell holidays through other agents.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Comalco, the Australian aluminium producer controlled by the CRA mining
group, is considering selling a 100 per cent holding in Commonwealth
Aluminium Corporation, its Kentucky-based aluminium products operation,
through a public flotation in the US.
The Australian company said yesterday it had filed a prospectus with the US
Securities and Exchange Commission, although it stressed it would not make a
final decision until February.
In the prospectus, Comalco said it was looking at selling 10m shares, with
underwriters' over-allotment options comprising a further 1.5m. The
indicated price is USDollars 23.75. Although there is no guarantee that this
will be the actual price at which the shares are sold, it indicates a
potential stock market valuation for CAC of about Dollars 270m.
Comalco acquired the US operations from Martin Marietta, the defence group,
almost a decade ago. CAC, which takes in aluminium rolling and recycling
facilities in Lewisport, Kentucky, has remained a separate entity within the
Comalco group of operations.
According to Comalco's last annual report, CAC made a small loss in 1993, in
spite of achieved record production and sales levels, with the latter figure
standing at ADollars 607.9m (USDollars 471.9m), up from ADollars 544m in the
previous year.
The deficit was blamed on overcapacity in the US rolled products market, and
in August this year, Comalco noted that its subsidiary had returned to
profit on the back of higher average selling prices and continued volume
increases.
Although it said that price increases at that stage had only covered the
increases in input metal costs, it suggested that market demand would remain
strong. A cold rolling plant upgrade, due for completion in early 1995,
should also expand capacity.
Shares in CRA, which is 49 per cent owned by RTZ of the UK, rose 34 cents to
ADollars 18.16 after its Hamersley Iron subsidiary said it had negotiated
price rises for iron ore supplied to Japanese steel mills for 1995-96, in
the annual round of contract negotiations.
Prices for lump ore will rise by 7.9 per cent to 35.89 US cents per dry long
ton unit. The price for fines by 5.8 per cent to 27.15 cents.

<TEXT>
Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan's second biggest sheet-glass manufacturer, and
Tomen trading company are to set up a glass-making enterprise in Vietnam, in
a joint venture with Viglacera, a Vietnamese state-run corporation, writes
Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo.
The new company, Vietnam Float Glass, will have an annual production
capacity of about 150,000 tonnes and will be capitalised at Dollars 42m.
Nippon Sheet Glass will have a majority 55 per cent stake, with Tomen taking
15 per cent and Viglacera 30 per cent.
The joint venture, which will start production in 1997, aims to meet an
expected growth in demand for float glass in Vietnam.
The country has one ordinary sheet glass manufacturing facility, and the new
venture will be the first to manufacture higher-grade float glass, for use
in building and housing construction and vehicle manufacture, Nippon Sheet
Glass said.
Estimated demand in Vietnam for sheet glass this year was about 70,000
tonnes compared with 1.5m tonnes in Japan.
The new company is aiming for revenues of Dollars 37m in the first year,
rising to Dollars 52m in three years.

Survivors of the Cormorant Alpha helicopter tragedy in the North Sea off
Britain and bereaved families may sue the Shell oil company for compensation
in the US, where awards are likely to be higher, a Texas court has ruled.
Eleven people died and six others survived when their helicopter plunged
into the sea during a short flight in appalling weather in March 1992. Shell
said: 'Until we have a chance to study this in detail it would not be
sensible for us to comment other than to reaffirm that we believe Scotland
to be the appropriate forum for the resolution of this matter.'

FT  29 DEC 94 / Procter wins painkiller fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, has won approval from a US
court to continue its aggressive attack on the Dollars 2.4bn-a-year US
market for painkillers. A district court judge in New Jersey ruled that
Procter &amp; Gamble was not engaged in misleading advertising for its new
non-prescription pain-reliever, called Aleve. Procter &amp; Gamble entered the
market for pain-relievers in June this year in partnership with Syntex, a US
drug company. It accompanied the launch of Aleve, an over-the-counter
version of the drug naproxen, with television advertisements suggesting that
the product was more effective than established products - notably Advil, an
ibuprofen-based pain reliever made by another US drug company, American Home
Products.
In August American Home Products filed a lawsuit against Procter &amp; Gamble
and Syntex seeking a preliminary injunction to stop the Aleve
advertisements, claiming they were misleading consumers with 'unwarranted
and unsubstantiated' claims. Among the most serious, it said, was the
suggestion that Aleve lasted longer than Advil because the dosing interval
was longer. Procter &amp; Gamble stood by its claims, and on Tuesday, a US
district court ruled that American Home Products had failed to prove that
the advertisements were false or misleading. Procter &amp; Gamble said yesterday
that it was 'pleased, though frankly not surprised' by the ruling. American
Home Products had no comment.

FT  29 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Mexican worries hit Lloyds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank shares were a clear feature with Lloyds, hit by peso weakness, standing
out against the general upward trend among the clearers.
Out of step with the rest of the clearing banks in what looks to be the
traditional rally ahead of the 1994 results season, Lloyds shed 8 to 558p in
2.8m turnover as the problems of the Mexican economy and currency continued
to hog the financial headlines.
Lloyds' connection with Mexico is not easy to define but among the UK banks
it is easily the most exposed to peso concern. Around a fifth of pre-tax
profits arise in Latin America, and the bank has sizeable Brazilian
associate, Banco Multiplic. However, speculation that the US government may
intervene in support of the peso underpinned the feeling among analysts that
the market had over-reacted.
In marked contrast, Barclays and NatWest added a penny to 615p and 517p
respectively while Royal Bank of Scotland advanced 6 to 401p and Bank of
Scotland gained 4 to 214p.
Among merchant banks, SG Warburg came in for a renewed spurt on the back of
a reviving takeover speculation, closing 9 higher at 693p, having touched
700 1/2 p at one stage during the day.
Technical trading was cited as the main reason for the advance in theme park
operator Euro Disney, which jumped 18 to 141p, to make it one of the day's
biggest gains in percentage terms, as traders reporting a short position in
the stock.
A hefty 3.8m was dealt in the shares in Paris where it is also quoted.
Dealers attributed the demand in France to comments by the chairman, Mr
Philippe Bourgignon, who said figures for the first quarter to December
showed a 'significant' rise on a year earlier.
Mr Nigel Reed, a close observer of Euro Disney suggested the rise was around
2.5 per cent and predicted a 12.5 per cent increase for the year to
September 1995. However, he reiterated his negative stance on the stock
saying, 'We believe this stock is still considerably overvalued.'
The post Christmas bounce for crude prices duly washed over into oil stocks
 -but only just. BP was the most active counter with the shares up a penny
at 431p in 4m turnover while Shell gained 7 to 704p and Burmah added 6 to
805p. Brent Blend climbed back above Dollars 16 in London yesterday in
response to Tuesday's rally for crude prices in New York. But dealers said
there was still no shortage of bearish stock levels stories in the sector,
courtesy of the continuing run of unseasonally mild European weather.
Strong selling of pharmaceuticals issues in New York on general
profit-taking reversed the early gains in London seen in the first half of
the session.
Wellcome was in demand early in the day. Its US subsidiary has received
approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to market Lamictal, an
anti-epileptic drug and Navelbine, which is used in the treatment of
advanced lung cancer. The shares initially firmed 2 before retreating to
finish 2 down at 703p, on the US selling. Glaxo relinquished 9 to 664p,
while SmithKline 'A' was unchanged at 466p. The same selling also weakened
ICI which left the shares trailing 7 at 763p.
Hopes of further bids among the regional electricity companies continued to
drive several stocks in the sector sharply forward. South West added 9 to
874p, while Yorkshire jumped 18 to 707p. Seeboard was also in demand and the
shares finished 15 ahead at 477p. Bid target Northern appreciated 4 to
1010p, and its bidder Trafalgar House edged a penny forward to 75p, in good
business of 7.2m
Optimism over trading during the festive season brought a cheer to several
retailing stocks. Boots put on 9 to 506p while Body Shop improved 9 to 191p.
Marks &amp; Spencer was 3 better at 398p. Electrical goods retailer Dixons
hardened 4 to 192p.
Telecommunications stocks continued to attract attention with both BT and
Cable and Wireless gained ground in what for the first working day after the
Christmas break was healthy volume. BT rose to 2 1/2 to 384 1/2 p and C&amp;W
put on 5 to 390p with the two shares combined turnover topping 5m.
Mobile phones group Vodafone put on 2 1/2 to 211p on hopes that the
all-important December quarter new subscriber figures (due next week) will
make bullish reading.

FT  29 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures moved ahead strongly from the outset with the FT-SE 100
March contract touching 3,143 at one stage during the morning session, but
activity remained seasonally low and investor enthusiasm drained away during
the final few hours of trading, writes Jeffrey Brown.
At the close of pit trading the March contract was 3,118, up 5 points on
last Friday's close but 25 points under the best of the day. The premium to
the cash market was 21 points while fair value ranged from 16 points to 20
points, according to estimates.
Most activity was concentrated into the first hour of trading with dealers
reporting good buying from the moment the market opened in the wake of Wall
Street's overnight gains. But later in the day as US markets weakened
sentiment came off the top. Goldman Sachs was said have been a relatively
heavy seller during the afternoon session. The day's contracts totalled just
under 3,000.
Stock option activity was also weak with 16,821 lots dealt. Puts comfortably
exceeding puts. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE activity accounted for more than 11,500
lots.
Business among individual options was thin with Cable and Wireless the most
actively traded stock, notching up 785 lots.
Tesco, HSBC and Wellcome all managed to exceed 500 lots.

FT  29 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie rallies but fails to conquer
3,100 barrier - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong overnight push from the New York market helped London to maintain
its recent rally and move smartly higher yesterday. However, London's early
26-point rise was achieved on slight volume and reflected technical factors
rather than fundamental confidence.
There was little in the way of solid news to latch on to, and profit-taking
later in the day saw the FT-SE 100 index of leading stocks end the day only
12.4 up at 3,095.8 while the mid-250 index closed 18.8 higher at 3,506.1.
Business was dominated by activity in the US. Wall Street had ended its
Tuesday trading session 28 points higher making a gain of around 50 points
since the London market last closed. That gave a lead to the UK equity
futures dealers who raised the price for the FT-SE 100 contract expiring in
March to 3,143, a jump of 160 points since the December contract expired a
fortnight ago.
It was only a matter of time before underlying equities followed suit and
after opening 6 points higher, the FT-SE 100 moved forward to break through
3,100.
There was an element of 'year end rally' in the rise but the bulk of the
upturn was traced back to some relatively weak housing data in the US, which
were interpreted as a sign that the recent rate rise there had taken effect.
The figures gave a lift to US Treasuries and, subsequently, gilts notched up
a quarter-point rise among longer dated maturities. Strength in the bond
markets spilled over into equities and at its peak the FT-SE 100 was up at
3,109.7.
There was broad confidence that yesterday's meeting between the chancellor
and the governor of the Bank of England would not lead to an interest rate
rise but fundamental support in the UK was, effectively, non-existent. The
Treasury's latest monthly report showing that inflationary pressures were
subdued contained no significant new information. And though the panel of
independent forecasters had reduced forecasts of inflation in 1995 to 2.9
per cent from 3.2 per cent, the beneficial aspects of low inflationary
expectations were countered by an Institute of Directors survey showing
decreasing confidence among business leaders.
A strong D-Mark made sterling look slightly more attractive but not enough
to enthuse placid fund managers who had carried out most of their end-year
adjustments by last week.
Then, in the afternoon, the Dow was hit by profit-taking and the Footsie
lost ground accordingly.
In fact, post Christmas torpor was arguably the most significant element of
the day and the gains were not reflected by a frenzy of activity. By mid
morning only 70m shares had changed hands and the closing total was a paltry
269.6m with 153.4m of that figure accounting for non-Footsie issues.
The figure compared with total turnover on Friday - the last trading day
before Christmas and traditionally one of the quietest days of the year - of
577.4m shares. Then the value of genuine customer business was Pounds 754.1m
which was around half that of recent levels.
Mr Ian Harnett, economist with SGST said: 'If we had held the 26-point gain
we might have seen some follow through buying but, as it is, I can't
envisage much activity. People have already positioned themselves for the
next long break.'
Dealers said that despite some buying from the hedge funds in the futures
market, retail business was virtually at a standstill. There was some
interest in the financial sectors and Lloyds Bank shares were sold on
nervousness over its involvement in Mexico.
Elsewhere, Euro Disney regained some of its value after the group announced
that attendances in the quarter to December had shown a big rise from a year
earlier.

FT  29 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow retreats as year-end
rally falters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
Stocks retreated from the gains of the past four sessions yesterday as Wall
Street's year-end rally stumbled, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 22.20 at 3,839.49.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 1.61 at 460.86, the
American Stock Exchange composite gained 0.25 to 429.62 and the Nasdaq
composite fell 3.73 to 742.46.
Trading volume on the NYSE came to 244m shares.
Analysts attributed yesterday's losses to profit-taking, but said movements
were exaggerated by the day's low volumes. Many were optimistic that the
late-blooming year-end rally, begun late last week, would continue through
the end of the year.
Upjohn shares closed down Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 30 1/8 after the company
announced it was stopping trials of a drug for head injuries after the
pharmaceuticals company found a higher death rate among trial participants
taking the medication. The announcement fuelled rumours that Upjohn might be
the subject of a takeover bid.
Toys R Us, down Dollars 3 1/8 at Dollars 30 1/8 , declined to discuss its
Christmas sales or comment on a lowering of the 1994 earnings estimate by a
US broker. The plan announced on Tuesday by Home Holdings to cease
underwriting and transfer some business to Zurich Insurance Group of
Switzerland, left the shares down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 9 7/8 .
Mexican and other Latin American ADRs, which had been depressed in the wake
of Mexico's currency crisis, bounced back as officials from that country
discussed the possibility that the US and Canada would extend a credit
facility to their southern neighbour. Telmex was up Dollars 3 3/4 at Dollars
41 1/2 , Vitro rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 13 3/8 , Compania Telefonos de
Chile rose Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 80 and Telefonica de Argentina gained
Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 50 7/8 .
Canada
Surging gold stocks masked a day of broadly-based losses for most stock
groups on the Toronto Stock Exchange today.
After a sharp rise at the opening that breached the 4200 mark, the TSE-300
drifted downward for most of the session, ending the day with a slight gain
in light trading.
The composite index added 8.32 points, or 0.20%, to 4201.52 with advances
over declines 359 to 312.
The gold group added a remarkable 5.22% as the New York spot price for gold
added 2 US dollars to USDollars 383.75.

FT  29 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexican stocks recover
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexican stocks closed up 2.67 per cent after a late surge - spurred by news
of discussions for a Dollars 10bn credit facility to stabilise the Mexican
economy - reversed earlier downward trends.
The bolsa had a highly volatile session with mixed trading until the market
received the positive news of discussions between the US, Canada and the
International Monetary Fund on an an emergency credit line.
Volatility, traders said, was caused by the recovery of the Mexican peso
against the dollar. Investors sold high-dollar revenue stocks and bought
into dollar-indebted companies as the burden became lighter with the peso's
gains.
The key IPC index closed up 60.82 points at 2,337.72.
Volume totalled a heavy 1.9bn new pesos on 134.9m traded.

FT  29 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa in a solid rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares made steady gains helped by a solid bullion price and portfolio
juggling ahead of the year-end.
The overall index rose 29.9 at 5,839.7, as mining and industrial shares
performed well. The industrial index made 30.8 to 6,963.0, and the gold
index rose 22.2 to 1,976.1.
Miners were the focus as gold tested the Dollars 382 resistence level. The
feeling was that, if the metal broke through, it could push to Dollars 385
next week.
In golds, Harties gained 50 cents to R18.75, and Vaal Reefs climbed R5 to
R362.

FT  29 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrage unwinding
erodes early gains in Nikkei
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Arbitrage unwinding and position covering eroded earlier gains posted on
buying for the first day of January settlements, and the Nikkei index
finally closed lower, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average closed down 45.83 to 19,665.53 after a low of
19,599.40 and a high of 19,813.91. A rise in the futures market in the
morning prompted arbitrage buying and purchases by traders, but gains were
eroded by afternoon selling.
Volume was 260m shares against 235.8m. Activity was led by dealers and
arbitrageurs, with individual investors trading in speculative issues.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 3.26 to 1,551.79, while the
Nikkei 300 index lost 0.68 to 285.24. Advances led declines by 478 to 474,

Nippon Soda, a chemical maker, rose Y26 to Y660. Investors were encouraged
by the company's contract with a US drug maker to supply Aids-related
materials.
Konica, the photo film maker, closed up Y13 at Y818. The company's 20 per
cent revenue growth of its new disposable cameras has supported its recent
price rise.

FT  29 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent takes its cue from
early US weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weakness on Wall Street lay behind the downturn in some markets during the
afternoon session.
Reviewing possible developments among European equity markets during the
first quarter of 1995, Hoare Govett commented that it expected a recovery,
'but returns are unlikely to be spectacular, despite this year's falls'.
The broker overweighted France and the Netherlands on a six-month view.
'Paris has underperformed consistently for the past two years ..(and)
although liquidity and politics argue against a near-term overweight
position, we feel that these factors are offset by the relatively more
defensive nature of the market, in view of the risk of negative earnings
surprises in Europe as a whole.' Regarding Amsterdam, Hoare was positive
because the market was broadly skewed towards sectors which it favoured,
namely consumer, services and financials.
Sweden and Italy were put on the underweight list, partly as a consequence
of having outperformed the European index in 1994.
FRANKFURT pushed higher, the DAX index closing the official session up 2.86
at 2,109.01, having moved in a narrow range of between 2,107.55 and
2,113.85.
But the market turned sour later, with the Ibis indicated index falling to
2,097.34. Turnover was DM3.5bn.
In a preview of prospects for the German equity market in 1995 Bank Julius
Bar said that the biggest danger remained the threat of further rises in US
interest rates. 'This will lead to repositioning from the equities market
into money market funds in the US and investment capital will be
repatriated. The German exchange should also suffer from this withdrawal of
liquidity in the first quarter. A more favourable trend is likely to set in
starting in the spring when reports from companies make clear that the
earnings trend is intact.'
Banks were stronger: Deutsche Bank gaining DM2.50 to DM726.50, Commerzbank
up DM2.00 to DM332.50, and Dresdner Bank putting on DM1.70 to DM406.70. The
chemical sector also gained narrowly: Bayer rose DM1.80 to DM361.60, BASF up
20 pfennings to DM318.00, and Hoechst DM2.00 to DM332.00.
AMSTERDAM gave up most of Tuesday's gains, with the AEX index down 3.15 at
414.81, after reaching a session high of 418.94.
Unilever, down 30 cents at Fl 206, said that it had reached an agreement
with Danone of France to buy its 60 per cent stake in a Spanish frozen foods
company. Unilever said that it would have full management control and that
the stake would eventually be increased.
ING, off Fl 1.00 at Fl 82.10, confirmed that it had not been invited for
talks on acquiring Hungary's state-owned Budapest Bank.
Rodamco fell Fl 1.30 to Fl 47.20 after the group said that it might drop its
optional tax free dividend next year.
PARIS was affected by the US story and the CAC-40 index fell 28.15 to
1,927.83, once again in very low turnover of FFr2bn. EuroDisney, up 20
centimes to FFr11.55, was heavily traded after confirming that attendances
were showing a steady improvement.
ZURICH ended lower in a quiet session. The SMI index lost 17.3 to 2,656.2.
Holderbank was affected by what brokers described as UK selling on worries
about its exposure in Mexico, the bearers falling SFr24 to SFr1,006 and the
registered SFr8 to SFr199.00.
Zurich Insurance bearers dipped SFr5 to SFr1,255 following Tuesday's
announcement of a co-operation deal with Sweden's Trygg-Hansa.
MILAN was pulled lower by profit-taking, leaving the Comit index down 3.59
at 634.09.
Smith New Court, issuing a long-term buy note on Fiat, off L135 to L5,960,
said that its valuation indicated a price target of between L6,800 and
L7,300, indicating a 20 to 25 per cent upside from current levels. Positive
factors for the car group included the strong advantage it derived from the
devaluation of the lira, its low industrial debt/equity ratio, the prospect
of new models and new markets boosting sales further, and the potential
disposal of some assets providing an additional boost to earnings and cash
flow.
On the negative side, SMC noted that being a market proxy - representing
some 8 per cent of the Comit index - the shares were affected by volatility
and political instability in the country.
STOCKHOLM saw the Affarsvarlden general index slip 10.9 to 1,463.1.
Ericsson, down SKr6 to SKr411, said that it had won an order for the
expansion of the mobile telephone network in Jiangsu province, China.
Trygg-Hansa B lost SKr0.50 to SKr80 following its announcement of a deal
with Zurich Insurance.
OSLO moved higher as the All-share index added 3.59 to 655 in high turnover
of NKr935m.
Brokers remarked that the activity arose from tax-related transactions -
investors were exchanging shares with full voting rights for shares with
limited voting rights in order to be able to write off their losses while
retaining their stakes in the companies.
Kvaerner A shares added NKr4 to NKr315, while its free shares closed NKr6 up
at NKr317 after it announced that its German shipyard had won a NKr650m
contract to build two container vessels.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Mexican peso recovers off recent record lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Higher interest rates and rumours of central bank support yesterday helped
the Mexican peso bounce back from record lows, writes Philip Gawith.
After losing nearly 40 per cent of its value over the previous week, closing
on Tuesday at 5.65 pesos to the dollar, it recovered yesterday to end at
4.975 on the spot market.
Helping the peso was the upward surge in interest rates. The primary rate on
28-day treasury bills rose by 15 percentage points from last week, to 31 per
cent, in the central bank's weekly auction.
There was speculation that Mexico had started to use the Dollars 6bn line of
credit extended to it by the US and Canada.
Trading conditions were very thin, contributing to some exaggerated market
movements. This was exemplified by the dollar's sharp downward spike in
early afternoon US trading. It fell three pfennigs to DM1.54, and nearly two
yen, to Y98.6, before bouncing back to DM1.5450 and Y99.
There was little evidence, however, of heavy volumes being traded, or of any
sustained downward move being underway.
The weaker dollar, and political worries, pulled sterling lower. The pound
finished at DM2.4309, from DM2.4385. In afternoon Wall St trading, it was at
DM2.4198.
Elsewhere, the Canadian dollar breached the CDollars 1.40 level against the
dollar to finish at CDollars 1.403, its lowest level since 1986.
The peso's recovery followed comments from Mr Larry Summers, US Treasury
under-secretary, that its fall was not warranted by economic fundamentals.
He said 'excessive depreciation' was not in anyone's interest. Mexico has a
currency swap line totalling nearly Dollars 7bn with the US and Canada.
Mr Summers said the US had confidence 'in the underlying soundness of
Mexican economic policies.' He said the US Treasury was in close contact
with Mexico and Canada about the situation in the currency markets.
Aside from higher Mexican interest rates, the other development touching on
the dollar was the publication of Japanese trade and current account figures
for November.
Japan's politically sensitive current account surplus rose in November by
15.4 per cent from a year earlier - the first rise since June. The size of
this surplus has been a continuing source of friction between the US and
Japan, and exerted downward pressure on the dollar over the year.
A Japanese ministry of finance official sought to downplay the figure,
saying Japan's trade surplus was still on a downtrend, both in yen and
dollar terms, though subject to monthly fluctuations.
One positive factor for the dollar was the continued recovery in the US bond
market. The yield on the 30-year treasury bond has recovered to 7.79 per
cent, having recently been as high as 8.15 per cent.
After starting in Europe around DM2.4390, sterling lost nearly two pfennigs
by the afternoon in New York. Mr Paul Downs, analyst at Technical Data in
London, attributed the pound's weakness to 'overseas lack of confidence in
the Conservative government.'
He said support at DM2.4250 was 'very significant', as a break below this
level could trigger stop-loss selling, leading to a decline to DM2.40.
On the other UK news of the day, the monthly monetary meeting, Mr Geoffrey
Dicks, UK economist at NatWest Markets, said he would be surprised if
interest rates were raised again this month. 'Our view is that another  1/2
per cent rate rise will come in February, prompted by the Bank's next
inflation report.'
The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 350m money market shortage, at
established rates, in its daily operations.
Traders said the weakness in the Canadian dollar was more a case of ongoing
market momentum, rather than any specific development. Despite reported Bank
of Canada support, the dollar breached the crucial CDollars 1.40 level
against the US dollar, to finish in London at CDollars 1.403 - its lowest
level since touching CDollars 1.45 in 1986. The Canadian dollar has been
weakening steadily since touching CDollars 1.12 in 1991.
Mr Jonathan Griggs, economic adviser at Barclays in London, said the Bank of
Canada seemed 'prepared to see a degree of currency weakness. It is not
prepared to raise rates to defend the currency.'

FT  29 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia 'to scrap oil export
quotas from January 1'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government will scrap oil export quotas soon and oblige
producers to supply up to 65 per cent of their crude oil output to domestic
refineries in the first quarter of next year, Interfax news agency said,
reports Reuters from Moscow.
It quoted Mr Andrei Dogayev, deputy foreign economic relations minister, as
saying that a resolution, due to take effect on January 1, had already been
'definitively agreed'.
Mr Dogayev said that crude oil and refined oil product exports would
continue to be regulated by tariffs and other methods.
The system of 'special exporters', under which all oil exports must go
through a limited number of approved companies, would be maintained, he
said, adding that 14 companies currently had the right to export crude oil.
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have opposed the special
exporter system and compulsory supplies to domestic consumers, linking
further credits to Russia to liberalisation of the oil export system.
Mr Dogayev doubted that the lifting of oil export quotas would lead to a
significant increase in exports at the expense of the domestic market. He
said that exports would be limited by demand factors and the capacity of oil
export pipelines.
Russian oil pipelines are reported to have been pumping at close to capacity
this year to the main export ports of Novorossiisk and Ventspils.
There is some unused capacity on the Druzhba pipeline route to eastern
Europe, but slumping demand there has curtailed deliveries in this
direction.
Last year's crude exports outside the former Soviet Union were about 80m
tonnes and officials say this year's figure will be more than 85m tonnes.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russian president, issued a decree in May abolishing
export quotas and licences from July. But he postponed putting the move into
effect until January amid widespread concern that producers would rush to
export and leave domestic enterprises without fuel. Domestic crude oil
prices are less than a third of world market levels.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India's jute industry heads
up-market - Kunal Bose on efforts to add more value to the hard fibre and to
find new outlets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India's jute industry is set to climb on the bandwagon of growing exports of
denim to the US and Europe. Soon, much of the coloured twilled cotton
material shipped from India will be blended with the hard fibre, taking it
up-market from traditional applications such as sacking and carpet-backing.
The incentive for using jute in denim is that it is by far the cheapest of
all natural and man-made fibres.
Funded jointly by the United Nations Development Programme and the Indian
federal government, the Ahmedabad Textile Industries Research Association,
in collaboration with the country's biggest manufacturer and exporter of
denim, has perfected the technology to blend cotton and jute. Denim,
according to industry officials, can take a jute content of up to 15 per
cent without in any way compromising the quality of the fabric.
While cotton/jute blended denim awaits commercial marketing, apparel fabrics
using a higher percentage of jute than in denim have been finding favour
with the garment manufacturers both inside and outside the country. Mr DJ
Wadhwa, managing director of Champdany Jute, which is in the forefront of
the diversification campaign, said recently that following 'the extension of
multi-fibre policy to jute and the launch of the Dollars 23m UNDP programme
for the jute sector with a matching grant from the federal government, the
Indian jute and textile research laboratories have established that jute
blends well with cotton, silk, wool, flax, viscose and polypropylene.
'What is equally significant is that the knowledge has been transferred to
jute and textile mills from the laboratory.'
After more than a century of producing sacks and heavy hessian fabrics, the
Indian jute industry was not easily persuaded to embrace new techniques and
products. Mr Bimal Pande, the country's jute commissioner, admits that 'it
is only recently that the industry has started thinking positively about
making new value-added jute products. Of the 73 jute mills, not more than 12
are making non-traditional products. What is, however, encouraging is that
the entrepreneurs from all over the country have started showing a keen
interest in making a variety of things using jute yarns and fabrics.'
Until about five years ago non-traditional products accounted for just 2 per
cent of India's jute goods output. Aided mainly by strong demand growth for
export grade yarn (considered a non-traditional item), the share of
value-added products in the industry's total production is now about 7 per
cent.
The rewards of further change could be great. While traditional items like
sacking bags fetch around Rs15,000 (Dollars 510) a tonne and hessian cloth
about Rs20,000 a tonne, the new jute products have price tags ranging from
Rs25,000 to Rs100,000 a tonne.
According to Mr Pande: 'A shift of 20 per cent of the industry's product mix
in favour of value-added products will result in an increase of 23 per cent
in sales turnover. But there are some products like blended yarn where the
realisation is five to six times higher than the traditional products. I am
expecting that by the turn of the century, the share of value-added products
in the industry's total production will be at least 20 per cent.'
The balance sheets of jute mill companies like Champdany, Cheviot, Delta,
Ludlow and Birla Jute, which have undertaken product diversification in
earnest will show that the 'profit margins in value added products are quite
attractive', says Mr Wadhwa.
Already, seeing the benefits accruing to these companies while facing
growing competition from synthetics, paper and bulk-handling systems in
jute's traditional stronghold in the packaging sector, other jute mills are
seriously thinking of product diversification.
The government, meanwhile, is sending out clear signals to the industry. In
the country's new liberalised business environment it cannot insist that
cement and fertiliser producers should use jute packaging; but it allows the
duty-free import of second-hand machinery and equipment for making
value-added jute products. The exporters of such products are also given a
10 per cent cash 'assistance' on the export value.
With jute spinning mills in Europe having virtually gone out of production
because of rising labour costs, plenty of second-hand machines are
available, and at bargain-basement prices, according to Mr Wadhwa who has
created a number of spinning units in West Bengal and Orissa with such
machines. Other Indian jute mill companies have done the same.
Jute yarn is considered the cheapest and best weft yarn for making machine
woven carpets. Of all the value-added items, jute yarn shows most promise.
However, India, a late entrant in the field, is a distant third to
Bangladesh and Thailand in the export of yarn. India's export of yarn
totalled 40,623 tonnes in 1993-94.
Industry officials estimate that world trade in jute yarn will exceed
250,000 tonnes in 1995, compared with the present level of around 200,000
tonnes.
A couple of factories equipped with imported second-hand machinery have been
producing jute and jute-blended pile carpets for the domestic and export
market. The installation of high-speed Sulzer and Dornier looms in jute
mills, with suitable modifications, has allowed the production of light jute
and jute-blended fabrics. These blended fabrics are used to make soft
luggage and shoe uppers.
A breakthrough in the dyeing and finishing of jute and the removal of
hairiness of jute fibre will make the new jute products more popular, says
Mr Pande. Jute is also being used to make non-textile products such as jute
particle board, a substitute for wood, high-quality paper and door panels
for automobiles.
As India does not grow enough high-quality fibre, the production of many of
the textile grade jute items has become dependent on the import of raw jute.
The annual requirement for superior grades of jute (TD-1 to TD-3) will be
1.8m bales of 180kg each, by 1996, compared with present domestic supply of
about 600,000 bales. An urgent priority for the UNDP-funded project,
therefore, is to raise the country's output of high-quality jute.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'China must calm fears of
mining investors'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's mining and metals sector requires Dollars 44bn of capital in the
years to 2000, according to the Chinese authorities, but other countries in
Asia, in Latin America and the Commonwealth of Independent States are also
competing hard for funds.
So China's chances of obtaining the necessary money 'will depend as much on
its ability to calm lender and investor worries as on the viability of any
particular project', suggests the MetalsFinance newsletter.
Foreign investors will be particularly concerned about details of the
regulatory climate in China, the rate of return allowed on investments and
stability in economic and industrial policy, it points out.
The Chinese authorities say that Dollars 30bn is required for 'capital
construction' in the mining and metals sector and another Dollars 14bn is
needed for 'technical improvements'. MetalsFinance suggests China will
increasingly seek innovative funding sources, particularly structured
financing packages, which, at their simplest, involve the forward sale of
future metal production to a finance house in return for pre-production
funds.
Foreign investment in China is expected by the newsletter to maintain its
concentration in the base metals sector, with copper and aluminium given top
priority, 'although the list of prospective investors in the gold mining
sector is growing. The influence of Asian investors in the country's metals
and steel sector is also expected to grow over time, leading to greater
regional integration,' the newsletter adds.

FT  29 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Strong copper contract leads base
metals higher - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Metal Exchange contracts yesterday reacted positively to a strong
copper market and pushed higher throughout the day.
COPPER's three months delivery position got to within Dollars 3 of the
Dollars 3,000-a-tonne barrier at one stage. Traders said trading conditions
were comparatively thin and would probably remain so until the new year.
'It does appear to be very thin on the floor,' said one. 'The markets are
looking bullish for next year, so people do not want to be caught short.'
The three months price eventually finished the after hours 'kerb' session at
Dollars 2,994 a tonne, up Dollars 29 from the pre-Christmas level.
The ALUMINIUM market was encouraged by the trend in copper and once
resistance above Dollars 1,950 a tonne was cleared prices were able to build
on last week's gains. Final business for three months delivery was at
Dollars 1,973 a tonne, the session high, up Dollars 35 gain from last
Friday. Traders thought a run-up towards Dollars 2,000 was feasible as
current thin conditions tended to exaggerate price moves.
The NICKEL market also moved sharply higher, again in light conditions, as
chart-based speculative buying lifted prices through intermediate resistance
levels.
At the London bullion market light two-way interest kept the GOLD price
within a narrow range of around 50 cents a troy ounce and traders expected
the market to continue in the same vein for the rest of the week unless
something out of the ordinary emerges.
'I don't think much will happen on the precious metals this week. . . it's
just a case of keeping an eye on Comex (the New York Commodity Exchange)
because you can never tell whether they will come up with something new,'
one dealer said.
COFFEE futures at the London Commodity Exchange ended a quiet session just
off the day's highs, mainly on buying linked to year-end book-squaring,
traders said.
'It's a pretty normal thin volume day. There's a lot of disinterest,' said
one trader as the March delivery contract closed Dollars 53 higher at
Dollars 2,848 a tonne.
Nearby positions in the COCOA market fell back as fears of supply tightness
eased following news that a substantial amount of beans had been graded for
delivery since Friday. The December contract was Pounds 25 down at Pounds
978 a tonne while March was down Pounds 8 at Pounds 985.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries fall in wake of dollar's
decline

US Treasury prices fell in the wake of a declining dollar yesterday in thin
trading.
Late in the session the 30-year government bond was down  7/8 at 96 3/32 ,
yielding 7.834 per cent and the two-year note down  1/16 to 99 19/32 ,
yielding 7.707 per cent.
At one point the yield spread between the two-year note and the long bond
narrowed to 6 basis points, fuelling speculation that it could turn negative
early next year.
German bunds lost early gains and ended lower after the Bundesbank issued
the first DM3bn tranche of the government's new year bond.
Market participants were disappointed by the 7.375 per cent coupon - lower
than the 7.5 per cent most had expected - and the pricing of the issue, and
dealers reported little demand.
Another tranche is due to be auctioned today, and in the absence of buyers
so close to year-end, the supply could weigh on prices, dealers said.
French bonds weakened in after-hours trading, dragged down by the decline in
bunds and a drop in the three-month Pibor futures contract.
UK gilts drifted higher in an uneventful session, slightly outperforming
their continental European counterparts. The March long gilt future closed
at 102 7/16, up  3/16.

FT  29 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: German insurer to raise
holding in AGF to 5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMB, the German insurance group, is planning to raise its stake in
Assurances Generales de France to 5 per cent and become part of a group of
stable shareholders when the French insurer is privatised, writes John
Ridding. The German company, which currently holds 2.57 per cent of AGF,
intends to raise its stake by the end of June next year even if its French
partner has still to be privatised at that date.
AGF is slated for sale by the French government. Its privatisation,
originally expected last autumn, has been delayed by the depressed state of
the bond market which has significantly reduced the company's value.
In addition to AMB, other likely core investors include Societe Generale and
Paribas, the French banking groups.

<TEXT>
Bank Austria, the country's largest bank, said its 1994 pre-tax profits
would fall by a quarter to Sch4.5bn (Dollars 405m) mainly because of poor
results from own-account trading, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. Trading
income would be down 64 per cent to Sch650m, as results from trading
securities, currencies, precious metals and derivatives were all below those
of 1993.
The bank has also faced sharply increased employee pension charges this
year, after changes in a scheme for most of its employees.
Provisions for bad debts would ease slightly to Sch3.9bn from Sch4.1bn, the
bank said and dividends would be at least maintained. Assets are expected to
reach Sch630bn, up 5.2 per cent from a year ago.

Portugal has raised Es19.4bn (Dollars 119.6m) from the privatisation of 19.5
per cent of Banco Fomento e Exterior, a trade and investment bank, in an
oversubscribed public offer on the Lisbon stock exchange, writes Peter Wise
in Lisbon. Discounted prices, dividend pledges and tax concessions proved
strong attractions for small domestic investors, making the sale a success
for the government's 'popular capitalism' programme. Interest from foreign
investors, however, was negligible.
Orders were placed for 33.3m shares, although only 15.6m were on offer.
Demand was particularly strong for a 3.4m share tranche reserved for small
investors at a discount of 8.5 per cent to the basic offer price of Es1,300
a share.
Domestic investors were also attracted by the promise of a 1995 dividend of
at least Es60, and by tax allowances that do not apply to non-residents.
Foreign investors bought only 0.63 per cent of the bank.

FT  29 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Credit Lyonnais chief sees
return to black in 1995

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned French bank, will make a profit in 1995
after heavy losses in 1993 and 1994, chairman Mr Jean Peyrelevade told
Europe 1 radio, writes John Ridding in Paris.
'The 1995 year will be better than 1994. Finally, we will manage to have
positive results,' he said, without giving details. The state-owned bank has
been implementing a significant restructuring programme aimed at curbing
losses which totalled FFr6.9bn (Dollars 1.27bn) last year. The programme has
included the sale of assets, including FNAC, the music and retail chain, and
a stake in one of France's mobile telephone operators.
Earlier this week, Credit Lyonnais announced that it had sold a 20 per cent
stake in Adidas, the German sports equipment company, for an undisclosed
sum. Prior to this sale, the bank said it had received almost FFr10bn from
asset sales, about half of the target it set for 1994 and 1995.
Credit Lyonnais is one of 21 companies slated for privatisation by the
centre-right government of prime minister Mr Edouard Balladur. Industry
observers say that a return to profit is a condition for privatisation, but
that the government may move quickly to implement a sale once the bank has
returned to the black and strengthened its balance sheet.

FT  29 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Revival in gilts set to
continue - Despite political concerns, prospects are bright / Outlook 95
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A dark and bruising year for investors in UK government bonds finally draws
to a close. The prospect for gilts next year looks a lot brighter but
political uncertainty could again cast a shadow over the market.
Concerns about the pace of economic growth, inflation and rising interest
rates will no doubt continue to dominate market sentiment. But further
displays of anti-inflationary zeal by the UK authorities, a more benign
international environment and proposed gilt market reforms promising greater
transparency and liquidity should support prices.
Gilts began this year in a positive mood, with the yield on the 10-year
benchmark bond at a low of 6.1 per cent in January. What happened next has
been well-documented - a turn upwards in US interest rates in February, the
unwinding of speculative bond positions by highly-leveraged funds and bond
investors fleeing the market at the prospect of rising inflation and higher
interest rates worldwide.
The US, much further advanced in the economic cycle, led the way. In spite
of much talk of 'decoupling', European countries, many barely out of
recession, followed suit. An explosion in German money supply growth added
to the jitters and the UK, with strong economic growth and a poor record on
inflation, was badly hit.
Gilt yields climbed to around 9 per cent by September. Part of this 300
basis point rise was due to the increase in real yields, attributable to
stronger economic growth: the yield on index-linked bonds rose by more than
100 basis points to 3.9 per cent in September.
The remainder was due to a rise in inflation expectations and a risk premium
associated with, for example, political uncertainty. The difference between
nominal and index-linked yields, a rough measure of inflation expectations,
jumped from 3.2 per cent at the turn of the year to 5.1 per cent by
September, while actual inflation averaged around 2.4 per cent - a clear
sign that the markets doubted the authorities' ability to keep inflation
under control.
Since the autumn, however, things have changed. There have been modest signs
of stability, as yields have fallen back to 8.5 per cent, and the proportion
of that yield due to inflation expectations has shrunk. The Treasury and the
Bank of England can take much of the credit, having promoted the
transparency of economic policy. They produce monthly inflation reports and
publish minutes of monthly meetings between the chancellor and the Bank
governor.
Most important, however, they have twice raised interest rates - in
September and in December - to leave base rates at 6.25 per cent. The rises
were well received by the markets as timely and aggressive moves to head off
inflation.
At last, it seems, gilt investors are beginning to believe the authorities
are committed to keeping inflation low. It was their reluctance to do so
that caused much of the this year's difficulties. 'Gradually, more and more
sceptics are being won over,' said Mr Ian Shepherdson of Midland Global
Markets. 'Next year is going to see a coming together of the actual economic
fundamentals and what the market perceives them to be - something which has
not happened this year.'
Mr Kevin Adams of BZW agrees: 'Hopefully, 1995 will be a year in which the
market begins to see that the authorities are operating in a pre-emptive
fashion to ensure inflation remains subdued.' He thinks next year will see a
flattening of the yield curve, with the spread between short and long
maturities narrowing to less than 100 basis points, and the spread against
German bund yields falling for a time to below 100 basis points.
He says that one crucial question for next year is the size of the UK output
gap - the difference between the actual growth rate in an economy and its
theoretical potential growth rate if all spare capacity were used. This will
determine how much longer the UK economy can grow at above-trend growth
before beginning to overheat.
The OECD estimates the gap at 4 per cent. With trend growth rate estimated
at around 2 1/2 per cent, this means the UK economy could have two to three
years to continue growing at a rate of around 3 1/2 per cent before
inflationary pressures begin to emerge.
Another boost to the gilt market next year is likely to come from an
improvement in government finances. This year's busy funding programme
weighed heavily on the gilt market early in the year, but the public sector
borrowing requirement is now expected to fall from Pounds 34.5bn in 1994-95
to Pounds 21.5bn in 1995-96.
Further good news should come from various structural reviews. A gilt 'repo'
market and a calendar for gilt auctions are being considered, both of which
would make the market more attractive to international investors. There is
also the possibility of legislation forcing pension funds to hold more gilts
rather than equities.
'This would provide a new boost for gilts from overseas flows,' said Mr Mark
Reckless of at SG Warburg, who estimates the impact could be 10 to 15 basis
points narrowing across the yield curve.
However, perhaps the overriding influence on gilts next year will be the
international environment. 'This should be supportive, particularly with the
US economy slowing and (US) interest rates near their peak,' said Mr Adams.
Others are more cautious. Mr Paul Cavalier of Lombard Odier said: 'Any
progress will be limited, with growth picking up across Europe and interest
rates heading upwards,' although there is the potential for the UK to
perform the best of the European markets.
Towards the end of next year, however, political concerns may begin to weigh
heavily on the gilt market as investors begin to worry that the government,
lagging in the opinion polls, will be tempted to cut taxes to engineer a
pre-election boom.
The signs are that the modest revival in gilts will continue, at least for
the first half of 1995. There will be no dramatic recovery. But if the
authorities do not convince the markets that they are prepared to be as
strict on fiscal policy as they are on monetary policy, then any progress
could easily be undone.

Topdanmark, the Danish insurance group, has resolved a serious debt
refinancing problem after changing its articles of association to give
shareholders greater influence, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen.
The group must repay debts totalling about DKr1.5bn (Dollars 242m) in 1995.
Attempts earlier this year to solve the financing problems were blocked by
Danish shareholders, who said they would not subscribe to a new share issue
until a system of one vote per shareholder was changed to one vote per share
held.
The voting change means large shareholders have agreed to support a DKr175m
share issue next year, Topdanmark said. The two biggest shareholders are
Eureko BV (an alliance between insurance companies in Sweden, the
Netherlands, Portugal, the UK and Denmark) with 30 per cent, and Tryg, the
Danish insurer, with 19 per cent.
The group is also in the process of completing arrangements to raise a new
DKr800m loan, while Top Insurance will pay a dividend of DKr300m to
Topdanmark, the group holding company, for 1994.

FT  29 DEC 94 / International Company News: Force for growth at Renault -
Obituary of Pierre Dreyfus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pierre Dreyfus, the former chairman of Renault who died on December 25 at
the age of 87, was one of France's most influential post-war industrialists
and a driving force behind the expansion of the state-owned motor company.
When Dreyfus took charge in 1955, Renault had an annual production of
200,000 vehicles. When he stepped down 20 years later the production lines
were delivering 1.4m vehicles a year.
Behind the numbers lay a series of innovative and successful products. The
Renault 4, Renault 16 and Renault 5 all left the drawing board during
Dreyfus' chairmanship. All achieved significant commercial success, with the
Renault 5, of which more than 5m were built, becoming Europe's best-selling
car in the early 1980s.
As Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault's current chairman, put it: 'Under Pierre
Dreyfus' chairmanship, Renault was to produce a series of models that would
count as some of the greatest successes of the European motor industry.'
Dreyfus was also behind international expansion in the company's sales. By
the time he bequeathed management of the company to his successor Mr Bernard
Vernier-Palliez, Renault was deriving half of its turnover from abroad. This
was achieved in spite of significant problems in the US in the late 1960s,
which ultimately led to Renault's withdrawal from the market.
As well as his industrial achievements at Renault, Dreyfus will be
remembered for his development of social policy and trade union relations at
the company. Following its nationalisation after the second world war,
Renault became a showcase of state ownership and a crucible of social
policy. Dreyfus was responsible for many of the achievements in that sphere
and for a series of innovations which became widely adopted throughout
French industry.
In particular, he introduced in 1955 the first collective bargaining pay
agreement at the company. In 1962, he announced the move to four weeks' paid
holiday a year.
During his tenure at Renault, the company was commonly referred to as 'a
shop window' for French industrial policy. At the centre of this description
lay the close management consultation with the communist-led union the
Confederation Generale du Travail.
The important role held by the unions, however, and the CGT in particular,
was to became a substantial obstacle to Renault after Dreyfus' departure.
During the late 1970s and 1980s a series of strikes and union opposition to
restructuring and efficiency measures were principal factors in the
company's decline into the red. Restructuring measures have now been
implemented, and Renault has joined the ranks of the world's most profitable
motor groups.
Dreyfus' achievements during his tenure at Renault drew the attention of
French political leaders and prompted a return to the political arena, where
he had started his career as a civil servant in the 1930s. In 1981 he was
appointed industry minister in the Socialist government of Mr Pierre Mauroy,
the prime minister, and was responsible for implementing the
administration's nationalisation programme.
Ironically, given Dreyfus' position as a champion of nationalised industry,
his death coincides with Renault's move towards the private sector. A
partial privatisation earlier this year is expected to be followed in 1995
by the end of state control.

Comalco, the Australian aluminium producer controlled by the CRA mining
group, is considering selling a 100 per cent holding in Commonwealth
Aluminium Corporation, its Kentucky-based aluminium products operation,
through a public flotation in the US.
The Australian company said yesterday it had filed a prospectus with the US
Securities and Exchange Commission, although it stressed it would not make a
final decision until February.
In the prospectus, Comalco said it was looking at selling 10m shares, with
underwriters' over-allotment options comprising a further 1.5m. The
indicated price is USDollars 23.75. Although there is no guarantee that this
will be the actual price at which the shares are sold, it indicates a
potential stock market valuation for CAC of about Dollars 270m.
Comalco acquired the US operations from Martin Marietta, the defence group,
almost a decade ago. CAC, which takes in aluminium rolling and recycling
facilities in Lewisport, Kentucky, has remained a separate entity within the
Comalco group of operations.
According to Comalco's last annual report, CAC made a small loss in 1993, in
spite of record production and sales levels.

FT  29 DEC 94 / International Company News: Nokia to sell aluminium division
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nokia, the world's second biggest maker of mobile telephones, has agreed to
sell Nokia Aluminium as part of a plan to focus the Finnish group on its
fast-growing telecommunications operations.
The unit, with annual sales of about FM300m (Dollars 62.8m), is to be bought
for FM130m by a consortium of Morgan Stanley Capital Partners (a division of
Morgan Stanley of the US), CapMan Capital Management (a Finnish investment
group) and the management of Nokia Aluminium.
The deal is one of the last steps in the three-year transformation of Nokia.
The company has evolved from a widely-spread and troubled industrial
conglomerate into a dynamic telecoms group showing strong sales and profits
growth, particularly in its mobile telephone division. Nokia is Europe's
leading manufacturer of mobile telephones and second only to Motorola of the
US in world markets.
In the first eight months of the year, group profits rose five-fold to
FM2.9bn, with sales up an underlying 40 per cent to FM18.2bn. A driving
force was a 64 per cent increase in mobile telephone sales to FM5bn.
The sale of Nokia Aluminium, which makes products such as lighting tracks
and cable channels, follows Nokia's recent disposal of its picture-tube
factory in Germany to Matsushita Electronics of Japan, and the FM1.4bn sale
of the energy supply unit to the Finnish power group Pohjolan Voima. It is
also floating off most of its 80 per cent stake in Nokia Tyres.
When these moves are complete, Nokia will consist of four core divisions:
telecommunications, supplying systems and equipment for telecom networks;
mobile telephones; consumer electronics; and cables and machinery. Nokia
Aluminium was part of the cables and machinery division, now weighted
towards the telecommunications industry.
Mr Tapio Hintikka, head of the cables and machinery division, said the sale
of Nokia Aluminium meant the divestment plan was fulfilled 'at least for the
time being'.
The main problem for Nokia is its consumer electronics division, which has
lost money in recent years. However, Mr Jorma Ollila, Nokia's chief
executive, has said the division will soon return to profit.

FT  29 DEC 94 / International Company News: SCA buys out share of US joint
venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCA, the Swedish forestry products group, yesterday moved to bolster its
leading position in the world market for adult incontinence products by
buying out the balance of a joint venture it set up with Scott Paper of the
US.
Molnlycke, an SCA subsidiary, is to acquire Scott's 50 per cent interest in
Scott Health Care, which the two companies set up in 1992.
The price of SKr400m (Dollars 43.4m) excludes Molnlycke's share of cash
balances worth about SKr100m.
Scott Health Care, which is based in Philadelphia, has annual sales of more
than Dollars 100m in the US and Canada for its adult incontinence and wound
care products. It is an important part of Molnlycke's operations in the
European and North American adult incontinence markets.
Developments in recent years in the manufacture of 'fluff products', or
absorbent cellulose materials, have made a big impact in the fiercely
competitive market for disposable baby nappies. However, another spin-off
has been in similar products for adult incontinents.
Mr Bo Feltner, Molnlycke's chief executive, said his company had captured
about a 20 per cent share of this market worldwide, with annual sales of
more than SKr4bn. While total sales of baby nappies are stable in developed
countries, sales of adult products are growing by up to 7 per cent a year.
Molnlycke recently ran into difficulties in the baby nappy sector, where its
products have been battling for market share in a price war with Procter &amp;
Gamble and Kimberly Clark.
Earlier this month, it announced a SKr1.3bn rationalisation programme to
improve competitiveness.

FT  29 DEC 94 / International Company News: Allianz, Berner complete
co-operation agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Allianz, Europe's largest insurance group, has consolidated its position
among the leaders in the Swiss market with the completion of a co-operation
pact with Berner Holding, one of the country's top 10 non-life insurers.
Berner also said the German insurer was seeking to raise its stake to 51 per
cent from 31.5 per cent. The Swiss group did not oppose such a move, but
said there was no agreement on how or when it would be done.
Last June, Allianz revealed it had acquired the 31.5 per cent stake through
stock market purchases, and was seeking a co-operation agreement.
Berner, which can prevent any shareholder from exercising more than 3 per
cent of the votes, said at the time that such an agreement would depend on
respect for its independence and maintenance of its share listing.
Yesterday, Berner said it had agreed to allow Allianz to vote its 31.5 per
cent stake. It added: 'We do not see any problem with 51 per cent.'
Coupled with Allianz's SFr2.2bn (Dollars 1.7bn) acquisition of Elvia in
September, the Berner move catapults the German group into third position in
the Swiss non-life market, after Zurich Insurance and Winterthur Insurance.
In the life area, it is probably in sixth position.
These moves are a dramatic example of a company exploiting the current
liberalisation of European insurance markets. Until a few months ago,
Allianz had only a small presence in the Swiss market, with only SFr268m in
premium income last year.
Although Switzerland is not a member of the European Union, it has been
liberalising its market in step with EU directives.
Its insurance market is large, with SFr30bn a year in premium income. The
Swiss spend SFr3,000 a head annually on insurance, more than anyone else in
the world.
Berner said it expected to strengthen significantly its position in the
Swiss market as a result of the co-operation pact. It hoped to use Allianz's
international network to offer its Swiss clients better global coverage and
service, and to benefit from Allianz's financial investment skills.
Another potential area of co-operation is reinsurance, with Berner having
access both to Allianz's own reinsurance division and to its 25 per
cent-owned affiliate, Munich Reinsurance.
In the Swiss non-life sector, Berner was ranked sixth last year, with
premium income of SFr738.2m. Elvia was fifth with premium income of
SFr1.3bn. Together, they would overtake La Baloise to occupy third position.
In life, Elvia was in seventh position with premium income of SFr720m and
Berner, 14th with SFr355m in premium income.

FT  29 DEC 94 / International Company News: Spanish telecoms licence goes to
Airtel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Airtel-ASR, a consortium backed by AirTouch of the US, British
Telecommunications and the domestic banking groups Banco Santander and Banco
Central Hispano (BCH), was yesterday awarded a licence to install a second
mobile network in competition with Telefonica, the government-controlled
telecoms operator.
The licence to develop a GSM (global system of mobile communications) system
requires heavy investment but holds out the promise of considerable income
from a mature telecoms market that has arrived late to the cellular
business.
Under the terms of the award, Airtel undertakes to offer nationwide GSM
digital facilities within five years. The installation of the mobile network
represents an initial investment cost of at least Pta100bn (Dollars 750.9m),
on top of the consortium's Pta85bn initial cash bid last month when it
entered the contest for the licence.
The government preferred Airtel's bid to the one entered by Cometa-SRM, a
consortium backed by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) and by Vodafone, the UK
cellular telephones group.
Cometa made a higher cash offer, of Pta89bn, but Airtel was understood to
have offered better guarantees covering industrial investment, job creation
and research and development.
Airtel's prize is a licence, as a second operator, to break into a mobile
telephony market forecast to have a turnover of Pta210bn and 2m users by
1998. Telefonica, which already operates an analog cellular telephone
network, expects to earn Pta40bn from 400,000 subscribers this year.
AirTouch has 15.8 per cent of Airtel; BT owns 6.3 per cent and Santander and
BCH share 27.4 per cent. Among the other shareholders are five regional
savings banks which jointly own a stake of 16.8 per cent.

Bank of New York is to buy the American Depositary Receipt (ADR) business of
Bank of America, in a deal that cements its position as the leading ADR bank
in the US.
ADRs are baskets of shares of foreign companies denominated in dollars and
held on deposit at US banks. They make it easy for foreign companies to sell
their stock to US investors.
In recent years their popularity has grown, as US investors have bought more
foreign shares in an attempt to diversify their portfolios and participate
in the rapid growth of many non-US equities markets.
Under the agreement, Bank of New York will buy from Bank of America some 90
ADRs of companies from Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Singapore
and the UK.

FT  29 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Dominating a niche market - 1994 has seen
Inspec catapulted into the world league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a remote corner of Kansas, a small British chemicals company has hit on a
formula which has enabled it to defy the twin pressures of raw material
price increases and sluggish demand.
While margins have been squeezed for almost every maker of speciality
chemicals - used in products such as washing powder and paint - Inspec has
emerged as an unexpected star of the sector, with a forward price/earnings
multiple of 19.5, second only to ICI.
The company, floated at 160p in March this year, has found itself in that
enviable position by dominating the market for some highly specialised
products that command premium prices.
Its UK operations have been sustained by its role as the leading European
supplier of niche products in such areas as synthetic lubricants and
ingredients for fragrances. But it is in North America that it has begun to
enjoy margins which are the envy of the sector.
Concerned that rivals could try to pick off its customers, Mr John
Hollowood, chairman, is coy about the figures.
Sitting in the offices of Allco, the group's main US subsidiary near Galena
in Kansas, he says obliquely: 'At the end of the day, this business makes
quite a lot of money. It's been a find in every respect with a large market
presence and good margins in a niche market.'
All he will admit is that Allco - a former explosives manufacturer - has
improved its position since this time last year when Inspec paid Lenzing,
the Austrian chemicals group, Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.8m) for the business.
It enjoyed operating margins last year of 36 per cent, and industry analysts
believe the figure is now closer to 40 per cent.
Its profits - totalling Dollars 4m on sales of Dollars 11.2m last year  -
depend on two main products: BTDA, a basic component in fire resistant foams
and fibres, and PMA, the intermediate chemical for use in powder coatings.
Their share of the world market exceeds 90 per cent, a position which Inspec
has exploited by cutting costs and seeking multiple applications. In August,
it further enhanced its US presence by acquiring Imitech, one of Allco's
main customers, for Dollars 17.3m.
Imitech is the world's sole maker of polyimide foam - used mostly in
insulating naval vessels and aircraft fuselages - and therefore commands
gross margins estimated by City analysts at 70 per cent.
Although Inspec still derives most of its profits from its two UK plants -
inherited from a buy-out of BP's fine chemicals business - most analysts
expect the US arm to play an increasingly important role.
The outperformance of the shares reflects the opinion among investors that
Inspec's management got to this position by design rather than luck.
After looking at hundreds of potential acquisitions, a buy-out team led by
Mr Hollowood persuaded BP to sell its well equipped fine chemicals business
just when the conglomerate was looking to generate cash; and they then
picked up the two US plants from companies keen to concentrate on core
activities.
By going for margin rather than mass volume, it has also cornered part of
the market where other manufacturers apparently consider it too costly or
complex to set up rival plants. 'There will come a time when we face serious
challenges,' says Mr Hollowood. 'We will have to be defensive about it, even
though it would not be easy for a rival to compete.'
Inspec says it is now ready to expand its activities in North America and
Europe. 'We are looking at at least one company a month, and we'd be
prepared to spend up to Pounds 100m,' says Mr Jim Ratcliffe, chief
executive.
Although the Imitech deal pushed gearing above 100 per cent, the former
Courtaulds executive claims interest cover of 13 times would enable it to
use debt for further purchases.
Even with robust interest cover, however, the group's lenders may be
reluctant to endorse further large deals while it remains dependent on
relatively few customers.
Imitech, in particular, relies on the US Navy for half its orders; while
there is just one large customer for Allco's PMA: an international chemicals
group which uses the ingredient to make epoxy hardeners.
To counter that dependence, the group has extended its UK manufacturing of
hydroxy monomers, the reactive chemical ingredient used mainly by paint
manufacturers, and begun seeking new applications for polyimide foams.
It aims to sell these foams to manufacturers of such products as storage
heaters and soft furnishings, while exploiting demand for heat resistant
insulation from civil aircraft manufacturers.
The company is also investing some Pounds 8m to increase output from its UK
and US plants, currently running at about 80 per cent capacity. By
increasing output and tying new customers into long-term contracts, it
should be able to protect its market share and generate enough cash for
acquisitions without pushing gearing too much higher.

FT  29 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Higher orders boost Mackie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Mackie International rose 12p to 214p yesterday after the
Belfast-based precision engineering group announced sharply increased orders
for its textile machinery and environmental controls equipment.
The company, whose September flotation on the Unlisted Securities Market was
hailed as a sign of growing business confidence in Northern Ireland
following the IRA ceasefire, said it had won orders worth Pounds 9m - almost
matching its total first half sales.
Mr Pat Dougan, chief executive and holder of 20 per cent of the equity, said
the orders would both boost sales and secure the jobs of the group's 380
workers.
'We will press ahead with an Pounds 8m project to install new equipment,
which could lead to another 50 jobs,' he said.
The announcement was welcomed in west Belfast, the UK's worst unemployment
blackspot, where Mackie is the only surviving precision engineering group.
'The company looked as though it was on the way out a few years ago, but it
has been turned round successfully,' said Mr Joe Hendron, MP for west
Belfast.
In the two years to 1991, sales dropped from Pounds 30m to Pounds 6m before
the Northern Ireland Office helped rescue the company and appointed Mr
Dougan.
The upturn in orders is expected to push pre-tax profits up to Pounds 3.5m
on sales of about Pounds 30m next year, against forecasts this year of
Pounds 1.9m profits and turnover of Pounds 19m.

FT  29 DEC 94 / UK Company News: 1994: a year of deceleration - Hickson's
'annus horribilis' and its recovery hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hickson International is stepping up its search for new customers following
an annus horribilis in which the speciality chemicals company has been hit
by soap wars, underperforming subsidiaries and a series of industrial
accidents.
Mr Dennis Kerrison, chief executive, will be glad to see the back of 1994: a
year that has seen a profits warning and the prospect of an empty plant
following Unilever's decision to stop buying manganese catalyst, the
controversial ingredient in Persil Power and other detergents.
'We've been hit hard and it could be 1997 before we see sizeable profits
growth.'
Although he admits that Hickson's reputation has been tarnished by accidents
and its failure to deal quickly with operating problems in the US, he
singles out one overriding cause for the malaise - damaged laundry.
When Hickson secured the contract for Unilever's new range of dirt-busting
detergents, it enjoyed a rampant share price which touched 225p earlier this
year. But claims that its manganese 'accelerator' left clothes holed and
faded helped send it into freefall.
As the criticism mounted, Hickson started drawing up contingency plans for
PharmaChem, the subsidiary which depended solely on the Unilever contract.
At one stage, the shares fell to 106p and industry analysts voiced serious
concerns about the company's strategy.
Hickson was forced on to the back foot primarily by Unilever's
procrastination. 'Unilever was in complete disarray and they kept asking for
more time before telling Hickson if they would be taking up their orders,'
according to one industry insider.
There was, therefore, almost tangible relief at the chemical company's West
Yorkshire headquarters when Unilever announced its decision to stop
purchasing further supplies of the accelerator. It ended some of the
uncertainty over the future of PharmaChem; cleared the way for compensation
payments - still under negotiation; and enabled Hickson to pursue new
business.
The company was at least prepared for the worst. Even when it was still tied
to the Unilever contract, a team was set up to explore alternative uses for
CB1, the PharmaChem plant where the accelerator was manufactured.
It has picked up orders from two large pharmaceutical companies, yet to be
named, and aims to develop existing businesses with customers such as Merck
and Wellcome.
'If we had waited four months before doing anything, we'd be looking at a
black hole now. We've avoided that,' says Mr Kerrison.
The shares have recovered a little, closing unchanged yesterday at 122p, and
City analysts believe there is potential for a long-term revival.
'The company is now looking quite attractive as an investment and, if the
management sticks to its aims, the outlook could be reasonably bright,' says
Mr Martin Evans of Hoare Govett.
Nevertheless, most analysts have cut their profits forecasts from a top
range of Pounds 28m to between Pounds 21m and Pounds 23m this year, with no
pick up likely in the near future.
Some are also talking of a possible bid for the group which, with its
revival prospects and undemanding forward multiple of 13, could prove a
worthwhile acquisition for some of its big rivals.
But reviving Hickson will not happen rapidly. New orders for the PharmaChem
plant will have little effect on 1995 profits, and the group still faces
rebuilding costs of Pounds 25m on CB2, PharmaChem's other plant, which was
devastated by a fire last year.
Some of its overseas sites may be closed or merged, and raw material price
increases have forced a rationalisation costing Pounds 4.5m this year.
'We paid the price for developing a product for one big customer who got it
wrong in the market place,' says Mr Kerrison. 'But all the bad news we know
of is over. Now we must put something on the bottom line for shareholders.'

FT  29 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Stanhope still trying to avoid receivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stanhope, the property developer headed by Mr Stuart Lipton, yesterday
resumed its efforts to avoid receivership six days after its banks decided
not to renew its credit facilities.
Last Thursday 16 banks, led by Barclays, voted not to extend further credit
and asked for repayment of loans totalling about Pounds 148m.
Sources close to the company admitted yesterday that Stanhope had been in
limbo since its bank facility expired, but said the company would not call
in the receivers while it thought a deal could be struck with the banks.
Rescue proposals from British Land, the property investment company, and
from PosTel, the post and telecommunications pension fund, were rejected by
the banks last week. However, Stanhope resumed talks with British Land last
Friday in an attempt to find a solution.

FT  29 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Goldsmiths perks stores sector with strong
sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The post-Christmas round of retailers' trading statements began well
yesterday with news from Goldsmiths, the jewellers, of a 19 per cent
increase in total sales and a 12 per cent like-for-like rise in the month to
December 24.
Shares in Goldsmiths, which has 117 branches in the UK trading under names
such as Walker &amp; Hall and Northern Goldsmiths, gained 6p to 133p.
The statement, coupled with reports of a strong start to the post-Christmas
sales across the UK, gave a boost to the stores sector, which had fared
badly in December amid fears of poor trading.
Goldsmiths said total sales for the 11 months to December 24 were up 13.3
per cent, and like-for-like sales, which exclude new store openings,
increased 11.4 per cent.
However, Mr Jurek Piasecki, chairman and chief executive, said he believed
the sales increases were due more to improvements in Goldsmiths' business
and changes in the jewellery market than to any improvement in consumer
confidence.
'I don't think any of it is a reflection of underlying confidence. Things
are still very sticky,' he said. 'People are still concerned that interest
rates are going to go through the roof.'
Mr Piasecki said Goldsmiths had gained market share through investing in
systems and improving its product range, while the number of jewellery
outlets in the UK had fallen by more than one third in the past 10 years.

FT  29 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Unilever makes Spanish frozen foods
purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, yesterday agreed to buy
60 per cent of a Spanish frozen food company from Danone, France's largest
food group.
Danone said that Frudesa, a leading frozen vegetable and fish group, did not
fit into its strategy of concentrating on ready-to-serve meals.
Neither company would give any financial details of the transaction,
although Unilever said the deal would be financed partly from internal funds
and partly from loans. It also intends to increase its stake in the future.
Unilever will take full management control of Frudesa, which had sales of
Pounds 110m this year and employs 1,200 people. The group said the Spanish
market offered good growth prospects as Spanish consumption of frozen food
was below the European average.
Frudesa was transferred to Danone following the merger of its ready-to-serve
food business with that of Saint Louis last spring, creating the third
biggest European company in the sector.
Danone has a Spanish ready-to-serve offshoot, Pycasa, which leads the
market. Danone is also in the process of acquiring 100 per cent of Gelax, an
Italian group specialising in value-added frozen products.

Wellcome, the drugs group, yesterday predicted it would win a larger share
of the US market - the world's largest - following approval of two products
by the Food and Drug Administration.
The company welcomed the decision to approve Lamictal, its anti-epilepsy
treatment, and Navelbine, which it claimed would be the first new cancer
drug in the US for 20 years. Both products will be marketed by Burroughs
Wellcome, its US arm.
The potential market for Navelbine is estimated at Dollars 100m (Pounds 64m)
a year. Lamictal is expected to win a sizeable share of sales in North
America. The world market for such drugs is put at Pounds 1bn.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stanelco, the USM-traded thermal processing equipment group, saw pre-tax
losses narrow to Pounds 47,000 in the six months to August 31.
The outcome, which compared with losses of Pounds 84,000 last time and
Pounds 160,000 for the full year, came from turnover static at Pounds
631,000 and after exceptionals of Pounds 1,000 (Pounds 15,000).
Directors said that the group's order book stood at Pounds 383,000 at the
period end, up from Pounds 244,000 at the start of the year. It continues to
'search actively' for acquisitions.
Losses per share were unchanged at 0.01p.

FT  29 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Fisons downgraded by IBCA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IBCA, the European rating agency, has downgraded the long term rating of
Fisons, the drugs and scientific equipment company, from BBB+ to BBB. The
short term rating remains unchanged at A2.
IBCA said that Fisons' profits warnings with the interim results announced
in September, came after four years of deteriorating income coverage ratios.
'With only limited cash generated by operations, it is difficult to see
where long term support for the large capital and R&amp;D expenditure will come
from, although in the short term further disposals could be made,' IBCA
said.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Putting sales in a spin after costs squeeze: Andrew Baxter
sees Whirlpool's European white goods strategy enter a new cycle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like an old-fashioned mangle squeezing clothes dry, Whirlpool is coaxing
extra profits and productivity out of the former Philips white goods
business. The US domestic appliances maker completed the two-stage Dollars
1.1bn (Pounds 700m) purchase of its Dutch rival's operations in the sector
in 1991.
By the end of the first quarter of 1995, Whirlpool Europe executives at
Comerio in northern Italy will have completed detailed discussions with
unions and staff on shedding about 2,000 of the company's 13,000 employees.
A cut of this size smacks of a company in trouble. In fact, the plan
announced in November is the next logical step in a relentless drive to
transform the inefficient, underperforming business which Michigan-based
Whirlpool inherited from the Dutch electronics and electrical group.
The aim is to raise Whirlpool Europe's profitability to levels achieved by
its sister business in North America, secure its future in the highly
competitive European white goods market, and advance Whirlpool's long-term
strategy in an industry where the big players are increasingly thinking
global.
But Mr Ivan Menezes, Whirlpool Europe's vice-president for group marketing,
stresses the changes are not about 'going in and slashing out costs. The
emphasis is very much on how we go to market, clearly recognising we needed
to be far more efficient.' Whirlpool executives see themselves as leading
the battle to close what Mr Menezes calls the 'value gap' between Europe and
US, to give European consumers a better deal.
Because of Europe's fragmented industry, and big national differences
between products, Whirlpool estimates it took an average 7.7 days of
household income in 1992 to buy a dishwasher in Europe, against just 3.8
days for a comparable machine in the US.
Over the past two years, phase one of the process has focused on the big
items in Whirlpool Europe's cost structure - products, manufacturing and
materials and components supply.
The result mirrors the transformation at Electrolux, the Swedish-based
European market leader - a pan-European production base created out of
former national centres, and a big, continuing product-renewal programme
based on brands to suit customers with different pockets.
Employment at Whirlpool Europe has fallen from 16,000 in 1991, partly
because of a sharp reduction in indirect workers, the spin-off of compressor
production and the sale of a factory in Barcelona. Organic growth and
acquisitions in central Europe offset some of the reductions.
The changes, coupled with much tighter management of working capital, are
already showing through in improved financial results. Profits before tax
and interest rose from Dollars 92m in 1990 to Dollars 123m in 1993 as sales
hovered between Dollars 2.16bn and a peak of Dollars 2.46bn in 1992. Market
share in Europe has risen from 11.5 to 12.5 per cent.
The rise in profits has come in spite of industry-wide declines in retail
prices of 2-3 per cent a year, restructuring costs and heavy promotional
costs incurred by Whirlpool to establish its name in Europe. The Philips
name, which disappeared first from appliances in the Dutch market, will be
dropped in the last two markets, France and Germany, early in 1995.
Now comes phase two. After a two-year investigation, Whirlpool is replacing
its traditional country-based sales organisations with two pan-European
sales organisations based around the two big 'trade channel' groupings for
white goods - built-in and free-standing equipment.
Mr Jeff Fettig, president of Whirlpool Europe, says these support activities
are typically conducted in Europe with 'fragmented infrastructures,
inconsistent business processes and service levels'. The aim is for them to
be 'consolidated, re-engineered and standardised across borders'. Each
European country used to have its own sales force, trade marketing, order
processing and back office support, but while trade channels are evolving at
varying paces in the countries, Mr Menezes says the investigation showed
that 'channels across borders have a lot more in common than different
channels within a country'.
Two multiple retail chains in France and the UK, for example, would have
much more in common than either would have with a neighbouring small
independent retailer, or a kitchen boutique. And as the 'winning channels' -
big retail chains - form links across borders, Whirlpool needs a matching
structure so that it can manage the relationship more effectively. 'Our
analysis was done before the Kingfisher/Darty deal,' says Mr Menezes of last
year's takeover by the UK retailer of the French electrical store group. 'We
had predicted those kind of alliances would continue.'
The shake-up is also intended to address a competitive issue peculiar to
Whirlpool in Europe. 'We cannot win the game in Europe by competing on a
country-by-country basis,' says Mr Menezes. 'Whether it be Hotpoint in the
UK, Thomson in France or Bosch-Siemens in Germany, we have competitors who
are much larger than us in each of those markets, and so will always beat us
on selling and administration costs.'
The solution, he says, is for Whirlpool to take the advantage of its
European size and scale to each local market, enabling it to beat a strong,
entrenched national competitor. A key element in the shake-up, therefore, is
increased regionalisation and centralisation of back office and support
services. Transaction and processing activities will be moved into regional
centres, and one centre will be set up to handle administration of payables
and other accounting matters. Several sites are being evaluated, says Mr
Glen Walker, Whirlpool Europe's chief financial officer.
The changes will be completed next year, and will save Dollars 80m, on an
annualised basis, that will be spent elsewhere, for example on advertising.
Mr David Newkirk, a consultant at Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton who has been working
with Whirlpool since 1991, sees the restructuring as a 'very keen two-edged
sword. It cuts out the last pocket of tricky cost, but more than that it
creates an organisation with much greater control of the products and the
channels'.
A lower cost base will help Whirlpool Europe address what Mr Menezes sees as
the biggest challenge for it and the industry in 1995. Double-digit
increases in raw material prices forced Whirlpool Europe to raise its own
prices in the third quarter, but the picture has worsened since then, he
says. 'Outrageous' price increases of 20-30 per cent are being sought for
some grades of steel, he says, and suppliers of other raw materials - and
component suppliers using them - are also seeking big increases.
'The number one challenge will be in recovering these cost increases', he
says. This could mean 'high single-digit increases, and in some cases
double-digit increases' in Whirlpool Europe's selling prices.
Further globalisation across Whirlpool as a whole, and new programmes in
Europe to increase brand loyalty among customers - a perennial problem for
the white goods industry - are likely.
But achieving parity with Whirlpool in the US on operating margins is
'absolutely achievable' without moving to this next stage, Mr Menezes says.
'We are two or three points off at present, and are making progress. We have
always maintained that we can do it.'

FT  29 DEC 94 / Goldman Sachs falls to fifth place in underwriting table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A difficult 1994 for Goldman Sachs will end on a suitably downbeat note this
week with the publication of annual rankings showing that the investment
bank slipped from second to fifth place among Wall Street firms underwriting
debt securities.
According to the preliminary results released by the financial information
company Securities Data, Goldman was the fifth largest underwriter of debt
securities this year, with a total of about Dollars 53bn (Pounds 34bn). In
1993, Goldman ranked second with Dollars 108bn.
The sharp drop in underwriting business contrasted with some of the firms
ranked above Goldman, which saw much smaller declines in volume. Merrill
Lynch again ranked first with Dollars 102bn (compared with Dollars 145bn in
1993), Lehman Brothers moved up one position to second with Dollars 70.4bn
(Dollars 103bn), and CS First Boston jumped three places to third with
Dollars 70bn (Dollars 82bn).
The slide in its underwriting position is just the latest setback for
Goldman, which has been hit hard by the contraction in US capital markets.
Its earnings are reported to have dropped 80 per cent to about Dollars 500m
in fiscal 1994, a bigger decline than recorded by most of its main
competitors.
Goldman has suffered from a larger-than-usual number of retirements among
its partners, who provide the bulk of the privately owned firm's capital.
The departure of many top executives was linked to the poor earnings
performance and to an erosion of Goldman's famously close-knit corporate
culture. In recent weeks, the firm has announced plans for a series of big
lay-offs among staff in an attempt to cut costs and improve its results.
While analysts say the big fall in earnings at Goldman was primarily
attributable to rising costs and losses on bond market trading, they are not
so sure why the firm's underwriting business declined so sharply. One
possible explanation may be found in a survey of senior US corporate
executives by Financial World magazine, which found that although Goldman
still ranked as the most highly-respected securities firm on Wall Street, it
was also rated as the firm where service had declined the most.
All news has not been bad for Goldman. It has scored some notable successes
in other areas, notably in the underwriting of non-US securities. Last
month, it won the much-prized position of global co-ordinator in the
privatisation of Deutsche Telekom.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Pentos forces Athena into receivership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pentos, the specialist retail group, yesterday forced one of its
subsidiaries, Athena Holdings, into administrative receivership.
Mr Bill McGrath, chief executive of Pentos, decided it was impossible to
stem the losses at Athena, which sells greeting cards and posters in 157 UK
stores, and took the rare step of withholding further funds.
Directors of Athena Holdings, which lost an estimated Pounds 5m before
exceptional items on sales of Pounds 16.2m in the six months to July 2, then
called in accountants Grant Thornton as receivers.
'We couldn't give it (Athena) away,' said Mr McGrath, who was given the task
of restructuring Pentos after the removal of its founding chairman, Mr Terry
Maher. Mr McGrath said the decision to force Athena into receivership was
not taken lightly. He believed it would have taken a further Pounds
9m-Pounds 12m to take Athena to break-even and that the money would be
better invested in Pentos's other businesses. These operations - the
booksellers Dillons, the Ryman stationery shops, Athena North America and
Pentos Office Furniture - will continue to trade normally.
Mr Maher last night described the decision as 'devastating news' for Pentos.
'I don't believe it is possible for a public company to ring-fence its
subsidiaries in this way,' he said, warning that there was a danger of
relationships between suppliers and other subsidiaries being affected.
The main creditors are likely to be the shop landlords and Cartel, the new
name for Athena International, which left Pentos through a management
buy-out and was its main supplier.
Mr Scott Barnes of Grant Thornton said he hoped to discover over the next
few days which stores would be viable in the medium to long term. Until
then, all stores would trade normally. Twenty-seven stores are operated
under franchises. A total of 600 people are employed by Athena, mainly in
the shops.
Many of the shops will not be viable because the rents are much higher than
could be supported by likely revenues, although in the last week before
Christmas, Athena's sales were up 22 per cent on the same period last year.
Mr McGrath said he asked all of Athena's landlords earlier this year to
re-negotiate rents, but few responded. Together, the landlords are owed
Pounds 3.5m and Cartel is owed about Pounds 1.2m.
In October, Pentos reported a Pounds 36m pre-tax loss for the half-year to
July 2 after exceptional costs of Pounds 10.5m, and a number of former
managers accused Mr McGrath of making things worse rather than better.
Mr Maher said yesterday that on recent visits to Dillons stores he had found
the stock situation better and staff morale improved but said: 'Dillons is
still understaffed and understocked.'
Pentos said its bank borrowings in the second half had peaked at Pounds 67m
and were expected to be about Pounds 50m at December 31. After discussions
with its banks, credit lines 'to cover increased requirements' would be
available on demand until the end of February.
Mr McGrath said he could not rule out going back to shareholders to ask for
more cash but had no current plans to do so. The February review will be
part of the annual budgeting process as Pentos moves its year-end from
December 31 to March 31.
Results for the period to December 31 are expected to include write-offs of
between Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 8m arising from the Athena receivership.
Pentos shares yesterday closed 2p lower at 14 1/2 p, less than one-tenth of
their peak level.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Thomas Cook chief may quit at First Choice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First Choice Holidays, formerly Owners Abroad, is in talks with Germany's
Westdeutsche Landesbank, which controls a 21 per cent stake in it, that
could lead to boardroom changes.
Among options are the resignation from First Choice's board of Mr
Christopher Rodrigues, chief executive of Thomas Cook. He would be replaced
by a director from WestLB, which owns 90 per cent of Thomas Cook.
Mr Francis Baron, First Choice chief executive, has made no secret of his
desire to strengthen links with WestLB.
Thomas Cook bought the 21 per cent stake in First Choice last year, helping
it to fight a hostile takeover bid from Airtours, a rival tour operator.
First Choice, known as Owners Abroad until August this year, had hoped that
the link with Thomas Cook would enable it to make substantial savings
through co-operation with LTU, the German travel company 34 per cent owned
by WestLB.
By October, however, relations with the German bank had been soured and few
of the planned benefits had been realised.
It is understood that the 'strategic alliance' has failed to win cost
savings through shared aircraft maintenance, fuel buying and spares
purchasing. Nor has it given First Choice greater muscle in holiday booking.
However the retail side of Thomas Cook has delivered a significant amount of
business.

FT  29 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Spain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Spain and Italy tend to be lumped together from an investment point of view
as high-yielding Mediterranean markets on Europe's periphery. For much of
this year, this comparison has seemed unfair on Spain, a country which has
its fair share of economic troubles and political instability, but not
apparently on the same scale as Italy. However, in the past few weeks, the
gravity of Spain's home-grown political problems has intensified amid
mounting evidence of links between the current administration and illegal
anti-terrorist activities.
It is not surprising that the peseta has weakened against the D-Mark in the
past few weeks and is now below its former floor under the European exchange
rate mechanism. The gap between yields on Spanish bonds and German bunds has
also widened, in common with the performance of Italian bonds. But more
recently Spanish bonds have underperformed their Italian equivalents. This
is likely to continue, especially if foreign investors' confidence in Italy
revives appreciably. In Italy, political chaos is fully priced into the
market - in Spain this is not yet the case. An added risk for bond investors
comes from the inflation outlook; poor inflation figures for January could
lead the Bank of Spain to increase short-term interest rates.

FT  29 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: US dollar/Yen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US dollar's long-term depreciation against the yen appears to have
stopped - at least for the moment. Most indicators are supporting the
dollar. In spite of the 15 per cent year on year increase in Japan's current
account surplus during November, the underlying trend remains downward. For
the first 11 months this year, the politically contentious surplus fell
nearly 10 per cent in yen terms and 1.9 per cent in dollar terms. Interest
rate differentials are also moving in the dollar's favour; as long as
Japanese interest rates remain at their historic lows, and the Fed continues
to tighten monetary policy, the US currency should become increasingly
appealing.
The only thing limiting an immediate dollar rally is the continuing
reluctance of Japanese investors to buy dollar-denominated assets. Japanese
institutions discovered to their cost this year that the marginal benefit
offered by real US interest rates can be destroyed in a single day through
adverse currency movements. They need to be substantially compensated for
the risk by more than a couple of percentage points. Unless the US interest
rate cycle peaks at a higher level than the consensus, the Japanese may
continue to be reluctant to invest in the US. That reluctance could
significantly limit any appreciation of the dollar early next year. Any
respite for the US currency is likely in any case to be temporary. While the
interest rate cycle may support the dollar in the short term, the yen's
long-term appreciation remains assured.
Japan's inflation record is far superior to that in the US. The country's
ability to improve productivity should ensure the trade surplus does not
shrink excessively; and with Japan's overseas investment income forecast to
reach Dollars 1,000bn a year by the end of the decade, the current account
surplus's continued growth is assured. The dollar may briefly appreciate
this year, but it is not out of the woods.

FT  29 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican peso's sharp fall and the government's failed efforts to defend
it have significantly increased the cost of servicing Mexico's debt while
sharply reducing the nation's ability to pay for it. But the present
emergency need not prove a rerun of 1982. The existence of Nafta should
limit the hurt; it is in the interests of the US and Canada to prevent a
full-blown financial and economic collapse in Mexico that could culminate
with immigrants and cheap imports pouring over their borders. A
comprehensive package is required. Internationally, the US, possibly with
Canada and the IMF, must put together an emergency credit or guarantee
facility, probably worth more than the Dollars 10bn required to restore
credibility. Internally, the government must demonstrate its commitment to a
balanced budget by accelerating the privatisation programme, while also
providing support for the endangered banking sector. If the immediate
devaluation's economic and political damage can be limited, a weaker
currency could strengthen the Mexican economy through an export-driven
recovery.

FT  29 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: ITT in focus
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ITT, the company that was once the arch conglomerate, now preaches the
virtues of focus. Indeed, after the disposal of its non-insurance financial
services activities, it will be more focused than at any time in its recent
history. It has taken Mr Rand Araskog 15 years as chairman to get to this
point, but shareholders should be pleased.
In the past month ITT's stock has climbed by more than 10 per cent, or 8 per
cent against the market, as investors have taken in the implications of the
withdrawal from financial services. The move brings in net cash of Dollars
3bn to Dollars 3.5bn and leaves the group with three well-defined legs:
manufacturing, insurance and leisure. In spite of the new focus ITT concedes
that there is no special synergy between these businesses, and the group's
rating suffers a 'conglomerate discount'. Analysts suggest the value of the
individual parts could be as much as Dollars 130 a share, compared with
Dollars 87 now. Earlier this year, ITT itself raised the tantalising
prospect of a break-up. A self-sponsored dismemberment would undoubtedly be
in shareholders' interests.
There is a risk, though, that ITT's break with the past is less pronounced
than recent transactions suggest. The Dollars 1.7bn purchase of the Caesars
World gaming group, announced just before Christmas, makes eminent sense
since the fit with ITT's Sheraton hotels is excellent. Less logical is the
proposed acquisition of the Madison Square Garden sports and entertainment
company, a move which provoked an 8 per cent fall in ITT's share price in
the week it was announced. At least the group decided not to diversify into
the risky broadcast television sector. That would have represented an
unwelcome return to old-style ITT behaviour, where expansion took precedence
over the pursuit of shareholder value.

FT  29 DEC 94 / British senior civil servants second only to Japanese in pay
league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's civil servants are better paid than almost all their international
counterparts, according to a report published today.
Only Japan's senior officials are above Whitehall's in the pay league of
civil servants in leading states of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, according to the report by the European Policy
Forum, a London-based think tank.
The forum says UK permanent secretaries - the cream of Whitehall - are paid
markedly more than their German, French and US counterparts.
The figures, calculated from 1990 pay rates in US dollars at purchasing
power parity, are taken from a recent study of senior civil service pay in
11 countries within the OECD carried out by researchers for the Paris-based
organisation.
The figures also show that during the 1980s UK permanent secretaries were
the only top civil servants in the 11 states whose pay rose by more than the
rise in per capita GDP, thanks to big increases in 1985 and 1986.
Mr Graham Mather, president of the European Policy Forum and a Tory MEP,
said: 'These figures end the myth that British top civil servants are paid
less than their equivalents overseas and suggest it is time to reassess
their performance criteria.'
At Dollars 125,000 in 1990, the basic salaries of British permanent
secretaries are shown by the study to be just behind Japanese levels. By
contrast, counterparts in France were paid Dollars 70,000, in the US Dollars
90,000 and in Germany Dollars 100,000. In a submission to Mr David Hunt,
minister for public service, the think tank calls on the government to
abandon plans for a special new top pay scale, to start in April, which
would cover permanent secretaries and Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet
secretary.
Permanent secretaries are paid Pounds 95,000 a year and Sir Robin Pounds
118,000.
In his submission to Mr Hunt, Mr Mather claims it would be 'great political
folly' to introduce a 'super pay league' until 'clear policy target
agreements' are established.
Ms Liz Symons, general secretary of the First Division Association of senior
civil servants, said: 'Other countries have not got career civil servants of
our kind, so comparisons are very difficult.'

FT  29 DEC 94 / Tension stalks Algerians in Paris: Moslems in France fear a
civil war backlash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was an air of unease yesterday in the Cafe du Dome in Barbes, a
district in northern Paris with a large Algerian community. The Christmas
hijacking of an Air France airliner by Islamic militants and the murder of
three French priests in Algeria on Tuesday dominated conversation.
'It is tragic what is happening, Algeria is being torn apart,' said Hamid, a
mechanic who moved to France in the mid-1980s. He fears that his new
homeland is being dragged increasingly into Algeria's civil war between the
government and Islamic militants, and is concerned about the implications
for France's Algerian community, which numbers more than 1m, and for other
Moslem groups in France.
'We are worried that the troubles will come to France and build a feeling of
hostility towards ordinary Moslems,' says one of Hamid's friends as he
grinds his Gauloise into an ashtray. Such concerns among France's Moslems
have been fuelled over recent months by a series of crackdowns on suspected
Islamic militants by Mr Charles Pasqua, the hardline interior minister. Mr
Pasqua, determined to prevent the spread of the Algerian conflict to France,
has launched a series of security measures since the summer, from stop and
search operations to the expulsion of suspected Moslem radicals.
Mr Pasqua believes that France's Moslem community has been infiltrated by
extremists. In raids last month, he claimed to have smashed an international
support network for the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), the most militant
opponents of the Algerian government, which perpetrated the Christmas hijack
and the killing of the priests.
Most Moslems play down the threat from extremists in France. 'There is
little support for them. And I think there are very few here,' said one
delegate to last week's congress of the Union of French Islamic
Organisations.
Many Moslem groups, such as the National Council of French Moslems, endorsed
the storming of the Air France airliner in which the four hijackers were
killed. They also backed French policy towards Algiers. 'France is the
best-placed western country to play a significant role in the search for a
democratic solution to the Algerian drama,' the council said.
There are, however, growing concerns about attitudes to Moslems in France.
'First there have been the security crackdowns, then there was the banning
on wearing headscarves in classrooms,' says Yusef, a student from Nanterre,
near Paris.
The relationship between France and its Moslem community remains fragile.
'The Moslems in France are a disparate community and France has still not
come to terms with its Algerian history,' says Mr Dominique Moisi, deputy
director of the French Institute for Foreign Affairs.
The relationship may face further strains, particularly if the number of
immigrants from Algeria increases. Demands for political asylum from
France's former colony are rising steadily, according to the French Office
for the Protection of Refugees. In November 300 Algerians applied to France
for asylum, more than 20 per cent higher than in October and double the June
figure.
With urban problems already a serious social concern and with political
parties of the extreme right firmly opposed to immigration, the concerns of
Hamid and his friends could become more acute.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Germany 'ahead of UK on labour costs'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's labour competitiveness is in danger of falling rapidly behind that
of Germany as both countries pull out of recession, the Confederation of
British Industry warned yesterday.
In its latest pay trends survey the CBI said average UK settlements showed
an increase of 3.4 per cent in the three months to November among
manufacturing companies and of 4.3 per cent in the services sector.
It added that higher manufacturing productivity was masking the impact of
high wage increases on the country's competitiveness. Official earnings
figures, which include overtime and bonuses, are showing a 4 per cent annual
rise. While manufacturing productivity grew by 3.7 per cent according to
provisional figures for the second half of the year, UK unit labour costs
dropped by 2 per cent in 1994.
A few years ago that would have given UK competitiveness an 'exceptional
boost' as Germany struggled with the problems of reunification, Mr Robbie
Gilbert, the CBI's employment affairs director said. But the Germans had cut
unit labour costs in the western part of the country by 6 per cent in the
past year.
'We are falling behind again,' warned Mr Gilbert. 'With price rises low,
British workers are receiving bigger real rises than the employees of our
major competitors - many of whom are now accepting real cuts in pay.'
German labour market statistics show 7.5 per cent growth in industrial
productivity to August year on year, average hourly earnings increases of
only 1.9 per cent and a drop in unit industrial labour costs of 5.8 per
cent.
The latest forecasts for Germany published last week in the Paris-based
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's economic outlook
suggest its unit labour costs will grow by only 0.1 per cent next year and 1
per cent in 1996.
By contrast the OECD expects the UK's unit labour costs to grow by 1.6 per
cent in 1995 and 3 per cent in 1996 although the report said productivity
performance had been strong this year in the UK and real wage growth had
remained moderate.
The CBI survey came too late to be considered in yesterday's monthly
monetary meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie
George, the governor of the Bank of England. They are thought to have
decided against an early further rise in interest rates.
A Treasury spokesman noted that recent developments on pay and unit labour
costs in British industry had been 'very good' and had helped underpin UK
successes in export markets.
The Engineering Employers Federation said it had found no evidence of any
upward trend in the level of pay settlements. The average rise from
September to November was 3.0 per cent, excluding 15 companies which
reported pay freezes.

FT  29 DEC 94 / The FT Interview: Credit where it is due - The new president
of the EBRD has brought prudence rather than vision to the bank / Jacques de
Larosiere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAMBERT and DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques de Larosiere is in confident mood. His style is discreet, even
understated. Yet the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development is anxious to make his point.
Since he took over the running of the public sector bank set up in 1991 to
aid economic transformation in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe,
the institution has regained credibility.
The EBRD's first president, Mr Jacques Attali, resigned in the summer of
1993 after a crisis caused by revelations of mismanagement and
over-spending. The very future of the bank was in doubt.
Not all the questions about the EBRD's long-term future have since been
resolved. It has yet to prove that it can be more effective than private
sector banks in those central and eastern European countries that have
progressed furthest with economic reform.
But Mr de Larosiere says those who doubt the need for the EBRD 'are less and
less numerous'. He cites evidence that the bank is an increasingly
attractive partner for the international investment banking community.
'After little more than a year here, I see the EBRD as a valuable and
innovative institution. It is more and more respected and called upon by
other partners to work with them.'
He takes care to give credit for the turnround to his colleagues rather than
to himself, and he delivers his judgment from a position of experience. A
former director of the French Treasury, managing director of the
International Monetary Fund, and governor of the Bank of France, he is
Europe's most seasoned figure on the international monetary circuit.
He appears totally in control - of himself and of his institution.
A master of fastidiously-controlled diction, the EBRD chief - in contrast to
his flamboyant predecessor - eschews hyperbole. This approach adds force to
his description of the EBRD at the time of Mr Attali's departure: 'I don't
want to use pompous words. But I think the life of the bank was at stake.'
In the past year, the EBRD has strengthened its commitment to private sector
initiatives in its 25 countries of operation (the number has trebled since
it was set up, largely because of the break-up of the Soviet Union). It has
stepped up geographic diversification, shifting the focus away from the
pro-reform states of eastern Europe towards what Mr de Larosiere calls the
'outer countries, the more difficult ones' in the former Soviet Union.
Deals with five countries - Hungary, the Czech republic, Slovakia, Poland,
and Romania - accounted for 57 per cent of the EBRD's signed commitments for
loans and equity investments in 1993, but only 44 per cent in 1994.
The EBRD has reorganised its 750-strong staff, merging departments and
moving employees out of administration into front-line banking. The number
of EBRD employees - both London-hired and locally-recruited - in resident
offices in former communist states will roughly quadruple next year to 81,
compared with 23 in October 1993. Offices outside London, which previously
had largely representational functions, have been integrated into the EBRD's
banking department.
Asked to provide examples of recent projects, Mr de Larosiere reels off 10
that range from Russian small business credits and support for privatised
companies in Poland and Slovenia to loans for the Prague-Berlin rail network
and for improvement of wine-making in Moldova. With an uncharacteristic
burst of enthusiasm, he says he is 'elated' by such evidence of the bank's
diversity.
He cites statistics to show how the EBRD's operations are growing. Signed
loan and equity commitments for 1994 will be just over Ecu1.8bn, in line
with target, compared with a cumulative Ecu2.7bn during the EBRD's first
three years of operations. Seventy per cent of 1994 deals were for the
private sector - higher than the 60 per cent private sector content laid
down by the banks's charter. Disbursements during 1994 totalled something
like Ecu700m, compared with a cumulative Ecu557m up to the end of 1993.
The bank always acts with partners, such as banks, multinationals and local
companies, in its projects and on average it only puts up a third of the
capital required. Investments totalling Ecu5.7bn have so far been approved
by the board during the bank's life, supporting projects with an overall
value of Ecu17.1bn.
'This means that the EBRD is actually the most important agent in terms of
private financing in that part of the world,' Mr de Larosiere says proudly -
adding hastily that he does not say this to exaggerate the importance of the
bank, merely that he wishes to put the figures into perspective.
At the same time, the bank's famously accommodative budget has been brought
under strict control. Its administrative spending was frozen in 1994, and
the figure will rise by just 3.5 per cent in nominal terms in 1995 despite
the rising number of transactions.
'We have been moderating the expansion of our budgetary outlays, and this
has been extremely important to restore credibility. We are at the service
of our member countries, and we are very careful about the manner in which
we utilise the money devoted to the bank, since this is taxpayers' money,'
observes the president thoughtfully.
One possible source of future friction with shareholders concerns the EBRD's
cumbersome board, the cost of which (12 per cent of EBRD administrative
spending) has been criticised by some governments. Mr de Larosiere says it
is 'widely accepted' that the board's structure is 'a problem', adding, 'I
am confident the membership will look into it and take the proper measures.'
Problems concerning the EBRD's structure are not directly his
responsibility, Mr de Larosiere says, because he is the governments'
servant, not their master.
Such self-deprecation, however, is not the whole story. In his dealings with
the board, Mr de Larosiere is said to use a mixture of assertiveness and
subtlety to push decisions through. One EBRD insider says Mr de Larosiere
displays a single-mindedness that is similar to Mr Attali.
The difference is that Mr de Larosiere has 'infinitely more finesse'.
Another top EBRD official points to Mr de Larosiere's success in talking
directly to top contacts in shareholder governments. 'He commands total
respect.'
Mr de Larosiere takes care never to criticise his predecessor; indeed, he
does not mention his name during the interview. But his opinion of Mr
Attali's free-spending is not difficult to discern. The entire 12th floor,
the site of Mr Attali's former office, is being sub-let to save costs, as is
the bank's 2nd floor, bringing in Pounds 1.3m in annual rental income, 1 per
cent of the total budget outlays.
He has closed the executive dining room and prefers to lunch in the canteen.
'You can eat very decently.' He adds: 'It has a big advantage for me since
it allows me to speak to people whom I would not normally see in my office.
I sit at the table, and start a conversation. That is very good for me and
for the integration of the bank.'
Restructuring operations and restoring morale represented the most urgent of
Mr de Larosiere's tasks. But the bank's customers' needs are changing too.
For all the macroeconomic difficulties in the east, he says, 'the pace of
economic reform in most countries is encouraging . . . All this will create
a climate that will undoubtedly have profound consequences on the countries'
ability to generate business. Our job is to help the authorities in these
countries with the execution of these programmes, particularly in the
post-privatisation phase.'
Like most of its clients, the EBRD itself is operating under constraints.
First, it lends on commercial terms, at higher interest rates than, for
instance, the European Investment Bank - one of the reasons why the EBRD has
been criticised as excessively cautious. Second, the need to carry out a
large number of time-consuming smaller deals in a large array of countries
adds to both costs and risks. Third, though commitments and disbursements
are building up, the bank's overall activities - and thus its income - are
much lower than envisaged under Mr Attali.
Mr de Larosiere intends to tackle these problems in two ways. 'We have to
continue to increase productivity, and this is why I am continuing to press
for structural reforms, simplifying networks and streamlining procedures.'
He also wants to increase the bank's leverage by extending partnerships with
other institutions in the financial and industrial fields.
The EBRD has stepped up 'wholesale' activities in the financial area, taking
equity stakes in and forming associations with banks, financial institutions
and investment firms in its countries of operation. Such activities now form
20 per cent of its business.
Mr de Larosiere wants to extend this into the industrial sector, building
'global partnership relationships' with corporations from west and east.
'This would mean we would do less detailed work on individual projects,
accompanying important corporations in programmes (in the EBRD's target
countries).' By agreeing such 'package deals', the bank could save costs and
lend support to more modest projects that would otherwise 'be too small
productivity-wise', Mr de Larosiere says.
These plans make sense, but do they add up to a vision? Mr de Larosiere
bridles at the suggestion that he is interested solely in good housekeeping.
'Of course there is a vision. It would be inept not to have a vision. It is
one of the most important challenges for the west to help that part of the
world transform its basic habits and integrate into the world trade system.'
There is an important caveat: 'We are a bank and we have to behave as a
bank. We have a profit and loss account. We are judged by the markets. We
have to borrow on the markets. We had negative reserves in the first year,
and now we have to create positive reserves. We also have to look at the
years where we will have to put up provisions for risks. So the bank has to
be run like a bank.'
Mr de Larosiere neither looks nor sounds like a visionary. That is probably
the best guarantee that his agenda for the EBRD, mixing the prudence of the
public sector with the flexibility of the marketplace, can be made to work.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Leading Article: China and WTO
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
China's admission that agreement could not be reached this year on its bid
for membership of the Gatt and the new World Trade Organisation cost its
government considerable loss of face. It is encouraging, therefore, that its
response has not been to quit the bargaining table, but to indicate
readiness to continue talks next year. If resumed negotiations are to
succeed, however, all involved need to absorb some important lessons.
That is true, above all, for Beijing, which has frequently resorted to
menacing bluster rather than negotiating purposefully. China still seems to
covet WTO membership as a political prize, rather than for its economic
benefits. Western interest in China's market also appears to have caused its
government to think it holds all the high cards. Its public utterances often
imply that unless other countries accept its terms, they - not China - will
be the biggest losers. Such assumptions are mistaken. Despite the recent
growth of China's economy and exports, it accounts for only 2.5 per cent of
world trade. Its commercial isolation would thus only affect marginally the
world economy. But it would put at risk China's future growth potential.
China needs WTO membership for three main reasons: to stimulate further
reforms and modernisation of its economy; to safeguard markets for its
export industries, which in many cases are the main consumers of its
imports; and to provide a stable framework for the foreign investment on
which its development crucially depends. Such reassurance is particularly
critical given growing international concern about China's arbitrary
official regulations and late payments by its state enterprises.
Progress in negotiations is likely to remain slow until Beijing fully
accepts that WTO membership is fundamental to its economic self-interest.
Only then will it have the incentive to improve its offers on market access
and drop demands for easier terms than are enjoyed by other developing
countries, none of which is nearly as important a trading power.
This change will not be easy to accomplish while a looming leadership
struggle continues to immobilise China's government. Gatt's bigger members
must do everything possible to bolster the position of Beijing's economic
reformers, while standing firm on issues of basic principle. That calls for
enlightened leadership by the US, which should be ready to respond
positively to any constructive initiatives from Beijing.
As well as refraining from bilateral trade sanctions, which would play into
the hands of China's hardliners, Washington needs to show more flexibility.
In particular, it should soften its insistence that China join the WTO as a
developed country. Provided Beijing is ready to make worthwhile commitments,
it should be allowed to adjust to multilateral trade rules according to an
agreed timetable, subject to regular monitoring.
The EU could usefully play a role by offering the US stronger support if it
adopted a more flexible position. Regrettably, Sir Leon Brittan, the trade
commissioner, has seemed more interested in ingratiating himself with
Beijing. Whatever his motives, that has won no favours, but merely
encouraged China's negotiators to concentrate on driving a wedge between the
EU and the US.
China's membership of the WTO remains a highly desirable objective. But
achieving the necessary political conditions will take time. Recent events
have shown the futility of setting artificial deadlines. Admitting China to
the organisation by a fixed date is much less important than ensuring it
enters on the right terms.

One topic hovers over Hollywood this new year: will 1995 be the year the
Japanese pull out?
Sony, one of Japan's largest electronics groups, recently announced a
Dollars 2.7bn write-down on Columbia/TriStar, the movie studio it bought for
Dollars 3.4bn in 1989. Matsushita, its compatriot, has hired Allen &amp; Co, an
investment bank, to advise it on the future of MCA/Universal, for which it
paid Dollars 6.1bn four years ago.
The next few months will be critical for both groups.
Matsushita has been the more successful of the two. MCA has had a string of
hits under Matsushita, including Jurassic Park and The Flintstones at the
cinema and Aerosmith and Nirvana in the music charts.
The problem is that the architects of its success, Mr Lew Wasserman, the
81-year-old chairman, and Mr Sidney Sheinberg, 59, his second-in-command,
are not happy with their Japanese parent. 'We have no complaints on a
day-to-day basis,' said a senior MCA executive. 'Lew and Sid still have
control. But Matsushita hasn't allowed us to expand.'
The MCA deal preceded Japan's descent into recession. Matsushita has since
been unwilling to sanction further investment in the US while cutting back
at home. First it blocked MCA's plan to acquire Virgin Records (eventually
bought by Thorn-EMI) and then its attempt to invest in NBC, the TV company.
'Matsushita didn't make any promises in our original negotiations,' says one
MCA executive. 'The talks were conducted very quickly. We just assumed that
as they were so keen to keep the same people in charge they'd follow their
recommendations.'
The situation came to a head in October when Matsushita's chairman flew to
San Francisco for a summit meeting with Mr Wasserman and Mr Sheinberg. The
outcome was the appointment of Allen &amp; Co, coupled with that of Michael
Ovitz's Creative Artists Agency, to consider MCA's future.
One option for Matsushita would be to sell a minority stake in MCA to
provide it with capital for expansion. Another would be to sell out
completely and Matsushita is rumoured to be willing to consider offers of
Dollars 9bn-Dollars 10bn. Mr Tsuko Murase, executive vice president, denied
this: 'We're not stockbrokers. We did not buy intending to sell when the
value went up.'
But Matsushita is running out of time. MCA may face difficulties next year.
Junior, the Arnold Schwarzenegger comedy billed as a Christmas hit, is only
a modest success. The production of Waterworld, an aquatic sci-fi epic
starring Kevin Costner set to open next summer, has been plagued by problems
and now has the dubious honour of being the most expensive film ever, with a
budget estimated at Dollars 145m.
Finally MCA is about to lose some of its most talented executives. Mr David
Geffen, founder of its Geffen Records subsidiary, is leaving in April. Mr
Wasserman and Mr Sheinberg have threatened to quit when their contracts end
in late 1995 - unless Matsushita provides more capital.
If Mr Sheinberg went, Mr Steven Spielberg, the highest grossing director in
Hollywood's history, would go too. He is setting up his own entertainment
company with the dream-team of Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg, former head of Walt
Disney's film interests, and Mr Geffen. He will still be free to direct for
other studios and could make a planned sequel to Jurassic Park, but only if
Mr Sheinberg stays.
This Hollywood revolt has exposed Matsushita to ridicule in Japan. The
simplest way of averting it would be for MCA to invest in the dream team.
This would placate Mr Wasserman and Mr Sheinberg, while protecting MCA's
relationship with Mr Spielberg and Mr Geffen. The problem, as ever, is
whether Matsushita will pay up.
Sony confronts a very different set of problems. It has also adopted an
arms-length approach to the day-to-day management of its Hollywood
subsidiaries, but it has not had the advantage of a stable management team.
And, unlike Matsushita, it could scarcely be criticised for not spending
enough money.
Sony is estimated to have spent more than Dollars 10bn during its five years
in Hollywood. It began by paying Dollars 700m to hire Mr Peter Guber and Mr
Jon Peters, the Batman producers, only to see Mr Peters leave after 19
months with a Dollars 30m pay-off. It has since suffered a string of
departures culminating in Mr Guber's exit this autumn.
Its movie studios have had a few hits, such as Philadelphia and Sleepless In
Seattle. But they have also had several flops, including Last Action Hero
and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Sony's share of US box office revenues has
fallen 14.7 per cent in 1990 to about 8.9 per cent in 1994.
The consensus in Hollywood is that Sony has exercised insufficient control
over its film business and taken action too late. 'The alarm bells should
have rung when Peters left,' said a rival studio head. 'You don't pay
Dollars 700m for a duo only to be left with half of it.'
Mr Guber's departure and the Dollars 2.7bn write-off should, in theory,
enable Sony to start again. However there is little confidence in Hollywood
that the Japanese company has got a grip on its film interests.
Mr Mickey Schulhof, chairman of Sony's US interests, is still in overall
charge. He is well respected in the music business, but has no experience of
film-making, nor does Mr Alan Levine, the entertainment lawyer now in charge
of the film division. Mr Mark Canton, the new head of production, knows the
business but was recently described by the New Yorker magazine as 'easily
one of the most unpopular executives in the industry'.
Sony has given them three years to salvage the film business. Hollywood
sceptics suspect the real reason for the write-off was to prepare for a
disposal. Tokyo commentators argue that it would be even more embarrassing
for Sony, or Matsushita, to quit Hollywood now given the long-term thinking
that characterises Japanese corporate behaviour and the abhorrence of
short-term profiteering.
Moreover the film business is so volatile that the picture might look very
different in a year. 'Just think how different things would be if Last
Action Hero had been a hit,' said one Hollywood veteran. 'Though I shudder
to think what will happen if Waterworld flops.'

FT  29 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Mexico - 1994 is not 1982
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For experienced observers of Mexico, the story looks depressingly familiar.
Just as they did 12 years earlier, Mexican officials last week stood before
angry lenders at a meeting at the New York Federal Reserve to explain a
financial crisis. This week, like their predecessors in 1982, officials are
locked in long negotiating sessions in Washington in a bid to put together
an emergency financing package.
Every day seems to bring new horrors to the jittery financial markets: a
sinking peso, big losses in the stock market, worries about the health of
the banking system and questions about the ability of the government and
private sector to service their dollar-denominated debts. Resolving these
problems will be painful. Some companies and banks may even fail.
Nevertheless, this is not a repetition of 1982. The financial markets'
understandable concern must not be permitted to overshadow the manifest and
manifold improvements in the economy since then. Mexico's non-oil exports
were rising even before the devaluation, a sign that the economy is
increasingly competitive. The burden the state imposed on private enterprise
has been much reduced. The government's debt burden, albeit troubling in the
short term, is much less than 12 years ago.
A significant devaluation, coming on top of these many changes for the
better, provides an opportunity to achieve the rapid growth that has been so
elusive. It was, it should be recalled, precisely such a move to a flexible,
more competitive exchange rate, after the financial crisis of the early
1980s, which gave Chile its last necessary push towards international
competitiveness.
Although the new administration of President Ernesto Zedillo has suffered a
defeat, it has also been granted an opportunity. It has shown itself less
than deft in handling the immediate crisis. But what matters now is the
future.
Its first priority is to bolster financial market confidence. No resolution
will be forthcoming so long as capital continues to flee the country. This
will require unity within the administration. Given the low level of Mexican
reserves, it will also require the help of international agencies, such as
the International Monetary Fund. The US can play an invaluable role in
bolstering confidence. As it made clear on Tuesday, a collapsing peso is no
more in Washington's interests than Mexico City's.
Next, the package of measures that the government is set to announce by next
Monday at the latest must be comprehensive and clear. The aim must be to
demonstrate a continued commitment to reform, combined with willingness to
take the tough measures needed to exploit the devaluation. One element must
be an explanation of how the government proposes to keep its budget
balanced, given the extra costs caused by devaluation. Another must be a
commitment to policies aimed at halting an inflationary spiral. Yet another
must be a firm timetable for extensive privatisation, along with proposals
for faster deregulation and reform of the social security system. Finally,
it must indicate how it plans to stabilise the financial system.
A financial crisis is the last thing Mr Zedillo wanted, or needed, as he
tries to grapple with Mexico's many political and social problems. But
properly handled, this devaluation could mark the beginning of Mexico's
export-led growth miracle. Mr Zedillo has the time - six full years. He also
has the chance. The success or failure of Mexico's struggle for
modernisation hangs on his making the right decisions over the next few
weeks.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Whitehall pay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A report out today claims that the UK's senior civil servants are among the
best paid of their breed in the world. The European Policy Forum's paper is
a useful antidote to Whitehall's self-serving conventional wisdom, which
holds that Britain's top officials are comparatively poorly rewarded.
The problem is to know how to make the comparison. Because overseas
comparisons are difficult, and the City down the road, the tendency of late
has been to size up permanent secretaries against senior private sector
executives and to declare them poor.
There would be some justice to such comparisons if the civil service were in
competition with the private sector to fill its top posts. But it is not.
The new executive agencies have made serious attempts to recruit in the
private sector and, where successful, have in some cases paid chief
executives in excess of Pounds 100,000 plus bonuses. But Whitehall proper
remains a closed club, with permanent secretaries almost invariably
appointed from inside.
It will not be long before the pay of agency bosses becomes the yardstick
for Whitehall, and is used to justify large salary increases. This should be
resisted.
There are good reasons for continuing with the status quo: not least the
fact that there is no shortage of first-rate civil servants. A case can be
made for adopting the EPF's proposal to apply private sector disciplines to
Whitehall by linking senior officials' salaries to performance contracts, as
in New Zealand. But until such a decision is taken, it is inappropriate to
portray Sir Humphrey as the poor relation of his Rothschild cousins.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Nothing but a legal charade?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr W GRAEME KNOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Are all share support operations to be made legal by the Appeal Court?
Perhaps the Guinness trial defendants will create an interesting legal
precedent ('Court review of Guinness case', December 23).
Will it be possible to argue that, for example, motorway motorists driving
at 120 miles per hour cannot be prosecuted because those driving at 75 miles
per hour escape?
Surely there is no question of innocence, otherwise the board of Guinness
would not subsequently have settled with Argyll? Is what remains, therefore,
simply another legal charade?

FT  29 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Mexico having to bear cost of market
fickleness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From STEPHANY GRIFFITH JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Right decision, wrong tactics' December 22), correctly
points out some policy mistakes of this and the previous Mexican
administration.
However, nothing was said about the extreme fickleness of international
financial markets, as a key element in provoking recent events in Mexico.
The markets were somewhat over-optimistic about Mexican prospects a week
ago; they are certainly over-pessimistic today.
Nothing that has happened in Mexico in recent days can explain such a
massive change in perceptions; recent events are largely explained by the
intrinsic volatility of international financial market.
Maybe the largest mistake of the Mexican authorities was to pursue a policy
so heavily reliant on external capital flows. Would not some disincentives
to discourage excessive foreign inflows (especially short-term ones) a year
or two ago have implied lower, but more sustainable, private flows?
Greater reliance on domestic saving (as Stephen Fidler rightly suggests in
'Latin America faces difficult year ahead,' December 23) would also have
been prudent.
Perhaps the time has come for governments - in industrialised and especially
in developing countries - to review whether deregulation should not be
complemented by some management and greater regulation of international
capital markets.
Though this clashes with 'conventional wisdom', the costs of current extreme
freedom in these markets may start to outweigh the benefits.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Fables and foibles of the old year: FT writers select the
best books for the business reader in 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD, MARTIN WOLF, SAMUEL BRITTAN, JOHN PLENDER and
PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new year looks set to be the year of the political short game, on both
sides of the Atlantic. And when governments are looking for ways to boost
their popularity - as they are in the UK and US - inflation hawks get
worried. They might be reassured by Bob Woodward's account of President Bill
Clinton's first year in office, which describes how an expansionist Democrat
was turned into a deficit hawk.
The Agenda: Inside the Clinton White House (Simon &amp; Schuster) tells of how
political ideals run up against economic reality.
More surprisingly, it is an account of how the economic authorities went out
of their way to help. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, went
beyond the strict call of duty in convincing Mr Clinton of the benefits of
winning the markets' trust. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Clinton's first treasury
secretary, and Mr Robert Rubin, Mr Bentsen's successor, gave able support.
The selling of Mr Clinton's political agenda, by contrast, was all too
haphazard. A leftish administration - say, the Labour party in Britain  -
should perhaps take note.
There were more valuable economics lessons in Russell Roberts' The Choice: A
Fable of Free Trade and Protectionism (Prentice Hall). Paul Samuelson, Nobel
laureate in economics, described the theory of comparative advantage as the
only proposition in social science that is both true and non-trivial.
Unfortunately, few people understand it.
In a fascinating fable, Roberts renames comparative advantage the
'roundabout way to wealth'. Explaining this idea in the book is David
Ricardo, the inventor of the theory, sent back after death to turn the US of
1960 away from a protectionist path. His audience is Ed Johnson, chief
executive officer of Stellar Television, a company threatened by Japanese
imports. Johnson is also the moving spirit in a campaign to stop imports
into the US.
Ricardo takes Johnson to Rahway, New Jersey, to show him a television
factory of the future. 'Where's the television factory?' asks Johnson.
'You're looking at it.'
'But the sign says Merck and Co, Inc, a pharmaceutical company. Doesn't that
mean they make drugs?'
'Indeed, they do, Ed. They send some of those drugs to Japan. In return
Japan sends America televisions.'
If you want to understand comparative advantage read this book. It is
brilliantly conceived.
P J O'Rourke is no economist. But All The Trouble in the World (Picador),
probably contains more economic home truths than most economic treatises.
Auberon Waugh (of all people) complains that this author cannot make up his
mind whether he is a humorist, or means it. But he is funny and in this book
takes us to Third World jungles that most of us would rather visit from an
armchair.
His conclusion is: 'Money is preferable to politics. It is the difference
between being free to be anybody you want and being free to vote for anybody
you want.' His explanation for contemporary miseries is that the advance of
society has merely produced people like himself - or the reader.
O'Rourke is more pithy than the World Bank, to whom we can turn for the
subtleties and qualifications. But if any one would like the same point of
view in good-humoured, but straightforward, form then read No, Prime
Minister by Ralph Harris (IEA Occasional Paper). This consists of newspaper
articles from 1965 to the present, all of which are still easily accessible
today.
For those more interested in the Square Mile, David Kynaston has provided a
fascinating insight into British financial history. The City of London: A
World of Its Own, 1815-1890 (Chatto), the first volume of his three-part
work on the Square Mile, is a splendidly readable account, wonderful on the
sociology of 19th century banking and broking, and the development of City
institutions.
The book appeals as much to the general reader as to the specialist, not
least for the indirect light it casts on Dickens and Trollope. The later
volumes will do well to match the standard of this first offering.
Indispensable in a different way is Jonathan Charkham's comparative study of
corporate governance in the US, Japan, Germany, France and Britain. Keeping
Good Company: A study of corporate governance in five countries (OUP) is a
masterly overview by a former adviser to the governor of the Bank of
England.
Mr Charkham's book is unlikely to be bettered, either for its description of
how management is held to account (or not, as the case may be) in the five
countries, or for the judicious assessment of the merits of the respective
systems of governance.
Corporate-level strategy: creating value in the multi-business company (John
Wiley &amp; Sons) touches on some of the same issues from the narrower
perspective of the business manager. The authors, Michael Goold, Andrew
Campbell and Marcus Alexander, argue that most big companies are 'value
destroyers', because they do not have a proper strategy for 'parenting'
their subsidiaries. Bosses should decide which of three fundamental
'parenting styles' is best suited to their mix of businesses, and apply it
consistently to all. If individual subsidiaries do not fit this approach, it
is easier to change the portfolio than the style.
Despite its length, this book's basic message does not stretch far beyond
that of Goold &amp; Campbell's original, and influential, Strategies &amp; Styles.
But it offers a wider spread of case histories, and many practical ways of
implementing its theories. Parent-company managers will find it helpful.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Bad feeling about a good recovery: Tax hikes and job fears
are clouding the full extent of the UK's economic upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rarely has the British economy performed so well. And rarely have so many
people felt so bad about it.
Almost without exception, the economic indicators over the past two months
have confirmed that the UK is experiencing a textbook recovery from
recession.
The economy is growing at its fastest annual rate for six years, led by
manufacturing and exports. Unemployment, having fallen in all but one month
this year, is now below 2.5m and about 500,000 below its December 1992 peak.
The current account balance of payments, so long the Achilles' heel of the
British economy, has bounced back into surplus.
The government's budget deficit is responding to treatment and on course to
meet the Budget forecast of Pounds 34.4bn for 1994-95. Britain may be one of
only three European Union countries to meet the budget deficit targets
enshrined in the Maastricht treaty in 1996.
True, inflation appears to have bottomed. But at 2.3 per cent in November,
the underlying rate of retail price inflation was within the lower half of
the government's 1-4 per cent target range and only just above the 27-year
low of 2 per cent recorded in September and October. The UK's inflation
performance over the past year has been the best for more than 30 years.
Yet Britain is clearly not enjoying its economic recovery. Every indicator
of opinion, from this month's Dudley West by-election, in which the swing
from Tory to Labour was the biggest since 1935, to the latest consumer
confidence polls, points to a deterioration in the public mood. This month's
consumer confidence survey from Gallup registered a sharp jump in the
percentage of people thinking their financial position would worsen in the
year ahead as well as increased gloom about general economic developments,
inflation, employment prospects and people's ability to save money.
There are obvious policy reasons for the feel-bad factor. Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, and Mr Norman Lamont, his predecessor, raised taxes across a
wide spectrum to plug the fiscal deficit. But the prevailing mood almost
certainly reflects more far-reaching trends. Britain is undergoing painful
adjustment on three fronts that is hitting the articulate and hitherto
moderately pampered British middle class in particular:
The UK is having to adapt to low inflation, which, if sustained, will bring
benefits. But in the meantime it is dispelling the 'wealth illusion'
generated by inflation-induced double-digit pay increases and rising house
prices in the 1980s.
Competitive pressures, the result of deregulation, globalisation and
technological advance, have triggered 'down-sizing', job insecurity and
redundancies in once secure industries. The changes are encompassing
managers and professionals. There have been high-profile redundancies at the
Treasury, at the former nationalised electricity companies and even within
fast-growing sectors such as telecommunications; Mercury Communications, for
example, announced this month that it would cut nearly a quarter of its
11,400 workforce.
The state is scaling back its involvement in many areas of life for
budgetary and ideological reasons. People are having to put aside more of
current income to provide for education, healthcare and old age.
This confluence of short-term pain and long-term change is not just a
British phenomenon. It is contributing to the unpopularity of democratically
elected governments in north America and continental Europe.
In Britain's case, however, the increase in taxes and other burdens is
considerable. The two Budgets of 1993 resulted in average losses of nearly
Pounds 7 a week for British households. According to Sir George Young, the
financial secretary, tax increases taking effect over the next year will
cost all households an extra Pounds 2.30 a week on average.
Research by the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies shows the tax
increases will cost middle-income groups proportionately more than high
earners or the poor. This will be especially true of married couples with a
mortgage, hit by restrictions to the value of the married couples' allowance
(MCA) and mortgage interest relief (Miras) both last April and at the start
of the 1995-96 financial year.
Next April's cut to 15 per cent from 20 per cent in the rates of relief of
MCA and Miras will cost a working couple with a Pounds 30,000 mortgage more
than Pounds 5 a week. According to government estimates, a working couple
with children and a combined income of 150 per cent of average earnings will
pay 3 percentage points more of their income in direct and indirect taxes in
1995-96 compared with 1993-94.
In the meantime, the UK interest cycle has turned. Bank base rates are now
6.25 per cent against 5.25 per cent in early September. Most mortgage
lenders have yet to respond fully to the monetary tightening, but further
interest rate rises may come soon.
The UK consumer and house-buyer has shrugged off rising interest rates in
the past, most notably in the economically heady late 1980s. But house
prices were rising sharply then. Hopes that 1994 would see a moderate rise
in house prices after falls in recent years have been frustrated. The
Nationwide and Halifax building societies' house price indices showed price
falls of 0.6 per cent and 1 per cent respectively in the year to November.
Falling house prices, high real interest rates and diminishing mortgage
interest relief mean home ownership is no longer the sure investment that it
was for most of the postwar period. People can no longer hope that their
real debt burdens will be eroded by inflation. For many, especially in
south-east England, home ownership now brings to mind tales of heavy losses
or repossession during the recession.
According to the Bank of England, there are still an estimated 1.1m
households with negative equity in their property. The average sum is
relatively small at about Pounds 5,500. But the phenomenon is concentrated
in the south-east and greater London. It constitutes a burden for those
directly involved, and, by restricting transactions, is probably
contributing to the overall weakness of the housing market.
The transformation of the housing market since the late 1980s, when prices
rose by more than 20 per cent a year, is part of the bigger story of
adjustment to low inflation.
The government has managed to engineer an upswing that is foreign to
Britain's postwar experience. The recovery, led as it is by manufacturing
output and exports, holds out the promise of sustained growth and rising
living standards. But it has none of the elan of the last period of strong
growth in the 1980s when fast-growing pay brought shoppers out in force and
money made from trading up in the housing market fuelled the purchase of
consumer durables.
In economics, it is usually darkest before the dawn. The Treasury's Red
Book, published on Budget day, holds out the modest hope of some recovery in
the nation's spirits next year. It forecasts that real personal disposable
income will rise by 1 1/2 per cent in 1995 after stagnating this year. The
Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development expects
above-trend growth to continue for more than two years and further falls in
unemployment. The hope is that these trends, supported by a modest run-down
of savings, will support steady growth of consumer spending and restore the
feel-good factor.
But whether these broad economic developments offset the uncertainties
generated by fast-moving, and possibly unprecedented, changes at the
workplace is difficult to tell. Mr Clarke, who so far has been unexpectedly
steadfast in clamping down on inflation, will be hoping that they will.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Government ostrich-like on workers'
rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From PETER COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The interesting juxtaposition of your leader, 'Time to debate worker
rights' (December 22) and Samuel Brittan's article, 'The follies of the
macho manager', points to the conclusion that since 'labour is now plentiful
and cheaper than it used to be' (Brittan) reasonable improvements in
employee rights are unlikely to damage competitiveness and labour market
flexibility. As you say, the argument to the contrary, put at its most
forceful by the government, can be overdone.
Employment secretary Michael Portillo leads the attack, wholly undaunted by
the opposition of 11 other member states, the European Commission and the
European parliament. At a recent Confederation of British Industry
conference, his minister of state, Ann Widdecombe, vigorously defended the
UK's opt-out from the social chapter. She also attacked the directive on the
establishment of European works councils, recently adopted by the 11, before
a sceptical audience of UK employers who were, in the main, planning
compliance with the directive for their EU operations, including those in
the UK, following the lead of United Biscuits. Her powerful rhetoric was met
with a slightly embarrassed silence.
On employee rights issues, the government adopts an uncritical pro-employer
organisation line to which many big employers pay lip-service but do not
support in practice. Absence of constructive criticism at the draft stage
leads to directives - and that on European works councils is a good example
 -being adopted by the EU in a half-baked form. Worse, if in due course the
UK decides to opt in, it is likely it will be bound to implement a series of
directives on which there has been no formal UK input.
Surely the economic added value of EU membership should be shared partly in
the form of improved social benefits for workers where these can be
delivered without prejudicing competitiveness? The rectification of the
anomalous position of part-time workers under UK law was long overdue.
Equally, the burden on UK multinational employers of complying with the EWC
directive has been exaggerated.
The government's ostrich-like attitude to the European Court of Justice's
interpretation of the acquired rights directive and equal pay legislation,
and the consequential costs incurred by the taxpayer, ought to direct its
attention to the starting point of the debate you favour.
The knee jerk as an instrument of policy is ripe for replacement. Also, with
Labour so far in front in the polls, a rational examination of employment
rights and their place in a market economy could produce a political
dividend for the Conservatives.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Indices should adjust for Japanese
double counting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GRAHAM COX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Plender, in 'A less than stabilising experience' (December 12),
drew attention once again to the long-standing problem of double counting in
Japan: namely, the impact of companies' holdings of other companies' equity
which in total leads to an inflation of market capitalisation by more than
35 per cent.
This in turn distorts world equity indices by giving an excessive 30 per
cent weight to Japan, or around 32.5 per cent excluding the UK. Some
institutions like Sun Life avoid these distortions by holding a weighting
nearer to relative gross domestic product, in the range 15 per cent to 20
per cent of non-UK equities.
However, other funds and investors feel obliged, or are required legally, to
follow world indices as benchmarks. To avoid the 'doubly pointless' activity
of taking exposure in Japan to match a weighting that is a statistical
illusion, such world indices need to be either adjusted for double counting
or have heavy footnotes pointing out the distortion and its scale for Japan
and for any other country where the effect is significant (for example,
Germany).
Let the FT and its actuarial and investment bank advisers panel set a good
example by starting with the FT-Actuaries World Index.

The cynical will doubtless note how much better the programmes get after
Christmas.
Tonight you could do worse than stay with BBC2 all evening. Start with The
Marriage of Figaro (7.20pm), the first of a three-part transmission of one
of Music Theatre London's lovingly outrageous updatings. This is the company
that uses young performers, a slimmed-down band and frequently rude
translations to get astonishingly close to the heart of Mozart. Tonight's
Figaro transforms the lecherous Count into a Tory Eurocrat, the slimy
go-between into his permanent secretary and the frumpish Marcellina into a
National Trust manageress. The vocal lines will be scrupulously observed.
More nuptials in Three Fights, Two Weddings and a Funeral (9.50pm), the
wedding video of Pauline Calf perpetrated by her brother Paul, both better
known as Steve Coogan of Alan Partridge fame.
Like Figaro it is directed by Geoff Posner. And Rab C. Nesbitt fills the gap
at 9pm if you have a Glaswegian interpreter.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Arts: The year of kaleidoscopic identity crises - Nigel
Andrews looks back at the best and worst films of 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tapping his pocket calculator, the British film critic works out that during
1994 he spent some 500 waking hours in darkened movie theatres.
How is he affected by this daytime dream life? Re-watching Nightmare On Elm
Street on TV recently, I realised that it was all about us. We film critics
too sink into dream states from which we emerge with a large quantity of
traumatic baggage. We too have a difficult time, at day's end, sorting real
life from fantasy.
In 1994 we endured exploding faces and showers of blood in Pulp Fiction. We
sat through the Holocaust in Schindler's List. We died of Aids in
Philadelphia. Worst of all, we spent 2 1/2 hours galumphing across America
with Forrest Gump, knowing that on returning to the real world we would be
torn apart by Mr and Mrs Average Filmgoer for not liking the year's
sentimental favourite.
Gump was overlong, self-pitying and speciously panoramic. The film's implied
proposition was that Forrest Gump stands for us all. Sensible critics'
counter-proposition was that Forrest Gump stands for absolutely no one. The
movie itself was the product of a maudlin America desperate to portray
itself as the world's Mr Innocent, even as it picks up the pieces of its own
accident-strewn recent history.
Even where Gump's chameleon experiences did coincide with the flavour of the
year, that flavour was better caught and served in other films. Major theme
of 1994: the protean self. We had Jim Carrey doing quick-change acts in The
Mask, helped by belief-beggaring special FX. We had Robert Altman's bitterly
brilliant Short Cuts, where Los Angeles is a city of seething, sleazy,
metamorphic humanity (so true) in which the Good Mother does sex phone-calls
on the side and the Good Cop rescues dogs and has adulterous affairs.
As for the year's best independent movie, that too was about kaleidoscopic
identity: 32 Short Films About Glenn Gould. Canadian film-maker Francois
Girod took a real famous person (unprotestingly deceased) and broke him into
shiny dramatic pieces like an animated mosaic. The film, dazzlingly clever
and funny, shattered our preconceptions about what bio-pics can and cannot
do. Most of all they can - and should - show the several dozen selves of
which a single human being is made up.
If 1994 was the year of the de-centred hero, could this possibly have had to
do with our leaders?: with having two western premiers in particular who are
resonantly ATTAP (all things to all people). While Gump openly invoked Bill
Clinton - down to the grainy news-shot of our hero shaking hands with JFK -
Britain's top movie commercially was Four Weddings And A Funeral. In this a
likable silly ass dithers around the British landscape trying to turn
non-commitment into a form of evangelism. Hugh Grant, we suspect, was the
matinee idol's answer to John Major.
But we are talking of men. Were there no heroines? Here we must draw
attention to the chronic catch-22 concerning women in popular movie culture.
Whenever in western history the female sex hangs back socially and
professionally (as in the 1950s), women are relegated to helpmeet or
romantic interest roles on screen. The iconography fills up with June
Allysons and Jane Wymans. Yet when the female sex bounds forward, as it has
since the New Feminism began, women on screen may end up being sidelined
even more drastically: by a paranoid patriarchy fearing for its pecking
place.
So in 1994 Jodie Foster paid for her Oscar-strewn recent history by being
cast as Mel Gibson's moll in the year's top no-brainer, Maverick. Michelle
Pfeiffer, once a tough, intelligent kookie, was demoted to lycanthropy bait
for Jack Nicholson (Wolf). Diane Keaton, once the quirkiest leading lady in
Hollywood, gave up on solo leads and went back to being Mistress Woody Allen
in Manhattan Murder Mystery.
As for the appalling House Of The Spirits, it managed to lock up both Meryl
Streep and Glenn Close, and throw away the key, in a hacienda ruled by
barking-mad male chauvinist Jeremy Irons: a sort of Hollywood studio chief
translated into Chilean landowner.
Hollywood the boys' club: it would be funny if it was not tragic. Compare
Europe and points east. Here the year's key films nearly all centred around
women. Kieslowski's Red gave us Irene Jacob manfully - womanfully - holding
the line for honesty and human values against paternalist voyeur Jean-Louis
Trintignant. In The Scent Of Green Papaya a lithe camera rhymed the baroque
beauties of a middle-class Vietnamese house with the anfractuous mysteries
of its heroine's mind. And in China's The Blue Kite - the best Maoist fresco
in a busy year for the sub-genre - women characters were as strongly, subtly
dimensionalised as the men.
At least America gave us Go Fish, a grainy, uninhibited comedy of lesbian
life. But that was low-budget and independent. So were two other films from
North America that were among the year's best. Atom Egoyan's Calendar played
hide-and-seek with reality in a mock-autobiographical tale of the
film-maker's splintering marriage: set against the mosaic landscapes of
Armenia and Toronto. And Kevin Smith's Clerks, a brilliantly profane tale of
sex, death and existence in a convenience store, was shown at the London
Film Festival and should be released next year, though not for good
behaviour.
In Britain the doors have long clanged shut on creative vitality. The
triumph of Four Weddings And A Funeral was good news and bad news. Good that
it became, worldwide, the most successful British film in history. (In
Britain itself it was number one above Gump, Mrs Doubtfire and The
Flintstones.) Bad that British cinema can only 'click' abroad, and seemingly
at home, by reviving those fluffy notions of Old Blighty in which our
kingdom is filled with champers, silly ass-ness and oh-I-say accents.
Don't blame the movie. Blame the other movies: the slew of made-in-UK
horrors like Shopping, Funny Man, Staggered, Deadly Advice and Decadence in
which British film-makers behaved, in this 99th year of movie history, as if
none of them had ever picked up a movie camera before.
A camera is indeed a dangerous and daunting object: fed with light, it
captures life. But perhaps 'life', rather than technology, is where British
cinema comes unstuck.
We seem unable to define what life is in this country. We wander about in
half-worlds belonging to other times (Four Weddings) or other people (the
Americanisms of Shopping). Perhaps we should celebrate the cinema's
hundredth birthday by beginning again: first by finding out who we are, only
then by trying to pin it down on celluloid.
And the top 10 films of 1994?
Short Cuts, 32 Short Films About Glenn Gould, The Blue Kite, Go Fish, Dear
Diary, The Scent Of Green Papaya, Manhattan Murder Mystery, Calendar,
Schindler's List, The Mask.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Arts: Pirouettes and plies around the world - Clement Crisp
recalls the splendours and miseries of dance during the last 12 months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was not, in retrospect, too bad a year for dance. As the months passed,
with their toll of the damned, the doomed and the desperate - the dire Bill
T Jones Company, the Washington Ballet, the Anjelin Preljocaj troupe, Les
ballets Jazz de Montreal; the unveiling of the Royal Ballet's eyesore
Sleeping Beauty; Symphonic Variations mauled by inept casting; Rambert's
despicable Garden of Earthly Delights; the killing off of London
Contemporary Dance Theatre - I felt 1994 was annus horribilissimus. But
there were also splendid things in creation and performance, and too many
not to put the year's accounts into the black.
The Edinburgh Festival did dance-lovers proud with the return of Mark Morris
bringing his breath-taking L'Allegro; with the Miami Ballet's vivid accounts
of a Balanchine repertory; with a Merce Cunningham visit. Equally bracing
the appearance of Twyla Tharp's dancers at Riverside Studios - purposeful,
stylish. Home-grown talents made exhilarating work. Jonathan Burrows' Our
was a span of fascinating activity, with Lynne Bristow (a fine classicist
turned fine modernist) magnificent in it. Michael Clark's O was luminous,
revelatory, Apollo rethought. Richard Alston's dances for his new group
brought allusive, poetic versions of Petrushka and Les Illumimations.
Siobhan Davies' The Glass blew in was like gazing at refractions of a
mysterious image. Kim Brandstrup's Othello was a bold commentary upon the
play, with Irek Mukhamedov its tremendous heart. Mark Baldwin made witty,
emotionally sly dances.
We have much to celebrate with such creators, and Channel 4's season of
mauvais quarts d'heure from international dance-bores - Tights, Camera,
Action - was all the more unworthy. Veils can be drawn over the appearance
of Momix, over Lucinda Childs' frigidities, Adventures in Motion Pictures'
addled Highland Fling (La Sylphide as a haggis), and examples of
Eurotorment, not least Wim Vanderkeybus' Mountains made of barking about a
trip to North Africa. There were unlikely callers. The Spanish National
Ballet looked both un-Spanish and un-balletic. The feeble Cape Ballet's
visit was premature. Takarazuka offered cohorts of Japanese ladies and
gentlemen (who were also ladies), a stuffed sea-gull, and inscrutable
performance. There were unspeakable others.
I derived great pleasure from the Opera Ballet in Paris. The company is
crammed with tremendous dancers, young talents nipping at the heels of the
etoiles, as I noted in programmes devoted to Jeunes danseurs and bravura
accounts of Etudes and Le Palais de cristal. The repertory was imaginative -
three assured creations by Roland Petit; a Nijinsky evening which brought an
odd guess at his Tyl Eulenspiegel - and interpretation was superb, with
glorious dancing by Elisabeth Platel (a sublime Nikiya), Monique Loudieres,
Manuel Legris and the newest etoile, Nicholas le Riche, among many others.
I reported on the San Francisco Ballet's Paris appearance with Mark Morris's
daring Maelstrom; on the Royal Swedish Ballet's excellent Don Quixote with
the gifted young Jan-Erik Wikstrom; on the celebrations which marked Frank
Andersen's jubilee with the Royal Danish Ballet; on the Royal Ballet of
Flanders' engaging Coppelia. I reported on an awful Coppelia staged by Oleg
Vinogradov for the Kirov Ballet, and on that company's frigid account of
Fountain of Bakhchisaray, an important old Soviet ballet made bearable only
by Sylvie Guillem's physical passion.
For an Honours List of performances, I must nominate Stephen Jefferies'
commanding Drosselmeyer in the Royal Ballet's Nutcracker, a poetic heart for
the staging. In a year when Sleeping Beauty was put on the rack at Covent
Garden, Scottish Ballet's modest version was illuminated by Ludmila
Semenyaka, whose exquisite Aurora told of the grandest Russian classicism,
and I saluted Yurie Shinohara's sweetly danced Princess Florine in the same
staging. The Kirov ballerina Lubov Kunakova was a Giselle in the great
tradition, on tour with the small but serious Moscow Festival Ballet. Cumbre
Flamenca came back to London, feet and souls a-fire, and Mariquilla and
Juana Amaya tore like things divinely possessed into the dance.
In its unfussed Giselle, gallant London City Ballet showed us the touching
artistry of Kim Miller. English National Ballet's Thomas Edur is an
impeccable classical artist, noble in means and expression. His Prince in
Sleeping Beauty was an interpretation of first importance. Irek Mukhamedov,
a dancer of unique power, found meaning and truth in every role. From Sylvie
Guillem, a vivid Natalya in A Month in the Country - Jonathan Cope and Sarah
Wildor excellent as Belyayev and Vera in this same ballet - while Guillem's
blazing Kitri cast welcome light amid the dankness of Covent Garden's Don
Quixote.
The Bolshoi Ballet, riven by problems about artistic policies and structural
survival, cancelled a regional tour. Rambert Dance was re-launched with a
repertory that did less than justice to a fine roster of dancers. Birmingham
Royal Ballet staged three important revivals: Ninette de Valois' Job,
Ashton's Enigma Variations, and Massine's Le Tricorne. The company also
acquired Agnes de Mille's Fall River Legend, hokum justified by the presence
of Marion Tait, a dramatic artist of wonderful intelligence. English
National Ballet continued to show strong dancing, and its medium-scale tour
of the regions brought a clever XNTricities from Mauro Bigonzetti, which was
given a ripsnorting performance, while a welcome staging of Balanchine's
Square Dance had the dashing young Giuseppe Picone in it. ENB's new Giselle
was wrong-headed in its 1920s Austrian setting, but Derek Deane respected
the text and made the second act properly haunted.
The most haunted staging of the year was the Royal Ballet's misbegotten
Sleeping Beauty. Anthony Dowell's production sank beneath Maria Bjornson's
capricious ideas of baroque architecture and costuming. I thought it an
unmitigated disaster, unworthily danced. An Ashton celebration was a good
idea let down by weak casting and unidiomatic style, not to be excused by
injury. What used to be subtle, musically and physically deft, looked
coarse, numb. The company put on works by Ashley Page, Matthew Hart, William
Tuckett - its Dance Bites tour with new short choreographies an excellent
scheme - but it is disquieting to see a national ballet so uncomfortable
with both its classical and Ashtonian birthright. The treasures of its
repertory need to be re-furbished, and polished. Another Forsythe ballet and
a revival of the flaccid La Ronde later this season are no answer to
anything, save an unwise quest for the modish and the mediocre. New Year
resolutions need to be made in Floral Street.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Destination France -
French attempts at direct marketing in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jill Lucas was wondering where to go with her top 50 sales people when she
received a leaflet in the mail suggesting she take them to the south of
France.
Lucas, marketing executive of Rentokil Healthcare, had once taken a sales
group to Paris, but she thought the south of France option was probably too
expensive. The leaflet persuaded her otherwise, and in October she took the
sales people, who had exceeded their targets in selling washroom soaps and
related products, to Nice.
Lucas was one of the successes of a marketing campaign launched three years
ago by the UK branch of the French Government Tourist Office.
Bernard Crouset, deputy director of the London office, says that, like most
tourist boards, the French organisation had traditionally been reactive. It
saw its job as responding to queries from people planning to visit France
and to show the country's wares at trade fairs. It did not approach
potential visitors directly. Instead, it advertised France in the newspapers
and on television.
But the French tourist board decided to see whether direct marketing - which
has long been used to sell products and services - could be used to promote
a country. In particular, the tourist board wanted to know how to approach
directly the managers in companies who organise conferences and 'incentive
trips', given as rewards to successful staff members.
The French organisation decided to try its direct marketing in the UK first
because France was already a well-established destination for British
travellers.
Conference and incentive trip visitors are valuable customers because they
spend so much more than leisure tourists. Their flight and hotel expenses
have usually been paid for by their employers, leaving them with more
spending money than tourists.
Those going on conference trips also tend to be achievers with higher levels
of disposable income than many tourists.
The French tourist office asked the Marketing Organisation, a UK company, to
compile a database of managers in British organisations responsible for
conference venues.
The Marketing Organisation compiled a list of 3,000 UK decision-makers and
wrote to them directly. If they expressed an interest in visiting a
particular region of France, tourist and conference officials from that area
would be brought to the UK to press their case.
Emmet Hart, the Marketing Organisation's sales and marketing director, says
keeping the database up to date is an onerous task. In constantly revising
the database, the Marketing Organisation has found that about 25 per cent of
its information becomes out of date each year as conference decision-makers
move to other positions or to other companies.
Crouset insists, however, that the effort is worth it. First, the direct
marketing of France in the UK has turned out to be remarkably cheap. The
budget for the whole programme is only Pounds 240,000 a year, of which the
tourist office pays only a quarter. The remainder has been met by the
various French regional governments and by Air France.
Second, Crouset says that over the past four years France has doubled its
share of the overseas-bound UK conference and incentive trip market to 25
per cent.
Not everything has gone France's way, however. The strength of the French
franc against sterling has made France a less attractive destination for UK
travellers than it has been in previous years.
Crouset says France also faces strong competition from destinations such as
Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Cyprus. Several other tourist boards, he says,
are thinking about following the French and marketing themselves directly to
UK conference organisers.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): All aboard the
nature tour - Australia is waking up to ecotourism, but so are the
unscrupulous operators, finds Nikki Tait
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

<TEXT>
The promotional brochure is seductive. There are pictures of stark rocky
hillsides rising from translucent waters, bathed in a purplish light.
Inside, on grain-flecked paper, the Tasmanian holiday operator promises 'a
place which remains pure, unpolluted and free from man's heavy hand'.
Only the price - ADollars 895 (Pounds 445) for a four-day walking tour, with
three nights accommodation - seems a little steep. But, then again, it is
not every day that one can stay in a 'minimal impact' lodge, which depends
on solar-electric energy, composting toilet technology and stores its rain
water.
Ecotourism - that is, nature-based holiday activity that aims to leave the
environment intact - has become something of a buzzword within the leisure
industry. A little belatedly, Australia is scrambling on board. Its federal
government launched a national ecotourism strategy this year and backed up
the fine words with ADollars 10m.
There are two main reasons for the official enthusiasm. First, the concept
appears tailor-made for the country. With a population of 18m spread around
a land mass the size of the US, Australia has always sold heavily on its raw
and impressive natural features.
Official figures suggest that 90 per cent of international visitors come for
non-business reasons, and that perhaps 80 per cent already spend part of
their time on extended outdoor activities - even if it is only jumping the
surf at Sydney's Bondi beach, or viewing the fairy penguins on Victoria's
Phillip Island.
Second, the nation has big ambitions for its tourism industry. Yet it has
seen enough unattractive development on its own shores and among Asian
neighbours' to be aware of the dangers of unfettered expansion. The
skyscraper condominium buildings that line Queensland's Gold Coast and shade
the beaches serve as a warning. The Tourism Forecasting Council recently
predicted that the country could attract 6.2m visitors by 2000, double the
number arriving in 1993.
But while the concept seems admirable in theory, Australia is finding that
marketing ecotourism is not without problems.
For a start, definitions of ecotourism are fuzzy, and it is relatively easy
for less scrupulous operators to jump on the 'ecotour' bandwagon. As the
Wilderness Society pointed out recently: 'Four-wheel driving and horse
riding do not belong in more remote areas of the bush . . . and could
scarcely be called ecotourism. Currently, however, there is nothing to stop
such ventures painting a big ecotour operator sign on the side of their
vehicle.'
Even the most scrupulous customer can be misled. One consumer advocate group
points to the numerous companies offering adventure or nature cruises around
Queensland's Barrier Reef. While these sound harmless and the promotional
material is thick with pictures of clear water and marine life, many dump
sewage at sea.
In an effort to address these problems, the government has proposed a formal
system of accreditation for ecotour operators, and asked for comment. In
general, environmentalists think the notion is fine in principle. Already
there is debate over who should supervise the scheme, how big industry's
input should be, and where the standards should be set.
Ideology may be running ahead of the market. Sydney, the starting-point for
many international visitors, does boast one travel agency specialising in
ecotours, but many of the conventional travel consultants blink at the
concept.
'It is not something people request, although they are usually pleased to
hear about environmental features,' says the Australian Travel &amp; Information
Centre. 'I think it will come - but in the main, people really don't care
when they're travelling,' says Jack Dart, head of the Australian Federation
of Travel Agents.
Australian Consumers Association, which was involved in publishing an
ecotourism guide last year, reports an uninspiring response to the book, the
first of its kind in Australia. A report form at the back asked readers to
comment on the 300-plus holiday operators listed. Just one non-industry
response came in.
Related to this is the question of the commercial viability of ecotourism
projects. The more genuine environmental efforts - such as the Tasmanian
example - usually entail an extra cost for their operators. While this can
be passed on to dedicated environmentalists, the scope for a rival operator
to undercut and lure away less committed consumers is considerable.
'If you're saving the last blade of grass, the resort has to generate the
funds to justify it . . . and if the resort goes under and is vacant, that's
the worst kind of ecological damage,' notes Dart.
Phil Young, managing director of P&amp;O Holidays Australasia, which is probably
the country's largest ecotourism operator and runs environmentally-friendly
lodges in Tasmania and Queensland, is more optimistic. He points out that
much depends on the resort's position. A careful ecotourism operator, he
says, will always aim for an element of 'scarcity'.
For example, P&amp;O runs a resort on Heron Island which, unlike most resort
islands in the area, is part of the Barrier Reef. The only other occupants
are a marine research station and a ranger base for the National Park. All
waste is recycled or barged back to the mainland, and by agreement P&amp;O is
responsible for the supply of services to the whole island.
'You get benefits in other ways,' he adds. 'There tends to be higher
occupancy, you don't have to discount, and advertising costs less. Moreover,
with a number of medium-sized eco-resorts, you start to get economies of
scale in management. But a very small operation would be difficult to make
work.'

FT  29 DEC 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Perrier's 'eau'
returns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Perrier 'eau' puns, one of the most memorable advertising campaigns of
the 1980s, will be making a come back early next year after a five-year
break.
'We had to give 'eau' a rest,' says Wenche Marshall Foster, chairwoman of
Perrier UK. As the UK recession began to bite, 'it reminded people of the
old times'. The theme's light-heartedness was not working as well for
consumers concerned about negative equity, she adds.
Moreover, the company wanted an advertisement change to go with the relaunch
of the brand in the spring of 1990 after a contamination problem at its
French bottling plant.
Life after a classic campaign is never easy for a brand and its agency. In
Perrier's case, subsequent advertising evolved from a 'visually shocking'
approach to the current line of Everything Else Isn't. The television
advertisements are 'full of sounds, symbols and imagery so relevant to the
1990s youth culture', the company says.
'We have retained huge loyalty among people in their late 20s and older, but
during the recession we have lost those younger Perrier drinkers who had to
pull in their belts,' says Marshall Foster. Peter Thomas, commercial and
marketing director of Perrier UK, emphasises this point: 'We were not
necessarily hitting the buttons of the young consumer.'
The bottled water market is fragmented by products and types of consumer, so
the challenge is to find a flexible theme which will work for many audiences
in various media.
Perrier and its agency Publicis believe a new 'eau' campaign will achieve
that. 'Eau' has never been far away. Thomas admits the walls of Perrier UK's
Hertfordshire headquarters are covered with 14 years of the ads. Eau-la-la,
eau nouveau, bistreau, Picasseau, H2Eau, rainbeau, eau naturel and eausis
were but a handful of the variations.
'But this time, it will look very different. The pun idea is back but it
will be more visual.'

FT  29 DEC 94 / Bank rate likely to be unchanged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the
Bank of England, reviewed monetary policy yesterday amid expectations that
they would leave interest rates unchanged at least until their next meeting
on February 2.
As usual, neither the Treasury nor the Bank would reveal the conclusion of
the hour-long talks, which were brought forward from early January because
Mr Clarke leaves this week for a 12-day trade promotion tour in Malaysia,
Thailand and Vietnam.
However, speaking after the meeting, Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury minister,
made clear that there would be no change in the thrust of policy in spite of
weak consumer confidence.
He told BBC radio's The World at One that the government would continue to
set interest rates to maintain the momentum of recovery while bearing down
on inflation.
Analysts said they did not expect any decision to raise rates would emerge
because the last meeting, when the chancellor increased base rates by 0.5
percentage points to 6.25 per cent on Mr George's recommendation, was only
on December 7.
Although the City believes rates must rise further to curb inflationary
pressures, there has been little economic news since then.
Yesterday's discussions finished before publication of yesterday's report
from the Confederation of British Industry pointing to a rise in pay
settlements.
The talks also came too soon to evaluate retail trends before and after
Christmas.
The minutes of the November monetary meeting, released last week, showed the
chancellor expressing some concern about the effect that tax rises announced
before last month's Budget might have on consumer demand.
Mr Nelson predicted that the government's unpopular decisions of reducing
public expenditure and increasing taxes would yield political as well as
economic dividends.
The minister forecast that personal disposable income would increase next
year in spite of tax increases and that there would be 'further progress'
both for government finances and those of the British people.
However, the Treasury's monthly monetary report for January said 'continuing
steady growth' in the economy was 'concentrated in the company sector'.

FT  29 DEC 94 / C&amp;G warns members not to snub Lloyds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society is to issue a blunt statement
telling its members that if they do not approve the Pounds 1.8bn cash offer
from Lloyds Bank, the board intends C&amp;G to remain a building society.
The statement will dismay those C&amp;G members who believe the society could
command a higher price or should become a public limited company on its own.
But it is likely to increase the prospect that any member who wants a share
of the cash incentives will vote for this deal, instead of holding out for
the possibility of a larger handout from a new offer.
The Pounds 1.8bn offered by Lloyds is to be shared mainly among investing
members of more than two years' standing, and depositors. C&amp;G estimates that
the average total payment to an individual will be about Pounds 2,000.
If C&amp;G remains a society, there will be no distribution of cash to members.
The warning that only the Lloyds bid will be put to members and that the
board does not mean to give them a chance to consider other options is
contained in the draft transfer document.
It is due to be sent to all 1m-plus C&amp;G members late in February before they
vote on the plans at a special general meeting on March 31. The move must be
approved by two separate resolutions, from borrowers and investors.
A simple majority of borrowers taking part in the vote is enough to pass
their resolution, but the investors' resolution must be passed by both 75
per cent of those voting and 50 per cent of those eligible to vote.
Before the deal was announced in April, Lloyds agreed with C&amp;G that the
board would not put any other offer to its members for an undisclosed length
of time to preclude a rival bid.
Under building society legislation, a society's board does not have to give
members the opportunity to vote on a proposed offer or takeover bid unless
it wants to.
By far the most likely prospect is that the Lloyds deal will go ahead.
However, even the faintest suggestion that if it does not C&amp;G will stay as a
society is likely to surprise senior executives in other societies.
Many of them regard takeover by a bank as the logical conclusion to C&amp;G's
strategy of concentrating on being a low-cost provider of mortgages and
savings accounts, instead of diversifying into a broader range of personal
financial services as other societies have done.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Cost of house insurance develops a bout of subsidence: What
is good news for consumers is less so for shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales fever is spreading to house insurance.
Halifax, the UK's largest building society, last week announced cuts
averaging 20 per cent for building cover. Since then evidence has grown of
an escalating price war.
AA Insurance, which sells policies on behalf of 40 insurers, yesterday said
the average cost of house contents policies had fallen by more than 1 per
cent since July. It would have been greater if the 2.5 per cent Insurance
Premium Tax had not been imposed in October.
The AA's latest insurance price survey, due for release early next year,
shows rates for building insurance policies dropping by about 2.5 per cent
since July, excluding IPT.
Churchill Insurance, one of the new breed of 'direct insurers' selling via
the telephone and cutting out brokers' commissions, said its buildings
policies were 7 per cent cheaper than a year ago. Contents premiums have
fallen 2 per cent.
Cornhill Insurance, which offers building and contents insurance, yesterday
announced that it was following Halifax's lead in offering no-claims
discounts on some household policies as well as discounts for older
policyholders.
Such signs are good news for consumers who, in recent years, have become
accustomed to crime and bad weather leading to rapidly rising insurance
premiums. They are less welcome for shareholders, who have seen profit
forecasts cut for large insurance companies - many of which have only
recently returned to making healthy profits.
Several factors are increasing competition. Most obviously, fast-growing
'direct' sellers such as Churchill and Royal Bank of Scotland's Direct Line
are anxious to build market share in the home insurance sector. But
consumers are also becoming more price sensitive.
Traditionally, most structure and contents policies have been sold by
building societies at the same time as mortgages. More than half of people
taking out combined policies for the first time continue to use this route,
according to a survey earlier this year by NOP, the polling organisation.
But the number of policyholders switching from one company to another -
currently about 10 per cent a year - is increasing, NOP suggested.
Worryingly for banks and building societies, which in recent years have
enjoyed healthy profits from selling insurance products, about 21 per cent
of 'switchers' choose direct insurers.
Such trends explain Halifax's high-profile price cuts last week. But
building societies have another reason for examining the cost of insurance
products they sell. From next year Treasury rules are expected to allow
societies to underwrite, as well as distribute, insurance policies.
That will put pressure on the current system by which societies sell polices
provided by composite insurers (most of Halifax home insurance products, for
instance, are supplied by Sun Alliance). There will be a big incentive for
societies to cut costs and take a greater share of profits by becoming
insurers in their own right.
Certainly the scope for cutting household insurance premiums further is
considerable. Over the past year insurance companies have benefited not only
from higher premiums set in previous years, but also from a dramatic fall in
subsidence claims, helped by wetter weather. Theft has fallen too, while
natural disasters have been infrequent.
Computers allow insurers to assess risks more accurately, enabling them to
set premiums almost on a household by household basis. For instance, Royal
Insurance says it uses all the characters of postcodes to judge likely
claims.
Typically, insurance companies are this year reporting underwriting profits
of about 20 per cent on household insurance premiums - far higher than for
most other insurance products. Profit margins are still higher when income
earned by insurance companies from investing premiums is added. Building
societies and brokers take another slice of the price paid by policyholders.
The size of that cushion illustrates the room for insurers cutting prices
next year - and still making a decent return. 'You can halve the profit
margin and it's still very exciting,' said Mr John Chester, insurance expert
at SG Warburg.
But as they cut premiums, insurers will have at least half an eye on the
longer term. Household insurance policies have to make substantial returns
most years because once in a while there is a large natural disaster
resulting in big losses. The UK has escaped lightly in recent years so there
are insurance bargains to be had. But good times cannot last for ever.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Wales and west face further floods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Parts of England and Wales face severe flooding with weather forecasters
warning of more torrential rain and gales this week.
The National Rivers Authority said yesterday several big rivers were close
to bursting their banks after heavy rain over the Christmas holiday.
In England, the south-west and the west Midlands were the worst affected,
with the authority issuing more than 25 flood warnings. Train journeys were
disrupted and holidaymakers returning to work experienced long delays.
Police issued warnings to motorists in the south of England. The London
Weather Centre last night forecast gales gusting up to 70 mph accompanied by
heavy rain.
In Wales the situation showed signs of easing last night. The NRA said: 'It
looks now as if the worst of the rainfall has passed. If the situation stays
like that we should begin to see water levels falling.'
However, many rivers, including the Wye, were still on 'red' alert.
Around Dartmoor and Exmoor recently completed defensive schemes averted much
of the flood danger.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Tec chairman's contracts defended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The awarding of contracts by a training and enterprise council to a company
owned by one of its board members was defended yesterday by the Tec National
Council.
Essex Training and Enterprise Council awarded a contract to a business owned
by Mr Roy Lawrence without going through competitive tendering, it emerged
yesterday.
Mr Lawrence, former chairman of Essex Tec, said that in 1991 Mr Philip
Howard, then chief executive, appointed Raytel Insurance Brokers - a company
Mr Lawrence then owned - to arrange insurance cover and pensions without
accepting formal bids from other brokers.
Mr Howard said that when the Tec could not find a 'suitable broker' for its
insurance cover, Mr Lawrence 'offered the help of his broker manager'. The
Tec decided to place its business with Raytel after talking to a few other
brokers because 'the deal was by far the best'.
Mr Lawrence said he did not take part in the decision and fully declared his
interests.
The Department of Employment, which provides about Pounds 2bn in funding to
the 82 employer-led Tecs, which administer government-funded training in
England and Wales, requires all contracts to be awarded impartially. In an
audit of Essex Tec's bidding procedures last year, it said it found 'no
reason to think any impropriety has occurred'.
Mr Howard said that in late 1991 Mr Albert Gable, then head of finance,
asked Raytel to arrange personal pensions for some staff members, again
without putting the contract out to tender.
Mr Gable left the Tec in late 1993, and yesterday refused to comment on the
arrangements.
In May 1993 Mr Michael Clegg took over as chief executive and reviewed the
Tec's pension scheme. A number of brokers were invited to bid for the
account, and Mr Clegg chose to transfer all 30 plans which were placed with
Raytel to the Tec National Pension Scheme.
Mr Chris Humphries, director of policy and strategy at the Tec National
Council, said: 'The whole point of a Tec is that it is based in a community
and requires you to have local people on your board.'

FT  29 DEC 94 / Loss of job hits two in five workers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly two out of every five workers have recently experienced unemployment,
according to unpublished figures from the Department of Employment released
today by Ms Harriet Harman, shadow employment secretary.
The proportion is highest among men. About 6.9m or 44 per cent of the male
workforce have been jobless at some time since 1990. This contrasts with
3.9m women, a third of the female workforce.
Ms Harman said the figures included only those who had been officially
registered as unemployed and the true figure was probably higher.
'These figures explain why people at work continue to feel insecure,' Ms
Harman said. 'They know from their own personal experience that unemployment
is a threat which constantly hangs over them.'

FT  29 DEC 94 / Business flocks to Blair Euro seminar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly 100 European companies are to attend a ground-breaking Labour seminar
to be held in Brussels next month in a fresh indication that business is
starting to take the party seriously, David Owen writes.
The Pounds 500-a-head event, to be called Labour Working in Europe, will be
attended by Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader.
The seminar is expected to make a sizeable contribution to Labour's
fast-growing fighting fund for the next general election. According to one
conference organiser, the party's profit is likely to run into tens of
thousands of pounds.
Scores of blue-chip companies in sectors including financial services,
natural resources, tobacco and telecommunications have reserved places at
the event, which will take place in the afternoon and evening of January 10.
Mr Blair will make what is billed as a keynote speech setting out his agenda
for Europe. The event will be addressed by Mr Klaus Hansch, president of the
European parliament.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Minister rapped on Pounds 6m coal subsidy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A coal subsidy scheme which helped ministers suppress a backbench revolt
over pit closures has so far cost the government only Pounds 6m of the
several hundreds of millions it indicated were available.
The disclosure, in a written answer by Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, to Mr
Paddy Tipping, Labour MP for Sherwood, yesterday prompted a dismissive
response from Labour.
Mr Brian Wilson, a frontbench trade and industry spokesman, said the figure
was 'another reminder of how cheaply Tory rebellions are bought off with
promises which are never significantly delivered on'.
If the figure of Pounds 6m had been quoted at the time, Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, would have been 'submerged in
ridicule', he said.
Mr Richard Caborn, Labour chairman of the Commons trade and industry
committee, said the figure proved the subsidy was 'a cosmetic exercise'. He
said: 'There were so many hoops that companies had to go through to achieve
the subsidy that it became impossible.'
Mr Eggar told Mr Tipping that the government had so far made seven offers of
subsidy. The Pounds 6.11m paid out covered the sale of 'almost 600,000
tonnes of additional coal'.
The promise of subsidies was a cornerstone of a government strategy outlined
in March 1993 in which ministers 'reprieved' 12 pits from closure while
British Coal looked for markets for their coal.
In its coal white paper, the government said it was prepared to 'embrace the
range of figures' on subsidies put forward by the trade and industry
committee.
The committee had sought a subsidy until 1998, saying the total cost would
be unlikely to exceed Pounds 500m.
Most of the reprieved pits have since closed, along with several others
which then looked safe. However, the strategy enabled the government to
defeat an opposition motion over its coal policy.

FT  29 DEC 94 / British Gas attacked over cut in leak checks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas found itself caught in another storm yesterday as a leaked memo
showed sharp cuts in its budget for checking gas leaks.
The memo - sent out on December 5 by the company's newly created gas
transportation arm Transco - said 'revised procedures' would permit a cut
from Pounds 9m to Pounds 1m a year now that safety had improved and pipeline
modernisation was nearing completion.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, shadow consumer minister, who published the memo, said:
'British Gas cannot give an assurance that safety standards will not be
reduced following a budget cut of this magnitude.
'This cut was planned and implemented in secret. Neither key safety
employees nor the unions were consulted. Even British Gas's own workforce
has not been told how levels of safety will be maintained on a ninth of the
former budget.'
He demanded that Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, hold an inquiry into the
justification for the move.
The cut affects the continuous surveying British Gas carries out on its
thousands of miles of gas pipelines nationally. Much of the system has
recently had its cast iron pipes replaced with plastic.
British Gas denied that safety was being put at risk. It said it would be
'realigning' its survey to concentrate on those parts of the system that
were more at risk or susceptible to leaks. This was 'a better use of
resources'. The change followed an 18-month review and 'benchmarking'
against US practice.
The leaked memo comes after two recent gas accidents - one in which an
explosion destroyed a house and another where a couple were found dead of
asphyxiation on Christmas day.
Mr Ian Powe, director of the Gas Consumers Council, said the Health and
Safety Executive should intervene to ensure that British Gas 'has not
sacrificed yet another principle of public service in its unseemly race to
reduce costs and keep competitors at bay'. The cuts had a 'whiff of
over-confidence', he said.
Mr Jim Waller of Unison, the public services union, said: 'Many employees
feel this reduction is . . . an accident waiting to happen.' He could not
see how the company could make a cut of this size without harming safety
standards.
British Gas is still embroiled in controversy over its decision to grant a
Pounds 205,000 pay rise to Mr Cedric Brown, its chief executive, while
asking showroom employees to take cuts in holidays and pay.
The company has said all these actions are designed to make the company more
commercial before the gas market is liberalised in 1998.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Scheme submitted for Pounds 4.5bn airport
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A private-sector consortium has submitted plans to build a Pounds 4.5bn
airport in the Vale of the White Horse area of Oxfordshire near Abingdon.
Provisionally called Lox, the airport would have two runways, be privately
financed and owned, and operated by airlines. It is thought it could be open
by 2007.
The plan faces fierce opposition as it would be on a greenfield site and
would affect more than 3,000 houses.
The consortium includes Ove Arup, the engineering company, and Pleiade
Associates, the Bristol-based architects, designers and planning
consultants.
The application would in the first instance be considered by Oxford county
council, with the Department of the Environment having the final say.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Exports rise boosts Vauxhall output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vauxhall, the General Motors subsidiary, has increased vehicle production by
5.9 per cent this year helped by a recovery in exports to continental
Europe.
Exports of the Vauxhall Cavalier (badged Opel Vectra) and Astra - which fell
by 62 per cent in 1993 to only 39,932 - have more than doubled this year to
86,358, the company said yesterday.
Total exports, including car-derived vans, have risen by 99.5 per cent to
91,535 this year and have more than compensated for a 15.6 per cent drop in
output for the domestic market to 168,308.
Vauxhall's total vehicle production increased to 259,843 from 245,313 a year
ago.
LDV, formerly Leyland Daf Vans, is planning to re-enter the main volume
markets of continental Europe in 1995, two years after it was rescued by a
management buy-out from the financial collapse of the former Daf group.
The company, which has maintained a small dealer network in Spain, said it
aimed to establish sales and marketing channels in Germany, France, the
Netherlands and Belgium.
The company has increased production by 36.4 per cent to 12,509 this year,
helped by the recovery of the UK market.
The workforce has grown from 960 to more than 1,200 during the year.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Labour hits at Guinness delays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday warned that the City of London's international reputation
could be at stake as it attacked the government's handling of the decision
to refer the cases of the four men convicted over the Guinness affair to the
Court of Appeal.
Mr Alistair Darling, a shadow Treasury spokesman, said there would be
'immense political repercussions for the government' if the Guinness
convictions were overturned. The reputation of the City of London was 'bound
to be damaged,' he said.
Mr Darling was speaking after it emerged that Mr Michael Howard, the home
secretary, decided to refer the cases of the four men to the Court of Appeal
shortly after lawyers for two of them started legal proceedings against him.
In the three days before Mr Howard's decision was announced, solicitors
acting for Mr Gerald Ronson, the property developer, and Mr Anthony Parnes,
the former stockbroker, applied for a judicial review of the home
secretary's failure to reach a decision on reopening the cases.
Mr Darling said: 'No home secretary should ever find himself in a position
of having to make a decision of this magnitude in 72 hours. The government
had been aware of possible problems with the Guinness prosecution for some
considerable time.'
Mr Darling called for the current review of the Serious Fraud Office, which
brought the prosecution, to be 'brought to a head' early in the new year. It
was difficult to overestimate the importance of a system of policing that
commanded confidence, he said.
'If the policing system is fundamentally flawed, it is worse than having no
system at all.' Labour would be urging an early government statement on the
issue.
Lawyers connected with the cases of the four men expect it will be months
rather than weeks before they are heard by the Court of Appeal.
The timing could prove difficult for the Serious Fraud Office, which next
May faces another legal challenge to its Guinness prosecutions.
Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman, is to ask the European
Court of Human Rights to uphold and make legally binding a judgment of the
European Commission of Human Rights that his trial was unfair because it
heard evidence given by him under compulsion to trade department inspectors.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Hualon chief on share charges
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Oung Ta-ming, a Taiwanese tycoon and legislator, was indicted for share
price manipulation yesterday after a spate of payment defaults sent the
island's stock market tumbling nearly 15 per cent in one week during
October.
Mr Oung is the effective head of the Hualon group, which includes a textile
company earmarked to receive a UK government grant of Pounds 61m for a
project in Northern Ireland.
The Taipei district court formally charged Mr Oung and 33 others with
offences including violation of securities transaction laws, breach of trust
and embezzlement. The maximum sentence is seven years in prison.
Prosecutors determined there was a case for Mr Oung to answer. He allegedly
masterminded price-rigging of shares in Imperial Hotel through Hung Fu
Securities, a brokerage indirectly controlled by him. With backing from
underground financiers, Mr Oung and his aides were alleged to have lifted
the share price from TDollars 30 in January 1993 to a high of TDollars 402
in August 1994.
The district prosecutor, Mr Chou Chi-jung, said that even as investigations
into alleged share price manipulation proceeded, Mr Oung and his associates
endeavoured to push the share price higher to continue borrowing money from
financiers.
'Links between financial flows from stock manipulation and his (Oung's)
personal bank account and (those of his associates) are very close,' Mr Chou
said.
The case was the third big stock market controversy in four years linked to
Mr Oung, who, with other family members, controls a group of companies
believed to be the island's 10th biggest industrial group.
The largest of these is Hualon-Teijran Corp, a listed textile concern, which
earlier this year said it would build a Pounds 157m textile plant in Ulster
with UK government subsidies. Hualon-Teijran was not named in indictment
documents released by prosecutors yesterday. Mr Oung is believed to control
the company but occupies no formal position.
He was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in jail for his role in a 1990 share scandal
which led to the fall of a cabinet minister but following appeals the
sentence was reduced to to 26 months.
Mr Oung has yet to be imprisoned because he was elected to a parliamentary
seat as an independent in December 1992, entitling him to virtual immunity
from detention and arrest.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Bangkok slashes tariffs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES

<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Thailand is from January 1 to slash tariffs on nearly 4,000 kinds of
imports, with the emphasis on raw materials and semi-manufactured goods for
industry. The move will cut import duties from 100 per cent to a maximum 30
per cent by 1997.
The new rates will reduce the average tariff on nearly all imports,
excluding farm produce, from 39.24 per cent to 17.61 per cent when fully
implemented.
The deepest cuts in certain sensitive categories will have to wait until
1997. Mr Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, finance minister, said: 'We need this
reform to create an effective link between the Thai and global economies.'
The measures would cost the government Bt11.43bn (Pounds 291m) in 1995 and
Bt6.24bn in 1997.
The tariff system will also be trimmed from 36 different taxes to six.
These will range from no tariff on medical equipment, 1 per cent on raw
materials such as coal, and electronic parts, 5 per cent for machinery and
computers, 10 per cent for intermediate goods, 20 per cent for finished
products, to 30 per cent on goods such as silk and leather products, these
last two thought to need fairly high protection.
The petroleum industry bears tariffs ranging from 30 per cent on naphtha to
60 per cent on plastic pellets. These fall to 1 per cent for naphtha in 1995
and to 30 per cent on plastic pellets by 1997. Artificial and knitted
fabrics will have duties cut from 60 to 40 per cent in 1995, and to 20 per
cent in 1997.
The government can afford to lower tariffs partly because of value added
tax.

Opposition members of Bangladesh's parliament last night resigned en masse
in an attempt to oust the government of Mrs Khaleda Zia, writes Reazuddin
Ahmed in Dhaka.
The opposition has been boycotting parliamentary sessions for 10 months to
press home their demand for early polls conducted under a non-partisan
caretaker government to allay the fear of election-rigging by the ruling
party.
The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party agreed to an opposition proposal
that the prime minister resign 30 days before the next general election, due
in February 1996. But a deal foundered on BNP demands that the opposition
refrain from calling general strikes and blockades during the next year.

FT  29 DEC 94 / US envoy presses North Korea to release pilot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A senior US diplomat arrived in Pyongyang yesterday to seek the release of a
US army pilot whose detention by North Korea threatens its recent nuclear
agreement with Washington.
The visit by Mr Thomas Hubbard, a deputy assistant secretary of state,
follows that of a US congressman who last week helped to arrange the return
of the body of the pilot's colleague, killed in the crash of their
helicopter in North Korea.
North Korea has said that it has delayed the repatriation of the captured
pilot, Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall, because he has not co-operated in
its investigation of the straying of the OH-58 reconnaissance helicopter
into its airspace.
Pyongyang claims the helicopter was on a spying mission and the North has
demanded an acknowledgement of guilt and an apology from the US. Last night
North Korea said the pilot had confessed to intruding deep into its
territory on a reconnaissance mission and had asked for forgiveness. The
official news agency quoted Hall as saying: 'I admit that this criminal
action is inexcusable and unpardonable. However, at home my parents, wife
and kids are anxiously waiting for my return.'
Washington said the helicopter flew into North Korea because of a
navigational error.
Analysts believe other reasons may account for North Korea's reluctance to
release the pilot. One possibility is that North Korea is trying to exploit
the incident to gain new concessions from the US. Pyongyang has been
pressing Washington to sign a peace treaty that would formally end the
Korean war of 1950-53, in the hope that this would eventually lead to the
withdrawal of the 37,000 US troops in South Korea.
North Korea could argue that the helicopter incident underscores the need
for such a peace treaty.
It may also try to use the incident as a means to force the US to accelerate
the establishment of diplomatic ties with Pyongyang, as promised under the
bilateral nuclear accord concluded in October.
The US also agreed to guarantee international aid, including the supply of
safer light-water reactors, if North Korea dismantled its current nuclear
programme, which is suspected of producing weapons-grade plutonium.
However, such a diplomatic strategy carries risks for North Korea since US
congressional critics of the nuclear agreement may use the continued
detention of the pilot as a reason to block the deal.
US critics of the accord believe that it offers too many concessions to
North Korea. Senator Bob Dole, who is soon to become US Senate majority
leader, was quoted yesterday as calling the agreement 'a lousy deal' and
adding, 'you can't trust the North Koreans'.
Mr Lee Hamilton, outgoing chairman of the US House of Representatives
foreign relations committee, said: 'I don't think we'd proceed with our side
of the nuclear accord if they don't release the airman.'
Even so, the delay may also reflect deep divisions between North Korea
leaders over the nuclear agreement. Some South Korean officials believe that
the Northern military is at odds with its government over whether to proceed
with the agreement.

FT  29 DEC 94 / 'Shift towards Asia' for steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A shift in the global pattern of steel production and consumption
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
towards Asia and away from central and eastern Europe - is forecast this
week for the remainder of the 1990s.
By the end of the decade, Asian countries will be consuming nearly 47 per
cent of the world's steel, compared with 34 per cent in 1990, according to a
study by Meps (Europe), the Sheffield steel consultancy.
Over the same period, Asian production will have climbed from 31 per cent of
the global total to nearly 40 per cent, it predicts.
The forecast underlines the importance to the world steel industry of Asian
markets, buoyed by increasing domestic demand because of strong economic
growth rates.
Production of steel in Asia is forecast to rise by 50m tonnes, or 19 per
cent, to 316m tonnes between 1994 and 2000. China will account for the
biggest share of the increase: its output is forecast to rise by 22.5m
tonnes to 113m. The extra production will probably meet the higher demand
for steel in China, says Meps, but it will remain a net importer of steel
well into the next century.
Production in South Korea will continue increasing, reaching 41.5m tonnes by
2000, while Indian steel production is also forecast to grow in the second
half of the 1990s. New capacity is coming on stream in India and more is
likely to be installed.
Meanwhile, the Asean countries will all increase their production to meet at
least part of the higher steel demand. New manufacturing plants for
engineering products will create a strong demand for steel.
Elsewhere, Latin America, South Africa, Iran and Australia will also
increase their share of world production. The main loser, says Meps, will be
the former Soviet Union, as compared with 1990. But even here, growth in
output is expected from 1995, and many east European countries are already
reporting increases in output.
The traditional steelmaking regions - Europe, Japan and the US - will all
have a lower share of total steel production in 2000, says the study.
But the cake will be larger, as the consultancy forecasts a steady increase
in global production from 727.5m tonnes in 1993 to 805m in 2000. It
expresses confidence that 1994 will prove to be the low point in the cycle.
Over the same period, finished steel consumption is expected to rise faster,
from 615.3m to 715m tonnes. Outlook for World Crude Steel Production and
Consumption to 2000. Meps (Europe). Fax UK 0114 2759808. Dollars 425.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Gangsters bag top gun in Thailand's 'bird nest war'

A sharp increase in the price of edible bird's nests prompted a leading
exporter of the 'caviar of the east' to employ a crackshot hired gun who
reportedly killed 14 bird's nest thieves over the past three years.
The gunslinger was himself shot dead as he was leaving a restaurant a week
ago, according to police in Phattalung, southern Thailand.
Mr Tid Musigachinda had been hired by the Laemthong Birds Nest Company to
guard a cave on Koh Si Koh Ha Island where swiftlets build some of the
world's most valuable edible nests.
Conservationists blame the region's economic boom for driving nest hunters
to extremes to satisfy mainly Chinese eaters of what was once an exotic
delicacy for the few.
Traffic International, run by the World Wide Fund for Nature and the World
Conservation Union, reported earlier this year that Hong Kong is easily the
biggest importer of bird's nests, buying 17m swiftlet nests in 1992, the
most recent year for which statistics are available.
In the five years to 1992, the wholesale price of swiftlet nests nearly
trebled to HKDollars 3,586 (Pounds 296) per kilogram; it is said that 1kg of
the finest nests can fetch up to HKDollars 30,000.
Mr Tid was due to stand trial for shooting 14 suspect nest robbers, but
district officials in Phattalung claimed his death makes it much harder to
tackle the bird's nest gangs in Southern Thailand.
'He was the only witness. He was the only one who really knew what was going
on,' said Mr Somphon Nunoon, a provincial councillor. There were rumours
that Bt50,000 (Pounds 1,280) had been offered to anyone who killed the
40-year-old security guard.
Even legal pickers find it difficult to harvest the nests which are built
mainly in limestone caves in Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia.
The small cup-shaped nests harden like cement after the birds make them from
salivary secretions, but they are eaten in soup or with bamboo pith as a
rare delicacy and a health tonic.
Traffic International blamed a steep decline in the swiftlet population on
the almost continuous harvesting of nests in many areas, which destroys eggs
and chicks.
According to the fund's Mr David Melville, the birds were caught in a
vicious circle: 'Higher prices will lead to yet more intense harvesting and
reduced breeding productivity, leading to higher prices.'
Swiftlet nests would be a sustainable resource only if harvesting took place
before eggs were laid, followed by a closed season of 130 days to allow the
birds to rebuild nests and rear their young.
But Mr Kluem Poolsung, deputy president of Phattalung provincial council,
said: 'Too many people want to make too much money out of too few nests.
Tid's murder will not be the last killing.'

FT  29 DEC 94 / Japan and US to resume motor talks: Way now opened for
conclusion of framework negotiations on bilateral trade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Japan and the US are expected to resume negotiations on trade in vehicles
and motor parts early in the new year, after a two-month hiatus in bilateral
discussions on one of the most contentious areas of trade.
The breakthrough came after a meeting on Tuesday between Mr Sozaburo
Okamatsu, vice minister for international trade and industry until
yesterday, and Mr Jeffrey Garten, US commerce undersecretary.
A resumption of the vehicle talks paves the way for conclusion of the
so-called framework negotiations on bilateral trade which began in the
summer of 1993. Most of the main issues - from greater access to Japan's
government procurement market for telecommunications and construction
projects to opening up of the country's insurance market - have been agreed.
The two sides are aiming by the year-end to conclude negotiations covering
financial services, which are being held this week in Seattle.
The talks on vehicles and motor parts trade, however, had been stalled after
the US launched sanctions procedures under its trade legislation against
Japan's motor parts after-market. The Japanese side has been unwilling to
resume negotiations under threat of sanctions. Japan has also resisted US
calls to discuss possible targets in the number of dealerships which sell
foreign cars and to encourage Japanese vehicle makers to come up with
'voluntary' plans for foreign parts procurement.
Nevertheless, both sides agree that early resumption of the talks is
preferable since the US trade deficit with Japan in these goods comprises
two-thirds of the overall US trade deficit with Japan.
The Japanese government has agreed to come back to the negotiating table in
the belief that the US has accepted that discussions will not be held under
threat of sanctions, will not cover targets and will not extend beyond the
reach of the government, a trade ministry official said.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Year-old Saudi 'parliament' is a quiet affair: Mark
Nicholson assesses the role of the 60-member, royal-appointed Consultative
Council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saudi Arabia's Consultative Council, a body optimistically hailed by some in
the west as a step towards democracy in the secretive monarchy, is a year
old. However, since King Fahd ceremonially inaugurated the council on
December 29 last year and its 60 royal appointees set about their task of
'advising' the Saudi ruler, it has almost vanished from public view.
Information about council affairs is scant. Newspapers report that the
council meets but not what it discusses. Saudi TV recently broadcast images
of a plenary session, without sound or comment.
Mr Abdulla Nasseef, the council's vice-chairman, insists the lack of
publicity does not mask a lack of accomplishment on the part of its members,
each on stipends of SR20,000 (Dollars 5,333) a month plus car.
'We're in the beginning and we're a conservative society,' explains Mr
Nasseef, a geologist and former head of the World Moslem League. 'So, in the
beginning, it's better that we deliberate in exclusion. But, in the future,
there will be the ability to bring in people - we have public galleries, and
galleries for the press.'
The assembly has, he says, studied more than 50 of Saudi Arabia's
international agreements and passed them to the Council of Ministers for
approval. It has - backed by continuous work from eight committees 'who do
the basic work' - drafted laws on intellectual property rights, and
environmental and wildlife protection, both of which were passed unaltered
by the cabinet.
It is reviewing all Saudi Arabia's by-laws, drawing in experts and
academics. Members are studying possible fees and service charges for public
utilities and recently called in the finance minister for a six-hour
debriefing.
'The time will come when we have to discuss things ministry by ministry,
though we are not charged to put them on trial or criticise them,' he says,
but adds: 'It's a sort of positive competition - they have to be more
careful now.'
The council is charged, in essence, to advise King Fahd who, in appointing
it last year, kept a long-standing promise to revive the more informal
Majlis a-Shura of courtiers and tribal sheikhs which, almost 40 years ago,
used to advise Saudi Arabia's founding monarch. But King Fahd impressed most
Saudis with his appointees, who were not the expected tribal or religious
leaders, but a low-profile selection of diligent, professional technocrats.
Half hold doctorates from western universities. Diplomats and locals believe
that, had the council been elected, Saudi voters would have returned fewer
technocrats and more sheikhs and Islamic leaders.
But, if the council's creation was, in Saudi terms, a leap in increasing
participation in government, the council is far from a proto-parliament. Its
plenary session and committees - which embrace information, finance, foreign
policy, security, religion, health, utilities and legal affairs - address
only matters directed by the king. After review, it then posts its
recommendations back to the king, who passes them on to the Council of
Ministers for approval. If the cabinet disagrees with the Majlis findings
(which they have not yet), King Fahd arbitrates.
The council has a modicum of legislative power. A minimum of 10 members may
propose legal reforms to the king. Mr Nasseef says five such recommendations
await royal assent to proceed, including proposals to modernise school
curriculums. He would not say how.
Debate, says Mr Nasseef, has been 'lively' in the small assembly room for
plenary sessions; members have forsaken as 'too large' the centrepiece
456-seat hall, complete with electronic voting equipment, rows of
comfortable chairs and an ornate dome of 48m diameter. 'The podium was too
big - members couldn't see the chairman,' says Mr Nasseef.
Members are formally permitted 10-minute speeches, but routinely take 20 or
30 minutes to make their points, he says. Voting is by majority. 'There can
be big arguments: sometimes it takes days and nights to come to agreement.
But, generally speaking, people are enjoying this.'
So too, it seems, are government ministries, which now have to open their
work to the council. 'Whatever comes out of the Shura is generally more
realistic than what we have done before,' says Mr Abdul Rahman al-Zamil,
deputy minister of commerce. 'Laws used to be passed from one bureaucrat to
another, and these people have no experience of the outside world. It's a
tremendous advance.'
But Saudi Arabia's new Consultative Council is making its tremendous - and,
in Saudi terms, experimental - advances cautiously. The body is not,
stresses Mr Nasseef, a prospective new centre of political power. In part,
he explains, this is because its job is to implement Islamic law, which is
Saudi Arabia's formal constitution. 'It's a bit different from a parliament
because a parliament has a secular point of view and has to implement the
people's will, regardless of religion. But we have to implement the law of
God.'
Also, he says, council members do not see their role as political. 'It's a
question of improving the country's performance, not a question of power,'
he says. Decision-making in the kingdom remains absolutely the realm of the
king.
That said, Mr Nasseef leaves the clear impression that the council still has
some way to evolve. He does not rule out, for instance, that King Fahd might
decide to enlarge the body in two years' time, when half the present council
members must be replaced. 'Of course, the king makes the decision. But the
possibility is there,' he says. 'We have 450 seats in our assembly hall,
after all.'

FT  29 DEC 94 / NTT told to open its lines to competitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's telecommunications authorities have ordered NTT, the domestic
carrier which has a virtual monopoly on local calls, to allow competitors
access to its lines.
NTT provides local and long-distance services while three new common
carriers compete with it in the long-distance market.
The order to NTT by the minister of posts and telecommunications follows a
protracted dispute over connection to NTT's local loop for virtual private
network (VPN) services, which offer call discounts to large customers.
The new carriers have been negotiating for five years without success with
NTT, seeking connection to its local lines to enable them to provide VPN
services. After NTT began offering such services itself this year, the three
carriers asked the telecommunications ministry to intervene.
This is the first time the Japanese authorities have intervened in a dispute
between telecommunications companies under the telecommunications business
law.
The ministry said allowing new carriers access to NTT's lines for VPN
services would provide greater convenience for telecommunications users.
However, it highlighted a big difficulty in Japan's telecommunications
industry, in which one company dominates the local network and also competes
with much smaller companies in the long-distance market.
NTT is the second largest telecommunications company in the world. Japan's
new common carriers complain that NTT's dominance of the local network has
prevented them from competing with it on an equal footing in the
long-distance market. The dispute over VPN services, which prevented the new
carriers from providing value-added services at the same time as NTT, will
add weight to their argument.
The issue has also strengthened calls for a break-up of NTT into
long-distance and local businesses when its operations are reviewed next
year by the government. The tele-communications ministry believes a break-up
could stimulate competition in the telecoms market which has lagged that of
the US in terms of new services on offer.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Bangkok to slash tariffs on 4,000 imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES

   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Thailand is from January 1 to slash tariffs on nearly 4,000 kinds of
imports, with the emphasis on raw materials and semi-manufactured goods for
industry.
The move will bring import duties down from 100 per cent to a maximum 30 per
cent by 1997.
It confirms the government's determination gradually to remove tax
protection that can shelter inefficient domestic manufacturers which could
hinder Thailand's attempt to produce higher value-added products.
The new tax rates will reduce the average tariff on nearly all imports,
excluding agricultural produce, from 39.24 per cent to 17.61 per cent when
fully implemented.
Many of the cuts, to affect more than half of all taxable imports, are
scheduled to come into full effect next week; the deepest cuts in certain
sensitive categories will have to wait until in 1997.
Mr Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, finance minister, said: 'Our economy has made
significant advances in terms of efficiency and competitiveness, so we need
this tax reform to benefit the people and to create an effective linkage
between the Thai economy and the global economy.'
Analysts welcomed the move. HG Asia's Mr Neil Semple said: 'This is very
good news; it lowers the overall cost structure of the economy at a time
when there are worries about rising wages and inflation'.
Mr Scott Christensen, Jardine Fleming Thanakom Securities' Bangkok
economist, declared: 'It's terrific. Some firms will suffer, but the overall
effect will prove very helpful.'
Mr Tarrin said the measures will cost the government Bt11.43bn (Pounds 291m)
in 1995 and Bt6.24bn in 1997.
The tariff system will also be trimmed from 36 different taxes to just six,
which will reduce uncertainty among importers about what charges the customs
service will impose.
The six rates will range from no tariff on medical equipment, 1 per cent on
raw materials and electronic parts such as coal, 5 per cent for machinery
and computers, 10 per cent for intermediate goods, 20 per cent for finished
products, to 30 per cent on goods such as silk and leather products.
These last two are considered to need fairly high protection.
The heavily protected petroleum industry enjoys tariffs ranging from 30 per
cent on naphtha to 60 per cent on plastic pellets. These fall to 1 per cent
for naphtha in 1995 and to 30 per cent on plastic pellets by 1997.
Artificial and knitted fabrics will have duties cut from 60 to 40 per cent
in 1995 and to 20 per cent in 1997.
Finance ministry officials said the tariff cuts were generally deeper than
were required by the Gatt agreement and will continue the liberalisation of
the economy which had been begun in the late 1980s.
The government can afford to lower tariffs partly as a result of value added
tax.
A decade ago, tariff income typically supplied 60 per cent of government
income; at the end of the 1993 financial year this had been reduced to 18
per cent.
Thailand has a rebate system for manufacturers to claim back import duties
but this relief is lost if the imported item is sold on before leaving the
country, and, anyway, is difficult to administer.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, has won approval from a US
court to continue its aggressive attack on the Dollars 2.4bn-a-year US
market for painkillers. A district court judge in New Jersey ruled that the
company was not engaged in misleading advertising for its new
non-prescription pain-reliever, called Aleve. Procter &amp; Gamble entered the
market last June in partnership with Syntex, a US drug company. It
accompanied the launch of Aleve, an over-the-counter version of the drug
naproxen, with television advertisements suggesting that the product was
more effective than established products - notably Advil, an ibuprofen-based
pain reliever made by American Home Products.
In August American Home Products filed a lawsuit against Procter &amp; Gamble
and Syntex seeking a preliminary injunction to stop the Aleve
advertisements, claiming they were misleading consumers with 'unwarranted
and unsubstantiated' claims.

The Indian government yesterday cleared 27 proposals for foreign investment
worth Rs1.4bn (Pounds 28m). They include a joint venture between Pearson,
owner of the Financial Times, and the New Delhi-based Hindustan Times group
to produce television and video programmes in India, and the setting up of
two subsidiary companies by Morgan Stanley. Pearson and the Hindustan Times
media group, owned by the Birla family, will set up film and television
production facilities in India with a third partner, the Hong Kong-based
Television Broadcast (TVB). Clearance for the TV venture comes at a time
when the entry of foreign companies into the print media is being hotly
debated. Pearson's proposal for a joint venture between the FT and the
Ananda Bazaar Patrika group's Business Standard newspaper has yet to be
approved. The Hindustan Times-Pearson proposal has assured the government
that it will not undertake any print media-related activities.

General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia, was reported yesterday
to have won a verbal promise of a truce in Bihac from Mr Fikret Abdic,
renegade Moslem leader, whose troops have fought alongside the Serbs in the
northwestern Moslem enclave. He had talks with both Mr Abdic and General
Atif Dudakovic, commander of the Bosnian government Fifth Corps, in an
attempt to halt fighting which threatens the country's latest ceasefire. A
UN source said Mr Abdic had accepted a three paragraph truce proposed by Gen
Rose. However, Gen Dudakovic is understood to have expressed some
reservations and to have indicated that he would have to consult his
government in Sarajevo. Details of the truce proposal were not immediately
known.
Gen Rose, who until yesterday was prevented by Serb forces from visiting
Bihac, met for talks on implementing a truce in the region, encircled by
Serb forces. Clashes in the Bihac region have thwarted negotiations on the
details of a four-month cessation of hostilities, brokered by Mr Jimmy
Carter, former US president, due to come into force on Sunday. As Gen Rose
held talks in Bihac, fighting flared in the north of the enclave around Mr
Abdic's stronghold of Velika Kladusa, with some 87 shells falling near the
town, according to a UN spokesman in Zagreb.

Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, was last night seeking a way to
climb down from the crisis generated by ground-clearing for a West Bank
settler suburb on land claimed by Palestinian farmers. Mr Yassir Arafat
summoned an emergency meeting of his Palestinian National Authority in Gaza
last night to consider the issue. A spokesman for the PLO chairman demanded
that Israel return the land to the villagers of Khader, south of Bethlehem.
He warned that failure to do so might 'negatively affect' the peace
negotiations. Earlier yesterday Mr Rabin asked Mr Michael Ben-Yair, attorney
general, to clarify the legal situation. Bulldozers, meanwhile, are
continuing to clear the hillside one mile from the settler township of
Efrat. Hundreds of Palestinians mounted a protest vigil there yesterday and
a large Israeli force still guards the site.
Meanwhile, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia arrived unexpectedly in Alexandria
yesterday for a meeting with Presidents Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Hafez
al-Assad of Syria. There was speculation in Egypt that Mr Assad had sought
the meeting to express his concern about the pace at which Israel was
establishing relations with Arab countries, particularly in the Gulf, while
still occupying large areas of Arab territory.

FT  29 DEC 94 / German import prices rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
West German import prices moved up sharply between October and November,
bearing out the Bundesbank's determination to combat future inflation as
expressed in its money supply target for 1995. The November import price
level was 0.8 per cent above that for the previous month and 2.2 per cent
above November 1993, the federal statistics office said. The yearly rate was
higher than the 1.9 per cent in both September and October. Producer prices
have also been rising more rapidly. Both indicators suggest a later upturn
in inflation.
The central bank stressed its commitment to reaching its medium-term
inflation goal of 2 per cent when setting its M3 target last week. Athough
the 1995 target range is unchanged at 4-6 per cent, achieving it will mean a
slower average rate of money supply growth than in 1994. The strong upturn
in the economy this year has revived uneasiness about future inflation,
although the rate of consumer price growth has been slowing. Provisional
figures from four west German states showed a 2.7 per cent annual inflation
rate in December (as in November) and the Bundesbank expects this to ease to
under 2.5 per cent early next year. The average for 1994 was 3 per cent, the
statistics office said.

non-political problems when an Arkansas federal judge ruled that the case
alleging sexual harassment by him could not go to trial until he left
office. However, Judge Susan Wright ordered that sworn statements and other
activities related to the case go ahead in the meanwhile. She also found no
constitutional justification for arguments by Mr Clinton's lawyers that a
sitting president should be immune from lawsuits alleging wrongdoing before
he took office. But she also noted that the damages suit - by Ms Paula
Jones, a former Arkansas state employee - had only been brought two days
before the statute of limitations expired and thus clearly had no urgency.
Ms Jones is seeking Dollars 750,000 in damages over what she charges were
unwanted sexual overtures from the then Arkansas governor in 1991.

Japan's surplus in trade and services in November showed the first
year-on-year rise in five months, according to a preliminary report by the
finance ministry. The current account surplus rose by an unadjusted 15 per
cent to Dollars 9.67bn after falling for four months in both yen and dollar
terms. For the January-November period, the current account surplus dropped
9.7 per cent in yen terms and 1.9 per cent in dollar terms. The trade
surplus, which makes up the bulk of the current account surplus, increased
by 20 per cent in November to Dollars 10.94bn. Although imports increased by
21 per cent, their impact was offset by a similar rise in exports. The
finance ministry believes, nevertheless, that Japan's surplus is on a
downward trend. The surplus with the US increased in the first half by 15
per cent to Dollars 26.24bn and that with south-east Asia by 21 per cent to
Dollars 33.81bn. However, its surplus with the European Union declined by 37
per cent to Dollars 11.96bn.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Gonzalez stands firm as market falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The continuing slide on the Madrid stock market has rattled the Spanish
government and forced Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, to deny
persistent reports that he may soon be driven from office.
His office yesterday signalled his intention to stay, despite legal probes
into his government's security services that have prompted opposition calls
for his resignation.
'Speculation that the prime minister will stand down is completely
groundless,' said a senior aide to Mr Gonzalez.
His government has been rocked in recent days by judicial investigations of
an alleged misuse of reserve funds by interior ministry officials and of the
role alleged to have been played by former high-ranking security officers in
an undercover war against Eta, the Basque separatist group.
'The government has a clear programme for 1995, which includes important
economic reforms and major European responsibilities in the second half of
the year, during the Spanish presidency of the EU,' the official said. 'This
requires firm government and the prime minister has the parliamentary
support to deliver it.'
Mr Gonzalez's governing socialist party yesterday blocked an attempt by
opposition groups to open a parliamentary investigation of the scandals that
have involved the interior ministry and the security services.
The 'business as usual' message came as traders said Madrid's stock market
had clearly de-coupled from Wall Street and from the main European markets.
The market fell by nearly 4 per cent on opening yesterday, though it then
regained some ground, with the index finishing down 0.36 per cent at 283.59,
a new low for the year.
'This is the worst December for 10 years on the Spanish markets,' said Mr
Juan Bastos, chief executive of the Madrid brokers Ibersecurities. The fall
was 'absolutely driven by political sentiment,' he added.
Reflecting a high political risk premium, the 10-year Spanish Treasury bond,
which had yielded 8 per cent at the begining of 1994, has hovered between
11.50 and 12 per cent in the past few days, maintaining a spread of more
than 400 points against the German long bond. Tracking market sentiment, the
Treasury yesterday boosted the marginal yield on its one-year bills by
nearly half a point to 9.4 per cent.
The market nervousness coincided with a Madrid judge starting a legal probe
of hundreds of bank cheques, drawn from the interior ministry's reserve
account at the Bank of Spain, that were alleged to have been used to swell
the pay packets of ministry officials and security chiefs.
The investigation, which could lead to charges of widespread embezzlement of
public funds by a network of senior officials, is linked to a scandal
involving a former head of the Guardia Civil, Mr Luis Roldan, who became a
fugitive from justice in May when he had been accused of having enriched
himself illegally.
A second Madrid judge has re-opened a case involving a death squad
responsible for 23 deaths in the mid-1980s during operations against Eta.
The renewed investigation follow a decision by two police officers,
sentenced in connection with the squad, to provide further evidence that is
alleged to incriminate their superiors.
The judge remanded three former security chiefs in custody last week and he
is expected to indict more senior officials in connection with the case in
weeks ahead. Mr Jose Barrionuevo, a former interior minister, said yesterday
he would take legal action over press reports linking him to the death
squad.

1995,' Mr Clinton said. At a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden Mr
Glickman referred to the challenge of the five-year farm bill that he must
help craft. 'Agriculture is not and should not be immune to change,' he
said. Mr Espy resigned in October after an independent prosecutor began

King Fahd of Saudi Arabia arrived unexpectedly in Alexandria yesterday for a
summit meeting with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and President Hafez
al-Assad of Syria. Mr Safwat el-Sherif, the Egyptian information minister,
said it would focus on 'resolving Arab differences and co-ordinating efforts
towards solidarity on Arab, regional and international levels'. There was
speculation in Egypt yesterday that Mr Assad had sought the meeting to
express his concern over the pace at which Israel was establishing relations
with Arab countries, particularly in the Gulf, while still occupying large
areas of Arab territory.
Israel is talking to Qatar about the supply of gas, while Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
the Israeli prime minister, has just made a surprise visit to Oman. There
has been no indication of an early Saudi move towards formal contacts with
Israel, although Riyadh has given its blessing to the peace agreements
involving Israel, the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Jordan. Syria
and Israel have meanwhile made little progress in their negotiations over
the Golan Heights, captured by Israel during the 1967 war.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Super-minister who fell in clash over D-Mark: Obituary of
Karl Schiller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Karl Schiller, who has died at 83, was the West German
'super-minister' who came spectacularly to grief in a conflict with the
Bundesbank over exchange controls in 1972.
His resignation as economics and finance minister in defence of free market
economics and strong budgetary policies in July of that year unsettled the
Social Democrat-led coalition government of Chancellor Willy Brandt and, for
a period, appeared to jeopardise its electoral prospects.
But Schiller lost influence after an ill-judged dalliance with the Christian
Democrat opposition party ahead of the general election that November.
Although he continued to be highly regarded as an economist, the re-election
of Willy Brandt's left-liberal coalition meant Schiller was never again a
political force in Germany.
Karl Schiller was born on April 24, 1911 in Breslau (now Wroclaw), in what
was then German Silesia. After studying economics at the universities of
Kiel, Frankfurt-am-Main, Berlin and Heidelberg, he began an academic career
at Heidelberg in 1934 before moving in 1935 to the Institute for World
Economy in Kiel where he headed a research group. After serving in the
German army in the second world war, he returned briefly to Kiel before
becoming professor of economics at Hamburg university, where he was rector
between 1956 and 1958.
Schiller's involvement in politics began in 1946, when he joined the Social
Democrat party. By 1948 he was economic senator in the federal state of
Hamburg and an adviser to the economics ministry in Bonn. By the time the
Social Democrats and Christian parties formed West Germany's 'grand
coalition' government in 1966, Schiller had held numerous party offices and
was a member of the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament. He had played
a key role in steering his party away from traditional socialism towards
free market economic policies.
He was appointed federal economics minister in 1966 and for a time formed a
remarkable partnership with Franz-Josef Strauss, the finance minister. At
first sight, the young-looking, slight, bespectacled, didactic academic from
Hamburg hardly seemed the type to coexist with the burly, beer-swilling
leader of Bavaria's Christian Social Union. But Strauss was also a gifted,
highly educated man with a powerful intellect. The two developed a mutual
respect.
Together they steered the German economy to recovery after a shallow
recession in 1967. However, tensions grew over how to respond to upward
pressure on the D-Mark in the increasingly enfeebled post-war Bretton Woods
fixed exchange rate regime. Breaking with conventional business opinion,
Schiller came to recognise that revaluation was unavoidable.
When the coalition broke up in 1969, Schiller was one of the Social Democrat
party's stars. His intellect, communication skills and mastery of economic
policy, combined with the respect Germans of that time had for professors,
were important in winning the electorate for the unknown: a Social
Democrat-led government.
With hindsight, the election of September 29, 1969 was Schiller's high-water
mark. He returned to government as economics minister - this time in a
coalition with the Free Democrats. But storm clouds were gathering over the
West German economy, largely because of its trading success relative to
other industrialised nations.
At Schiller's behest, one of the new government's first acts was to revalue
the D-Mark to DM3.66 to the dollar compared with DM4 previously. This,
however, failed to stem the flow of speculative funds into Germany. Currency
turbulence in turn increased inflationary pressure as Bundesbank
intervention to curb the D-Mark's rise resulted in a sharp increase in
domestic money supply.
Schiller won a temporary respite for the D-Mark by floating it against the
dollar in May 1971. But the coalition also faced budgetary problems as it
tried to meet its election promises for greater social expenditure after
having promised not to raise taxes. Symptomatic of growing tension was the
resignation, also in May 1971, of West Germany's finance minister, Alex
Moller.
Schiller added Moller's portfolio to his own, becoming 'super-minister'. But
he found his authority increasingly challenged as he tried to secure support
in cabinet for spending cuts. Unrelenting speculative inflows into Germany,
particularly after the D-Mark was repegged against the dollar in December
1971, brought him into conflict with Karl Klasen, president of the
Bundesbank.
Klasen, like Schiller, was a Social Democrat from Hamburg. But there the
similarities ended. Tall, commanding, with a dislike of detail, Klasen had
come to the Bundesbank in 1970 from Deutsche Bank, Germany's most powerful
commercial bank. He was far more concerned than Schiller that the rising
value of the D-Mark would cripple the country's export industry.
Schiller was convinced of the need to revalue the D-Mark to safeguard
Germany from imported inflation and advocated a joint float of European
Community currencies to protect the country's competitiveness.
Tension between the two men reached crisis point at the end of June 1972
when Klasen, attending a cabinet meeting in Bonn, proposed exchange controls
to combat the inflow of funds into the D-Mark. In a long and bitter
resignation letter, Schiller complained that Klasen had sat next to him at a
European Community meeting in Luxembourg only two days before without
mentioning his plans, even though he had already advised the chancellery of
them. In the letter, Schiller acknowledged that he was in conflict with the
majority of the cabinet. 'In this war of attrition - rich in personal
defamations - the minister of finance and economics often stood alone,' he
wrote.
Without doubt, Schiller's tangled personal life added to his problems. Four
times wed, his marriage to his third wife, Eta, during 1971 attracted
unfavourable comment and hostility in the Social Democrat party and
undermined his standing.
His resignation from the cabinet was followed by his departure from the
party presidium and the party itself. In the months following his
resignation as a minister, there was intense speculation that Schiller would
join the Christian Democrats in opposition to the Brandt government. He
allowed his name to be used in the campaign against the governing coalition,
but never jumped fully into the opposition camp.
Schiller's waverings made enemies across the pol-itical spectrum. Even the
most charitable observers queried his judgment. Willy Brandt's election
victory left Schiller politically high and dry.
Schiller's policies, however, survived his political eclipse. The final
collapse of the Bretton Woods currency system in March 1973 meant that
Germany again floated the D-Mark. The exchange controls that provoked
Schiller's resignation had been inadequate to cope with huge currency
inflows in a time of widespread international currency turbulence.
Successive West German governments supported and promoted his idea of a
European joint float, leading to the creation of the European Monetary
System in 1979. That was in large part the achievement of another
super-minister: Helmut Schmidt, a pupil of Schiller's from Hamburg, who
succeeded him as minister of finance and economics in 1972 before becoming
chancellor in 1974.
The nature of Schiller's departure from government also had a profound
effect on economic and monetary affairs in Germany and beyond by
contributing to the reality and legend of Bundesbank power.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Milosevic silences opposition at home: The Serb president is
tightening his grip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once denounced as the chief instigator of war in former Yugoslavia,
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, now praised by the west for his key
role in efforts to end the violence, is quietly getting on with crushing the
last remnants of opposition at home.
He has turned his attention to the independent media, political opposition
and national minorities in Serbia, convinced that western approval entitles
him to a free hand. While western governments count on him to broker peace
in Bosnia, they appear to ignore the fact that since coming to power in
1987, his regime has fed on conflict.
The Serb authorities this week outlawed Borba, the only independent daily
newspaper in Serbia. A city court ruled that Borba, which was privatised
four years ago, was now state property. Journalists have a fortnight to
report to the new editor-in-chief, Mr Dragutin Brcin, minister of
information and a member of the ruling Socialist politburo.
Borba now comes out under Mr Brcin's supervision. His 'official' edition is
filled with unsigned pro-government articles and is sold in kiosks. But
Borba journalists have not given up. Joined by liberal intellectuals, they
brave the cold to hawk the 'real', now illegal, version on the grey streets
of Belgrade.
Why the seemingly omnipotent Serbian president would crack down on a
newspaper with a circulation of 35,000 puzzles them. 'Especially,' said Mrs
Gordana Logar, editor, 'when Mr Milosevic is now supporting peace, which we
have always advocated'. In the distorted landscape of Serbia, Borba somehow
maintained high standards. It published news censored by all other Serbian
dailies, opposing nationalist hysteria and offering Serbs an alternative to
the state-run media's tales of foreign conspiracies and providing a bridge
to the outside world.
At first, these steps appear at odds with the Serbian president's new role
as a 'man of peace', determined to re-join the international community. A
European Union statement issued this week by Germany, the outgoing EU
president, warned that the Belgrade regime's disregard for an independent
media would be taken into account when considering Yugoslavia's
re-integration.
In fact, Mr Milosevic's repressive measures have increased since five months
ago he abandoned his proteges, the Bosnian Serb leaders, pronouncing himself
in favour of peace in Bosnia. Almost unnoticed, the Serbian regime has
unleashed a wave of terror in its southern province of Kosovo, killing,
arresting or harassing hundreds of ethnic Albanians who comprise 92 per cent
of the province's 2m population. Belgrade has also intensified arrests and
Kafkaesque political trials in Sandzak, a Moslem-inhabited region which
straddles southern Serbia and tiny Montenegro, the two republics that now
comprise what remains of Yugoslavia. Non-Serbs make up a third of
Yugoslavia's population of 10.5m.
The restive Kosovo remains the most volatile potential flashpoint in Serbia.
This densely populated province, which was stripped of its autonomy five
years ago, remains in the grip of the Serbian police. If violence were to
erupt, Albanians from neighbouring Macedonia and Albania could take up arms
to help their Kosovo kin. Diplomats worry this could ignite the Balkans.
While opposition parties hold nearly half the 250-seat Serbian parliament,
they have virtually disappeared from public life. The Socialist MPs this
week took advantage of an opposition walk-out to adopt the state budget
unanimously - and without any debate. Opposition MPs yesterday said the
government was poised to introduce 'special measures' in key municipalities
where the Socialists were not in power. Mr Milosevic has used his iron grip
over the state media to blame the opposition for rising economic
deprivations and the massive increase in crime.
Indeed Mr Milosevic rules as if his quarrelsome opposition does not even
exist. His wife, Mrs Mirjana Markovic - after her husband regarded as the
most influential figure in Serbia and who makes known her views by
publishing her diaries in a popular magazine - recently made clear her
distaste for the parliamentary system. 'Parliamentary democracy, for
example, suits the English but really not does not look good on the Serbs,'
she wrote last week.
In former Yugoslavia, Serbia was the last of six republics to adopt a
multi-party system. Mrs Markovic routinely mourns the fall of communism in
eastern Europe, insisting that it was just a passing phase.
Meanwhile, the Serbian parliament has passed a law calling for the
re-appraisal of all privatised companies. In short, what little
privatisation has been achieved, less than 10 per cent of state-companies,
will be largely reversed.
It seems, as one Socialist official recently confided, 'everything must be
under control - we will have to take important decisions'. Perhaps fearing a
backlash by Serbs, tired of extensive power cuts or the deteriorating
economy, Mr Milosevic seems to believe that he will have to snuff out even
the last flicker of opposition.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's privatisation programme will continue strongly next year and
foreign investors can expect more real security, according to Mr Maxim
Boiko, chief executive officer of the Centre for Privatisation.
Mr Boiko, whose agency is independent but closely linked to the government
and to the reformers in it, said new laws on security markets, tax and
property rights would address most of the main fears of foreign investors.
'The government has taken their worries on board and you will see progress,'
he said.
He admitted, however, that Mr Vladimir Polevanov, who heads the State
Property Committee - the main agency for executing privatisation - had
'given grounds for concern that we would not keep up the momentum for
privatisation'. Mr Polevanov wants the aluminium industry renationalised for
strategic reasons.
The momentum of the programme depends crucially on the success of a
stabilisation plan which in turn depends on international aid to the 1995
budget of more than Dollars 12bn.
Mr Boiko said the government remained committed to:
Sell the large proportion of shares it retains in semi-privatised
industries, including energy. Under the special rules for oil, the
government's shares may not be sold for three years, but, said Mr Boiko,
'for many of them that time will be up next year and these shares will then
be sold. Many of them are pressing for it.'
Continue privatisation of companies still in state hands by a cash system in
place of the initial system of sales for vouchers given free to the
population. The new system is scheduled to bring in Rbs9,000bn to the budget
in 1995, though Mr Boiko said it would easily top that figure.
Introduce a regulated securities market and a more transparent tax and share
registration system, in order to attract a much larger amount of foreign
investment than the Dollars 2bn-Dollars 2.5bn which has come in this year -
an amount far exceeded by the amount of domestic capital fleeing the
country.
Press ahead more rapidly with the privatisation of land.
Insisting that even the sceptics in the government and in the enterprises
were being won over to the privatisation programme - by far the world's
biggest and fastest - Mr Boiko said there was now serious discussion of
pushing privatisation into areas from which it had hitherto been excluded,
such as the railways and health care.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Clinton suffers new setback as director of CIA resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton last night suffered the loss of another senior member
of his administration when he accepted 'with regret' the resignation of Mr
James Woolsey, director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
In a brief White House statement, Mr Clinton commended Mr Woolsey for
'having advanced the transformation of US intelligence in the aftermath of
the Cold War'.
Mr Woolsey, sailing in the Caribbean with his wife and three sons, offered
no reason for his resignation, conveyed to the president at the weekend,
other than family considerations.
His departure was not a complete surprise in Washington. It was no secret
that he was unhappy over relations with a White House largely uninterested
in intelligence matters, though Mr Woolsey did not make a habit of
complaining in public.
He also came under heavy fire in Congress for failing to discipline senior
CIA officers severely over Aldrich Ames - the spy for the Soviets sentenced
to life imprisonment this year for having betrayed US covert operations. A
sexual harassment case settled in favour of a woman CIA officer further
damaged the agency's reputation.
Mr Woolsey is the third Cabinet-level member of the administration to leave
in the past two months. Mr Lloyd Bentsen resigned as treasury secretary this
month and will be replaced by Mr Robert Rubin, head of the White House
national economic council.
Earlier yesterday, Mr Clinton named Mr Dan Glickman as agriculture secretary
to succeed Mr Mike Espy, who resigned under an ethical cloud. Mr Glickman, a
Democratic former congressman from Kansas and a leading member of the House
intelligence committee, had been mentioned as a replacement for Mr Woolsey.
Mr John Deutch, deputy secretary of defence, and Mr Morton Abramowicz, a
former diplomat who runs the Carnegie Endowment think-tank in Washington,
now head most possible short-lists for the CIA post. But there may be
reluctance to break up the successful team at the Pentagon under Mr William
Perry, defence secretary, while Mr Abramowicz's criticisms of US policy on
Bosnia have not endeared him to the White House.
Retiring members of Congress, possibly including some Republicans, may be
considered, but several Democrats have blotted their copybooks.
Mr Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma, for example, who lobbied for the CIA position
before it went to Mr Woolsey, recently described Mr Clinton as 'a
transitional figure'.
No date for the announcement of a successor has been set.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Russian forces tighten hold on Chechen capital: Moscow
denies continued bombing of Grozny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian forces and aircraft stepped up their attacks on the Chechen capital
of Grozny yesterday in what was reportedly the most bitter fighting so far
in the 17-day war.
In Moscow, officials denied that the town was bombed after a promise from
President Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday of a pause in the air raids. Reports from
Grozny, though, said bombing of the outskirts had continued and that an
orphanage had been hit, with no casualties.
The Russian government's press service said its forces were making 'real
advances' towards Grozny's outskirts, 'carrying out the task of closing and
tightening the circle round the Chechen capital'.
Mr Yeltsin said in his address to the nation on Tuesday that the circle
around Grozny had already been tightened.
Chechen officials confirmed the increased level of fighting, with the press
service reporting that the Russian army 'is trying to storm the city today'.
That was denied in Moscow by Mr Oleg Lobov, secretary of the Security
Council, which advises the president on security matters. But he admitted
that the village of Petropavlovskaya to the east of Grozny, and Khankala
airport near the city, had both been taken.
The raids and the increased military activity appeared to rule out the slim
hope - proposed by Mr Yeltsin - of the resumption of negotiations between
Russian and Chechen officials.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, leader of the Russia's Choice group and Mr Yeltsin's
harshest critic on the liberal wing of politics, said he was 'sorry that
President Yeltsin lost this chance of seriously promoting negotiations that
could lead to peace'.
Mr Gaidar, a long-time supporter of Mr Yeltsin even after most other
reformist politicians had given up on the president, gave an exceptionally
pessimistic review of the Chechnya crisis to journalists. He said Mr Yeltsin
was receiving false information, was 'not in overall control' and had ceded
authority to 'those who are against Russian democracy'.
The cost of the war would break the budget, rendering any aid from the
International Monetary Fund useless and destroying the government's
macro-economic policy - designed to attract more than Dollars 12bn (Pounds
7.6bn) in aid from the IMF and the World Bank in the coming year, he said.
'It is inevitable that military expenditure will increase, the powers of the
police will increase, human rights won't be honoured, civilian institutions
will be marginalised and the press won't be as free as it was,' he added.
The signs are that Mr Yeltsin and the forces commanders are now seeking a
rapid end to the military operation.
The Russian parliament has begun its new year break, depriving deputies of a
forum for dissent over the action in Chechnya.
However, the leaderships of both houses of parliament, who are ex-officio
members of the Security Council, essentially support the continuation of the
war. Mr Ivan Rybkin, leader of the State Duma or lower house, said yesterday
that he 'supports the president in his actions against the bandit gangs' -
although he said a storming of Grozny should be avoided.
Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, leader of the Federation Council or upper house, has,
with many reservations, taken the same line and is to face a vote of no
confidence as a result.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Major renews tax cut promise: PM admits that rift over
Europe is threatening to destroy the Tory party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major last night made his strongest promise yet to reduce income
tax. He told senior Tory officials it was no longer a question of whether
the government would cut tax, but of when.
In a pugnacious new year's message, delivered with the Conservative party
trailing far behind Labour in successive opinion polls, the prime minister
called for an end to the party's civil war over Europe.
'United the Conservative party can continue to be invincible,' he said. But
he admitted the rift over Europe threatened 'to destroy our party from
within'.
His words, in a letter to Tory constituency chairmen, cut little ice either
with Labour or with Conservative Eurosceptics. Mr John Prescott, Labour
deputy leader, said Mr Major had 'confirmed his desperation over Europe and
his unbelievable complacency over everything else'.
Sir Teddy Taylor, the Euro-sceptic MP for Southend East who was among those
suspended from the parliamentary party for not supporting the government in
a confidence vote on Europe last month, said Mr Major could unite the party
if he would 'identify the real issues in Europe and take a strongly
Eurosceptic line on them'.
In comments made a week after new Treasury figures confirmed that the amount
of tax the government takes from the average family was set to rise again
next year, Mr Major said the day ministers could revert to their
'tax-cutting agenda' was getting closer.
Reaffirming the government's pledge to 'make progress towards' a 20p basic
income tax rate as soon as prudently possible, he argued that the
Conservatives were still 'the only party committed to low taxation'.
But amid indications that the so-called 'feel bad' factor among consumers
may be spreading to business, he appeared to acknowledge that the benefits
of Britain's improving economy were not yet getting through to voters.
'People have been through the pain and not yet seen the gain,' he said. 'But
the pain was necessary to create the present favourable prospects.'
His remarks came after Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, said the
Conservatives had lost credibility as the party of low taxation after
raising taxes by the equivalent of 7p on the standard rate of income tax.
The government would 'insult the intelligence of the British electorate' if
it expected people to be grateful for getting some of that money back, said
Mr Blair, who will deliver his own new year's message today.
He said tax cuts should not become 'just another political ploy by the
Conservatives to retain power'.
On Europe, Mr Major sought to portray himself as a mediator between the
warring Eurosceptic and pro-European extremes in the Conservative party,
saying he agreed with those who thought Brussels interfered too much in
'day-to-day affairs'. But he said the government had 'won the argument' to
ensure that Europe intervened as little as possible in people's everyday
lives.
In an uncompromising call for Tory rebels to train their fire on 'our real
opponents', he said that nothing was more soul-destroying for the party's
grass roots supporters than 'to see those whom they helped to get elected
arguing against other Conservatives'.

FT  29 DEC 94 / Mexican markets rebound as IMF crisis talks begin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE, STEPHEN FIDLER and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican stock market and currency rebounded yesterday as talks got under
way between the government and the International Monetary Fund and other
financing agencies which could lead to an emergency financial package.
Mexican officials held urgent meetings in Washington to try to negotiate the
support package.
A US Treasury official said last night that Mexico had not drawn on nearly
Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.46bn) in currency support lines offered by the US and
Canada, but he confirmed that discussions were under way on external support
for Mexico. He refused to provide details.
Also yesterday, doubts were surfacing about Mexico's ability to repay
holders of its dollar-denominated government securities. The government,
which faces a financial crisis following a sharp devaluation of the peso
during the past week, is seeking funds to back a currency stabilisation
plan, which it is expected to announce soon.
The meetings with the IMF and other financing agencies were adjourned
yesterday as an IMF mission headed for Mexico City.
There were unconfirmed reports yesterday of support for the peso by the New
York Federal Reserve. The spot rate for the peso rose to close at 4.975 to
the dollar, compared with 5.6 at Tuesday's close when the currency had
fallen 39 per cent since December 19. Helped by the strengthening peso, the
Mexican stock market recovered yesterday and was up 2.67 per cent at the
close.
In New York, Mexican shares recovered sharply after Tuesday's falls, with
Telmex up 9.93 per cent at 41 1/2 and Televisa up 7.95 per cent at 32 1/4 .
The doubts about the government's ability to service debt arose after it had
become clear this week that many holders of tesobonos (short-term,
dollar-denominated securities issued by the government) would be unwilling
to buy further securities as their existing paper matured. The central bank
offered Dollars 950m in tesobonos on Tuesday but only Dollars 27.6m was
purchased.
About Dollars 3.5bn in tesobonos will come due in the next five weeks, as
will an additional Dollars 13bn between February and June. Some 80 per cent
of these bonds are held by foreign investors - many by US mutual funds.
If the trend continues, the Mexican government will face further pressure on
its already limited reserves.
Reuter adds from Mexico City: Mexican agrarian reform minister Miguel Limon
pledged yesterday to tackle a main cause of a year-old rebellion in the
southern state of Chiapas by redistributing land from large ranchers to poor
peasants.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Three top officials quit in Tokyo bureaucracy battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three top Japanese civil servants, including the top bureaucrat at the
powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry, were forced to resign
yesterday.
The departures mark a significant victory for the government in its struggle
against bureaucracy.
A cabinet meeting accepted the resignations of Mr Hideaki Kumano,
vice-minister at Miti and its most senior official; Mr Sozaburo Okamatsu,
the Miti vice-minister for international affairs who is in charge of trade
talks with the US; and Mr Kinju Atarashi, chief secretary at the Science and
Technology Agency.
They are the most senior casualties so far in the battle between politicians
and bureaucrats and represent another blow to the declining influence of
Miti, which claims credit for overseeing Japan's industrial rise after the
second world war. Miti was, until recently, the only ministry able to
challenge the conservative Ministry of Finance, but morale has been crippled
by political infighting over the past 18 months.
The upheaval is likely to delay economic deregulation, a policy promoted by
Miti but viewed warily by the Ministry of Finance. Mr Atarashi resigned
because of a row with Ms Makiko Tanaka, the Science and Technology Agency's
politically appointed director-general, to whom he was chief adviser. He
angered Ms Tanaka by warning her not to name bodies affiliated to the agency
in response to a government request for state organisations to be considered
for closure. His intervention was condemned, in particular, because the cuts
were seen as part of the government's campaign to trim bureaucratic power.
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the prime minister, said the dismissal of Mr Atarashi,
who will return to Miti, was unavoidable. By Japanese standards, the shift
is a serious loss of prestige.
Mr Kumano's resignation from Miti is the result of a row over the dismissal
a year ago of a senior Miti bureaucrat for hastily promoting an official.
This official happened to be an LDP election candidate and the party is
taking its revenge against bureaucrats who opposed him.

dive

Wall Street
US shares added to last week's gains yesterday in light post-holiday
trading, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
By 1pm, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 28.26 at 3,861.69. The more
broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 2.64 at 462.47, the American Stock
Exchange composite climbed 0.59 at 429.37 and the Nasdaq composite gained
4.01 at 746.20.
Trading volume on the NYSE was 211m shares.
The much-discussed year-end-rally seemed to have kicked in as investors
loaded their portfolios with blue-chip stocks to close out the year. The Dow
also benefited as traders pulled out of shares with exposure to Mexico and
bought industrials.
The Mexican bolsa was off sharply and peso was trading at a record low
against the dollar in the wake of the Mexican government's decision last
week to stop supporting its currency.
Also boosting US share prices were gains in the bond market on the heels of
weak data on the sales of single-family homes. Home sales fell 2.6 per cent
in November, according to the National Association of Realtors.
An early morning report that consumer confidence hit a high for the year in
December may also have helped the market. The consumer confidence index rose
102.2, up from 100.4 for November, according to the Conference Board.
ITT gained Dollars 4 3/8 at Dollars 88 1/8 as the US conglomerate sells off
various financial services to raise money to expand its entertainment
division. The company announced yesterday that it would sell two pieces of
ITT Financial to Norwest and Deutsche Bank for a total of about Dollars
3.7bn.
Shares in major retail companies were weak amid widespread, but mostly
anecdotal, reports of lower-than-expected sales for the holiday period.
Dayton Hudson dropped Dollars 4 at Dollars 68 3/4 , Kmart was off Dollars
3/8 at Dollars 12 7/8 , JC Penney fell Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 42 3/4 ,
Dillards Department Stores lost Dollars 1 at Dollars 26 3/8 and Federated
Department Stores shed Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 18 5/8 .
American depository shares of Mexican companies dropped as turmoil continued
in that country's financial markets. Telmex lost 6.8 per cent of its value
as shares fell Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 37 3/4 . Vitro lost Dollars 2 1/8 at
Dollars 11 3/8 , Coca-Cola Femsa fell Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 21, Grupo
Tribasa dropped Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 17 1/4 and Televisa shed Dollars 2
3/4 at Dollars 29 7/8 .
Toronto was closed for a public holiday.
Mexico
Equities edged away from the session's lowest levels in late trading, but
still closed sharply weaker on escalating fears about the country's currency
crisis and economic prospects.
The IPC stock index ended 65.89 points, or 2.81 per cent, lower at 2,276.90,
four points off its low point.
Analysts said investors were nervous about rising interest rates and what
the government's next step will be in trying to tackle the peso's relentless
slide against the dollar.
In Brazil the Bovespa index was down as investors sold heavily on concerns
over the Mexican currency. The Bovespa index closed at 41,137 compared with
42,782.
In Buenos Aires the Merval index was down 4 per cent to a year's low of
437.62 compared with 455.98. Losses of 17.2 per cent have been posted since
Mexico devalued the peso last week. Foreign investors sold heavily on
rumours that some banks in Argentina could be facing financial problems.

FT  28 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei finishes lower
after profit-taking
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Nikkei index, which started the week higher on arbitrage buying,
encountered profit-taking selling yesterday and finished marginally lower,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average, which rose 93.22 to 19,726.75 on Monday, gave up
15.39 to 19,711.36 after moving between a narrow range of 19,801.30 and
19,628.41. Unwinding of long arbitrage positions and profit-taking countered
buying by domestic institutional investors, while individual investors
dabbled in speculative favourites.
Volume totalled 235m shares against 291m. Although overseas investors picked
up shipbuilders and laggard stocks on Monday, most foreigners were absent
from trading yesterday. Dealers dominated the day's activity on the last
trading day for December settlement.
The Topix index of all first section stocks, which advanced 11.21 to
1,556.23 the previous day, sank 1.18 to 1,555.05. The capital weighted
Nikkei 300 lost 0.22 to 285.92 after adding 1.44 to 286.14 on Monday.
Gainers led losers yesterday by 535 to 435 with 214 issues remaining
unchanged, while on Monday advances led declines by 843 to 210 with 155
unchanged issues.
Traders said that while investor confidence was generally positive,
profit-taking selling could prevent the Nikkei index from rising above the
20,000 level this year.
Sakai Ovex, a synthetic textile maker, jumped Y15 to Y735. The issue was the
most active stock of the day, on trading by speculators.
Individual investors also bought Keisei Electric Railway, which rose Y46 to
Y820 and Suzutan, a retailer, which added Y70 to Y1,160.
Brokers, which advanced on index-linked buying Monday, lost ground. Nomura
Securities fell Y30 to Y2,070 and Daiwa Securities declined Y10 to Y1,440.
Banking stocks were also lower, with Bank of Tokyo down Y20 to Y1,520 and
Sumitomo Bank retreating Y20 to Y1,880.
In Osaka, the OSE average, which rose 184.22 to 21,512.08 on Monday, added
another 115.24 to 21,627.32 in spite of the weakness in Tokyo. Volume
totalled 66.9m shares against 70.4m.
Roundup
Many investors extended their Christmas holidays, making for quiet
conditions in much of the region. Additionally, Hong Kong, Sydney,
Wellington and Bombay were closed.
TAIPEI reversed early gains to end lower, but the plastics sector gained
ground on bargain hunting. The weighted index lost 11.20 at 6,982.91.
Turnover was TDollars 117.6bn against TDollars 72.43bn during Saturday's
shortened session.
Early buying was noticed in textile stocks following recent buying by
domestic mutual funds, but profit-taking soon took the shine off. Fubon and
Yuan Ta Duo Yuan both rose by the daily permitted 7 per cent limit to
TDollars 15.8 and TDollars 17.1 respectively.
KUALA LUMPUR edged lower in thin volume with the market consolidating after
its run-up last week. The composite index, which rose 42 points last week,
gave up 1.33 to 987.54.
Brokers said, however, that they did not expect much activity until after
the new year holidays as most fund managers had already closed their books
for the year.
MBF Capital led activity with 6.3m shares traded, rising to a high of
MDollars 2.82 on a buy recommendation by Japan's Yamaichi Securities before
closing unchanged at MDollars 2.75.
Among the utilities stocks, which had seen a recent surge on institutional
buying, Tenaga Nasional and Telekom Malaysia each fell 10 cents to MDollars
10.50 and MDollars 17.90 respectively.
BANGKOK saw late buying of communications and finance stocks push the SET
index up 7.06 to the day's high of 1,359.86, after an earlier fall of more
than 9 points. Turnover was moderate at Bt4.48bn.
A gain by TelecomAsia in the afternoon from a morning low of Bt65 boosted
sentiment, the stock rising Bt1.50 at Bt70.
The finance sector was also strong, being the most active sector, gaining
0.6 per cent on turnover of Bt688.9m.
SEOUL closed flat after a late spurt of institutional bargain-hunting wiped
out early losses from profit-taking by speculative investors in
smaller-capitalisation shares ahead of the end of the year.
The composite stock index added 0.73 to 1,025.33, of a low of 1,018.21. In
spite of the index rise, losers led gainers by 556 to 329 and 175 went limit
down, with worries about a liquidity squeeze continuing to cast a gloom over
the market.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrials index closed higher but brokers warned
that the low volume of trading had exaggerated the advance. The index picked
up 7.96 to 2,227.25, off its intraday high of 2,234.68.
JAKARTA rose modestly supported by buy-backs on second-line shares.
The JSE index inched up 0.115 to 466.307. Advancing issues overshadowed
declines by 42 to 23, with 27 issues unchanged and 125 shares untraded.
Volume was estimated at 5.92m shares worth Rp11.81bn.

FT  28 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Chinese markets still down in the
doldrums - A year of little cheer for equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Crossman, senior representative in Shanghai for Jardine Fleming, did
not mince his words: 'This has been a brutally bad year for the markets in
Shanghai.'
Shanghai's B-share market for foreign investors is some 40 per cent down on
its high for the year achieved in early January, and ominously it has sagged
badly since rallying in September and October.
The end of 1994 brought little cheer for investors in both Shanghai's
A-share market for locals and B-shares. This is a year investors would
prefer to forget.
Yesterday Shenzhen A shares dived for the fourth consecutive session as
investors were unable to find positive stimulation. The index lost 2.3 per
cent to 140.45, but in volume was down to 193m shares from the previous
session's 241.9m. Shenzhen B shares were not traded.
In Shanghai the story was similar with the A's also losing 2.3 per cent to
682.17, and the B's off a marginal 0.08 to 61.94.
Representatives of the Shanghai Stock Exchange are adopting a more sanguine
view, no doubt reflecting satisfaction with the high turnovers achieved this
year in the bond market.
According to an official Xinhua news agency dispatch, transactions in the
bond spot, futures and re-purchasing markets exceeded one trillion yuan
(USDollars 116.2bn) for the first 11 months of the year - 158 times the
figure for the previous year.
Ms Li Qian, spokeswoman for the Shanghai Stock Exchange, said that while
trading in bond futures had been robust, turnover in stocks had been quiet
for much of the year, but she expected 1995 to be livelier.
She added that there would be a big increase in new listings, including
Dollars 1bn worth B-shares listings at a planned rate of about 10 new
companies each quarter. This would boost significantly B-share market
capitalisation from the current Dollars 1.4bn. It would also more than
double the numbers of B-share counters from 33.
Ms Li also forecast that the A-share market would be enlivened by the
lifting of a freeze on new listings. Stock market regulators in Beijing had
deferred until 1995 Yn5.5bn worth of new listed stock because of concern
about overloading a flagging market with new issues.
Among other factors likely to affect the market next year is the expected
promulgation of a new national securities law that has gone through at least
10 drafts, and is yet to be presented to the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress for approval.
The securities industry has been agitating for the early passage of the law
to help build confidence in the markets buffeted too much adverse publicity
this year, including several high profile insider trading cases.
A new national law governing B-shares is also in the works and is expected
to appear in the new year.
Stock analysts in Shanghai expect the B-share market to recover in 1995, but
also warn that this will depend to a large extent on a revival of confidence
in China's efforts to deal with its economic problems. The performance of
Hong Kong stocks will also weigh heavily with the Chinese markets.
Mr Crossman of Jardine Fleming said there was no doubt that confidence had
'taken a hit' this year, and people might be asking themselves whether it
might not have been a little early to enter the market. Among problems for
B-share investors was an illiquid market with turnover falling to very low
levels.
Richard Graham, chief representative in Shanghai of Baring Securities,
believes that comments recently by Premier Li Peng suggesting that China's
stock markets were 'experimental' had not contributed greatly to confidence
but 'suggested a lack of political commitment to the development of capital
markets.''
Mr Li Peng's remark, he added, did not augur well for the innovative
development of the markets, and the introduction of such instruments as
warrants, indexed futures and other derivatives.
Investors were likely to continue to be skittish for the time being as
evidenced by the lukewarm reception given to recent listings such as Huashin
Cement which tumbled 18.5 per cent at issue in spite of a price earnings
multiple of seven.
Mr Graham drew three broad categories of investors in China's B-share
markets at this stage: the China funds which are locked in to the market;
the emerging market funds, which have a wide choice; and possiblely a third
who might be tempted to take a contrary position with the B-share market
having fallen so low.
Shanghai analysts, while they might differ on likely trends next year, would
agree that artificial attempts by the authorities to boost the market, as
happened late last summer, will be treated much more warily next time.
Beijing , panicked by the market's free fall, introduced emergency measures
in August, freezing new listings, indicating that the A-share market would
be open to foreign investors through joint venture funds, and making funds
available to securities companies for share purchases. The A-share market
rose to a high for the year of 1092.85 on September 13 before it quickly
subsided to a trading range between 600-700.
Market regulators should have learned by now that there are no 'quick
fixes'.

FT  28 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Politics is driving force for
Milan, Madrid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong opening on Wall Street provided a cue for a positive direction
among many of the continent's markets.
MILAN extended its rally, picking up 1.4 per cent, on renewed hopes of a
swift end to the country's political crisis. The Comit index rose 8.68 to
637.68, approaching the 640 level which some analysts see as a resistance
point, as the market began to discount the formation of a broader coalition,
including the centrist Popular Party.
Ferruzzi rose L83 or 6.9 per cent to L1,280 with its strength attributed to
window dressing by stockholding banks which have had to book losses on loans
to the former parent company, Serafino, together with hopes Ferfin may soon
sell Fondiaria.
Olivetti gained L45 to L2,085 after the computer group said that it had
agreed to sell its 53.9 per cent stake in the news and financial information
group, Radiocor Telerate, to the Il Sole 24 Ore group.
MADRID was dragged down to a low for the year by continuing political fears
following high court investigations into the role of former leading security
chiefs in illicit anti-ETA activity in the early 1980's.
The general index lost 8.26 or 2.8 per cent to 284.62 amid worries that the
rumour laden atmosphere would deter foreign investors.
The market was led lower by sharp falls for Telefonica, Pta75 or 4.8 per
cent lower at Pta1,490, Argentaria, Pta310 or 6.3 per cent down at Pta4,620
and Santander which lost Pta260 or 4.9 per cent to Pta5,060.
ZURICH was firmer in thin volume with some of the gains attributed to
window-dressing ahead of the end of the year, and banks in particular said
to be buying their own shares.
The SMI index gained 22.5 to 2,673.5.
Zurich Insurance bearers picked up SFr1 to SFr1,261 but the registered
shares were SFr1 lower at SFr1,266 as the market found difficulty in
assessing the impact of the cooperation deal with Sweden's Trygg-Hansa. The
deal opens the way for Zurich to take over part of the insurance business of
Trygg's 64 per cent-owned US affilate, Home Holdings.
Holderbank bounced SFr27 to SFr1,030 on a reassessment of Friday's 3.7 per
cent fall which followed concerns about the company's exposure in Mexico,
and a downgrading from UBS.
STOCKHOLM featured a 3.8 per cent jump in Trygg-Hansa in otherwise thin
holiday trade with lower debt yields and the early rally on Wall Street
contributing to a firm tone. The Affarsvarlden index rose 2.90 to 1,474.00.
Trygg-Hansa B shares finished SKr3 higher at SKr81 following the
announcement that it had cancelled an agreement with US investors to bale
out its troubled Home Holdings subsidiary in favour of a new, in-principle
agreement with Zurich Insurance.
Partly as a result of Trygg, the day's winning sector was banking and
insurance whose sub-index rose by 0.6 per cent.
Volvo's B share rose SKr1.50 to SKr139, extending a pre-Christmas rally,
amid rumours that the automotive group would sell its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Branded Consumer Products, before the end of the year.
FRANKFURT moved upward, the Dax index adding 12.14 to 2,106.15 in the floor
session, then rising to 2,110.77 in the Ibis.
Daimler rose DM8.50 to DM772.50 as its Mercedes unit said that it expected
to see a return to profit in 1994. Worldwide sales were expected to show an
increase of about 9 per cent to some DM70bn.
Kaufhof, up DM1.50 at DM772.50, announced that it had asked the Federal
Cartel office to approve the merger of its ITS travel unit with
Hanover-based Touristik Union International.
PARIS did not find comfort from the gains on Wall Street, with investors
instead choosing to take profits at the start of the new account. The CAC-40
index lost 10.59 to 1,955.98 in low volume.
Among the day's movers Eurotunnel saw interest, losing 60 centimes to
FFr23.90, with EuroDisney firmed 20 centimes to FFr11.35.
AMSTERDAM edged higher, with the AEX index adding 3.56 to 417.96.
Ahold, up Fl 1.00 at Fl 61.20, confirmed that the food retailing group
expected investments in 1995 to exceed the Fl 1bn level seen in 1994.
ABN Amro topped the most actives list gaining 80 cents to Fl 61.20.
BolsWessanen, up 30 cents at Fl 33.40, said that it was combining its frozen
snacks companies under a single name.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Markets report: Peso slumps to record lows against US dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the aftermath of the Christmas holiday, the American foreign exchange
markets continued to provide the main focus of market interest, write Lisa
Bransten and Gillian Tett.
The dollar was steady within year-end ranges against major currencies
yesterday while the Mexican peso hit record lows against the US currency.
Late in the session the US currency was mixed against the Japanese yen and
the D-Mark. The dollar rose modestly to Y100.44 up from Y100.18 late Friday,
while falling slightly to DM1.5758 against the German currency from DM1.5790
Friday.
Meanwhile trading in Europe was extremely quiet, with London and several
other major exchanges still closed after the Christmas holiday.
The peso added to last week's dramatic losses yesterday falling about 10 per
cent against the dollar. By late afternoon the same-day, 24-hour and 48-hour
contracts closed 50 centavos down to 5.40/5.60 new pesos to the dollar while
same day contracts fell 1.05 new pesos from Friday's close to 5.55/5.75.
Last week the peso lost 30 per cent against the dollar.
Activity in the peso market was extremely volatile. Many traders were
watching the Mexican stock market for clues about what the peso might do.
The bolsa's key IPC index plunged further in late afternoon trading.
Some traders attributed the peso's continued plunge to growing tension in
the state of Chiapas as the anniversary of the peasant uprising in that
state approaches.
On January 1 of this year a group in Chiapas launched a rebellion against
state authorities that remains unsettled.
Late in the day, the US Treasury department a statement saying that 'recent
movements in the peso have gone far beyond what can be justified by
economics.'
In Washington a World Bank official was quoted by Reuter as saying that
Mexico was unlikely to draw on the Dollars 6bn swap facility arranged
between its central bank and US agencies to calm financial markets. He said
that it could only tap it in the event of a 'real catastrophe', such as the
collapse of oil prices.
Against major currencies, the dollar was trading within recent ranges.
Margaret Kudarauskas, a senior foreign exchange analyst at Thomson Financial
Services, said there was no fundamental reason for the dollar's gain against
the yen.
She added that rumours of orders to sell large amounts of dollars of the
currency runs up between Y100.50 and Y101 would probably keep the US
currency below the Y100.50 mark.
The dollar's loss against the D-Mark came as that currency gained against
other European currencies.
Volume on US currency markets was extremely light with most market activity
due to companies purchasing foreign exchange for business reasons, not
traders betting on rising or falling currency values, according to Ms
Kudarauskas.
The peso continued to be the main focus of the day, as it plunged to a new
low point against the dollar in nervous trading.
Most market activity yesterday - and most of last week - was due to
companies purchasing foreign exchange for business reasons, not traders
betting on rising or falling currency values, according to Ms Kudarauskas.
Trading in Europe was extremely quiet yesterday, with the London exchanges
remaining closed. Sterling weakened slightly against the D-Mark, closing at
DM2.438, down from Friday's close of DM2.441.
Against the American currency it also weakened fractionally, closing at
Dollars 1.546, down from Dollars 1.547 at the close on Friday.
Trading in the European crosses was also extremely quiet, although the lira
slipped slightly against the D-Mark, as the Italian currency continued to be
undermined by the political uncertainty gripping the country.
The Turkish central bank raised its overnight lending rate to 110 per cent
in the afternoon from 95 opening to control dollar rates, bankers said.

US Treasury prices rose across the maturity spectrum yesterday. The yield
curve depicting the relation between two-year and 30-year bonds pushed close
to flat as the long end of the market gained more than the short end.
Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  25/32 at
96 31/32 , yielding 7.756 per cent. The two-year note rose  1/16 to 99 21/32
, yielding 7.673 per cent.
The yield spread between the two-year and the long bond shrunk down to 7.7
basis points before rebounding later in the day.
Prices dipped early in the morning after the conference board released a
stronger-than-expected report on consumer confidence. Prices recovered later
amid short-selling by traders reacting to relatively weak home sales.
European markets were very quiet, with most participants on holiday and the
UK market closed. German bonds got a small lift from firmer US Treasuries,
and the March bund futures contract on DTB ended at 98.84, up 0.08, albeit
on extremely thin volume.
The German government will launch its year-end bond today. The first tranche
of the 10-year paper - expected to carry a 7.5 per cent coupon  - will be
placed via the traditional bond consortium and a second tranche is due to be
auctioned tomorrow.
In Spain, continued jitters surrounding political scandals undermined the
market, causing the March bond future to tumble by 0.68 to 84.20.
In Italy, the March bond future rose by 0.29 to 99.82, despite continued
political uncertainty following Mr Silvio Berlusconi's resignation last week
as prime minister.

FT  28 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Syndicated lenders take
another look at covenants as pricing nears the floor - Loans have become a
cheap alternative to bonds this year. Martin Brice looks at prospects for
1995
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE big issue in the syndicated loans market this year has been pricing, as
margins have fallen by up to 50 per cent. The questions for 1995 are whether
pricing will fall further, and whether covenants will become weaker.
Although bankers are divided on the direction of pricing, one thing is
certain. If margins fall any further, banks will start paying borrowers to
take out loans. As one banker said last week: 'We are close to the floor
now. There is not much room for movement.'
As for covenants, while some bankers expect to see weaker structures, others
are not so sure. 'What won't happen this time around in the economic cycle
is a dramatic weakening of covenants,' said one banker. 'People have learnt
from some pretty ghastly experiences in the recession, so they will compete
on price.'
The fall in pricing has been most evident in loans for strong, respected
names. Some bankers expect this movement to transfer to names not rated so
highly. 'While liquidity remains strong, there remains strong pressure on
pricing for lesser quality credits,' said one market participant.
On the question of pricing, the jumbo loan for Sweden and the Ecu6bn deal
for Spain set benchmarks. The Spain deal was priced at 4.25 basis points for
the facility fee and a margin of 4.5 basis points over the London interbank
offered rate (Libor).
This level of pricing raised eyebrows, but within months even this margin
had been cut, with Citibank and JP Morgan arranging Dollars 6bn for Sweden
at a facility fee of 4 basis points and a spread if drawn of 4 basis points
over Libor. The fall in pricing has been rapid; as one banker at another
house said: 'Margins have come down faster than we expected.'
Bankers behind the Dollars 6bn syndicated loan for Sweden are planning a
dinner to celebrate the completion of the deal. Appropriately, as Sweden
voted to join the European Union this year, they plan a trip on Eurostar,
the Channel Tunnel train, to Brussels. 'Good luck to them,' said a banker
not involved in the deal.
However, bankers are not the only people with cause to celebrate that loan,
which was unquestionably a benchmark deal in the international lending
market.
The Riksgalds Kontoret, or Swedish National Debt Office, also has cause to
celebrate. It now has a total of Dollars 6bn available from 46 banks, for a
total annual fee of just Dollars 2.4m.
Sweden will use the money to pay off two more expensive existing loans, of
which around Dollars 1bn is outstanding, so this loan means Sweden starts
the year with Dollars 5bn in reserve. Since its borrowing requirement for
1994 was around Dollars 24.5bn, it seems well placed for 1995.
If the rocky ride in the bond markets continues, we may see Sweden return to
the syndicated lending market for funding. If it does, observers will be
very interested to see what price it pays.
Corporate borrowers from Scandinavia have also been active this year in the
loans market, where they can now get prices similar to those prevailing at
the end of the 1980s, when 25 basis points over Libor was available.
Televerket of Norway and Vattenfall of Sweden have secured funds this year
at around 19 basis points over Libor, and bankers point out that last year
they would have had to pay around 40 basis points over.
Borrowers coming to the loans market to escape bruising in the bond markets
is likely to be a feature of 1995.
Italy is one area where uncertainty in the bond market may prompt borrowers
to access the market for international credits.
NatWest Markets has recently arranged a deal for Finmeccanica, the big
Italian state-owned engineering group, thereby opening up the Italian
corporate sector of the syndicated loans market after a gap of several
years. This deal was priced at 40 basis points over Libor.
Another feature of 1994 has been the reappearance of Japanese banks, which
have fought aggressively for loans. Although this may have had an effect on
the fall in pricing, a glance at the names of banks in syndicates for loans
shows that their influence is not overbearing.
As one banker said: 'There is no question that Japanese banks have been
active, but it (the fall in pricing) is global, not just a specific part of
the investor world.'
Other bankers point to the names in both the Sweden and Spain deals this
year, where apart from domestic banks, there were 28 institutions from eight
countries involved.
The list for the Dollars 1.5bn loan for Airbus Finance shows that of the 49
banks in the deal, only 13 are Japanese. This deal, arranged by JP Morgan,
was launched into syndication as a Dollars 1bn loan but attracted
commitments of more than Dollars 2.3bn, and was increased to Dollars 1.5bn.
The Airbus Finance deal is notable in that the loan is guaranteed by the
four parents of Airbus until the long-term unsecured and unguaranteed debt
of Airbus Finance is rated at A1 or A+ or equivalent by two credit rating
agencies. At that point the guarantee ends.
As a banker said: 'Pricing has continued to fall and structures (covenants)
continue to get weaker. We are at the stage where margins on high quality
credits are wafer thin. This is a cyclical problem with the syndicated loans
market and I don't expect any change from other cycles. There will be loan
losses, and margins will rise.'
However, one borrower for whom margins are unlikely to rise for the next
five years is John Lewis, the UK retailer. NM Rothschild has arranged an
innovative Pounds 140m facility which allows the company to lock in at
existing rates, during the life of the five-year facility, which is limited
to a core of banks which already have a relationship with the company.
A banker close to the deal said: 'If the market continues to improve in its
favour, the company will get the benefits.'
Another benchmark deal was the Pounds 350m loan for East Midlands
Electricity, the UK power utility, which was priced at a facility fee of 7
basis points on the undrawn portion of the loan and a margin of 15 basis
points over Libor on the drawn part of the loan.
Although widely regarded in the market as a deal too far at the time,
nevertheless the loan was completed. A banker close to the deal said: 'It
met resistance but it was done.'
While the deals for Sweden and Spain set benchmarks, a deal for Thai
International Airways has raised eyebrows. This 10-year, Dollars 115m loan
guaranteed by the Thai Ministry of Finance is believed to be priced at Libor
flat, leaving banks with little if any profit.
'This is just absurd. We have our mouths open in amazement. The market has
gone berserk again,' said one banker.
One person giving the impression of keeping his feet firmly on the ground
among all this is Mr Walter Shipley, chairman and chief executive of
Chemical Bank, a leader in the syndicated loans market.
Mr Shipley has said publicly that Chemical is prepared to lose its dominance
of the US market in loans rather than yield to pressure for looser terms.
This raised eyebrows among competitors, since Chemical is perceived to set
some of the most aggressive terms for loans.
His concern on covenants was shared by the Bank for International
Settlements, which, in its November quarterly report on financial market
trends, highlighted the rise in popularity of loans.
The report said: 'The high volume of loanable funds stimulated competition
to win business: the average maturity of loans was increased, spreads
charged over inter-bank rates were reduced and covenant clauses were further
relaxed.'
The report also said institutional investors' reluctance to commit funds at
fixed interest rates for long periods led an increasing number of
lower-rated or lesser-known borrowers to turn to syndicated loans.
This has led some market participants and regulators to caution against the
risk of a reversion to the low credit standards which prevailed in the late
1980s.
As one observer said last week: 'It would be nice if bankers had longer
memories.' However, he added: 'There are too many banks in the world and
there is too great a supply of money compared to weak demand.'

FT  28 DEC 94 / International Company News: Investment group buys Adidas
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A group of international investors has taken control of Adidas AG, the
German sports equipment company, according to Credit Lyonnais, the French
state-owned bank which sold a 20 per cent stake in the group.
Under the terms of the deal, a consortium of investors including Mr
Robert-Louis Dreyfus, the chairman of Adidas AG, will acquire Adidas
International Holding, which controls the company. The amount of the
transaction is thought to value Adidas at about DM1.4bn (Dollars 887m).
The deal marks the latest in a series of ownership changes in the company
and reflects the desire by Credit Lyonnais to dispose of assets to reduce
debts. The loss-making bank said it has sold assets worth almost FFr10bn
this year as part of a rescue plan.
The group of international investors, joined in a newly-created company
called Sogedim, also bought stakes in Adidas International Holding from
Assurances Generales de France, the insurer, and several investment funds.
In addition to Mr Dreyfus, a former chief executive of Saatchi and Saatchi,
Sogedim includes Mr David Bromelow, a British publisher, Mr Christian
Tourres and two US shareholders, Mr Tom Russell and Ms Mary Friday.
Adidas said 1994 profits would confirm the recovery begun in 1993 after
losses of DM150m in 1992. It said pre-tax profits would be significantly
higher than DM100m, compared with DM34m in 1993.

FT  28 DEC 94 / International Company News: Telekom sails into unknown
waters - Germany's newly privatised utility had a troubled launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sailing off into unknown waters with neither steersman nor charts is hardly
the most promising set of circumstances, least of all for the gaggle of
absolute beginners manning Deutsche Telekom. Yet Germany's state-owned
telecommunications utility was launched down the privatisation slip-way last
week in just such conditions.
Chairman Mr Helmut Ricke was at the Cologne ceremony at which Telekom, the
postal service and the post office bank were officially transformed into
joint stock companies. But as he had announced two weeks earlier, he was
leaving the board 'for purely personal reasons'.
Mr Tyll Necker, grizzled doyen of German business, was also present but not
in the role the government had intended. Just as Mr Ricke had turned down a
two-year extension of his contract, Mr Necker had rejected the government's
offer of a seat on the Telekom supervisory board.
He was more forthcoming about his cold-shoulder: he was worried about how Mr
Gerhard Pfeffermann, state secretary in the post ministry, could reconcile
the conflict of interests implicit in his dual role as a representative of
Telekom's owners and as a regulator. For his pains he was awarded a verbal
mugging from unrepentant post minister Mr Wolfgang Botsch, who thought his
reasons 'incomprehensible'.
Rejected both by the man who in only four years has wrought deep-seated
changes in the monstrous Telekom hierarchy and one of the country's most
respected industrial figureheads, Mr Botsch in turn ejected Mr Peter Bross,
from his job as the chief architect of German telecoms liberalisation.
In the kerfuffle which followed, it emerged that there had long been
friction between Mr Bross, the technocrat, and Mr Pfeffermann, the
politician, over the principles on which the Telekom privatisation is
grounded.
Specifically, according to supporters of Mr Bross: talk of liberalisation of
telecoms markets - on which swathes of industry are planning huge
investments - is 'empty political talk'.
'We need far more transparency,' one government official said. 'Who is
helped when the minister says he will liberalise telecoms markets by 1998
without explaining what will be liberalised or how?' Mr Ricke's refusal of a
contract extension was bad, but Mr Bross's removal set the signals in the
wrong direction and would damage Germany's image, he added.
The common thread which appears to link the sequence of defection, rejection
and sacking is concern that Telekom's management, which has about 18 months
to prepare for the first stage of privatisation and two years to brace
itself against the onslaught of free competition is going to find itself
hog-tied by political interference and opportunism.
A predominance of politicians on the newly-appointed supervisory board and
the consequent underweight representation of business and technical skills
is already seen as a potential obstacle. Management plans for major
investments, structural changes or top appointments have to be approved by
the board of supervisors.
Then there is the government's surrogate, the so-called Federal Institute
for Post and Telecommunications which is to act as an umbrella holding
company for all three former post office departments.
This 3,500-strong body, which will have certain key tasks such as
negotiating employment conditions for a large proportion of Telekom's
230,000 employees, is also to be headed by a group of politicians.
As a recent analysis by Deutsche Bank of the company's prospects pointed
out: 'The relationship between the holding and its subsidiaries will be an
important factor in the valuation of Deutsche Telekom. A key factor will be
the ability of the management (Telekom's) to create shareholder value
without supervisory conflicts.'
Meanwhile, government has to prepare and win approval for new legislation
constituting the regulatory framework within which Germany's liberalised
telecoms market will function. Existing laws are valid only until 1997, and
according to bankers associated with the privatisation share sale, there has
been no sign yet of any draft legislation.
In so far as potential combatants have already been removed or retired from
the scene, the potential for conflict has been reduced. But Mr Botsch's
refusal to review his decision to post Mr Pfeffermann to the supervisory
board, his brusque treatment of Mr Necker and Mr Bross appear to be the
deeds of a man determined to have his own way rather than find a consensus.
It is only a matter of weeks since he shocked Telekom with the announcement
that Germany would scrap its state monopoly on the federal
telecommunications network at the end of 1997. Until then the utility had
been working on the assumption, fostered by the minister, that the network
monopoly would remain in place until 2000.
Mr Rolf-Dieter Leister, supervisory board chairman, protested immediately.
'I certainly do not represent the view that Germany should become the
front-runner in European telecoms liberalisation,' he said.
He also complained that day-to-day management was hampered by the need for
all important decisions to be approved at the political level. If
shareholder interest was to be cultivated to assure a successful float,
Telekom's mandate had to be clarified as quickly as possible. It was
particularly important that it should be able to establish foreign
subsidiaries without Mr Botsch's having the final say.
The minister made a point at last week's ceremony of stressing that the
three former post office companies were now free to spread their wings in
commercial ventures beyond Germany's borders.
While this is strictly true in German legalistic terms, it fails to take
account of the fact that the international playing field - most notably
those parts on German and French territory, for example - is in distinct
need of levelling.
AT&amp;T of the US was quick to object on these grounds to a proposed deal under
which Telekom and its French counterpart want to buy a 20 per cent stake in
Sprint, a leading US long-distance carrier. The Federal Communications
Commission and/or the Justice Department should prevent the investment until
AT&amp;T and other US competitors were allowed equal opportunities in Europe, it
said.
Lack of liberalisation was also an important factor in the recent decision
of the Brussels competition authorities to block a proposed joint venture in
multi-media between Telekom, the Bertelsmann media and music group and Mr
Leo Kirch, a Munich film distribution magnate.
If it had been allowed it could have effectively shut out all prospective
competition for many years - a state of affairs to which Telekom has grown
accustomed over the years, and one to which Mr Botsch still seems strongly
attached.

FT  28 DEC 94 / International Company News: Mercedes-Benz to return to
profit
</HEADLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mercedes-Benz, the luxury car subsidiary of Germany's Daimler-Benz, will be
back in the 'black' in 1994 following heavy losses of more than DM1.2bn
(Dollars 760m) for 1993, Mr Helmut Werner, chairman of the board said
yesterday in an end-of-year statement. However, he did not disclose the
extent of the profits.
At the same time, Mr Werner confirmed that world-wide group sales rose 9 per
cent to DM70bn for 1994.
The more optimistic results stem from an upswing in the US and west European
economies, a trend which is expected to continue throughout next year. But
Mr Werner added that the optimistic forecasts were also based on what he
called a 'product offensive' in both business areas (cars and trucks),
adding that Mercedes will start a complete renewal of van and truck
programmes at the start of 1995 with the introduction of its new transport
vans.
This year, Mr Werner said car deliveries would rise by 15 per cent, or by
more than 585,000 compared with 1993, while deliveries of trucks and buses
would grow by a similar margin to 290,000.
For 1995, he added that 'we expect an increase in deliveries of cars on the
same scale as this year, despite the replacement of our E-Class, and a clear
rise to over 300,000 units in commercial vehicles'.
Next year, Mercedes-Benz expects its worldwide deliveries of cars to match
1994 levels, while deliveries of commercial vehicles should rise to more
than 300,000 units from 290,000 in 1994.

FT  28 DEC 94 / International Company News: Cadillac Fairview gets court
protection
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Cadillac Fairview, the big Canadian property developer, has obtained court
protection from its creditors while it tries to stitch together a financial
restructuring.
The Toronto-based company, whose securities are held mainly by North
American institutional investors and 'vulture' funds, has debts of CDollars
5.3bn (USDollars 3.8bn), including CDollars 2.3bn of mortgages tied to
specific properties.
Its developments include the landmark Eaton Centre and Toronto-Dominion
Centre in Toronto, Pacific Place in Vancouver, and commercial buildings in
several US cities.
Cadillac sought the court order in an effort to prevent nervous creditors
triggering a liquidation of assets.
The action was directed mainly at Goldman Sachs, the New York investment
bank which holds 28 per cent of Cadillac's senior bank debt, totalling
CDollars 1.1bn.
A real-estate investment fund managed by Goldman is also one of four parties
which have submitted proposals to acquire a controlling equity stake in
Cadillac as part of the proposed restructuring. Despite its balance-sheet
problems, Cadillac is widely regarded as having a blue-chip property
portfolio.
The other three bidders are New York's Blackstone Group in partnership with
JP Morgan; a real-estate management firm controlled by US financier Mr
Gerald O'Connor, in partnership with the Ontario teachers' pension fund; and
a group comprising Canada's Cambridge Shopping Centres and the Caisse de
Depot, the Quebec public pension fund.
Mr Justice James Farley gave Cadillac until January 31 to present a draft
restructuring plan. During this period, management will be allowed to
negotiate with potential investors, without sharing details with the
creditors.
However, Goldman Sachs's 28 per cent holding of one class of debt is
sufficient to block any proposal which it finds unacceptable.

Bank stake

<TEXT>
Credit Suisse, the main banking arm of Swiss financial group CS Holding,
confirmed that the Hungarian government has chosen it as the lead contender
to take a controlling stake in the planned privatisation of Budapest Bank,
reports Reuter from Zurich.
A Credit Suisse spokesman said the Swiss bank would be ready to make a
formal offer 'by the end of the first quarter of 1995', but declined to
speculate on the possible size.
The acquisition would considerably strengthen Credit Suisse's presence in
eastern Europe. So far it only has a branch in Moscow and a representative
office in Vienna.
Earlier this year, it withdrew an offer to share in the privatisation of
Austria's second-largest bank, Creditanstalt, following political
opposition.
CS First Boston, the investment banking arm of CS Holding, has been very
aggressive in expanding into eastern Europe. Credit Suisse mainly targets
commercial banking.

<TEXT>
The US entertainment group Time Warner is planning to form a joint venture
with two Japanese companies, Itochu and Toshiba, and the US regional
telephone company US West, to spend Dollars 400m on building cable
television systems in Japan.
Although both Time Warner and US West declined to comment, a spokeswoman for
Toshiba in Tokyo yesterday confirmed that the four companies were
considering joining forces to set up a company to develop the Japanese cable
market.
'We are still in the middle of discussions, but we may finalise a decision
soon,' she said. She would not give details and said nothing concrete had
been decided.
Toshiba and Itochu are already linked to Time Warner through their joint
ownership of a 12.5 per cent stake in Time Warner Entertainment, the
subsidiary which runs the group's cable television operations. US West owns
25 per cent of the business.
Earlier this month Tele-Communications, the largest US cable operator,
announced a joint venture with the Sumitomo Corporation to develop cable
systems in Japan.

FT  28 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Doubled bonus for Tate &amp; Lyle chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bonus paid to Sir Neil Shaw, chairman and highest paid director of Tate
&amp; Lyle, the sugars and sweeteners group, doubled last year to Pounds 200,000
for the year to September 24.
Sir Neil's remuneration, excluding pension fund contributions, increased by
26 per cent to Pounds 456,000, although his salary eased from Pounds 261,000
to Pounds 256,000, according to the annual report and accounts published
yesterday. For the year 1992-93, his total remuneration fell from Pounds
375,000 to Pounds 361,000, including a bonus of Pounds 100,000.
Last month Tate &amp; Lyle reported record annual profits of Pounds 273.8m, up
23 per cent on the previous year, on the back of a strong performance from
US cereal sweeteners and starches. Fully diluted earnings per share rose 13
per cent to 37.1p, while the dividend was 11 per cent ahead at 14.4p.
The main factor behind the rise was a turnround at Staley, the US
subsidiary, which brought in record results after several years of disputes
over working practices at one of its Illinois plants. Just before Christmas
the group announced a Dollars 78m (Pounds 50m) expansion project for Staley
which will eventually double capacity for both high fructose corn syrup and
modified starch.
Staley's gains last year masked a downturn in the US sugar profits following
record beet supplies. But the group would not give specific figures for
sugar, in line with a decision to reduce the data it publishes. Sir Neil
said it was detrimental to the business to give more information than
competitors, many of which were private companies.

FT  28 DEC 94 / International Company News: Samas makes German purchase -
Dutch group will get 10 per cent of European office furnishings market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Samas, the Dutch office furnishings company, said yesterday it had reached
final agreement on acquiring a majority stake in Schaerf, the German office
furniture maker, from the Schaerf family.
The acquisition will nearly double Samas's annual turnover to Fl 1.4bn
(Dollars 800m) and will give it 10 per cent of the European market for
office furnishings. Samas said this would make it the European market
leader.
The company declined to say how much it will pay the Schaerf family for its
58.7 per cent stake. The remaining 41.3 per cent of the Schaerf group's
shares do not carry voting rights and are listed on the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange. 'The Samas group is not considering a bid for these shares', the
Dutch company said.
The two companies are largely complementary, both in their products and
their geographic markets. Schaerf makes a range of wooden off-ice desk and
chairs and generates nearly three-quarters of its sales in Germany, while
Samas focuses mainly on the Netherlands, France and Britain.
Schaerf also has production facilities in Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary, providing the Dutch company with a foothold in Eastern Europe.
Although Samas would not reveal the purchase price, it said part of the
financing for the deal would be raised through a rights issue of
convertible, cumulative pref-erence shares that would be worth at least Fl
152m before costs.
In the first quarter of 1995, Samas's shareholders will be able to subscribe
to one new preference share for every two ordinary shares they own. ING
Bank, lead manager, will underwrite the issue at a guaranteed price of at
least Fl 74 per preference share.

FT  28 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Companies come up with Pounds 331m for
Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost 30 companies are providing the extra Pounds 331m in corporate capital
Lloyd's of London has attracted for underwriting next year, according to a
list released by the insurance market.
Corporate investors at Lloyd's fall into two categories. First are the
spread vehicles and investment trusts, which invest in a range of insurance
syndicates. The profitability of these companies will depend on their
expertise in selecting the best performing syndicates.
Second, are 'dedicated' companies which invest in only a narrow range of
syndicates run by a single Lloyd's managing agency. The purest form of
dedicated company - and the closest to the embryonic insurance companies
which many expect to dominate Lloyd's of the future - are the 'corporate
syndicates', where the new capital is the syndicate's only source of funds.
Corporate syndicates do not have to be 'annual ventures' as is traditional
for Lloyd's insurance syndicates. This means premium income can be invested,
more efficiently, over a longer period.
Of this year's new investors, four are listed on the UK stock exchange -
including two 'dedicated' companies, Kiln Capital and Wellington
Underwriting.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Peso's fall packs a double whammy: Ted Bardacke looks at the
heavy pressure devaluation will place on Mexico's corporate and banking
sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 39 per cent devaluation of the Mexican peso since December 19 has the
country's banks and big companies struggling to estimate how much the change
will cost them, both in terms of 1994 profits and 1995 revenue. Many are
frightened by what they see.
Projected lower economic growth and high interest rates coupled with
exchange rate losses on dollar-denominated debt will eat up the profits of
many companies, even among those who may ultimately benefit from a weaker
currency. But the banking system, which apparently will escape 1994
relatively unscathed, is the main long-term worry.
Expensive domestic financing costs, slow economic growth and exchange rate
exposure are nothing new to Mexican companies, At various times during the
presidency of Mr Carlos Salinas, they suffered through similar conditions,
such as suffocating interest rates in 1992, recession in 1993, and foreign
exchange losses approaching Dollars 1bn in the first quarter alone of 1994.
But these factors never coincided as strongly as they do now. 'We didn't get
much sleep last week. And when we did sleep, we didn't sleep very well,'
confesses Mr Jose Cavillo, finance director of Comercial Mexicana, the
country's third largest retail chain. 'Profits have disappeared and all we
can project for next year is uncertainty.'
Only a few of the Mexican blue-chip companies whose shares trade on Wall
Street will escape the effects of devaluation. In the league table (above)
of the country's biggest corporate debtors, the lower a company appears, the
greater its relative exchange rate loss from devaluation. Companies with
already high export levels or dollar earnings, such as the
telecommunications monopoly Telmex and the glassmaker Vitro, will not be hit
that hard, although Telmex is projecting a fourth quarter after-tax exchange
rate loss of approximately P1.3bn (Pounds 150m). Companies with low overall
debt levels or inelastic demand for their products, such as the retailer
Cifra and cornflour and tortilla group Maseca, are the best prepared to
confront 1995.
And while many companies say they are relieved that the devaluation took
place at the end of 1994 so that they can start 1995 with a clean slate, the
extreme situation at Comercial Mexicana shows what companies will have to
deal with in the coming months.
The fact that nearly all of Comercial Mexicana's P785m debt is in dollars,
and that it has absolutely no foreign exchange earnings, is only the
beginning. The company also expects low economic growth - if not outright
recession - in 1995.
Couple that with a projected decline in real wages as the government is
unable to control prices as tightly as it controls the unions, and the
outlook for any company is problematic at least.
In general analysts say that consumer products will take a nosedive, while
hotel and resort operators like Situr will weather the storm as property is
valued in dollars and Mexico becomes more attractive to foreign tourists.
Construction is the big question mark. Increased foreign direct investment
may be offset by lower overall growth.
But no matter what the immediate effect the devaluation has on individual
companies, they are all worried about the increase they face in financing
costs. Annual interest rates on peso loans from Mexican banks now stand at
between 35 and 45 per cent, while foreign sources have dried up for the
moment and will be expensive when they return.
'The margins at our stores can't cover more than an 18 per cent cost of
capital. And dollars, if they exist, are going to cost significantly more
than the 7 to 8 per cent we were getting before the devaluation,' Mr Cavillo
says. 'We are going to have to watch our cash position very closely next
year because cash may be all we have.'
The consensus among financial analysts is that as companies lower their
capital demands because of high interest rates and low economic growth,
Mexican banks will see little or no growth in their loan portfolios. Yet
this is just the start of the concerns about the banking system.
'Things that used to worry us only a few days ago, such as asset quality . .
. and total loan growth of 10 per cent, could be just a pleasant dream of
the past,' Mr Petru Vaduva of Bear Stearns says in Fasten Your Seat Belts,
his analysis of the post-devaluation Mexican financial sector.
Most loans in Mexico carry variable interest rates. As rates shoot up to 40
per cent and beyond, defaults are likely, especially in the consumer sector
such as credit cards, mortgages and car loans. Mr Eduardo Garcia of Banca
Serfin, Mexico's third largest bank, says: 'The quality of our loan
portfolio is no doubt going to get worse. If people don't have money they
simply aren't going to pay. We just don't know exactly how much of our
portfolio is going to be in that position.'
Dollars account for about 15 per cent of the liabilities of the Mexican
banking system, so net income will suffer from exchange rate losses as well
as from increased one-time charges for bad loans. But analysts say 1994
balance sheets should still look reasonably good and that the real warning
signals are on capital and reserve levels.
By law Mexican banks are required to put aside reserves not only for
uncollectible loans but for potential bad loans as well. This will cost
banks money in 1995, as would - if it now goes ahead - a planned increase in
required capital from 8 per cent of assets to 9.5 per cent at the behest of
the finance ministry. In addition, much of banks' current capital is either
in the Mexican stock market - down more than 50 per cent in dollar terms so
far in 1994 - or in long-term government securities, the value of which has
also fallen heavily.
Most banks will need new capital even to meet the current 8 per cent
requirement.
The problem, explains Serfin's Mr Garcia, is that not much capital is
available. 'Forget the international capital markets,' he says. 'It will be
a long time before they invest in Mexican banks again. And the national
market is going to be pretty dry as well. Everybody with money is going to
be using it to help their own businesses, not ours.'

FT  28 DEC 94 / ITT sells financial units for Dollars 3.7bn: Break-up
speculation as Deutsche Bank and Norwest buy commercial finance and consumer
lending arms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ITT, the US conglomerate, is selling two of its financial services
businesses for Dollars 3.7bn (Pounds 2.3bn) to fund its expansion in the
leisure and entertainment industries.
The two units - ITT Commercial Finance and the consumer lending operation
Island Finance - are being bought by the German banking group Deutsche Bank
and the US banking group Norwest, respectively.
ITT says it is near to completing the sale of another part of ITT Financial,
including property services and small business finance, to an unnamed buyer
for Dollars 1.8bn. The company said the remaining 25 per cent of ITT
Financial - the reinsurance business - will be sold shortly.
After debts, ITT expects that between Dollars 3bn and Dollars 3.5bn will be
raised from the sales of the four parts of ITT Financial. The money will be
used to finance acquisitions in the hotels, leisure and entertainment
industries, and while ITT would not comment on its next move, the company is
believed to be interested in acquiring a US broadcast television network.
Although ITT has made clear its ambitions in leisure and entertainment (it
already owns the Sheraton hotel chain, it is awaiting regulatory clearance
for its recent Dollars 1.1bn purchase of the Madison Square Garden sports
and entertainment group, and a week ago it agreed to pay Dollars 1.7bn for
the Caesars World gaming group) the company denied reports that ITT's
aggressive expansion meant it was preparing to divest its other two main
businesses, insurance and manufactured products.
Analysts, however, believe that ITT may be considering breaking up the three
main operations - hotels, leisure and entertainment (which has sales of
Dollars 6bn), insurance (Dollars 10.5bn sales), and manufacturing (Dollars
8bn sales) - and floating them on the stock market as separate companies.
Analysts believe the three units could be sold to the public for as much as
Dollars 15bn, or Dollars 130 a share. ITT would not comment on reports of a
planned break-up, but said that it was keeping its options open.
Yesterday, news of the various deals involving ITT Financial and speculation
about a break-up lifted ITT's share price to Dollars 88 1/8 up Dollars 4 3/8
at the close in New York.
The bigger of yesterday's two deals was the Dollars 3.1bn acquisition of ITT
Commercial Finance by Deutsche Bank North America, the US subsidiary of the
German banking group.
The acquisition, which is part of Deutsche Bank's programme of
internationalising its activities as well as diversifying its financial
services operations, 'will accelerate DBNA's strategy to become a leader in
the rapidly growing business of asset-based lending', said Mr John Rolls,
DBNA president and chief executive. After the deal is completed, DBNA's
portfolio of asset-based lending will be worth more than Dollars 5bn.
Through acquiring the ITT unit, Deutsche Bank believes it will also win
greater access to commercial finance markets in North America, Canada and
south-east Asia, 'regions which are becoming increasingly important
particularly for our strategy', according to the company.
Deutsche Bank has been expanding its banking and investment activities
outside Germany and Europe recently. Last October it moved the investment
side of its activities to London, while it has already established 40
subsidiaries in south-east Asia.
In the other deal, the Minnesota-based bank, Norwest, paid about Dollars
595m for Island Finance, ITT's Caribbean and Central American consumer
finance operations.
Island Finance's main business is making small loans to individuals in
Puerto Rico, Panama, and the Caribbean Islands.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Trygg turns to Zurich in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trygg-Hansa, the Swedish insurer, yesterday announced the virtual takeover
of its loss-making US associate Home Holdings by Switzerland's Zurich
Insurance group, tearing up an earlier refinancing agreement for Home struck
only three weeks ago with a group of US investors.
Zurich, one of Europe's top three insurance groups, will take over the
management of Home and will be able to renew all existing Home business.
Home will be de-listed from the New York Stock Exchange.
Moody's, the New York credit rating agency, responded to the news by saying
it might cut senior debt ratings of Trygg-Hansa and Home and also Home
intercompany pool's insurance financial strength rating. It had previously
said it may raise Home's ratings.
Trygg-Hansa and Zurich will meanwhile enter a strategic alliance giving
Trygg's industrial clients access to Zurich's international network in
insurance and risk management and giving Zurich's customers access to
Trygg's services in Scandinavia.
The deal replaced a Dollars 590m refinancing package arranged with Fund
American Enterprises Holdings, Trident Partnership and Hellman &amp; Friedman.
As the result of its 1991 investment in Home, Trygg holds a 64.5 per cent
stake in the US insurer.
Mr Lars Thunell, Trygg's chief executive, said the about-turn was possible
under an escape clause in the original deal - although Home will pay a
penalty to the US investor group of about Dollars 12m. Trygg said the new
agreement meant its total loss from the investment would fall to SKr4.5bn
(Dollars 601m) from SKr5bn and its required write-down would fall by a
similar margin to SKr2.3bn.
Zurich is to pay Dollars 100m-Dollars 150m as a commission for taking over
the renewal of Home business. It will lend Home Dollars 98m and put up
working capital of about Dollars 30m.
It will buy 800,000 Home shares from Trygg, now at Dollars 7.50 per share
and, over an eight-year period, a further 17.4m shares at about Dollars 8.50
per share, cutting Trygg's stake to 12 per cent. Home will repurchase about
9m outstanding shares (not held by Trygg or the other principal shareholder,
Centre Re) for Dollars 10 per share.
Home's Dollars 170m debt to Trygg will be restructured, with Zurich
initially paying Dollars 1m for Dollars 110m in junior debentures and Trygg
taking on Dollars 60m in junior debentures.
The repayment of the balance of Dollars 109m due to Trygg will be postponed
and based on an assessment of Home's loss reserves at the end of 1994.
The original deal involved a Dollars 420m injection into Home by the US
investors, the write-off by Trygg of its USDollars 170m loan to Home and the
option for the US group to buy 14.5m of Trygg's 22.5m shares in Home.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Gazprom looks for industry investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gazprom, the world's largest gas producer, and its merchant bank adviser,
Kleinwort Benson, have drawn up a list of 10 to 20 western industrial
companies expected to take stakes in the Russian company's planned share
offering in 1995.
Gazprom owns an estimated 24 per cent of world gas reserves and earned
Dollars 6bn-Dollars 7bn (Pounds 3.4bn-Pounds 4.5bn) in hard currency in
1993. Its managers see the offering of equity stakes to western companies as
a way of cementing existing or proposed relationships.
These core investors are expected to provide what the Russian gas company
described as 'a nugget of demand' for the 9 per cent tranche earmarked for
sale.
British Gas, currently negotiating with Gazprom over the latter's
participation in the development of the giant Karachaganak gas field in
Kazakhstan, said it had neither 'ruled in nor ruled out' participation in
the equity offering.
The non-committal stance is echoed by other gas companies, such as Enron of
the US, which has an agreement with Gazprom to use Russian gas for possible
power generation projects in Europe. Gazprom's existing joint ventures with
BASF in Russia and Germany makes the German chemical company another
candidate but Neste of Finland, another customer and partner, has said it
will not take a shareholding.
While customers of Gazprom, and integrated oil and gas groups, make up most
of the group of 10-20 core investors, it is believed that suppliers of
infrastructure like pipelines and compressors are also included.
Proposals for the equity sale also include a placement with investment funds
and other institutions, but it is thought the 'trade sale' to industrial
investors will predominate.
International bankers who have worked with Gazprom say they would view the
presence of sophisticated industrial investors on Gazprom's share register
as a 'very positive' development that would enhance its credit-worthiness.
An audit is under way to present Gazprom's finances in a western-style
format, but in the short to medium-term, industrial investors familiar with
the sector might be better placed to gauge the true state of its
performance.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Taiwan bank buys in California
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chinatrust Commercial Bank, controlled by Taiwan's Koo family, plans to buy
a Californian bank in a first step toward establishing a US banking network
targeting Asian, especially ethnic Chinese, communities.
Mr Jeffrey Koo, chairman, said the US government deliberated for four years
before approving the purchase of Trans National Bank, which has five
branches and total assets of Dollars 100m (Pounds 65m). The Dollars 30m deal
will be the first takeover of a US bank by a Taiwanese company.
The Koo family is one of Taiwan's wealthiest and most influential families,
and Chinatrust is the island's biggest privately owned bank. Mr C F Koo, the
patriarch and head of the family's diverse business interests, is a senior
figure in the Taiwan ruling Nationalist party.
The bank will be renamed China Trust Bank of California. The purchase is
part of Chinatrust's broader expansion strategy of serving Chinese
communities in Asia and elsewhere.
Chinatrust Commercial Bank posted net profits of TDollars 2.4bn (Pounds 59m)
on sales of TDollars 25bn for the first eleven months of 1994, against
TDollars 1.3bn on sales of TDollars 23bn in 1993.

Early gains in Mexican equities faded yesterday after the peso fell again
against the dollar. Other Latin American markets were also weak in early
trading. Foreign investors were seen selling the ADRs of Mexican-quoted
companies on Wall Street to buy the domestic shares, which now looked more
attractively priced.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Cautious Chinese look before they leap into year of change:
End of Deng era may bring 1995 turmoil, explains Tony Walker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It will be a leap year in China in 1995 and only the fourth time this
century that August has provided the leap month. It will also be a year of
the pig - the last of the 12 terrestrial symbols and among the least
auspicious.
Little wonder that the mood in China is a mixture of unease, inertia and
nervousness, or that China's leaders are enmeshed in a game of transitional
politics which is affecting domestic and foreign policy.
Sensitive to omens and portents, the Chinese are noting that each August
leap year this century brought cataclysm.
In 1900 the Boxer uprising ended in bloody reprisals by a foreign
expeditionary force. In 1957 the anti-rightist campaign preceded two decades
of disaster. 1976 produced the Tangshan earthquake in which as many as
250,000 perished. It was also the year in which Mao Zedong and his premier,
Zhou Enlai, died.
The deteriorating health of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, coupled with the
sense that the end of an era is fast approaching, appear to be weighing more
heavily on the leadership.
As the New Year beckons in wintry Beijing, China's leaders are engaged in
seemingly endless meetings, conferences and planning sessions. But in spite
of much talk about continued reform, the overwhelming impression at present
is not one of movement, but of inertia.
A western official put it succinctly: 'We're in limbo,' she said. 'We're in
stalemate.'
This lack of motion seems set to persist as Mr Deng's life ebbs away. How
long the process will take is anybody's guess, but the leader's condition -
he has Parkinson's disease - appears to have worsened since mid-year.
Nervousness about the future appears to be conditioning policy responses at
home and abroad, sharpening the leadership's reaction to challenges to its
authority - real or imagined.
Last week's sentencing of nine dissidents to jail terms of between three and
20 years is a case in point. These sentences are a sign, according to
western officials, not of self-confidence at the top but of leaders unsure
how they will keep order in the post-Deng era.
China's mystifying approach to the Gatt negotiations, in which it eschewed
what might have been regarded as reasonable compromise, left an impression
that a distracted leadership, weighed down by other preoccupations, was in
no mood to sanction the concessions required on market access and other
issues.
Lack of progress on Sino-US copyright negotiations is another example of
inertia. Pirating of laser and compact discs and computer software is rife
in China. US officials report that talks on intellectual property rights
violations have bogged down recently, with Beijing apparently unwilling to
concede that its policing efforts are ineffectual.
Domestic economic reform also appears to be faltering. Worries about
inflation are casting a long shadow and reinforcing a tendency towards
caution. Chinese officials talk endlessly about state enterprise reform, but
there appears to be a widening gap between words and deeds.
Among indications of uncertainty is the eclipse, for now, of Mr Zhu Rongji,
the reformist vice-premier. Mr Zhu has been less prominent since mid-year.
Western officials and Chinese observers interpret Mr Zhu's current reticence
as vulnerability. They believe that he is shoring up his defences for the
leadership struggle that lies ahead once Mr Deng dies. The executive
vice-premier is said to oppose strongly concessions required to advance the
Gatt negotiations.
Another indication of uncertainty in Beijing is the more nationalistic tone
apparent in recent public statements. Commentaries on the failed Gatt talks,
for example, were more an expression of outrage and wounded pride than an
analysis of reasons for failure.
'Our government has said it will not yield to pressure, however great; we
believe all Chinese people endorse our government's firm and just stand,'
said the China Daily yesterday.
The Gatt argument also risks sharpening Sino-US differences after a period
in which the two sides appeared to have achieved relative harmony in
managing their complex relationship. President Bill Clinton's decision last
May to 'de-link' human rights and the renewal of China's Most Favoured
Nation trading status have improved the atmosphere, but there are dangers
that things could regress.
Finally, lurking in the background are real concerns about the quality of
China's 'third generation' leadership, whose task it will be to assume Mr
Deng's 'blood-spattered mantle'.
Mr Jiang Zemin, the avuncular 68-year-old president of the republic, general
secretary of the Communist party and chairman of the Central Military
Commission, awaits his turn, but doubts persist about his ability to assert
authority in the difficult months after Mr Deng's death.

FT  28 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The crisis in Mexico has underlined the risks of investing in Latin America
as a whole. Most countries in the region remain dependent on foreign capital
to compensate for their current-account deficits. That makes their markets
peculiarly vulnerable to crises of investor confidence and for the
foreseeable future the region will be dependent on the international
markets.
The sell-off by foreign investors in Mexico was prompted not only by
attempts to avoid the peso's devaluation, but by their recognition of the
impact of the crisis on corporate earnings. Companies' financial charges are
likely to rise because of higher local interest rates. The increase in rates
could lead to an appreciable slowdown in already hesitant economic growth.
Worst of all, the peso's depreciation will significantly raise the cost of
companies' dollar-denominated debt. Some banks could find themselves in
serious difficulties.
The Mexican crisis depressed the currencies of other Latin American
countries without regard to their differing economic circumstances.
Argentina, certainly, is struggling with difficulties similar to those in
Mexico - a current-account deficit, political problems and an overvalued
peso. The Mexican crisis may strengthen the Argentine government's resolve
to support its currency, but that will be at the expense of higher interest
rates and slower growth.
Thus the Argentine market's 10 per cent fall in dollar terms last week may
have been justified. But by contrast the 13 per cent fall in Brazil was
bizarre. The country is running a current account surplus, its foreign
reserves are far larger than Mexico's and the value of the new currency has
only just been set. Chile's 5 per cent fall was also strange, given the
country's large domestic savings base and relatively stable economy.
In the longer term, the macroeconomic environment in Latin America remains
more attractive than for many years. Command economics has been abandoned
throughout the region, serious attempts are being made to control inflation
and the political environment has become more stable. Given the continent's
huge natural resources, the potential rewards remain considerable.
Long-term, investors cannot afford to avoid emerging markets, in Asia, Latin
America, or elsewhere - so long as the investment is made as part of a
properly balanced portfolio. Economic growth rates in developing countries
are set to outpace those of the developed world for the next two decades.
Corporate earnings will prove highly geared to this growth, political risks
notwithstanding.
Moreover, the liquidity argument may again work in emerging markets' favour.
The total invested in these markets is still small in absolute terms and it
would only take a modest adjustment in fund managers' asset allocation
models to give rise to further substantial flows into the developing
markets.
The next big buying opportunity is likely to come once investors become
convinced that US interest rates are nearing their cyclical peak.

Asian indices have plunged this year while economic growth in the region has
at worst maintained the high levels that investors have learned to expect.
This creates some interesting anomalies. In Thailand, for example, earnings
per share are likely to grow at close to 30 per cent this year whereas the
stock market has fallen 19 per cent.
There are other positive signs. In 1980, 76 per cent of Asia's exports were
shipped outside the region. Regional trade now accounts for over half of
exports and is rising rapidly. Given levels of growth throughout Asia,
economic success should feed upon itself. Secondly, US weightings in the
region remain low and, given limited currency risk in a number of Asian
markets (ie Thailand and Malaysia), exposure is expected to increase
steadily in the coming years.
One risk for the region is the large amount of capital-raising. India's
stock market is expected to absorb new issues amounting to around Dollars
11.5bn in the year to March. This represents close to 10 per cent of market
capitalisation and is one factor behind the 16 per cent fall in the Indian
market since it reached its peak in September. Capital-raising has similarly
held back Indonesian stocks.
The spectre of an overheating Chinese economy and an ailing political
figurehead, Deng Xiaoping, could hurt China's stock markets. Ripples would
follow through to an already vulnerable Hong Kong and Taiwan. But the
regional impact may not be great, and 1995 seems likely to be a year of
recovery.

FT  28 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Emerging risks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If last year demonstrated the rewards of investing in emerging markets, this
year has highlighted the risks. In 1993, emerging markets outperformed
developed markets by a factor of three - increasing by 64 per cent in US
dollar terms. This year they underperformed. They were down by 7 per cent in
the year to mid December and fell further last week as a result of the
plunge in the value of the Mexican peso and stock market.
The poor performance this year reflects not just political and economic
uncertainties; another issue has been the gradual tightening of US monetary
policy. High yields on US Treasuries, coupled with rising short-term
interest rates, have reduced the investment attractions of risky emerging
markets and have enhanced the relative appeal of risk-free cash.
Repatriation of funds out of emerging markets back to the US is a big factor
behind the 17 per cent fall in the IFC Asian emerging markets index after
four years of breathtaking gains. It did not, though, prevent some
spectacular gains in less interest-rate-sensitive south American markets
such as Brazil and Peru.
Total net foreign investment in emerging markets for this year is likely to
be about Dollars 25bn to Dollars 30bn, down from Dollars 38bn in 1993. The
figure will probably fall again this year if US short rates are raised as
aggressively as markets expect. The weight of money seeking a home in a
limited selection of 'investable' securities in the developing world has
been as much a factor in driving up share prices as the fundamental
attractions of earnings growth far higher than that available in the
developed world. The emerging markets will prove correspondingly vulnerable
to any large-scale reversal of investment flows.

FT  28 DEC 94 / MP calls for belt-tightening over Pounds 2.4m bill for top
brass' cooks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministry of Defence top brass were urged to tighten their belts yesterday
after the disclosure that more than 100 serving officers are entitled to
cooks' services at the public's expense.
The insight into the lifestyle enjoyed by Britain's senior officers comes
just ahead of the completion of an independent review of 'representational
entertainment' in the armed forces, including domestic assistance and
official residences.
The MoD said Sir Peter Cazalet, former chairman of the armed forces pay
review body, who is conducting the study, was due to report back in January
or February. It said the review - the first of its kind - would help
ministers see 'what we have got and whether we need it'. The cross-party
Commons defence committee is also making inquiries into the use of the 77
official service residences in Britain and abroad.
The disclosure on cooks came in a Commons written answer by Mr Nicholas
Soames, the armed forces minister and former food minister. Mr Soames listed
114 posts that are entitled to cooks at an estimated cost of Pounds 2.4m in
the present financial year.
Officers ranging from the First Sea Lord to the Captain of the Admiralty
Interview Board and the 'Commodore Minor War Vessels' are entitled to cooks.
The Navy is particularly well catered for: 65 officers are covered, compared
with 23 in the Army and 26 in the Royal Air Force.
Mr Stephen Byers, Labour MP for Wallsend, who tabled the question, called on
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, to consider 'as a matter of urgency
whether in the 1990s this historic entitlement is still appropriate'.
Mr Byers said the figures showed a misplaced sense of priorities within the
armed forces. 'At a time when public spending is under pressure and
squaddies serving in Bosnia are making do with reduced rations, senior
serving officers need to tighten their belts,' he said.
The government disclosed earlier this year that the latest valuation for
official service residences was approximately Pounds 34m. It said total
maintenance and furniture and equipment costs for the last two financial
years for all residences was about Pounds 5m, as was the annual cost for
domestic and household staff.

FT  28 DEC 94 / 'Are we losing our grip, sensei?': William Dawkins
eavesdrops on the fears of Japan's bureaucrats over the pace of economic and
political reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Snow is falling in the mountains north of Tokyo. Steam rises from a rock
pool of scalding water, fed by a volcanic spring. Two men are basking, up to
their necks, in one of Japan's most exclusive onsen, or therapeutic hot
baths.
The older of the pair is Takeshi, a retired yet fit-looking former
bureaucrat from the all-powerful Ministry of Finance. He now works as an
adviser to several of what used to be the world's largest banks.
Takeshi's banks are less large today than they were a year ago, the last
time he came to this onsen. Their assets have been diminished by bad-debt
write-offs and a declining domestic loan book. But he still has enough cash
and free time to develop one of the best golf handicaps in Tokyo.
His companion, Tokoro, an ambitious and overworked rising star in the
ministry, used to work for Takeshi in the old days. Since Tokoro cannot
afford to play golf on his meagre pay, they meet in hot water once a year to
chat about the ways of the world.
'Always a pleasure to hear how things are going with you, young man, but why
so tired?' asks Takeshi, pouring out two cups of sake, from a stone flask on
a floating pine tray.
'Sensei, I've been working overtime trying to engineer a nice gentle
economic recovery without rekindling inflation,' says Tokoro.
'It hasn't been made easy by the tendency of the three coalition governments
we have had over the past year to throw their weight around in a way that
plays havoc with my budget projections,' the young man complains, as he sips
his sake.
Takeshi nods his head. 'Yes, I too have wondered at times over the past 12
months whether the ministry is losing its grip.'
Tokoro continues: 'But despite the havoc caused by those warring
politicians, the economy did start to pick up, just as you said it would,
sensei. As you also warned, it is a weaker upturn than we are used to. We'll
be lucky to see gross domestic product rise by more than 1 per cent this
year. After that, we'll be seeing pretty slow growth rates, two or three
points below the 5 per cent a year we got used to in the roaring late 1980s.
'It has been hard work, but we in the ministry are moderately pleased. We
have come through the worst recession since the second world war with only a
small rise in unemployment, to 3 per cent, and without letting your banks
get into trouble. In the process, we have managed to sort out some urgent
matters, like putting through that long overdue rise in sales tax, so that
the state will have enough money to pay me a decent pension when I retire.'
The older man looks dubious. 'You are right to be cautious about the future.
But you are in danger of not being cautious enough. Of course, the recovery
will continue, and it would even strengthen a bit if you could stop worrying
too much about inflation and ask that new boss at the Bank of Japan, Mr
Yasuo Matsushita, to cut official interest rates. Yet we are, on the whole,
in poor shape to face the next downturn,' he says.
A sudden breeze whips handfuls of snow from the trees, and clears the steam,
giving Tokoro an uncomfortable sense of impermanence. Both men look up and
see storm clouds massing over the mountains. Tokoro looks pained. 'Aren't
you looking too far ahead?' he asks.
'You don't get a golf handicap as good as mine by being short-sighted,'
replies Takeshi. 'This is a reprieve, not a recovery. It is driven by an
unsustainable rise in export sales to the booming US economy and to our
fast-industrialising east Asian neighbours.'
Takeshi continues: 'Now the US, our biggest single market, will probably go
into its next downturn in 1996. The east Asian import boom will lag too,
because it is supported by a short-term shortage of capacity there. Come the
next downturn, our Asian competitors will have built up more capacity, to
produce higher volumes of goods at prices that we cannot beat.'
'So what?' says Tokoro. 'We have ridden through ups and downs in world
markets before. We can do the same again. Many of our exporters have risen
to the challenge posed by the rise of the yen. They are getting leaner,
especially in the car and electronics industries.'
The sensei smiles sadly at the young man's optimism. 'Sure, some sectors
have shed a bit of fat. But overall, restructuring has been only cosmetic.
The number of corporate employees is still higher than at the start of the
downturn. Capacity utilisation is barely more than 70 per cent, the lowest
for 18 years.'
The older man continues: 'The danger is that this upturn will reduce the
pressure on domestic industry to rid itself of surplus capacity. Companies
may get complacent again. That would not matter too much, if we could
somehow stoke up domestic demand before export growth falls away. But people
these days are willing to spend only if they can find a bargain, which for
the most part means imported electronics, clothes and food - not much help
to domestic producers, nor to Japan's economic growth.
'On the subject of spending, I noticed with distress that you arrived by
bus. Isn't it time to renew that old car you bought before the recession?'
'Wait a minute,' says young Tokoro. 'You don't do much to use up our
industrial overcapacity yourself, what with that imported BMW you picked up
cheaply because of the rise of the yen.'
Takeshi laughs. 'That's just the point. But I can buy a German car with a
reasonably clear conscience because I know that weak demand for Japanese
goods is only a symptom of the real problem: the maturing of the economy.
How can we increase the economy's capacity to grow, as our population ages
and as more of our basic industries relocate to lower-wage countries?'
'What about service industries?' says Tokoro. 'A surge in the service sector
has done wonders for the US economy. It might do the same for us. More
Japanese jobs are being created in services today than in manufacturing, for
the first time since the war.'
'You may be right there, in the long run,' says Takeshi. 'But the comparison
is flawed in the short run because our service industries are nothing like
as efficient as their US counterparts. Ours are chronically overmanned,
because of the service sector's traditional role in mopping up surplus
manufacturing jobs. Our services are also more sheltered from foreign
competition than their US counterparts.'
Tokoro interrupts: 'We can deal with that. I will ask those forward-looking
types at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to dream up a
policy to sharpen up the service sector. Path to enlightenment, we'll call
it.'
'That is dangerous talk,' replies the older man. 'There would have to be a
labour shake-out before our service sector can reach US productivity. Nobody
wants a sharp rise in unemployment. You chaps must go on ensuring that
deregulation happens slowly enough to keep yourselves in a job - and
incidentally avoid damaging our stable social structure.'
Tokoro replies: 'I agree. We have only just held the line on deregulation so
far. To be honest, sensei, I do partly agree with you about losing our grip.
The pressure for change is uncomfortable.'
The young man continues: 'For the first time, all the main political
parties, big business, the US and the European Union are simultaneously
begging for deregulation. Until now, we have been able to fend them off by
paying lip service to the idea and doing little.
'But there are worrying signs that economic deregulation has built up a
momentum of its own, independently of political pressure. Look at the
explosion in the number of new discount supermarkets and the rise in cheap
mobile telephone sales since we eased controls in those areas early in the
year. It all looks fine from the consumers' point of view, but it's more
than we expected. I worry that prices might collapse across the board,
taking the wind out of the recovery,' concludes Tokoro.
'Cheer up,' says the sensei. 'You are still one of the few finance
ministries in the world to control budget outlays and revenue, taxation,
monetary policy, the financial system, anti-trust policy and any industrial
policy that needs public money. You can't stop the clock like you used to,
but you can still control the pace.'
Tokoro asks: 'But can we really? Can we be sure that the new order will
learn to be as co-operative as the old? Ministers have even started asking
to be consulted about budget spending. Most irregular. What about this big
new opposition party that promises to drive the Liberal Democratic Party out
of power and change everything? What about the reform-minded younger
generation in the LDP itself? Won't that make things worse?' He looks upset.
'Don't worry too much about the politicians,' replies Takeshi. 'The old
order hasn't changed as much as it seems.'
Takeshi smiles in a way that Tokoro finds slightly sinister, and explains:
'The LDP reformists who left the fold and formed that new opposition party
are still conservatives at heart. New labels, but the people are the same.
The younger generation in the LDP has not won the battle yet. The old guard
has just begun to feel at a comfortable distance from the scandals that had
forced them into the shadows. Now they are back.'
Politely, the young man dissents. 'But for the first time, the LDP faces a
strong opposition. Its new enemies tasted power for nearly a year until June
and might win again. Their new party won't be in league with the bureaucracy
like the LDP was. Don't you remember how unpredictable it was working with
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition? It took all of six months to get him under
control.'
'Things have moved on since Hosokawa,' says Takeshi. 'Present and former
factions of the LDP have now found a way to keep themselves in power for
ever. They have split into two, taking it in turns to govern. They might
sometimes misbehave to keep the voters happy. But ultimately, they know that
they must work with, not against, you. The old order has fragmented, not
collapsed.'
Tokoro: 'So the economy will stay in safe hands then?'
Takeshi: 'You can bet your bottom yen it will.'
The pair clink sake cups and drink a toast, as storm clouds overhead burst.
They are hidden from sight by a blizzard.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Rocked by tremors but still reassured: Though reinsurers
claim risk is growing, cover for disasters is still available, says Ralph
Atkins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prophets of doom have new friends as the year ends. As brokers this week
hurry to complete January insurance policy renewals, there are warnings
about the risks being borne by the world's reinsurers - the companies that
sell protection against large-scale losses to insurance companies.
Last month, Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurer, announced that it was
prepared to reduce or terminate business connections where risks were
greater than were justified by premiums. It believes there is a trend
towards increasingly costly catastrophes. In 1993, there were 600 big
natural disasters worldwide generating overall losses of Dollars 50bn.
Rival reinsurer Swiss Re has published a provocative report warning that
changes in weather patterns could lead to even greater catastrophes. 'All
extreme weather catastrophes are basically the result of human systems
failing to adjust to 'possible' local weather patterns,' the report argues.
'Now this peril is being dramatically intensified.
'Human intervention in the natural climatic system could accelerate global
climatic change to such an extent that society might no longer be able to
adapt quickly enough.'
Swiss Re accepts that the impact of global warning on the climate is not
fully understood. But even if the number of catastrophes is not increasing,
the insured loss is rising, it says. A decade ago, for example, few living
in Taiwan or the Philippines would have taken out insurance policies. That
is now changing.
Some idea of the risks insurers face comes from Standard &amp; Poor's, the
rating agency. Its figures show that the world's 111 largest reinsurers
excluding Lloyd's of London had 'shareholders funds' (a measure of the
capital invested and surplus funds retained after taking account of
liabilities) totalling Dollars 36.7bn in 1992. That was the last year for
which figures are available.
That might appear a comfortable financial cushion. But the Los Angeles
earthquake in January, which is estimated to have caused Dollars 30bn of
damage, illustrates how it might disappear. Reinsurers escaped relatively
lightly on that occasion, because the insured losses from the 'Northridge'
earthquake were only about Dollars 10bn-Dollars 12bn, of which they would
have underwritten only a part.
A stronger earthquake closer to a main population centre could have resulted
in much higher costs - still more so if a greater proportion of properties
had been insured. Policy claims from one event of, say, Dollars 50bn might
force many insurers or reinsurers out of business.
It might be expected that such grim speculation would place constraints on
the amount of catastrophe cover available and lead to premiums rising
rapidly. This has not happened this year for two reasons.
First, in spite of the gloom spread by many reinsurers, the amount of
business they are able to underwrite has increased. This is due largely to
the flow of funds into new property/catastrophe reinsurance companies in
Bermuda. Attracted by the favourable tax and regulatory regime, investment
in the island's international insurers and reinsurers increased by Dollars
7bn last year, about half into nine new catastrophe reinsurance companies.
The second reason why catastrophe cover remains readily available at
reasonable prices is that the more cataclysmic projections of reinsurers
have not radically altered the way premiums are set.
'It is only people in universities who worry about global warming,' says one
reinsurance executive. 'When it comes to pricing, people look at what has
happened in the past and at market forces: when people want more cover,
perhaps after an incident, prices go up. As you get further away from a
loss, people's memories shorten.'
This produces a roller-coaster cycle of price rises and falls. In recent
years, for example, some reinsurance premiums have doubled or tripled as
companies have sought to make up for poor underwriting results earlier in
the decade. This year there have been relatively few natural catastrophes,
so there is little pressure to raise rates. With the added capacity in
Bermuda, reinsurance brokers say that premium cuts in excess of 10 per cent
are possible.
Some insurance specialists even say the pessimism of European reinsurance
companies in particular has been deliberately overdone to encourage higher
prices.
There is, however, a longer-term trend towards greater precision in risk
assessment on the part of reinsurers. One sign is the increasing use of
meteorologists, geologists and computer software to pinpoint and quantify
risks. 'Five years ago many insurance companies were unable accurately to
assess their exposure from a catastrophe event. Now they are much more
careful about the risks they are carrying,' says Mr John Pelly, chairman of
non-marine reinsurance at broker Willis Faber &amp; Dumas.
Another significant trend has been a change in the type of policies
reinsurance companies provide. Previously, reinsurers issued 'proportional'
policies, in which they underwrote an agreed percentage of the risk borne by
the insurance company without any limits on total claims. Now they prefer to
provide 'non-proportional' policies, in which they agree to underwrite an
agreed chunk of the risk borne by the direct insurer. These policies have
minimum levels for claims, below which the reinsurer pays nothing, and upper
limits that cap the reinsurers' total exposure.
The effect of this change - and the increased focus on rigorous scientific
analysis - has been to increase the control reinsurers exercise over their
risks. One result is that insurance policyholders may have to bear a greater
share of the risk, paying the first part of any claim or taking
responsibility for the top slice. Another is that premiums paid by companies
and individuals will rise still higher on the worst risks.
Insurers, however, find it difficult to convince consumers that it matters
to them whether reinsurance companies are financially safe. Mr Felix Kloman,
editor of the US publication, Risk Management Reports, says: 'The insurance
industry is held in very low esteem in the minds of the public . . . The
security of the insurer or reinsurer has got to be right up the (priority)
list.'
The evidence of the current renewal season suggests that this is not yet
happening. Buyers of catastrophe reinsurance can still beat prices down. To
keep upward pressure on premiums, reinsurers may have to rely largely on
apocalyptic warnings. That is, until the next large-scale disaster strikes.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Thorp revisited
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by Hamburg's nuclear power utility to cancel some of its fuel
reprocessing contracts at the UK's Thorp plant in Cumbria is an ominous sign
for British Nuclear Fuels, Thorp's owner.
The cancellation adds to scepticism about the long-term profitability of
Thorp, which received its licence to operate a year ago after a bitterly
contested battle between BNF and environmentalists. It may also represent
the beginning of a change in governments' approach to nuclear waste
disposal.
Hamburg's action does not at first sight appear very significant. The
utility has cancelled contracts for reprocessing waste from 2004 to 2014 and
has paid undisclosed compensation. This follows a change in German law this
year, which allows 'direct disposal' of nuclear waste underground. BNF says
the contract represents just 1 per cent of its total orders, and 4 per cent
of orders beyond 2004, and that the cancellation makes no difference to the
economic case for Thorp. This was based entirely on the first decade's
business. However, the move shows that the arguments for reprocessing
nuclear waste may be losing their force.
Reprocessing separates out reusable uranium and plutonium from used fuel
rods, leaving a smaller amount of true waste. But it is more expensive than
direct disposal, many claim. Moreover, the uranium shortages foreseen when
Thorp was conceived a decade ago have not materialised, while international
concern has grown about the proliferation of plutonium-based weapons
capability. So other customers may follow Hamburg's lead, if they can find
direct disposal sites at home.
Hamburg's action also implicitly raises a taboo question: whether the most
valuable service Thorp offers is storage rather than reprocessing. BNF's
customers have already delivered many of the fuel rods for the next decade's
reprocessing to Cumbria, where they sit in cooling ponds. The customers are
obliged by their contracts to take back the products of reprocessing, but
that may not be for many years.
For governments which do not have a policy for permanent disposal, BNF is,
in effect, performing a political favour: while removing their waste, it
also shifts difficult decisions about final disposal on to future
governments.
The UK government would not wish to portray BNF's Sellafield site as a
long-term store for foreign nuclear waste. But that would be no more than an
acknowledgement of an important part of Thorp's role, which was hardly
emphasised during the two public consultations on its licence. Such an
admission would also allow the UK to ask itself whether it was charging
enough for that service, given the political difficulty many countries face
in finding permanent disposal sites. The value placed on reprocessing may
have fallen, but the value of storage is rising.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Toys were us
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The scene is familiar. Breathlessly they line up and shyly pass on folded
scraps of paper with their secret wishes for the coming season. Children
queuing for the Christmas grotto, or voters entering the polling booth? In
truth, they have something in common. They share a sense of wishful
anticipation, of belief that their desires will be satisfied. But once the
ritual is done, awe passes too. All too often, disappointment follows as the
outcome falls short of expectations.
As disappointed children punish their toys, so do voters their politicians.
The victims are all around: John Major, plumbing new depths in the opinion
polls; Bill Clinton, still reeling from the Republican landslide; Boris
Yeltsin, manoeuvring ineptly for advantage in Moscow; Silvio Berlusconi, now
the helpless plaything of Italian politics, not its saviour. At the sixth
Christmas since the fall of the Berlin Wall, leaders in industrialised and
former communist countries have discovered how rapidly the fashions of
politics can turn against them. Their product life-cycles, like those of the
trinkets dispensed by Santa Claus, modern toys, have become ever shorter.
In most of eastern and central Europe, former communists have regained a
place in power; not only in Italy, but also in Japan and Canada, the ground
has caved in under governing parties during the past 15 months. The last
great survivor of European politics is Helmut Kohl, who four years ago
promised east German voters that Christmas would come every day. It is no
coincidence that he rules the European nation most enduringly attached to
traditional fairy-tales.
The extension of democracy increases the risk that it will be over-burdened
with unrealisable expectations. Too little belief in the capacity and
legitimacy of elected leaders can produce authoritarianism or anarchy; too
much leads inevitably to disillusionment and cynicism.
Voters should be like wise children: thoughtful, and slow to succumb to the
blandishments of the flickering image, the unsubstantiated promise, and the
free gift. Instead they persist in over-burdening their politicians with
contradictory demands that even a sorceror could not reconcile, while
politicians hope that the length of the electorate's memory will be
inversely proportional to the list of problems they have been put into power
to solve.
A new compact between governments and the governed is needed, not for
perfect truth and perfect democracy - for neither exists - but for better
balance between the two. Politicians must cut the wrapping and improve the
content of their packages. They must inform and, at times, indulge, the
voters without pandering to gullibility or greed; and they must admit their
mistakes.
The voters should show more consistency, and greater rigour. They should
foresake the cycle of extremes under which suspension of disbelief on
polling day gives way, on the morrow, to disenchantment. The child's
Christmastide, wide-eyed and tantrum-torn, must not become their daily lot.
We voters need a healthy mix of sceptical hope and hopeful scepticism all
through the year.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Leading Article: France and Islam
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On the technical level, the denouement of the Algerian hijack drama is an
undoubted success for France, which should be a source of relief and
pleasure to anyone who is likely to travel to France or use French airlines,
whether for business or pleasure.
The capacity to protect its citizens against terrorism is a necessary
attribute of any modern state. The French state, faced with a severe test of
that capacity, has passed it with flying colours.
No such encouraging conclusion can be drawn for Algeria. The fact that this
hijacking could happen at all, in what must be one of the most heavily
guarded airports in the world, is one more indication of Algeria's deep
political and social crisis.
It is clear that Islamic extremist groups have members and sympathisers
among airport employees, as they do in other public services such as
education and the post office. Algeria is in the grip of a particularly
vicious civil war.
According to 'well-informed sources in Paris and Algiers', quoted by the
leading French newspaper Le Monde, the average death toll in the violence is
now running at 800 per week, with 'peaks' as high as 1,000 in the worst
weeks of all.
France's anti-terrorist strategy is impressive; its Algerian policy much
less so. Officially France is neutral in the Algerian conflict. Its
spokesmen minimise, sometimes even deny, the military aid France is giving
to the Algerian government. Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, warns
the government that it must not rely solely on a policy of repression.
Yet at the same time the French Interior minister, Charles Pasqua, not only
cracks down heavy-handedly on suspected Islamic militants in France, but
denounces third countries which seek to promote dialogue by giving a
platform to moderate spokesmen of the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) -
the party that would have come to power in Algeria through the ballot box
but for the coup of January 1992.
There can be no hope of ending the violence unless, as in South Africa, some
common ground is established between moderates on both sides. Nor can it be
in the French or European interest to represent this conflict as a clash of
civilisations or war of religion, which would inevitably rage on European as
well as North African soil. Yet that is what Mr Pasqua's policies, and those
of his colleague at Education, Francois Bayrou, such as expulsion from state
schools of Moslem girls who insist on wearing headscarves, are tending to
do.
The EU now has several million Moslem citizens. It needs to earn their
loyalty by showing respect for their faith.

FT  28 DEC 94 / The prince as candidate: The heir to the British throne has
come to resemble a politician running for office, argues Andrew Adonis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prince Charles is running for office as surely as any politician fighting an
election campaign. That is the inescapable conclusion to be drawn from his
actions in 1994 - yet another turbulent year for Britain's royal family.
The British public and media have been slow to recognise Charles Windsor,
embattled candidate for the throne of the United Kingdom and a collection of
other realms and territories including Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
Understandably, they have assumed that Charles will ascend the throne as a
matter of course, unless he chooses to relinquish his birthright in favour
of his eldest son, William - a theme of intermittent tabloid speculation but
little more.
It is now clear that Charles does not see things so simply. His motives for
embarking on a campaign for office can only be speculated upon: insecurity
about his public standing, fear for the long-term damage done by his
separation from Diana, and concern about the steadily declining reputation
of the royal family are the obvious factors.
Whatever the prince's precise motives, the evidence of a
carefully-orchestrated campaign is unambiguous.
The planning stage appears to have been the months immediately preceding the
separation in December 1992. In the summer of 1992 the prince agreed to
allow Mr Jonathan Dimbleby, a senior BBC journalist with impeccable
Establishment credentials, to write an authorised biography.
The arrangement was astonishing for a public figure in mid-career. The
prince gave Mr Dimbleby lengthy, intimate interviews, had him 'shadow' his
private and social engagements, and arranged for friends and some relatives
to be interviewed discreetly. Mr Dimbleby was given unprecedented access to
the prince's private and official papers, including ministerial
correspondence. There was a formal agreement to allow the prince to read the
manuscript and comment on 'inaccuracies'.
The prince's agreement with Mr Dimbleby amounted, in effect, to the
preparation of a manifesto for office. Far from disguising the fact the
author parades it.
In the preface to The Prince of Wales, published last month, he stresses his
growing intimacy with Charles and his efforts to 'accommodate' the prince's
sensitivities. 'I have learnt too much about my subject to be either
indifferent or dispassionate,' he writes, adding the hope that readers 'will
emerge at the other end feeling that they have come to know the heir to the
throne as they never could before - and that he is well worth knowing.'
Like an election manifesto, the book is partly a defence of the prince's
record to date and partly a prospectus for office. The 'defence' recites the
prince's public works, and offers apologias for his shortcomings in which
everything from bullying at school to unsatisfactory relationships with his
father and Mrs Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher are prayed in aid. The
prospectus includes a plea for the maintenance of the royal yacht and a
proposal to broaden his future spiritual role beyond the Church of England
(as 'Defender of Faith').
The book has gone hand in hand with a media offensive. In October of last
year, St James's Palace told the FT that the prince was available to be
'shadowed' on a week-long trip to the Middle East. The prince regards the
promotion of British business as an important part of his role, and the FT
was the ideal outlet for his views on the subject. It led to a full-length
profile - which dominated the media - entitled: 'A prince captured: The heir
to the British throne believes he could be used more effectively in
promoting UK plc.'
The FT article was a prelude to the main event: a three-hour television
documentary in June presented by Mr Dimbleby. In campaign terms, this was
equivalent to the party political broadcast, although unusual in attracting
13m viewers. The manifesto was broadcast to the backdrop of appropriate
action shots; and the prince, no doubt advised that it is now fashionable
for candidates to come clean about peccadillos, adopted a suitably pained
expression to confess adultery.
As the first year of the campaign draws to a close, it is time to take
stock. Is the prince a novel royal entrepreneur? And novel or not, is he
wise to be alarmed about his succession prospects?
There is nothing novel in the prince's endeavours. Every century or so since
the Norman Conquest serious efforts have been made to repackage the
monarchy. Some, such as Elizabeth I's bid to become 'Faerie Queene', were
resoundingly successful; others, notably attempts by Edward II, Richard II,
James II, and Charles I to seize power from established elites, were less
so.
The most successful of recent royal redesigns was the creation of the
modern, constitutional and ceremonial monarchy under Queen Victoria in the
mid-19th century. Dubbed by historians the 'invention of tradition', it was
a brilliant ploy to renovate medieval royal pageantry and represent what
were previously the symbols of office as its substance. Disraeli's
proclamation of Victoria as 'Empress of India' was the final triumph,
presenting the monarchy as the emblem of imperial unity.
The monarchy has remained largely stuck in this Victorian groove. Some
changes have been necessary: the Empress of India has become head of the
Commonwealth. But the hallmark of the current reign has been the dedication
of the Queen and her advisers to the Victorian legacy. Indeed, Elizabeth II
does it better than Victoria herself: the aged widow performed few public
duties, rarely even opening parliament in person.
No one with historical sense can doubt that the monarchy will need to be
'reinvented' in the next reign if it is to survive. But, in considering
whether the prince is right to be alarmed, the peculiar feature of his
manifesto is its failure to address two of the institution's greatest
weaknesses: its lack of a European role, and social changes that are making
the public ever less enamoured of royal flummery.
While the monarchy had excellent European credentials until the early part
of this century, with Victoria related to all the Continent's leading
rulers, today's monarchy has barely any European dimension.
The threat to the monarchy is insidious, not immediate. It comes from the
increasing irrelevance of its role, and from steadily eroding popular
respect and support. Should the erosion continue, politicians are bound to
start dabbling in republicanism. A tell-tale sign was the call earlier this
month by Mr Jack Straw, Labour's new home affairs spokesman, for a smaller,
Scandinavian-style, monarchy.
More ominous, perhaps, is the growing republican tide in the former
dominions. Australia looks increasingly set to hold a referendum on the
future of the monarchy at the end of the Queen's reign or perhaps sooner.
New Zealand may follow suit, to judge by the surprise declaration by its
prime minister last March in favour of such a move.
Such referendums are bound to attract notice and stir a debate in the UK. It
is not inconceivable that they would prompt calls for a vote at home too.
Another straw in the wind is the growing political popularity of referendums
on important constitutional issues. If such a vote is held on a single
European currency, for example, the chances of a referendum on the future of
the monarchy could be increased dramatically.
Even if all this were to come to pass, the prospect of the prince losing his
election must be small. However unpopular the royals, the difficulty of
devising arrangements for an alternative head of state, which is currently
dogging Australia's republicans, would powerfully reinforce the status quo.
Yet Candidate Charles might care to ponder the proverb that, in politics,
the expected never happens.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: A basis for Turkey's membership of EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL PAPADOPOULOS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Turkey has again been refused admittance to the European Union. You are
right in your implication that it is in the long-term interest of western
Europe (and the Turkish people) that Turkey becomes a stable state and
remains pro-western ('Turkish tangle', December 21). However, even were
issues such as Cyprus, Kurdistan's right to exist, and general violation of
human rights within the Turkish Republic settled, Turkey would, probably,
find western European statesmen would discover other obstacles to her
integration within Europe.
You are right, Greece has made itself the scapegoat for keeping Turkey out
in the cold. Nevertheless, much as it is in Greece's long-term interests to
reach a permanent friendly accord with Turkey, Athens cannot cease to
support the integrity of the Republic of Cyprus which was violated in 1974.
Indeed, Greece has a moral obligation to insist on the ending of Turkey's
military occupation of the island as it was a Greek junta which provided the
excuse for the invasion.
It should not be forgotten that, under the Zurich agreement, the basis of
Cypriot independence from British rule in 1960, Greece, Turkey and Great
Britain were the guarantors of the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus
and, as regards the Turkish military occupation since July 1974, several UN
resolutions have not been satisfied. Morally, the EU (and FT editors) should
support Greece's insistence on a Cyprus settlement as a precondition of
Turkish entry, and not shrug the issue off as an example of (oh dearie me])
Greek intransigence.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Fibre optic bridge: A tiny Irish village has a role in US
health care, says John Murray-Brown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY-BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Cigna? What's that, a horse?' It was the sort of conversation you might
expect in an Irish pub as Saturday night slipped into Sunday morning. In Pat
Barret's, one of Loughrea's favourite hostelries, surprisingly few people
seem to know about the American healthcare company installed among the dry
stone walls next to the Gaelic Athletic Association.
Like the Burt Lancaster character in Local Hero, who descends on a remote
Scottish village with big business plans, Cigna is something of a mystery to
many of the 3,500 inhabitants of this west of Ireland town close to the sea.
'The only thing I know is that my wife plays bridge in a group called the
Cigna pairs,' says Joe, as he passes round a plate of crab claws.
Bertie Donoghue, local correspondent for the Connaught Tribune, who for 54
years has in his own words 'chronicled the passing parade', says: 'It comes
over by satellite every day, some kind of hospital accounts I think, and
they send them back mostly by computer . . . Gives a lot of young ladies a
lot of hope.'
Cigna is, in fact, one of several US companies that have set up back offices
in the heart of the Irish countryside, reducing their wage bills thanks to
advances in telecommunications.
The office handles around 5,000 medical claims a day, equivalent to 20 per
cent of Cigna's business. The paperwork - from doctors, patients and
corporate clients across the US - is flown to Shannon from New York's John F
Kennedy airport, collected by courier and driven to Loughrea. It is then
entered into the computer, and transmitted through two dedicated optic fibre
cables back to Cigna's headquarters in Delaware, where, because of the time
difference, it arrives in time for the following day's business.
Catherine Hynes, the office manager, believes that one of the reasons the
operation is so little understood locally is that it is an office, rather
than a factory.
'Five years ago there was nothing. All of a sudden this American company
arrives. There was some anxiety over whether it was going to take off.
Ireland has had some manufacturing. But the office environment is
different,' she says. 'There is also still a myth out here that office work
is more suited to women.'
But Cigna is now Loughrea's largest employer, with a staff of 88, and office
skills have come to the fore.
Michael Bond, headmaster of St Brigid's vocational school, one of two
schools in Loughrea, admits to knowing nothing about computers himself, but
St Brigid's has been offering evening classes on information technology and
secretarial skills for some years.
'I am a geography teacher and I know how much a service industry can do. I
welcome it,' Mr Bond says. 'Our history is that we always went away for
work. Now parents want to see their children stay.'
Others are more sceptical about the gains from operations based on
telecommunications. The average starting salary at the Cigna office is
IPounds 7,000 (Pounds 7,000). 'They are in a buyer's market: there are
300,000 out of work in Ireland,' says Maurice Sweeney the local travel
agent, and head of Loughrea's fishing club. Any company that relocates its
back office is doing so to keep wage costs down and will be willing to go
anywhere, he says. 'They can hire and fire at their leisure.'
Loughrea certainly has cause to be wary of the longevity of foreign
investments. Courtaulds, the UK textile group, was producing locally in the
1950s. Hohner, the mouth organ manufacturer, also had an operation nearby.
Both have long since closed down. There were even rumours of cuts at the
Cigna office, when US President Bill Clinton was applying pressure to get
his health bill past Congress, but, by all accounts, Ms Hynes fought
Loughrea's corner.
'We would prefer if it was an indigenous company but, if it gives
employment, it gives employment. The Americans make them work hard, no
doubt,' says Rodney Donnellan, newsagent and local town commissioner.
In Loughrea, there are some 800 people collecting benefit, and Ireland has
the second highest unemployment rate in the European Union. Young people
have traditionally moved away in search of work. But opportunities are
scarce these days. There are fewer jobs available in the UK, and it is
becoming increasingly tough to get work visas in the US, except under the
so-called Morrison scheme, a lottery which provides a few hundred visas
every year. 'It is easier to win the pools,' says Richard Reilly, father of
four and a local painter and decorator.
Many locals used to work in Dublin during the week, coming home only at the
weekends. 'It used to be so sad to see all the young people lined up on a
Monday morning taking the bus to Dublin,' says Mr Michael Chambers, manager
of the local branch of Allied Irish Bank. But 'Cigna is changing all that,'
he says
The Cigna jobs do seem to have made a difference. Home rents have gone up.
Declan Keary, the local auctioneer, says: 'We always used to have a few
properties on our books, now we have none.'
At the Skillet, one of Loughrea's 33 pubs, Willy Burke has converted his top
floor into new apartments. The town council is considering reopening the
local cinema, an old linen hall donated to the town by Lord Lascelles in
British times. A new lease of life at the Temperance Hall, a former cavalry
barracks, has brought performances which this year included Zorba the Greek
by the Loughrea Choral and Dramatic Society. The community appears to be
thriving.
Mr Terry Doyle, manager of the town's other bank, the Bank of Ireland, says
of the Cigna operation: 'In the early days I suppose the type of employment
wasn't the best - the wage structure, for example. But it's a better place
today. If we got another one it would be grand.'
'I've come back,' he says, 'and thank God I've come back and please God I'll
stay.'

FT  28 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Traffic study not defective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr DENVIL COOMBE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I write as an author of the report by the standing advisory committee
on trunk road assessment (Sactra) on induced traffic, as a consultant who
assisted the department of transport with the development of its motorway
tolling policy, and as a member of the consultancy team researching
congestion charging in London. Your editorial on December 21, 'Sanity on the
roads', was admirable in many respects, but contained some
misunderstandings.
First, not all road schemes will induce significant amounts of extra
traffic. Our report defined the circumstances where induced traffic is most
likely to occur: essentially, where congestion is high, where traffic demand
is sensitive to changes in travel costs, and where the proposed scheme would
result in a large reduction in travel costs. Individual schemes in rural
areas may not induce much extra traffic. It is, therefore, incorrect to say
that all road schemes should induce extra traffic. Some do, some do not.
Second, the committee was asked by the government to advise on induced
traffic, and this it has done. It is surely unfair to claim the report is
defective because it does not fit the debate you wish to stimulate.
Third, however laudable your argument may be that motorists should pay a
true economic cost for their use of the road system, this is not the
philosophy underlying the government's motorway tolling policy. This policy
is designed to raise funds for the direct use of the department of transport
for promoting further road improvements. The intention is to pitch the tolls
at levels which will keep the traffic diversions away from the motorways
onto less safe, more congested and more environmentally sensitive local
roads to acceptably low levels.
Notwithstanding this, I applaud your effort to stimulate an intelligent
debate about transport policy.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to your editorial, 'Germany's EU balancing act' (December 16),
which said that 'last spring France and Germany announced plans to
co-ordinate their consecutive presidencies of the European Union, joined a
few months later by Spain'.
On behalf of my government, I would like to state that what was agreed last
spring - that is, before the start of Germany's EU presidency - was an
exercise of co-ordination among the consecutive presidencies of four
countries - Germany, France, Spain and Italy - in view of the 1996
inter-governmental conference, which will be inaugurated under Italy's EU
presidency.
All along, Italy - which the editorial oddly fails to mention - has
participated in the above-mentioned exercise, whose first two meetings took
place in Bonn on July 2 and November 2. The exercise is supposed to continue
until the end of the IGC.

Sir, Joe Rogaly ('Down with the lottery]', December 17/18) says the national
lottery 'will provide no benefit to anyone save perhaps the shareholders of
Camelot'.
May I suggest that the scheme acts as a welcome redistribution of available
funds from the leading national fund consumers to much needed micro-projects
in many communities and thus has a positive impact on the lives of countless
people.

Sir, I am sure Bob Beckman ('In the Pink: Batten down for a bear beware',
December 10) would wish no help from me, but Mr H L Benjamin's letter
(December 20) requires a response.
'Well-reasoned articles' deserve argued replies, not insults. Mr Benjamin
has conveniently forgotten that Beckman forecast the 1987 crash before it
happened (unlike most experts) and was publicly pilloried for forecasting
the collapse of the housing market when it was at the height of its boom.
These were correct forecasts of the two most important events in recent
financial history - ask those with negative equity]

Sir, Nick Gillies does the legal profession a great disservice with regard
to the generosity of solicitors in the area of biscuits ('City thefts take
the biscuit', December 20, and Letters, December 23), as this act of
hospitality can yield unexpectedly profitable results for clients and staff
alike.
Clifford Chance who, according to Gillies, restrict the issue of chocolate
biscuits to two per head, provide Jacobs Club biscuits in their selection.
Inside the wrapper is a scratch game which requires one to scratch, with a
silver coin, three squares; and, if the numbers revealed match, the player
wins a cash prize. I was very pleased during a recent meeting to select
three matching squares and win Pounds 100. Unable to contain my surprise, I
expressed joy at this good fortune, whereupon there was an unsightly
scramble for the remaining biscuits.
There can be few occasions when a client leaves a lawyer's office with money
in his pocket and I would urge an early visit to 200 Aldersgate Street
before the senior partners institute a charge for opening the lucky wrapper.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Arts: The good, the bad and the positively eccentric -
Christopher Dunkley looks back at television programmes over the last 12
months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY

<TEXT>
In 1994 television brought us the BBC's excellent adaptation of Middlemarch
but also The National Lottery Live. People groaned at the mindlessness of
the game-show-from-hell, Don't Forget Your Toothbrush, and stayed silent,
mostly, about the excellence of Watergate, which finally revealed the
astounding details of the most bizarre affair in modern American politics.
Phil Agland, previously known for the unforgettable Baka, People Of The Rain
Forest, went to China and made a superb series called Beyond The Clouds,
about everyday events in a country town, which proved that some aspects of
life (the generation gap) are universal, while others (attitudes towards
medicine) vary dramatically between countries. Little was said about it. In
other words, television was, as ever, providing the good and the bad and, as
ever, being noisily attacked for the bad and rarely praised for the good.
Perhaps it is just human nature. For some reason, when you sit down at the
year's end to prepare any sort of audit, it is the disappointments which
spring to mind. Who can forget, for instance, the cascade of lamentable
comedies throughout the year, with far too many contributed by BBC1:
Nelson's Column, set in a newspaper office; Honey For Tea in which the
previously indefectible Felicity Kendal came a cropper, playing an American
matron in a Cambridge college; and Nice Day At The Office which was so
dreadful that you had to watch several episodes to make sure that there was
not something subtle going on which you had missed. There was not.
Of course BBC1 was not alone. BBC2 piloted a comedy called The High Life
about the squabbling members of an insufferable cabin crew on a Scottish
airline. Seeing how appalling it was, someone has commissioned six more
episodes to start in the new year. ITV had fewer comedy failures, largely
because they had fewer tries, but Mother's Ruin, set in an alternative
health shop, with Dora Bryan playing the tippling mother of a middle aged
son (Roy Barraclough, fresh out of Coronation Street) was so old fashioned
that it was sometimes unintentionally funny. You could hardly blame ITV's
House Of Windsor for damaging the reputation of the royal family, given the
greater damage done throughout the year by the members of the family
themselves - not least via ill-advised television programmes - but this was
not the most sophisticated comedy ever seen on television.
Comedy was not a complete disaster area, but several of the year's best
series turned out to be remarkably old. With a bit of editing to bring the
shows down to 40 minutes, the BBC proved in Morecambe And Wise: Bring Me
Sunshine that those who suspected the old hoofers would outshine any of
their successors were absolutely right. And The Lost Steptoes similarly
confirmed that there is nobody writing television comedy in Britain today
who even aspires to creating the sort of complexity or subtlety of
relationship which Galton and Simpson achieved via Wilfred Brambell and
Harry H. Corbett.
The best of the 1994 comedies were The Day Today which fed off the crassness
of television itself, and Rory Bremner - Who Else?, a show which gets more
topical and more sinewy with each series.
There were plenty of other let downs. Channel 4 had the praiseworthy idea of
commissioning three new 'operas' for television which, in the event, looked
as though they set out deliberately to confirm all the worst expectations of
opera-phobes, being pretentious, unmelodious and silly. The first major
piece of drama actually produced by Sky 1 rather than being bought
secondhand, Red Eagle, was a run-of-the-mill thriller with poor direction
and (consequently, perhaps) poor acting.
Horizon, one of the most consistently admirable series, celebrated its 30th
birthday with the most daft and incomprehensible edition I have ever seen.
Between The Lines slithered from first to third rate when it bafflingly
abandoned the setting of an internal police investigation division and
became just another crime series.
However, looking back through a year's notebooks it is fascinating to find
how much good material has failed to spring to mind. Take drama series, the
category used by ITV to sustain the centre of its evening ratings. Most of
their series about doctors, policemen and so on, were pretty ho-hum, but the
nine o'clock ITV slot also contained Sharpe, with Sean Bean swashing his
buckle through the Peninsular War; Finney in which David Morrissey played
the reluctant gangster who just wants to be left alone to strum his double
bass; and, best of all, another excellent run - the best yet - of Cracker,
with Robbie Coltrane playing the psychologist-detective. Politically correct
rights-ists attacked it for being anti-black, anti-woman and anti-soccer,
but the people at Granada stuck to their guns, knowing that they were
protected by the quality of the drama and by the fact that you only had to
wait to find that it was, on balance, pro-black, pro-woman and pro-soccer.
In the same category the BBC offered us Richard Griffiths - larger even than
Coltrane - as the would-be retired detective who only wanted to be left
alone to run his terribly English restaurant in Pie In The Sky; a medical
series called Cardiac Arrest which was said to be an insult to the medical
profession, but which seemed, to some of us who have worked in hospitals, to
be only too horribly accurate; and the all-human-life-is-there saga of the
dustmen - whoops, refuse operatives - Common As Muck. Most undervalued and
least noticed was probably Takin' Over The Asylum, an autumn series on BBC2
which managed to move beyond television's previous stereotypes.
Good documentaries were thin on the ground, though Secret History offered an
interesting revisionist version of the dam busters' raid, and Edward
Mirzoeff brought us an eye-opening account of Britain's ice dance champions,
Torvill And Dean: Facing The Music, which revealed that Mr Dean ran the
partnership with a rod of sarcasm. It was the attempt by Torvill and Dean to
win another Olympic gold medal which produced not only the highest rating
for an unrepeated programme in 1994, but the highest in a decade: they
attracted 23.95m viewers. The National Lottery Live which we were assured
beforehand would achieve huge figures actually managed 20.2m in the first
week, 18.5m in the second, and by week three had slipped to fifth place in
the national Top 10 with 15.7m.
The two strongest documentary series were both on BBC2: White Heat which
looked at the development of technology and the way we have reacted to it;
and The Fall Of The Wall which investigated the detail of the events leading
up to the fall of the Berlin wall and proved, yet again, just how compelling
detail can be. BBC2 also had a powerful showing in current affairs series.
Heretic introduced us to scientists whose ideas did not win the approval of
their peers, a failure as damaging in science as in religion. The Trial took
British television cameras inside British - actually Scottish - courts for
the first time. And Midnight Hour provided a forum for the discussion of the
day's politics.
We saw the last of Minder and That's Life], but Esther Rantzen was pretty
soon back on screen with a daytime studio agony show - called Esther, of
course - which is already better than the odious Kilroy-Silk thing (what
isn't). It and Ms Rantzen have some way to go before it begins to challenge
the American originals such as Donahue.
The year brought a Commonwealth Games and a football World Cup to keep the
sports departments, if not British fans, happy. And Question Time dispensed
with the services of Peter Sissons, took on David Dimbleby, and dished out
'Yes, No, Don't Know' keypads to the audience. None of which made any
difference. This was also the year when television almost ceased to transmit
bright, cheery programmes about Aids in which dim personalities claim 'We're
all equally at risk now'.
The best arts programme of the year was the poignant and moving interview in
Without Walls between Melvyn Bragg and the most important British dramatist
(not merely 'television dramatist') of our generation, Dennis Potter. He
was, he told us, dying of cancer, and he swigged morphine from a flask with
a bravura that made you want to cheer and weep. Weeks later he was gone,
having raced death in his final months to leave us two drama series, Karaoke
and Cold Lazarus, which we are to see in 1995. Other memorable arts
programmes included a South Bank Show celebrating the life and work of Larry
Adler and George Gershwin; an Omnibus on the astonishing working methods of
actor Robert Stephens; and Channel 4's coverage of the building of the new
Glyndebourne theatre and the opening performance of The Marriage Of Figaro.
If obliged to make awards mine would go to four eccentric marvels. First,
from January, Jonathan Meades' splendidly unclassifiable series Further
Abroad which offered engrossing and hilarious programmes on vertigo,
brewers, golf and pigs. Next, also from the start of the year, The
Unpleasant World Of Penn And Teller, which combined comedy and conjuring
with quantities of bad taste and endeavoured to give away many of the tricks
of the protagonists' trade. Third, Billy Connolly's World Tour Of Scotland
in which a fond travelogue was married to some foul-mouthed and yet
hilarious stand-up comedy routines. And fourth, Christopher Hitchens'
hatchet job on Mother Teresa in Without Walls, a programme which kept alive
the libertarian ideal of real freedom of speech rather than the wan little
imitation which we know so well.
Roll on 1995, when cable comes to our street. Let a thousand channels
flourish]

FT  28 DEC 94 / Arts: Playwright's talent for angry words - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Osborne, who has died at the age of 65, made an unforgettable mark in
the British theatre with the first performances of Look Back In Anger at the
Royal Court in 1956. Although he went on to write other memorable plays and
produced two volumes of autobiography, nothing can compare with that first,
heady triumph.
Osborne had been a reporter and an actor. By the early 1950s he had also
written several plays, though without success. Even Look Back In Anger had
been turned down by agents and managements throughout the country. Then
Osborne saw a notice in the Stage, saying that the newly-formed English
Stage Company under the artistic direction of George Devine was looking for
new works.
Along with some 750 other applicants, he sent in his text. Look Back In
Anger, which Osborne said he wrote in 12 days in May 1955, was the only one
selected for performance. Even then acclaim was not immediate. Derek
Grainger of the Financial Times was one of the few critics on a national
daily to admire the piece on the first night.
The Sunday papers treated Osborne better. In a famous article in The
Observer, Kenneth Tynan wrote of the play presenting 'post-war youth as it
really is, with special emphasis on the non-U intelligentsia who live in
bed-sitters . . . All the qualities are there, qualities that one had
despaired of ever seeing on the stage - the drift towards anarchy, the
instinctive leftishness, the automatic rejection of 'official' attitudes,
the surrealist sense of humour'.
Jimmy Porter, the hero or anti-hero of the play, began to be seen as the
spokesman for the younger generation. Yet Osborne had been lucky in his
timing. Neither he nor Jimmy Porter was the first of the 'angry young men',
as they came to be called.
Kingsley Amis had already established a new post-war irreverence with his
novel Lucky Jim in 1954 and for a while the angriest young man of them all
seemed to be the now almost forgotten Colin Wilson for his literary and
philosophical study, The Outsider. Where Osborne scored was to do it on
stage: where all of them gained in publicity was in the way they were taken
up by the popular press.
Tynan was also wrong in one main respect: there was no 'instinctive
leftishness' about Osborne. Like most of the other angry young men, he moved
steadily to the right and may not have been far away in the first place.
Look Back is about changes in generational and social attitudes; there is
nostalgia as well as anger. An important line comes when Alison, the upper
class wife of Jimmy Porter, explains to her father, who has spent most of
his life in India: 'You're hurt because everything is changed. Jimmy is hurt
because everything is the same. And neither of you can face it. Something's
gone wrong somewhere, hasn't it?'
The success of Look Back led to suggestions at the time that there had been
a revolution in the British theatre: the kitchen sink was in, the drawing
room was out, and certainly the plays of Terence Rattigan and William
Douglas-Home fell out of fashion.
Osborne went on to other successes. He attracted great actors: Laurence
Olivier in The Entertainer, a play comparing the decline of the music hall
to the decline of Britain, the young Albert Finney in his most cerebral
play, Luther, and Nicol Williamson in Inadmissible Evidence, recently
revived with a different actor at the National - a theatre that Osborne
claimed never much to have liked. He also wrote the screenplay for Tom
Jones.
Much of his reputation was for invective: from the tirades of Jimmy Porter
to some of the passages in his autobiographies about his mother, whom he
publicly disliked, and ex-wives. Yet at his best he was simply a good writer
with a talent for the stage. His last play, Dejavu, a revisiting of Jimmy
Porter more than 35 years on, was performed at the Comedy in 1992 and
received less praise than this critic thought it deserved. Fashion had
changed; by then Rattigan was back in London.
A small annual tribute will continue to be paid to him in the St Valentine's
day messages from bears and squirrels in the newspapers. That was just like
Alison and Jimmy when they clicked, though for that Osborne was derided by
some at the start.
He is survived by his fifth wife, Helen Dawson, and one daughter. He was
previously married to Pamela Lane, Mary Ure, Penelope Gilliatt and Jill
Bennett.

No apologies for picking an old film tonight. If . . . (10pm Channel 4)
stands head and shoulders above most of the cinematic dross foisted on us
over the past few days. The director Lindsay Anderson once upbraided me for
apologising for my excessive enthusiasm, so let me declare defiantly that
this is simply one of the best British movies ever.
Anderson's 1968 tale of public school revolt is funny, surrealistic, even
romantic.
It has been interpreted at various levels, notably as an attack on the
Establishment, which of course it is; but the director himself pointed out
that it was nothing so crass as a mere hatchet job on public schools - the
thread of nostalgia is deliberate.
However you take it, direction and acting are superb, not just from Malcolm
McDowell's non-conformist schoolboy but a host of stalwart performers like
Peter Jeffrey (a blandly fatuous headmaster), Graham Crowden (a convincingly
dotty history master) and Arthur Lowe's bumbling housemaster, piping
Purcell's 'Fairest Isle' with his wife in the dark watches of the loveless
night.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Management: Beyond the numbers game - Tony Grundy and Keith
Ward say there are nine key principles to ponder when appraising investments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY GRUNDY and KEITH WARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most managers know something about valuing key investment decisions. They
have frequently heard of net present value, discounted cash flow, internal
rate of return, payback and sensitivity analysis.
Yet in management practice these financial tools are so often distorted,
degenerating into a 'numbers game'. An Alternative Guide to Corporate
Finance might translate NPV to 'numbers prevent vision' and DCF as
'deliberate cash fudge'. 'Sensitivity analysis' might become 'insensitivity
analysis' (that is - knowing the right answer and then playing with the
assumptions to get there). 'Payback' might be more suitably translated as
'pray-back', emphasising managers' fear of longer-term uncertainty in
decision making.
On this page earlier in the year (February 9) Elroy Dimson and Paul Marsh of
the London Business School suggested that many companies are in danger of
under-investing because they are applying too high a cost of capital. The
numbers game has thus become a corporate ritual, even though the financial
environment has changed.
But could it be that some of the bias towards unduly high hurdles of cost of
capital is due to the very limitations of the business and financial
assumptions which managers make? Our own research of five large corporations
has highlighted that there are many not-so-obvious reasons why managers may
be looking at investment decisions using the wrong lens.
Applying the appropriate cost of capital may be important but it is not
nearly as important as identifying the underlying sources (or 'drivers') of
value. These are typically whether the investment decision exploits an
inherently (and sustainably) attractive opportunity; or where it builds
from; or on some area of competitive advantage; or where there are tangible
and measurable synergies. Possibly it is based on some area of distinctive
implementation capability. Finally, it might be a function of simple, good
timing.
These tests - attractiveness, competitive advantage, tangible synergy,
implementation and timing - can be used to probe the softer drivers of value
which our research study explored.
We conducted in-depth studies with small groups of managers in five leading
organisations - Rolls Royce Aeroengines, International Distillers and
Vintners (part of Grand Met), Post Office Counters Business, London
Underground and BP. From managers' point of view there were three main
problems or 'curses' surrounding investment appraisal - uncertainty,
intangibles and interdependencies.
Together these problems far outweighed those associated with the cost of
capital.
The uncertainties included not only external uncertainty (such as the
economic, regulatory and competitive environment), but also internal
uncertainties (such as implementation capability, management's commitment
and intent).
Intangibles turned out to pose particularly acute problems for managers.
These are often seen as the 'no go' areas of financial analysis, and covered
a 'wide range of value, from improving customer service through to defending
against competitive erosion and areas of future opportunity.
We found that almost all intangibles could be subjected to some form of
targeting, even if only by way of indicators. Our argument goes - if we
can't think of any world in which value might be harvested, then intangibles
don't really have genuine value at all.
Finally, we discovered that most project decisions faced by managers were
not like the 'stand alone' projects described in traditional financial
texts. They are interdependent with the business areas or with other
projects coming on stream. It seemed sensible, often, to appraise them as
part of a larger set when these interdependencies were complex, rather than
in isolation. The issue of interdependencies needs to be tackled on a
case-by-case basis, again by understanding the key value drivers (internal
and external) - and how these are linked.
We discovered that in those instances where managers found decision-making
intractable, those decision zones became much clearer if coupled with
strategic thinking to fit the project to the business strategy. A simple way
of forging closer links was to specify strategic objectives for each
project, and to do this explicitly rather than implicitly.
During the action research study, managers gained further insights by asking
questions such as 'if we have a project with X million pounds NPV, how does
this exploit market imperfection for advantage? Is it because it exploits a
particularly attractive market segment (and if so, for how long)?
Or is it because we have a wonderful, and sustainable, competitive
advantage? Or is it because we have synergies (killing two birds with one
stone), or have some very powerful innovation? These tests can be used to
explore each decision and challenge the assumptions underlying project
value.
By probing the three areas of uncertainty, intangibles and interdependencies
through strategic thinking much of the strain on the financial numbers
dissolves. This reduces the temptation to use the unnecessarily high hurdle
rates of return which Dimson and Marsh highlight.
What we are not saying is that improved, and more balanced, analysis alone
will dissolve the numbers game. Better strategic and financial analysis
needs to be supported by two things.
First, it requires a more open process of debate on key decisions, for
instance using workshop or learning approaches rather than bureaucratic
meetings as a primary evaluation tool.
Second, it requires more challenge by senior management (and not less) to
reshape the project to add more value or to achieve similar value at lower
cost and risk.
Too often, the testing of a business case becomes akin to a legal battle
between defence and the prosecution.
This climate does everything to dissuade open debate of the assumptions
which a learning process using key strategy and financial tools implies.
Managers may find it fruitful to ponder nine key principles which help lift
investment appraisal above the numbers game.
Identify the most appropriate level of analysis (this may be the project
itself, a group of projects or possibly the business unit strategy - based
on an analysis of the interdependencies).
Explore the key value drivers which have an impact on the project (including
the competitive environment, margin potential, cost base, quality of
implementation, timing).
Evaluate the key sources of external and internal uncertainty.
Where intangibles exist, target them and set measures (if not primary,
financial measures, then secondary, operational or competitive measures).
Where value is of a contingent nature, then examine the conditions under
which this value might arise and the likelihood of it crystallising.
Where value is protective or defensive, explore how this value can be gained
at least cost and through what other options.
Compare a basket of financial measures (including both NPV and payback) and
ensure that short-term goals don't drive out longer-term goals, and vice
versa.
Generate challenge in the decision process by openly exposing key
assumptions and uncertainties through learning workshops.
Use management challenge in a supportive way to re-shape the project: a
project not initially passing the net present value test may still be worth
pursuing.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Management: Change for change's sake - The perils of
initiative fatigue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Initiative 'fatigue' is creeping into some British companies. A study of
innovation and the initiatives designed to encourage it suggests that some
managers have been more concerned with change for the sake of it rather than
actually achieving anything.
The research is by Bob Sweeting of the School of Management at the
University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, who has been
looking at whether government-sponsored initiatives and agencies trying to
change the industrial infrastructure really do work.
Sweeting says initiative fatigue is characterised by a fall in morale as one
innovative initiative follows another with little or no apparent benefit for
the effort of making the changes. This leads to change becoming an end in
itself.
Worse, those in charge, or closely related to the changes, institutionalise
the process to justify themselves, so that the initiatives become catalysts
for empire building. This in
turn leads to something even worse.
'The same people also become celebrities, much called upon by outside
agencies to talk to others about the changes . . . this becomes very
time-consuming,' Sweeting says.
'There was a clear feeling among managers that a balance was required
between giving innovative changes credibility, visibility and support, while
keeping a clear view of what the business was all about and what customers
really needed and were prepared to pay for - and in sufficient quantities to
ensure financial viability and achieve growth objectives for the company.'
Previous research by Sweeting into new accountancy techniques demonstrated
that some managers embrace novel methods in search of panaceas, rather than
through understanding their problems and how - or whether - to use the new
techniques to solve them.
'Innovation' seems to attract many of the same followers. The more knowing
among interviewees had learned from experience that innovation in itself was
no substitute for a well-rounded, grounded and robust business approach.
Sweeting says: 'Some companies highlighted as exemplars of manufacturing
process excellence were at the same time struggling for commercial
survival.'
Sweeting says the local social, cultural and business environment often
plays a large part in success. Entrepreneurship is driven by a common
culture, or shared attitudes. Sometimes these are based on an elitist group,
or a family network, or widespread educational attainment. A modern example
is Silicon Valley; an earlier one lies in north-west England during the
industrial revolution.
'A dynamic period of change in recent decades has left manufacturing
industry in north-west England disoriented and ill-positioned. However, one
of the key findings of this study is that it is vital to prevent initiative
fatigue. Constant innovative change blunts enthusiasm and reduces the chance
of new initiatives working,' Sweeting warns.
He says 'management socialising' can play a part in improvements as networks
form and people understand better why initiatives work or fail and which
might be best for them. He also thinks the government should support a guide
to agencies charged with promoting innovation, to help companies shop around
for the most appropriate.
Too many agencies have secure funding for their first two or three years
only. They begin by doing what they are supposed to for 90 per cent of the
time but later spend a similar amount of time trying to secure further
funding as the money runs out.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Record industry's heart develops healthier beat: The new
Beatles album is just one of the reasons why sales have rebounded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Executives of EMI Records knew they had a hit on their hands last month when
they launched a rare Beatles recording, Live At The BBC. But they never
thought it would sell nearly 1m copies in its first month.
Live At The BBC is not the only success on the UK music scene. Album and
singles sales rose by 12.5 per cent in the year to October, according to the
British Phonographic Industry. Early estimates suggest Christmas sales could
be 20 per cent up on last year.
Record companies are also basking in the success of UK acts - such as Take
That, East 17, Blur, Oasis and Eternal - in the continental European market.
This rosy picture could not be more different from that of a few years ago
when the industry was mired in recession and haunted by legal and regulatory
problems.
The music market declined steadily in the early 1990s with album sales
falling from 163m in 1989 to 134m by 1992, British Phonographic Industry
statistics show. The record companies also faced the dual threat of the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into compact disc pricing and the
legal attempt by George Michael, the singer, to end his contract with Sony.
These threats have evaporated. The MMC found in the industry's favour and
George Michael lost his case. The latest probe into the music business - the
MMC's investigation into the Performing Right Society, the body that
collects royalties for composers - will not affect the record companies.
The economic environment has also improved. Music is traditionally a leading
indicator, emerging from recession earlier than other consumer sectors, and
its recovery from the early 1990s recession has been accelerated by other
factors such as demographic trends and technological changes.
The growth in the number of teenagers, the prime purchasers of singles, has
triggered a revival in teen phenomena such as Take That and East 17. Both
bands have had a string of hits and become the most successful teen acts
since David Cassidy, the Osmonds and the Bay City Rollers back in the 1970s.
The record companies have also invested in new alternative acts such as
Oasis and Blur. These bands have more critical kudos than Take That and East
17, which might help them to last longer. They have also enjoyed healthy
sales. Blur's Parklife album has sold 500,000 copies since its September
debut.
The jungle dance craze which started in the London clubs has been bombarded
by media attention in the US and UK. Record companies have been signing up
jungle acts in the expectation that it will become a commercial phenomenon
next year.
Meanwhile the industry continues to benefit from increased sales to age
groups which grew up in the vibrant pop culture of the 1960s and 1970s. Some
of the most successful 1994 releases have been aimed at this age group.
REM's Monster sold 200,000 copies in its first week - more than any album
for five years - when it came out in September. The 'greatest hits'
compilations by Bon Jovi and the Beautiful South have been among the
best-sellers this Christmas.
Live At The BBC is even better news for retailers, as it attracts older
consumers who do not normally buy albums. EMI's compact disc plant has been
working round-the-clock to satisfy demand. Mr Brian McLaughlin, managing
director of the HMV chain, said his shops were still selling 'as many copies
as we can lay our hands on'.
The popularity of compact disc players is also boosting music sales. Some 40
per cent of UK homes now have compact disc machines and consumers are
replacing their record collections by buying old favourites on disc,
increasing sales of classic rock, jazz and classical music.
The outlook is even brighter on the international front. UK acts are
well-established on the Continent and are starting to regain the ground they
lost in the US in the early 1990s due to the popularity of American
phenomena such as country music, rap and grunge rock.
Country and grunge are waning, making it easier for UK acts to make their
mark in the US, by far the world's largest pop market. This means that their
UK record companies can earn royalties on their North American sales.
Take That is being primed for a US debut next autumn. Mr John Preston,
chairman of the UK subsidiary of BMG, its record company, said: 'The US is
such an important market and Take That is such a big act that we want to get
it right first time. If we do, the upside is stupendous.'

FT  28 DEC 94 / Retailers report January sales rush
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retailers yesterday reported intense activity by shoppers at the opening of
the January sales, as the wet weather encouraged more bargain-hunters than
usual into stores. But retailers were doubtful that the surge in buying
signalled a lasting upturn in consumer confidence.
Preliminary indications were that business in the week before Christmas and
yesterday was stronger than in the same period last year. However, retailers
in the West End of London said numbers were swollen by foreign customers,
particularly from continental Europe and the Far East, who had been
attracted by the weakness of sterling.
Mr Tony Salem, retail managing director of Liberty, whose flagship store is
in Regent Street, said: 'There are a lot of foreigners in for the sales and
spending their cheap pounds. In the West End tourism has been very strong,
and that is what has kept our figures increasing at above the level of
inflation.' He added: 'It's no thanks to the suburban spender. We've found
it very difficult outside London.'
He said UK consumers still seemed to be afflicted by a 'feel-anxiety'
factor, resulting partly from speculation that mortgage rates would rise.
Mr Tim Daniels, managing director of Selfridges, said volumes in Oxford
Street were 'at least in line with last year'.
Regional shopping centres reported sharp increases in business. Mr Ron
Woodman, marketing manager at Gateshead's MetroCentre, Europe's largest
out-of-town retail and leisure complex, said: 'It's been absolutely
brilliant. It looks as though people have kept some of their budget back for
the sales. There seems to be more money than last year. They seem to be
buying more.'
About 200,000 people visited Manchester's Arndale Centre, approximately 15
per cent up on the same day last year. In the pre-Christmas period total
visitors were up 8 per cent, and turnover was 5 per cent ahead of the
equivalent period in 1993.
Two centres that have opened in the past five years, Sheffield's Meadowhall
and the Lakeside centre in Thurrock, Essex, both estimated that they had had
their busiest day yet.
Mr Woodman said the north seemed to have fared better than the south in
retailing during the Christmas season. But he added a note of caution:
'There is this famous feelgood factor today but will it be there in a week
or fortnight's time?'
Throughout the country there were heavy sales of warm clothing, after bad
weather during the Christmas season. Sales had been poor during the autumn,
which was milder than usual, and so shops had surpluses on offer at large
discounts.
Furniture sales also appeared to be healthier than usual, with Maples
claiming sales about 45 per cent higher than at the same point last year.
The company said its fortunes were improving in spite of the lack of
recovery in the housing market, because 'people are realising that they
cannot afford to move, and they are spending to upgrade the look of the home
they have'.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Labour to tackle student tax rift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party yesterday announced that it was to investigate ways of
charging students for their tuition by linking student loans to income tax
or national insurance.
The decision reopens an old wound for the party. Last year senior Labour
politicians led by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, blocked
publication of a discussion paper that suggested students might be asked to
pay towards the cost of their courses after they had graduated.
Mr Jeff Rooker, Labour's higher education spokesman at the time, was
subsequently sacked.
University funding difficulties have intensified since then and criticisms
of the government's existing student loans programme have made the issue
difficult to avoid.
Loans, administered by the Student Loan Company, an Education Department
quango, are repayable in fixed instalments over five years, starting in the
April after graduation. Repayments start once the graduate's income has
reached 85 per cent of the national average.
Processing the loans has proved difficult - 35,000 applications for this
academic year were still outstanding at the beginning of the Christmas
holiday. The National Audit Office is investigating the company's expenses.
In spite of these difficulties, grants were cut by 10 per cent this year,
and further cuts are scheduled for the next two years. Loans will be
increased to make good the shortfall.
Mr Bryan Davies, Labour's higher-education spokesman, yesterday claimed that
this system deterred young people from entering university.
'We don't want to see any system of finance which acts as a deterrent. If
students are to contribute, it should not be on a punitive basis and should
not be on the basis of the present unfair system.'
He added that graduates had to meet inflexible repayments at the time 'when
their lifetime earnings are at their lowest and when their family budgets
are at their tightest'.
Linking student loans to income tax or national insurance would tie the
level of repayments more closely to ability to pay, and would allow those in
low-paying jobs to take longer to repay the loan. It would also be much
cheaper to collect.
Such a system was broadly endorsed last year by the Committee of
Vice-chancellors and Principals, which represents all universities.
Plans linking loans to the tax system have been introduced in Australia and
New Zealand in the last five years with no significant effect on student
numbers.
Political controversy still surrounds two issues. First, Labour must decide
whether universities should be allowed to vary the fees they charge.
These so-called 'top-up' fees would allow the more prestigious universities
to charge more, thus leading to claims from lecturers' unions that they
would create a 'two-tier education system'.
Second, Labour faces a decision on whether to introduce a full-blooded
'graduate tax', with graduates paying a higher rate of income tax throughout
their careers, rather than stopping once they had paid off their loan.
Final proposals will be presented to the party's annual conference next
year.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Former head of tied agent sues Lautro for Pounds 6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The self-regulating body for the insurance industry is being sued for Pounds
6m by the former head of a now defunct investment company on the basis that
its actions unfairly forced the company out of business.
Mr Victor Tee, former majority owner of the Winchester Group, has issued a
High Court writ alleging negligence and fraudulent misrepresentation against
Lautro, the insurance watchdog whose operations are being taken over by the
Personal Investment Authority.
Mr Tee's action is one of the most serious legal challenges faced by Lautro,
which in recent years has taken an increasingly tough line on insurance
companies judged to be failing to comply with regulations to protect
investors.
The case is one of several hundred legal tussles involving former insurance
salesmen and either their former companies or the regulatory authorities.
Many of these cases stem from the large shakeout in the insurance industry
over the past four years, during which about 100,000 sales agents have lost
their jobs. The sackings have often been accompanied by disputes over money.
Assuming that Mr Tee's case reaches trial, it will explore the degree to
which Lautro's efforts to ensure consumers do not suffer from mis-selling
may conflict with the requirement also to deal fairly and law-fully with
affiliated companies.
Lautro said it would vigorously defend itself against the writ. It would not
comment further.
Mr Tee is seeking compensation to cover loss of income and general damages
arising from Lautro's actions which he contends conflicted with natural
justice.
The writ stems from an investigation in 1990 by Lautro into Winchester's
selling activities. After finding evidence of breaches of its rules, Lautro
served an 'intervention notice' in October 1990 that effectively stopped the
Hampshire-based company from trading.
Until the time of the notice, Winchester had been a 'tied agent' for Norwich
Union, the insurance company, selling investment products on its behalf.
After the notice, Norwich Union severed its connections with Winchester.
At the time of the notice Winchester had a staff of 80 people with five
branch offices.
Since 1990 Mr Tee has fought a prolonged legal battle to challenge the
Lautro ruling through a series of High Court and Court of Appeal hearings.
Should Mr Tee be successful in gaining damages, the costs would fall on the
members of the PIA, which is scheduled to complete its takeover of Lautro's
operations by October. The members include insurance companies, banks and
independent financial advisers.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Treasury aides told off for not mingling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior Treasury officials have been ticked off by Sir Terry Burns, the
permanent secretary, who says they have failed to show enough enthusiasm for
finding out about the outside world.
In a memo not intended for publication, Sir Terry says that the number of
visits to companies this year by top officials has been 'very
disappointing'.
Only about a third of the officials whom Sir Terry has asked to visit at
least one commercial organisation during 1994 have done so. The visits are
part of a Treasury scheme to make its employees more aware of business
issues.
But many of the officials face an uncertain future in the private sector
under a programme to cut a quarter of the Treasury's top 100 jobs.
The memo was sent this month to about 200 senior staff. It asks people
eligible for the department's 'contacts with industry' scheme and who have
not been on a visit this year to arrange one as soon as possible.
Sir Terry adds: 'I see the scheme as an effective way to exchange ideas and
experiences between the Treasury and industry as well as a useful source of
training for (Treasury) staff.'
Last year about 60 of the 100 officials who were asked to go on at least one
visit to industry did so. For this year the scheme was extended to include
slightly lower grades, taking the total covered to about 200 people.
Morale at the Treasury is poor following a review of its staff structure
which requires the department to shed about 25 top jobs by early next year.
Officials have until January 23 to apply for voluntary redundancy; after
this, selected civil servants may be issued with compulsory redundancy
notices.
The scheme to promote contacts with industry, devised by Sir Terry two years
ago, has been received well by companies. More than 50 leading groups -
including GEC, Glaxo, Rolls-Royce and National Westminster Bank - have
offered to host visits to help break down barriers between government and
industry.
The Treasury, explaining the background to the memo, said that many of the
officials eligible for the scheme may have been too busy worrying about the
other matters preoccupying the department.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
About half of all National Health Service prescription items - 222.8m out of
the 445.4m - cost less than the prescription charge, the government
acknowledged in a Commons written answer. Government figures also show that
NHS spending on health services from private-sector providers has risen 70
per cent in two years - from Pounds 208.5m in 1991-92 to a provisional
Pounds 357.4m in 1993-94.

thousands of people who had been 'enticed' into purchasing a Mercury
One-2-One mobile telephone on the promise of unlimited free calls on

Mercury One-2-One said at least 20 people had spent more than 12 hours on

FT  28 DEC 94 / Nadir pays tax debts of Pounds 250,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Turkish Cypriot tax authorities said yesterday that Mr Asil Nadir, the
fugitive tycoon, had paid about Pounds 250,000 in tax debts from disputed
Cyprus-based assets of his collapsed Polly Peck empire.
The payments were made late on Monday, only hours before the authorities had
threatened to confiscate the Jasmine Court Hotel in Kyrenia and the Palm
Beach Hotel in Famagusta.
Mr Nadir - who is believed to have debts to the state of about Pounds 7m -
said he still controlled the hotels, which have remained beyond the reach of
Polly Peck administrators because of court cases concerning their transfer
of ownership in the island's Turkish sector.
Administrators for the Polly Peck subsidiary Voyager Mediterranean last week
paid the Turkish Cypriot authorities a year's land rent of Pounds 62,000 for
the Jasmine Court Hotel.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Guinness appeal timing defended
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Home Office last night defended the timing of its decision to refer the
case of the four original defendants in the Guinness trial to the Court of
Appeal.
It refused to confirm or deny a report in The Times newspaper that the
decision was taken by Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, 72 hours after
legal proceedings demanding a judicial review were initiated against him by
Lord Mishcon, acting for Mr Gerald Ronson.
The report said the proceedings were started because Mr Howard had failed to
reach a decision on the application after 22 months.
The Home Office said: 'The decision was taken on a very complex case after
very careful consideration. The timing had to do with the need to give this
careful consideration.'

FT  28 DEC 94 / Buy-out preferred for British Coal arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A management and employee buy-out team has been selected by British Coal and
its advisers as the preferred bidder for Coal Products, the smokeless fuel
and foundry coke manufacturer.
British Coal also said it had sold TES Bretby, its scientific services
subsidiary, to John Mowlem Construction, which is paying Pounds 3m in two
instalments.
The announcements mark important steps in the privatisation programme for
British Coal's non-mining activities. RJB Mining is paying Pounds 815m for
its English mining assets, while Celtic Energy is buying its opencast sites
in south Wales.
The Coal Products buy-out bid - led by Mr David Foster, operations director,
and backed by Legal &amp; General Ventures - has been selected from a shortlist
of four. The other three bids were from Anglo United, Coal Developments and
a management buy-in led by NatWest Ventures.
The preferred bidder will have a period of exclusive negotiations intended
to allow completion of the transaction by January 31. Terms of the possible
deal were not disclosed.
Coal Products is the UK's largest manufacturer of solid smokeless fuel with
about 30 per cent of the market. More than 1m homes still use solid
smokeless fuel.
It also has about 60 per cent of the UK foundry coke market, and supplies
industrial coke to a number of major customers. Its four main plants are at
Immingham on the Humber, Coventry, and Aberaman and Cwm in south Wales.
TES Bretby does chemical analysis for the coal industry and other UK
industrial customers. Its contracts with British Coal will be transfered to
the successor mining companies until March 1998.
Mr John Gains, managing director of John Mowlem Construction, said the
acquisition would enhance its position in a sector where it was already
strongly represented through its geotechnical business.

The earnings of non-manual employees have risen more than three times as
quickly in the past 15 years as those of workers in manufacturing, say
government figures.
Earnings of full-time non-manual employees in the private sector rose by
56.3 per cent in real terms between 1979 and 1994, Mr Phillip Oppenheim,
employment minister, said in a Commons written answer. This compared with
17.6 per cent for full-time manual workers in manufacturing.
Meanwhile, a Labour MP, Mr Denis McShane, said government figures showed
that one in six blue-collar workers had weekly earnings before deductions of
less than Pounds 150.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Weak rebound predicted for Japanese economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's economic recovery was confirmed by statistics released by the
government yesterday, although a fall in consumer prices, indicating
lingering deflationary pressures, reinforced predictions of a weak rebound,
Emiko Terazono writes.
Industrial production for November rose 2.7 per cent from the previous
month, and 5.9 per cent from a year earlier on an unadjusted basis, thanks
to output growth in sectors including electrical machinery and steel.
Industrial shipments rose 2.8 per cent from the previous month while the
inventory index dropped 0.2 per cent.
Labour conditions showed a slight improvement, with the unemployment rate
for November at 2.9 per cent, the first fall in seven months, down from
October's 3 per cent. The ratio of job offers to applicants remained flat
for the third consecutive month at 0.64, indicating 64 offers for 100
candidates.
Strong November construction order figures reflected a recovery in private
sector capital spending. The figure rose 20.8 per cent from a year earlier,
with private sector orders rising 13.9 per cent and public sector orders
advancing 31.8 per cent. The Construction Ministry said housing starts rose
4.5 per cent from the previous year to 136,983 units, up for the second
consecutive month.
However, consumption figures indicated continuing downward pressures on
prices. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said large
retailers' sales last month rose 0.3 per cent from a year earlier, the first
rise in four months. Sales at department stores rose 0.1 per cent, the first
increase in 33 months.
Meanwhile, the December consumer price index for the Tokyo metropolitan
area, a leading indicator for the national figure, fell 0.5 per cent from
the previous year, due to lower prices on clothing and other manufactured
goods. For the whole year, the CPI for Tokyo rose 0.7 per cent, the first
increase of less than 1 per cent since 1987.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Tokyo mandarins feel power of the sword: Japan's bureaucrats
are being shaken up in their struggle with politicians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The office blocks of Kasumigaseki, Tokyo's civil service district, were
shaken yesterday when three of the country's top mandarins, in charge of
industrial, international trade and technology policy, lost their jobs.
Ministers of the conservative three-party government coalition yesterday
approved the resignation of Mr Hideaki Kumano, vice-minister (the top
bureaucrat) at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which took
pride in being the architect of Japan's industrial success and is a keen
advocate of economic deregulation.
His right-hand man, Mr Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice-minister for international
affairs - the top trade negotiator - stood down. With them went Mr Kinju
Atarashi, chief secretary of the Science and Technology Agency, a Miti
fiefdom which runs the country's first home-grown space rocket, successfully
launched last summer.
They are the senior victims of the ruling Liberal Democratic party's
campaign to reassert power over the public administration, which follows the
party's return to office six months ago after its first humiliating year in
opposition for nearly four decades.
The purge further destabilises Miti, already struggling to find a new
identity to replace its redundant role of engineering industrial growth. It
may take 10 years for morale to recover, mourns a retired official.
The Miti mandarins' alleged sin was to get in the way of politicians'
attempt to strike a new balance between elected representatives and the
holders of bureaucratic power.
This is a popular theme on all sides of Japanese politics. Public feeling is
shifting away from a public administration perceived as more sensitive to
its own interests than to the citizen's. Bureaucrat-bashing excites
increasing competition between political parties, in the absence of
significant policy differences.
Mr Kumano, the Miti boss, was blamed for failing to stop, and by implication
for conniving in, the dismissal, by a previous government almost exactly a
year ago, of Mr Masahisa Naito, former head of Miti's industrial policy
bureau.
Mr Naito, until then next in line to succeed Mr Kumano, was ousted for
prematurely promoting a young official who was about to stand for the LDP.
Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Miti minister and a rising star in the LDP, only
delayed the sackings because he was waiting for the 1995 budget to be
completed, say officials.
Meanwhile, Mr Atarashi lost his job because of a row with his political
boss, the formidable Ms Makiko Tanaka, the agency's director general.
Unwisely, he told Ms Tanaka to restrain a government campaign to trim the
number of departments, reportedly warning her that government offices were
'public organs. . . not a minister's personal obsession'. He should have
known better. Ms Tanaka, 51, the daughter of former prime minister Mr Kakuei
Tanaka, is a popular and much publicised critic of excessive bureaucratic
power.
She and a generation of younger politicians want to break with the tradition
under which ministers were merely ministries' meek figureheads. They would
read from scripts prepared by civil servants, leaving policy formation,
parliamentary questions, and sometimes international negotiations, to
officials.
Ministers were kept weak by the former LDP faction system, in which they
changed jobs every two years or so to make way for the next faction's
candidate. But the LDP factions were finally dissolved a week ago, in
connection with the political reforms that took effect on Christmas Day, a
deep blow to the old order. Now, 'teamwork between cabinet ministers and the
people who shoulder public administration is necessary,' argues Mr Yohei
Kono, LDP president.
Yesterday's bureaucratic bloodletting is a consequence of a process started
in summer 1993 by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the first non-LDP prime minister for
38 years, when he launched a deregulation drive. Ostensibly, deregulation
was supposed to promote consumer demand and open the economy to imports, in
which Japan had the support of trade partners sceptical of seeing change to
a tightly protected system.
But deregulation won political popularity as an attack on the bureaucracy.
Mr Naito's resignation, in December last year, brought this into the open.
When the LDP returned to office in June, it took up deregulation as an
electorally popular policy, despite its own conservative instincts.
The government plans to publish the country's first white paper on
deregulation early next year and has launched a review of 92 state agencies
 -the issue on which the unfortunate Mr Atarashi committed his
self-destructive gaffe.
There is another dimension to all this. The bureaucracy has also become a
battleground between the LDP and the opposition New Frontier party, whose
members formed the two previous coalition governments.
Many saw the hand of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the NFP's strategic mastermind, in Mr
Naito's dismissal. Equally, the hand of Mr Noboru Takeshita, the LDP's
shadow shogun and former prime minister, is thought to be behind yesterday's
sackings.
Yet the humbling of Miti may not go entirely to the politicians' script. It
will, in the short term, further strengthen the Ministry of Finance,
untouched by this battle, rather than boost the power of the LDP, warns the
retired official.
Until this row, Miti was the only ministry strong enough to counterbalance
the finance mandarins' fiscal austerity and conservatism, he points out. The
Ministry of Finance is increasingly portrayed in the Japanese press as an
arrogant defender of the old bureaucratically controlled order. It may
therefore become the next target of ambitious politicians, though the men
from the MoF will certainly put up more of a fight than did the Miti men
across the road in Kasumigaseki.

Priests of several religions offered last prayers for former President Zail
Singh, India's first Sikh head of state, as his body was cremated according
to Sikh custom yesterday (pictured above), Reuter reports from New Delhi
Hindu, Moslem, Sikh, Christian and Buddhist prayers were chanted on the
banks of the Yamuna river in Delhi near the memorials to two of India's
founding leaders, Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi.
Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao laid a wreath on the body at the ceremony
attended by ministers, opposition leaders and chiefs of the army, navy and
air force.
Singh, who was 78, died in the northern city of Chandigarh on Sunday after
suffering multiple fractures when his car was hit by a truck on November 29.
He was appointed by then-prime minister Indira Gandhi, and served as
president from 1982 to 1987.
He was called Giani, or scholar, for his mastery of Sikh scriptures.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Violence raises concern over future of Karachi: Farhan
Bokhari on the unrest which has claimed 170 lives this month in Pakistan's
business capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Karachi's worst outbreak of factional, ethnic and sectarian violence in
recent memory has led to fresh tensions between India and Pakistan and
raised concerns over the future of Pakistan's business capital.
The violence, which Pakistan claims has been fomented by Indian agents and
which has led to the closure of the Indian consulate in Karachi and the
expulsion by both countries of two diplomats, has claimed at least 170 lives
this month. More than 650 people have been killed this year.
In two recent incidents, the bullet-riddled corpses of four paramilitary
troopers were discovered blindfolded and tortured with their hands tied
behind their backs and shot at close range. No one claimed responsibility.
The next day, a group of nervous off-duty policemen blindly pointed their
guns towards a side street and fired in response to celebratory shots fired
in the air by people in a marriage party. The bridegroom and best man died.
The base of the country's vital port facilities, Karachi is home to the head
offices of some of the country's largest business groups and financial
empires.
Many foreign businesses, including multinational corporations, banks and
stock market investment groups, are also based in the city and have a stake
in its future.
Many businessmen, fear the security crisis could affect investment
decisions.
The violence has already hit the heart of that confidence.
The KSE-100 index of the Karachi Stock Exchange has fallen by almost 15 per
cent in two months, while many small shopkeepers claim that sales have
fallen by up to a half.
Fears for personal safety run high, and confidence in the ability of the
police to reverse the trend stands at an all-time low. Many foreign
governments have advised their citizens to avoid travel to the city.
'The business activities in Karachi are coming down day by day, and if this
situation is not brought under control, we fear that in coming weeks the
activities may (come to a) standstill,' says Mr Ahmed Sattar, president of
the powerful Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Pakistan's largest
business chamber.
The violence has escalated rapidly since the government pulled out army
troops from Karachi last month, ending a controversial 29-month operation
which was criticised by human rights activists for excesses against
civilians. But the withdrawal has given an opportunity to well armed
political and religious groups to settle scores.
One significant cause of the problem is the continuing crisis caused by a
bloody split in Karachi's largest ethnic political party - the MQM (Mohajir
Qaumi Movement), a group representing Moslems who migrated from India in
1947 at the time of independence from the British raj.
Security officials claim that the rivals have tried assassinating each
others' leaders, to strengthen their own position.
Some of the MQM-related violence has also been ethnic, with the mostly
Urdu-speaking migrants demanding more representation in government jobs than
that given to the Sindhis, who have a majority in the province but mostly in
areas outside the city.
Some of the recent killings are also linked to religious disputes. A group
of Sunni Moslems has been campaigning to have members of the Shia Moslem
minority officially declared non-Moslems.
Despite these factors, government officials primarily accuse intelligence
agencies from India, Pakistan's neighbour and arch-rival, for fomenting much
of the unrest.
Many local businessmen, including Mr Sattar, accept the notion of the
enemy's 'invisible hand' stirring the trouble. But some western diplomats
are less convinced. 'Both India and Pakistan have repeatedly made such
accusations. In Karachi, even if there was some truth, the core problem is
essentially the government's failure to find a political settlement,' one
diplomat says.
The government of Mr Abdullah Shah, the provincial chief minister, with the
support of Ms Benazir Bhutto, the prime minister, and President Farooq
Leghari, has begun negotiations with representatives of the MQM's larger
faction, in an effort to find a political solution.
Some officials are convinced that the key to ending the killings lies with
Mr Altaf Hussain, the movement's leader, who lives in exile in London.
The government wants Mr Hussain to use his influence over his supporters,
who are probably an overwhelming majority among the city's migrant
population, to denounce violent tactics. In return, MQM legislators in the
provincial assembly in Sindh could be offered ministerial slots.
'An agreement could help to bring the MQM in the political mainstream and
put the violence to rest,' says one government official in Karachi.
Officials hope that if Mr Hussain's faction agrees to a settlement, the
rival faction, whose following is much smaller, could be brought around to a
truce.
However, it is not clear if such an agreement would be reached, and if so,
how long it would hold together.
Furthermore, it is also not clear how the government would deal with
sectarian and ethnic violence even if the MQM's two factions silenced their
guns.
Some analysts are convinced that even if the killings are stopped, other
socio-economic problems which plague the city and create the temptation for
crime would be far more difficult to resolve.
In recent years, a combination of growing numbers of unemployed youth
together with a large flow of guns and drugs - a fall-out from the war in
neighbouring Afghanistan - created new temptations.
The city is also a striking example of the stark contrast between the rich
and the poor, with the elite living a life of luxury in fashionable enclaves
while the slum population grows substantially in katchi abadis (shanty
towns).
Ms Sherry Rehman, editor of Karachi's monthly Herald magazine, assessing the
situation, says: 'You can't just give ministries to people and forget about
it. The city needs a comprehensive package covering politics, economics, law
and order, social services.'

Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev yesterday urged the Socialist party of
former Communists, the clear winner of the December 18 elections, to form a
government without any ally.
Confirming previously announced unofficial results, Ms Ralitsa Negentsova, a
spokeswoman for the Election Commission, said the Socialists won an absolute
majority of 125 seats in the 240-seat parliament. Their main opponent, the
staunchly anti-Communist Union of Democratic Forces, gained 69 seats.
The Socialists have been seeking a multi-party government, which they say is
necessary to deal with Bulgaria's deeply rooted economic problems.

Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, says he is worried that
corruption recently disclosed in the Malaysian football league might spread
to the country's political system.
Malaysian police have arrested at least 50 football players in recent days
on suspicion of fixing the results of matches. Dr Mahathir said that he was
concerned that if people were willing to offer money to ensure a side wins
in a football match then they might also indulge in similar practices in the
political arena.
The investigations into football bribery in Malaysia comes at a time of
mounting allegations about corruption in various sectors of Malaysian
society.

Karl Schiller, the former Social Democrat who ranked as one of the fathers
of West Germany's postwar 'economic miracle', has died at the age of 83
after a long illness. He was dubbed 'Super Minister' because he held both
the economics and finance portfolios at the same time in the early 1970s.
Germany had lost one of its most important economists who had helped shape
the German economic powerhouse, Finance Minister Theo Waigel said. 'He won
great respect for his unerring judgement and his forthright advocation of
free market politics.'

UN officials yesterday cited progress in negotiations on the details of a
four-month ceasefire in Bosnia.
Two Bosnian government soldiers were wounded around Bihac, the embattled
Moslem enclave in the northwest. But a temporary truce appeared to be
holding. Winter weather also helped slow the fighting. General Sir Michael
Rose, UN commander in Bosnia, yesterday met Mr Ejup Ganic, vice-president of
the Moslem-Croat federation, to work out the details of the four-month
cessation of hostilities, mediated by Mr Jimmy Carter, former US president
and due to come into force on January 1.
The Moslem-led Bosnian government yesterday disputed UN reports that the
truce had taken hold in Bihac, which is ringed by Serb forces from Bosnia
and neighbouring Croatia. Mr Ganic called for the withdrawal of the Serb
forces from Croatia.

<TEXT>
A new system of regulating the Russian foreign and domestic oil markets will
come into force on January 1, according to a senior Russian official. The
system seems certain to run counter to the views of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and thus threatens the delivery of the
crucial aid to the Russian budget by these institutions next year.
Mr Andrei Dogayev, a deputy trade minister, told the Interfax news agency
yesterday that a new system - scrapping the oil export quotas but replacing
them with a requirement on oil companies to dedicate 65 per cent of their
output to domestic consumers - had been 'definitively agreed'. He also said
that the present system, under which 14 approved companies will have the
exclusive right to export oil, would be maintained, and that tariffs and
other methods would be used to regulate exports.

Boeing, the Seattle-based aircraft manufacturer, has announced orders and

customers.
Air Berlin, the charter operator, is ordering six 737-800s and one 737-400.
It has an option on four more 737-800s, a forthcoming 'next generation'
stretched version of the current 737-400.
Lufthansa German Airlines has also ordered one 747-400, which will be its
19th 747. Boeing said the purchase breaks a five-year lull in long-haul
aircraft orders by the airline.
Two other German airlines, Berlin-based Germania and Munich-based Bavaria
Fluggesellschaft, have also said they intend to order next generation 737s,
said Boeing. Last month Hapag-Lloyd, another German carrier, announced the
first 16 orders for the 737-800.

US consumer confidence rose nearly two points in December, to 102.2, its
highest level in more than four years, the Conference Board, a New York
business analysis group, reported yesterday.
Confidence varied substantially by region with gains in central and southern
regions offset by modest declines on the east and west coasts.
Separately, the National Association of Realtors reported a 2.6 per cent
decline in sales of existing (as opposed to new) homes between October and
November, to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 3.81m. Sales were 7.5 per
cent down from November last year. Analysts blamed sluggish sales on recent
increases in mortgage rates.

The pilots called the strike to protest against a tough wage and job cuts

Groundwork on a new suburb for 500 families in the West Bank Jewish
settlement of Efrat, south of Bethlehem, has thrown the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process into doubt.
The Arabs of the neighbouring village of Khader claim they have grown vines
on the disputed hillside for centuries; the settlers retort that they bought
part of the 125 acres involved and that the rest was government land. To the
Palestinians, the suburb looks more like a new settlement that an expansion
of Efrat, which houses 1,000 families.
Two of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's ministers have questioned the wisdom
of building it when Israel is negotiating peace through territorial
compromise. The decision will be reviewed at a cabinet meeting next Sunday.
After violent clashes yesterday between the villagers and the Israeli army,
Mr Sa'eb Erakat, the Palestinian Authority's local government minister,
protested: 'This is the graveyard of the peace process.'
Mrs Shulamit Aloni, Israel's outspoken communications minister, was the
first to condemn the project. 'What has been done here,' she said, 'is theft
by force of arms. We have to decide if we want to go forward towards peace,
or if we want to go towards unending terror.' Mr Moshe Shahal, the police
minister, agreed.
Israeli forces yesterday arrested 45 Arab demonstrators and Israeli peace
campaigners, who joined their sit-in on the hillside. After the protesters
had been evicted, two bulldozers began levelling the ground.

A Turkish court has convicted 86 Islamic fundamentalists of murder and
rioting, sentencing them for up to 15 years in jail for their part in
disturbances last year in the city of Sivas in central Turkey that lead to
37 deaths.
In July last year the defendants surrounded and set fire to a hotel where an
arts festival was being held, killing 37 people, most of them writers,
artists and actors. This was the worst outbreak of fundamentalist violence
in recent years in Turkey, highlighting the growing strength of Islamic
extremism.

Argentina's stock exchange had another stormy session yesterday in a
cash-squeezed financial market, with blue chips closing 4 per cent down on
the day in heavy selling.
But government officials said no fiscal measures would be taken to calm the
markets, and refuted rumours that several first-line banks were on the brink
of financial collapse.
The stock market's selective MerVal index closed at a fresh low for the year
of 437.08 points.
The bourse has nosedived 17.2 per cent in the past six sessions, after Brady
bonds and Argentine ADRs (those traded in New York) had taken a pounding on
the heels of Mexico's shock currency devaluation last week.
'There's absolutely no chance of a devaluation or any tax increases,' Mr
Carlos Sanchez, deputy economy minister, said. He predicted that the surge
in call money rates from 12 per cent last Thursday to about 25 per cent, and
the stock exchange's slide, would be reversed in the short term.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Lone Star state outshines NY
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has not been a great year for New York. Not only did the state vote out
of office the most distinctive US governor, Mr Mario Cuomo, but it will wake
up today to the news that it can no longer call itself the second most
populous state in the union after California.
That honour, say estimates from the Commerce Department's Census Bureau, now
belongs to Texas. The Lone Star state added a net 356,000 residents in 1994
to reach 18.4m. New York's nugatory 16,000 growth left it at 18.2m.
The reasons for the advance of Texas were broad-based, showing the extent to
which it has recovered from its early and deep recession in the 1980s. Its
residents were the second most fecund in the country, with births
outstripping deaths by 188,000. It was also among the most attractive to
immigrants, adding a net 86,000 from other states and a further 75,000 from
overseas.
New York recorded a natural increase of 114,000 and a foreign immigrant rise
of 101,000, but this was almost entirely offset by the more than 200,000
leaving the state for greener pastures elsewhere.
But at least New York had the consolation of discovering that California is
no longer the golden land of opportunity, at least for US citizens. Its net
loss of residents to other states rose to 426,000 (1.4 per cent of its
population), a testament to the seriousness of its recent economic problems.
California still grew overall, by a net 214,000 to 31.4m, on the strength of
a natural increase of 258,000 and foreign immigration estimated at 272,000.
This last figure only refers to legal immigrants.
California's loss mostly stayed out west. Eight of the ten fastest-growing
states were in the region. Neighbouring Nevada was the US leader with a
growth of 5.4 per cent, followed in order by Arizona, Idaho, Utah, Colorado,
New Mexico, Montana and Oregon.
Most of these states are underpopulated, which means that the largest
numerical increase (a net 1.3m people) was recorded in the geographic South.
Texas was followed by Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and
Virginia, all in the US top ten as measured by new heads.
At the other end of the scale of attractiveness, Connecticut, Rhode Island
and the District of Columbia all suffered population loss. The US capital,
losing a net 9,000, brought up the rear and, as its hopes of statehood fade
further, has fewer people than even Vermont.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Business turns to a Mercosur sunrise: David Pilling weighs
Argentina's prospects in a customs union about to take effect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The jitters afflicting currency and share markets have yet to undermine
Argentine confidence that the most important economic event in the near view
is Mercosur - the customs union that will from Sunday weld Argentina's
market to that of Brazil, as well as to those of Paraguay and Uruguay.
Brazil, a market of 150m and Argentina's largest trading partner, is
witnessing a 'vigorous recovery of demand', thanks to the initial success of
the Real currency plan, says Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentine economy minister.
Meanwhile, consumption in Argentina is levelling off.
'The macro-economic asymmetry (with Brazil) has completely changed,' he
says. When Mercosur was born in 1991, Brazil was in near-hyperinflationary
recession while Argentine consumer demand was booming, the minister says.
Now the reverse is so, providing a welcome boost to Argentine exports, which
are already showing signs of picking up strongly. The shift might just be
enough to ease what many foreign investors regard as a crucial weakness of
Argentina's restructured economy - its vast trade deficit, set to top
Dollars 5.5bn (Pounds 3.5bn) this year.
'Without doubt, Mercosur will start to be an important motor of growth,'
says Ms Debora Giorgi, an economist at Alpha, an economic consultancy. Alpha
expects that, in 1995, Argentine exports to Brazil will leap by Dollars
1.4bn to about Dollars 4.2bn, and that Argentina's trade deficit with its
giant northern neighbour - this year expected to be Dollars 1.1bn - will be
wiped out. In 1996, Alpha says, exports to Brazil will surge again, to
Dollars 6.1bn.
Baring Securities expects the 'Brazilian effect' to help reverse the trend
of Argentina's widening trade gap. Next year, Barings is predicting, the
overall deficit will shrink by Dollars 500m to about Dollars 5.0bn.
Argentine exports expected to do best, according to Alpha, are natural gas,
wheat, flour, sunflower oil, milk products, cars and autoparts, textiles,
leather goods and fish.
Provinces on the Brazilian border, many of which are among Argentina's
poorest, as well as the milk and wheat-producing zones of Santa Fe, Cordoba
and Buenos Aires further south, should receive a particular fillip, it says.
There is already evidence (largely anecdotal) of a year-end surge in exports
to Brazil, produced largely, says the Broda economic consultant, by a 37 per
cent appreciation of the Real against Argentina's dollar-pegged peso. This
gives Argentina what Broda calls a 'phenomenal trading advantage', helped
further by the leap in Brazilian consumer demand thanks to the slaying of
hyperinflation.
Mr Marcos Devoto, a food analyst at Santander Investment, gives the example
of Argentine cheese producers who cannot buy enough milk to supply the
resurgent Brazilian market. Customs officials on the frontier are reported
unable to keep pace with the rush.
Mr Devoto says that Brazil today is experiencing what happened in Argentina
in 1991 when the destruction of hyperinflation unleashed pent-up consumer
demand.
The impact of the formal start of Mercosur itself is expected to be less
dramatic. Although free trade for the majority of goods within the Mercosur
bloc will start on Sunday, in practice most items already face only minimal
tariffs after recent reductions.
'There will not be an explosion in January,' says Mr Cavallo. 'It's a
continuation of what was begun in 1991.'
One change that could have a marginally negative impact on Argentine hopes
to raise competitiveness - and hence exports - is the end of duty-free
imports of capital goods. Argentina, which has tried to encourage its
dilapidated industry to re-equip with modern machinery, must now bow to the
demands of Mercosur's common external tariff, in particular to the wishes of
Brazil.
Because Brazil wants to protect its own capital goods industry, Argentina
has been forced to agree to a gradual increase of tariffs on such items to
14 per cent by 2001.
Even so, Argentine companies show every sign of having taken advantage of
their opportunity. Capital goods imports went up by 60 per cent to Dollars
3.3bn in the first seven months of 1994 against the equivalent period of
1993. Partly because of this, the government expects exports to increase by
20 per cent next year.
Some companies have also been thinking ahead, in terms of taking advantage
of new Mercosur-driven opportunities. Cargill, the multinational commodity
trader with important operations in Brazil and Paraguay (in Argentina, too,
where it is the biggest food exporter), is 'already evaluating ways of
exploiting the synergies,' according to Mr Hugo Krajnc, public affairs
manager.
He believes, however, that traditional wisdom, which regards Argentina as
naturally strong in the food sector and Brazil as the obvious regional
centre for mass-produced consumer items, may be flawed. 'Without (the
distortionary effects of) inflation, the real competitive advantage may turn
out to be quite different,' he says.
Most analysts agree that some Argentine companies will suffer and that the
need for greater competitiveness may throw more people out of work.
Unemployment is already high.
'The profound productive transformation being set in motion by Mercosur
could be painful for many,' says Alpha. Brazilian industrial muscle will
force Argentine companies to specialise in their areas of strength, it adds.
'All this integration is definitely likely to reallocate industry,' says Mr
Krajnc at Cargill. 'The end of this film has not been seen yet.'

FT  28 DEC 94 / Talks today on release of US pilot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A senior US state department official arrived last night in South Korea, en
route for talks in North Korea today when he will seek the release of Chief
Warrant Officer Bobby Hall, the US army helicopter pilot downed over the
North on December 17.
Mr Thomas Hubbard, a deputy assistant secretary of state, was part of the US
team that reached the agreement on nuclear non-proliferation with North
Korea in October. He was sent on his new mission after North Korean
diplomats at the UN had suggested that this would 'facilitate a resolution'
of the problem.
But broadcasts and statements from Pyongyang over the last 48 hours have
alleged that the helicopter was on a spying mission and have demanded that
the US admit as much. US officials have maintained that it strayed into
North Korea while on routine training because of a navigational error. Even
so, the US has apologised for the violation of the North's air space.
Congressman Bill Richardson, the New Mexico Democrat who brought home the
body of the other US pilot killed in the incident, said the new mission
could strengthen the hand of the North Korean foreign ministry, adding that
it was more eager for a resolution than was the North's military command.
Mr Lee Hamilton, outgoing chairman of the House of Representatives foreign
affairs committee, warned yesterday that Congress might delay a scheduled US
oil shipment to Pyongyang so as to force the release of the pilot.
The US is to provide 50,000 tons of heavy fuel oil, valued at about Dollars
4.7m (Pounds 3m), to North Korea by January 21 as part of the October
accord.
However, the US is anxious not to jeopardise the hard-won agreement which
appeared to remove the immediate threat of the North acquiring an offensive
nuclear capability.
There has been speculation here about a continuing internal power struggle
in Pyongyang after the death last summer of Kim Il-sung ended 45 years of
his authoritarian rule. Kim Jong-il, his son and successor, has been seen
only intermittently in recent weeks.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Attention is focused on Algeria's hidden war: Some 800
people are dying each week in a vicious civil conflict which is largely
invisible to the outside world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dramatic television pictures of the Air France hijacking contrast with
the near invisibility to the outside world of the conflict in Algeria itself
in which some 800 people are dying every week.
Foreign camera teams, either banned by the Algerian government or afraid of
being targeted by fundamentalists, have been unable to record what Amnesty
International says is 'a growing spiral of violence (in which) the security
forces and armed Islamist groups (act) in total disregard of international
and humanitarian law'.
The hijacking appeared to have been timed to coincide with the third
anniversary on December 26 of the general election which the Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS) seemed certain to win before the poll was annulled by
the military-led Algerian government.
The result has been the loss of 30,000 lives - 25,000 of them this year
alone.
An attempt last summer by the head of state, General Liamine Zeroual to
establish a dialogue with the FIS leaders, Mr Abassi Madani and Mr Ali
Benhadj, collapsed in October. Too many people on both sides of the divide -
the army and the Islamist groups - had no wish to see it succeed and the
violence worsened.
Supporters of radical Islam have traditionally used violence, notably
against 'degenerate' women and have recently taken to decapitating their
victims and keeping their heads. The extreme Armed Islamic Group (GIA),
reported to have been responsible for the Air France hijack over the
weekend, has burnt down at least 500 schools and a number of university
research centres and have been known to gun down children.
At the same time, the army, led by General Mohamed Lamari, the tough chief
of staff who believes the FIS can be 'eradicated', has turned to torturing
and murdering people suspected of supporting it. There are reliable reports
that they have burned whole forests to flush out guerrilla groups and have
destroyed villages as retribution for the killing of soldiers.
More than 80 foreigners - including four Roman Catholic priests murdered
yesterday - have been killed since September 1993, most of them at the hands
of Islamists whose aim is to scare away international capital and knowhow
vital to Algeria's economy. Embassies have closed and many foreign companies
have withdrawn their personnel.
Since its birth five years ago the FIS has been a broad church. Its
supporters have included pious members of the middle classes, well educated
but radical younger Algerians and unemployed youths who despair of ever
getting employment or housing.
The GIA is the more notorious group, but western officials say that
disentangling one radical group from another is impossible. Many are
believed to be led by local emirs and the military security forces are
suspected of manipulating others.
The fault-line in Algerian society runs through family, tribe and region.
Recently a security officer shot a terrorist and when he pulled the
balaclava off the dead man's face, he recognised his son.
Intellectuals and members of the professional classes have been caught up in
the confrontation between a privileged elite which has held power for a
generation and the radical Islamists who say that 'those who criticise us
with their pen will die by the sword'.
They view intellectuals such as the writer Tahar Djaout, whom they murdered
in May 1993, as 'apostates' who deserve the same fate as 'Jews, Christians
and foreigners who are part of a colonial plot to commit profanities on our
country'.
These events, occurring on Europe's doorstep are kept not only from the
western eye. The authorities have imposed harsh measures on local
journalists who are also increasingly victims of fundamentalist terror.
The resulting sparse coverage of the brutality on both sides is in the
Algerian government's interests. It is well aware that television reporting
in particular could lead some in Europe to question the largely uncritical
support afforded it until now by western powers since 1992.
Most western leaders, notably President Francois Mitterrand of France,
tacitly endorsed the coup of January 1992. For the past three years the same
leaders have been keen to denounce fundamentalist violence but are notably
coy about the brutal methods of the army. The US and, to a lesser degree
Italy and Spain, have been more even handed in their condemnation of
violence.
French leaders have strongly backed the regime and led the chorus for
financial support. However, the Algerian government's handling of the
hijacking will do nothing to improve its standing in the eyes of its own
people.
Other security lapses could be economically costly. Were Algeria's vital oil
and gas export facilities at Arzew or Skikdda to be successfully targeted by
the fundamentalists, it would be a serious blow to the country's capacity to
earn foreign exchange.
Meanwhile, key civil servants are among the estimated 50,000 professional
people who in the past two or three years have joined in exile the estimated
100,000 well educated Algerians who left years ago. Many would agree with
the Spanish writer Juan Goytisolo that refusing the FIS its electoral
victory was 'a remedy worse than the disease'.
Algeria's modern history is one of continuing violence, first during 130
years of French colonial rule which culminated, between 1954 and 1962, in a
traumatic war of independence where native Algerians fought the French and
civil war prevailed within each camp. Thirty years of socialism, widespread
corruption and lack of freedom of expression have added to the country's
woes.
The fallout of further violence in Algeria, be it among its Maghreb
neighbours or the 2m North African community in western Europe, many of whom
live in France, cannot be discounted. Morocco and Tunisia, however, are
unlikely 'to fall off the shelf', in the words of one senior diplomat. If
anything, the violence in Algeria appears to be acting, for the time being
at least, as a powerful aversion therapy there.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Yeltsin tries to quieten the chorus of criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin's long-awaited address to the nation on the Chechnya
crisis, confidently delivered yesterday afternoon, was a judicious mix of
resolution to finish the job of disarming the 'bandit groups' who support
Chechen leader Dzhokar Dudayev and protestations of respect for the peaceful
people of Chechnya, for their religion (Islam) and the need to restore their
economy.
At its core was the same offer made a week ago: talks with leaders 'who
understand that further military confrontation is senseless', and with only
one item on the agenda - a ceasefire and the disarming of all illegal
groups. However, the president dwelt at length on the reasons for the
Russian military intervention.
These, he said, were the three-year state of lawlessness in the breakaway
republic, the illegality of a regime not recognised by the former laws of
Chechnya, by federal laws or by other states, and the criminalisation of a
regime which, he claimed, gained most of its revenue from arms and drugs
trading, and from the diversion to its own use of federal funds meant to pay
pensions and other expenses.
In its care for Russian fears about a long and bloody war and for Chechen
sensibilities, the speech reflects Mr Yeltsin's need to attempt to placate,
or at least reduce, the anxieties and hostilities of a number of senior
military officers and several of his aides and advisers who have opposed his
policies in Chechnya.
The most outspoken in the ranks of the military have been General Boris
Gromov, a deputy defence minister, General Alexander Lebed, commander of the
14th Army in Trans Dnester, and - less explicitly but more powerfully -
General Eduard Vorobyev, deputy commander of land forces who offered his
resignation rather than lead the Chechen mission. On Monday, speaking to
veterans of the Afghan war, General Gromov, the former Soviet army commander
in Afghanistan, likened the Chechen affair to the Afghan debacle. He called
it a 'woeful, badly thought-out move . . . which placed (the leaders')
political ambitions and the lives of the people on the same level . . . The
main thing I do not understand is for what reason our young and not-so-young
people have to die', he said.
General Gromov, together with two other deputy defence ministers - General
Georgy Kondratyev and General Valery Mironov, the latter of whom was Gen
Gromov's deputy in Afghanistan - may pay the price for their
insubordination. Mr Sergei Yushenkov, the forthrightly anti-war chairman of
the Duma defence committee, claimed on Monday that a decree had been
prepared sacking all of them. He said that the ostensible reason would be a
reorganisation of the defence ministry: the real reason, however, was their
refusal to take part in the 'shameful Chechen war'.
In a current affairs programme on Sunday night, Mr Emil Pain, a presidential
adviser on ethnic problems, appealed to Mr Yeltsin to rethink his position
and switch from military tactics to negotiation while there was still time.
Mr Pain, according to the programme, was speaking on the part of a wider
group of advisers, including Mr Gergy Satarov, Mr Leonid Smiryagin, Mr Mark
Urnov and others. These men, of a liberal bent, have voiced veiled or
explicit criticisms of the action over the past week at the risk of their
own positions. For the moment, like the generals, they have not been sacked
and may have seen their opposition rewarded in the softer content of the
president's speech.
However, the war will continue. If the Chechen rebellion is crushed,
sackings and resignations appear inevitable. That, in turn, means that the
remaining liberals around Mr Yeltsin will be joining the ranks of the
opposition. More alarmingly, a number of generals, popular with their
brother officers, will be relieved of duty but not necessarily of political
ambition.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Scalfaro intent on taking his time
</HEADLINE>

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
No quick solution to Italy's government crisis seemed likely yesterday as
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro resumed his consultations.
He spoke first to Mr Carlo Scognamiglio, senate speaker and a possible
interim prime minister, and Ms Irene Pivetti, speaker of the chamber of
deputies who has also become an important constitutional figure in the
search for a new government.
President Scalfaro, who can dissolve parliament or invite someone to form a
new administration, intends to proceed cautiously. He will spend at least
the rest of the week in formal discussions with all the main political
figures in an attempt to avoid early elections following last week's
resignation of the Berlusconi government.
His determination was emphasised yesterday in a letter to union leaders
praising their 'civic sense' for declaring, in a pre-Christmas message, that
early elections would harm the country.
This view has placed him in a potentially dangerous direct conflict with Mr
Silvio Berlusconi, the outgoing premier, who is determined that elections be
held by early April at the latest in order to gain maximum benefit from a
sympathy vote.
The media magnate turned politician continues to enjoy solid support for a
snap election from Mr Gianfranco Fini, leader of the neo-fascist
MSI/National Alliance, principal partner in the rightwing coalition that
governed Italy since May. However, the other main coalition partner, the
populist Northern League, does not share this view.
All are agreed that a quick election would be against the movement's
interests. This has weakened Mr Berlusconi's hand but has done nothing to
help find an alternative solution.
One new element in this uncertain picture is the plight of two senior
figures closely linked to Mr Alfredo Biondi, the outgoing justice minister
and one of the coalition's most controversial members. Over Christmas it was
revealed that Salerno magistrates had advised Mr Ugo Dinacci, chief
inspector at the justice ministry, that he was under investigation for
alleged links with the Camorra, the Naples Mafia, for allegedly helping
'fix' trials. Mr Dinacci has been in the forefront of the government's
campaign to bring anti-corruption magistrates to heel.
At the same time Mr Vincenzo Vitale, deputy head of Mr Biondi's office at
the justice ministry, has come under investigation by Palermo magistrates
for alleged abuse of office - which he denies - relating to a series of
favours provided to Sicilian businessmen and politicians suspected of being
close to the Mafia.

FT  28 DEC 94 / French team proves its worth

<TEXT>
The success of the French National Gendarmerie Intervention Group's assault
on the hijacked Air France Airbus has served as a reminder of increasing
sophistication of anti-terrorist action in the 1990s.
From the moment on Christmas Eve morning when the airline was taken over in
Algeria, the French government set in motion a well rehearsed plan of
action.
The apparent early prevarication by some French officials over whether or
not to negotiate was a ploy by security chiefs to give time to prepare the
commando operation.
The GIGN is divided into four brigades each made up of 15 professional
police and ex-army marksmen with an administrative back-up which includes
signals intelligence staff.
During the two days that elapsed between the hijack and the grounding of the
aircraft in Marseilles one of the GIGN brigades practised the assault on an
Airbus of the same type.
Throughout this period the movement and the conversations of the hijackers
were constantly monitored by existing listening devices, allowing the
commandos to pinpoint those areas of the airliner most susceptible to attack
and infiltration.
The GIGN is just one of several specialised anti-terrorist units which
France has established over the past two decades to deal with the threat of
international terrorism in all its forms.
Together with Britain's SAS and the Israeli special forces, the GIGN have
earned worldwide international recognition for their record in thwarting
terrorist actions.
Controversy has never been far behind the actions of these units, however.
They have to tread a fine line - often blurred by ministerial divisions -
between what is politically acceptable and what is a military necessity.
It was Castro supporters who initiated aircraft hijacks in 1961, diverting
four airliners to Havana, the Cuban capital. But it was in the late 1960s
and early 70s that the practice was used increasingly by mainly Middle East
groups to highlight their cause and, wherever possible, to secure the
release of political prisoners.
Anti-terrorist experts believe that as long as a government holds firm and
refuses to give in to terrorists there is less chance of hijacking
increasing.
However, they have continued with more than 20 taking place in the past two
years alone. Some hijackings have been carried out by deranged individuals,
others by common criminals bent on extortion. The bulk, however, are the
work of political fanatics who believe that the publicity generated by the
action is still worth dying for.

FT  28 DEC 94 / UK study criticises post-communist state sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The quality of much privatisation in post-communist countries is very poor,
argue Peter Young and Paul Reynolds, in a report from the London-based Adam
Smith Institute, published yesterday.*
'Unless there are substantial reforms in the approach being taken, what will
emerge will not be real market economies, but inefficient, partially
collectivised, hybrid economies in which a bureaucratic elite still succeeds
in exploiting the bulk of the population,' they say.
The big mistake, argues the report, has been to forget the wider goal of
establishing a competitive market economy. 'Instead, 'technical'
privatisation, without liberalisation, has become the new objective.'
The report's recommendations include:
better integration of competition policy with privatisation;
radical deregulation, combined with removal of barriers to entry of new
companies; conversion of all share-holdings into ones that can be freely
sold by their owners;
national share registers, rather than registers managed by companies; and
efforts to buy out the interests of entrenched managers, who remain dominant
in most privatised enterprises.
The Adam Smith Institute was the intellectual pioneer of privatisation in
the UK. The authors of the report have themselves worked on behalf of the
institute as advisers to several post-communist governments, including
Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Mongolia.
The report argues that mass privatisation is inescapable, given the scale of
the inherited task. But present efforts suffer from significant defects,
including:
the wholesale transfer of unreformed monopolies into the private sector;
creation of closed joint stock companies, whose shares cannot be sold
without company permission;
the sale of protected markets rather than just companies;
restrictions on the goods and services that privatised companies can offer;
conflicts between the different parts of governments involved in
privatisation;
use of residual state-owned shares by governments to exercise influence over
enterprises; and
the excruciatingly slow pace of privatisation in most countries.
Privatisation, notes the report, 'is a necessary, but not sufficient,
condition for the creation of a market economy'. Furthermore, 'the success
of privatisation will be short-lived if the process is managed as an
opportunity for enrichment amongst a bureaucratic or economic elite'.
One big worry of the authors is over the failure to integrate competition
policy with privatisation. 'In some republics, anti-monopoly organisations
have reimposed price controls over organisations they deem as monopolies. .
. . This constitutes reintroduction of the planned economy by the back
door.' The solutions include liberal trade and 'strong action to ensure that
new enterprises are free to enter markets.'
A second worry is over how the shares are owned, registered and traded. In
Russia, for example, share registries are maintained by individual
companies. More important, 'closed company privatisation, especially when
combined with the preservation of monopolies and a suffocating blanket of
regulations, serves to preserve the old economic structure and system'.
The persistent tendency towards chaotic over-regulation is a third big
concern. 'Too many bureaucrats,' notes the report, 'still think that reforms
are less important than forms.'
One result is 'the culture of semi-illegality which prevails in post-Soviet
industry and within administrative functions'. Yet this is inevitable when,
for example, 'businessmen operating in Moscow today have to pay 51 separate
taxes'.
Moreover, 'over-regulation also undermines the authority of the state when
the very constitutional upheavals of the present make respect for state
authority paramount'.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Hijack drama gives Balladur poll boost: PM's standing
enhanced but France faces growing threat from Algerian war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edouard Balladur yesterday resumed his holiday in the Alps to weigh the
bitter-sweet implications of France's Christmas hijack drama. His own
standing as prime minister and presidential hopeful has been enhanced. But
his country has been dragged towards the frontline of Algeria's civil war
and faces further threats from the torment of its former colony.
In ordering security forces to storm an Air France airliner, which had been
seized on Christmas Eve by Islamic opponents of Algeria's military-backed
regime, Mr Balladur threw off his cautious image. Monday evening's
operation, in which the 169 passengers were rescued, was widely hailed as a
success for a premier hitherto dogged by a reputation for prevarication and
concessions.
'France received its own Action Man for Christmas', said one diplomat. 'He
has succeeded in the first major crisis he has faced since he took office.'
For the prime minister, the timing is significant. Within the next few weeks
he is expected to declare his candidacy for presidential elections due in
the spring. The decision earlier this month by Mr Jacques Delors, European
Commission president, not to run as Socialist candidate, left Mr Balladur
favourite to succeed Mr Francois Mitterrand. The outcome of the hostage
crisis will further strengthen his hand.
Satisfaction, however, will be tempered by the implications of the
hijacking, the most daring assault yet on foreign interests by Islamic
opponents of the Algerian regime. The attack underlines the risks inherent
in French policy towards its former colony and the growing threat of the
civil war spilling into France. 'For the first time since the Algerian war
of independence we are seeing Algerian terrorism on French soil,' said one
Paris university professor.
Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, has warned that the violence in
Algeria is set to continue and that France will step up security measures.
Air links between the two countries have been suspended as a result of the
hijacking.
France's policy has brought it increasingly into conflict with opponents of
the Algiers regime. Since the cancellation in 1992 of elections which the
Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win, France has provided support
and financial backing for the government to try to contain the conflict.
This stance reflects a series of concerns. In particular, Paris is eager to
avoid a flood of refugees, swelling the ranks of the 1m or so Algerians
already living in France, fueling immigration tensions and playing into the
hands of extreme-right politicians such as Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, head of the
National Front.
Mr Juppe, like his counterparts in London and Washington, has sought to
promote a negotiated solution. But this has been overshadowed by the
hardline approach of Mr Charles Pasqua, the powerful interior minister, who
has launched a series of crackdowns on Moslem fundamentalists in France. In
November, for example, Mr Pasqua claimed to have broken a support group for
Algerian guerrillas following a dawn swoop which netted 90 suspected Islamic
radicals.
Mr Pasqua's actions appear to have public backing. But they have drawn
France into the firing line of Algerian Islamists, in particular the Armed
Islamic Group (GIA), the most militant of the forces opposed to the Algerian
regime of President Liamine Zeroual. The GIA claimed responsibility for the
hijacking, describing the action as a response to the military and financial
aid to the Algerian government.
Such hostility will only be heightened by the killing of the four hijackers.
As one diplomat in Paris put it; 'France has shown that it will act tough.
This could dissuade further attacks. But it could equally bring reprisals.'
With its policy of containment under strain, France is being pushed to
reconsider its relationship with the Algerian government. Mr Juppe denied it
was considering a policy shift, but he talked of tensions with the Algerian
government during the hostage crisis and sought to distance France from
close support for the regime.
'We are not backing a regime or a government. . . . the only side we are
backing is that of democracy,' he said. 'This message is directed to the
Islamists as well as to those who back the policy of all out repression.'
France may now try to step up its contacts with Algeria's Moslem groups in
an attempt to ease tensions and break the deadlock in Algiers. Sources in
Paris say the government has already sought to influence the FIS through
discussions in Tehran and Khartoum.
There are limits, however, on how far France seems prepared to move.
According to Mr Juppe, democratic forces have still to emerge with a
political platform in Algeria. In the meantime, he said, France and the
international community should provide financial aid to the Algerian people
to avoid 'chaos'. However, such economic support, which has totalled about
FFr38bn (Pounds 4.5bn) in 1994, is fiercely opposed by the Islamic
fundamentalists. They believe the financial assistance is propping up the
regime and reject France's assertion of impartiality.
A further obstacle to French strategy is lack of progress in seeking a
democratic solution to Algeria's woes. In November, President Zeroual
promised elections by the end of 1995. But the offer was rejected by
militants, who have pledged to continue their armed struggle. Fighting has
escalated sharply since negotiations broke down in the autumn.
The increased ferocity of the civil war has played into the hands of
radicals who are more willing to go beyond Algeria in pursuit of their
struggle. The Air France hijacking has sent a warning to Paris in
particular. Despite the events of the past few days Mr Balladur has not been
rescued from the Algerian crisis.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Mexico struggles to avert crisis as peso slips further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's financial difficulties deepened yesterday as the peso fell to
record lows and the government struggled to find a way out of the crisis.
The currency's sharp fall heightened concerns about the overall health of
the Mexican economy, especially with regard to inflation, economic growth
and the burden of rising interest payments on foreign debt.
The US Treasury Department said yesterday that the peso had fallen too far,
adding: 'We have every confidence in the underlying soundness of Mexico's
economic policies. We are in close contact with the Mexican and Canadian
authorities, regarding the currency markets, and recognise that excessive
depreciation is in none of our interests.'
It was not clear whether the last part of the statement indicated that the
US Tresury was ready to intervene in the peso market on its own account.
Mexican government officials indicated to bankers and senior officials in
the US yesterday that a comprehensive economic plan would be announced by
next Monday at the latest.
It would include details of accelerated privatisation - including
petrochemicals, electricity generation and transport - further deregulation
of the economy, and measures to cut demand. Outlines of some of these
measures have already been announced. There are no plans, the officials were
reported as saying, for exchange controls.
The government is also trying to assemble further international financial
support beyond the Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.5bn) pledged by the US and Canadian
governments.
One important question is whether Mr Jaime Serra Puche, finance minister,
who is widely considered to have handled the devaluation badly, will keep
his post. US bankers said it was important that there should be no change of
minister during the implementation of the plan.
At the close yesterday, the peso was trading at 5.6 to the US dollar, 8.2
per cent lower than Monday's close. Since December 19, the peso has lost 39
per cent against the dollar.
President Ernesto Zedillo plans to address the nation on Monday evening,
when he will explain the roots of the problem. Mr Zedillo will also outline
a plan to confront the crisis and to stabilise the economy. The president's
office cautioned that Mr Zedillo may not offer the complete details of a new
economic plan in his speech.
The main indicator of the Mexican stock market was down 2.81 per cent at the
close yesterday.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Yeltsin vows Chechnya victory: Russian president halts
Grozny bombing but says breakaway leader will be ousted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian president Boris Yeltsin promised a sceptical nation yesterday:
'Order and peace will be restored in Chechnya.' But he made clear that the
two-week war would not be halted until all Chechen units were disarmed and
the regime of General Dzhokar Dudayev, the region's leader, replaced.
In a 30-minute televised address, he softened the government's message by
calling a halt to the bombing raids on the Chechen capital, Grozny, and by
offering negotiations between senior Russian officials and leaders of the
breakaway republic.
Mr Yeltsin said some Chechen leaders understood that further resistance was
'senseless'. His promise of an end to the bombing was somewhat compromised
by a later announcement by the defence ministry, which claimed that the use
of laser-guided bombs would guarantee accuracy and avoid civilian
casualties.
The president's address, strongly and clearly delivered, was, in large part,
directed at the more than 10,000 Russian soldiers now fighting determined
resistance in Chechnya. The Russian army's leadership has been divided over
the campaign.
Mr Yeltsin said: 'You have a defined mission: to disarm the gangs of bandits
and secure the handing over or the destruction of their heavy weaponry. I
ask you to bend all of your efforts to fulfil the tasks assigned to you.'
Mr Yeltsin spoke distinctly and showed no signs of after-effects from a nose
operation that kept him in a Kremlin clinic for most of the early phase of
the conflict.
He made two brief swipes at the liberal politicians and the media opposed to
the war. He said that the former were serving their own ambitions and some
of the latter were funded by 'Chechen money'. He gave no details.
Nor did he comment on the more serious opposition to the war from some
senior military commanders including deputy defence ministers, now
reportedly under sentence of dismissal.
He said the republic, which proclaimed its independence at the end of 1991,
endangered the stability of Russia. Proclaiming that no region of Russia had
the right to secede, the president said that 'the longer the situation in
Chechnya continues, the greater the destructive effect' to Russia's
stability.
He sought to reassure the Chechens that the republic would be restored to
peace and to economic stability, but claimed that the Dudayev regime had
transformed Chechnya into a haven for arms traders and drug traffickers, and
that it had diverted state funds to buy arms.
He said leaders 'to whom the Chechen people are dear' must be brought into
the work of a future government of the republic, and that elections would be
held.
A three-man commission, composed of Mr Nikolai Yegorov, deputy premier for
nationalities, Mr Sergei Stepashin, head of the Federal Intelligence
Service, and General Anatoly Kvashnin, the officer commanding the Chechen
operation, had been empowered to open negotiations.
They are to be aided by a commission of parliamentary deputies from both
houses of parliament and a supervisory committee, including Chechen tribal
elders and religious figures.
In an effort to calm the fears of Russians worried by the effects of the war
on the political order and budget, he said: 'I want to assure all Russians -
do not worry. Order and peace will be restored to Chechnya. We will take
measures to avoid prolonging the search for a solution to this complex
problem.'

FT  28 DEC 94 / French suspend passenger links with Algeria: Security
shake-up in wake of hijacking to counter threat from Islamic militants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France yesterday suspended air and sea passenger links with Algeria, pending
new security measures to reduce the threat of attacks by Algerian Islamic
militants.
But it quickly set new security guidelines to allow French cargo ships to
continue to call at Algerian ports.
Four Islamic terrorists were killed on Monday when special forces stormed a
hijacked Air France airliner at Marseilles.
The terrorists, members of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), an organisation
opposed to the Algerian military-backed government, were protesting against
French support for the regime.
The hijack was the most dramatic action taken against foreigners by Algerian
Islamic militants. It raised fears that the violent conflict between the
militants and the Algerian government could spill into France and other
western countries.
Fears of further attacks were heightened by the news that three French
Catholic priests and one Belgian priest were killed in Algeria yesterday.
The deaths in Algeria took to 76 the number of foreigners killed in the
country since the GIA ordered all foreigners more than a year ago to leave
or face death. It also took to 25 the number of French people killed in
Algeria since the eruption of the civil war three years ago.
The conflict has escalated since the cancellation of elections in 1992 which
the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win.
Yesterday's deaths marred a triumph for Mr Edouard Balladur, the French
prime minister, who received praise from government and opposition
politicians and foreign governments for his handling of the hijacking.
His decision to order the successful rescue operation is seen as
strengthening his hand in presidential elections which are due in the
spring.
The tough action was supported by Mr Charles Pasqua, the hardline interior
minister and a potential prime ministerial candidate.
According to Mr Pasqua, there was evidence to suggest that the hijackers
were preparing a suicide mission over Paris.
He declined to give details, but passengers on the aircraft said the
hijackers had indicated they would crash into the French capital or explode
the aircraft overhead. Mr Bernard Kessedjian, France's ambassador to
Algiers, had been due to travel on the hijacked flight but brought his trip
forward.
Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, urged a democratic solution to
the crisis in Algeria and denied that Paris was backing the Algerian
government against its Islamic opponents. 'We are not backing a regime or a
government . . . the only side we are backing is that of democracy,' he
said.
Mr Juppe drew a pessimistic picture of the prospects for a resolution of the
conflict in the near future. 'I am convinced, unhappily, that the solution
to the Algerian drama is not close,' he told French radio.
Government officials said that a series of security measures were under
consideration to reduce the threat of attacks against French nationals and
businesses. Transport minister Bernard Bosson met heads of French transport
firms yesterday after Mr Balladur and other ministers held talks on how to
strengthen security.

FT  28 DEC 94 / Consumer gloom spreads to businesses claims IoD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'feel bad' factor among consumers that has been souring the UK economic
recovery may now be spreading to the business community.
The latest bi-monthly survey by the Institute of Directors, out yesterday,
showed that business confidence in the health of Britain's economy has
slipped in recent months, even though the City is forecasting steady growth
next year.
The findings, which come as Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, meets Mr
Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, for their monthly monetary
meeting today, highlight the obstacles the government may face next year in
convincing people that a stable recovery is under way.
The IoD survey showed business confidence at its lowest for two years. After
recent interest rate rises and Budget and political turmoil, the proportion
of directors who were optimistic about the economy fell to 38 per cent this
month from 43 per cent two months ago.
The fall occurred even though the IoD itself predicts steady growth for
Britain in 1995.
The prediction echoes a recent, separate survey of more than 40 economic
forecasters, which also expects healthy, industry-led expansion next year.
That survey, which is tracked by the Treasury, showed that most forecasters
expect growth of about 3.25 per cent in 1995, consistent with the Treasury's
own forecast. The underlying inflation rate is expected to be 2.9 per cent -
higher than the Treasury's forecast, but very low compared with the past two
decades.
The average consensus among the forecasters is that exports will grow by
between 6 per cent and 7 per cent next year, while imports will grow by only
5 per cent. The consumer sector, however, is expected to remain relatively
weak, underlining the export and industry-driven nature of the recovery.
City and independent forecasters expect consumer spending to grow on average
by only 2.3 per cent next year. Nevertheless, yesterday's IoD survey
suggested that rosy economic forecasts were viewed with caution by many
businessmen, not least because of recent splits in the government. Nearly
half those directors who were less confident about the economy than six
months ago cited political concerns as their key worry, the IoD said.
A separate report from the Incomes Data Services highlighted another
potential business worry. The survey of wage settlements showed that pay
rises have crept up over the past year, with most settlements between
October and December worth about 3 per cent. That is low compared with the
UK's recent economic experiences, but higher than the rate of inflation.

FT  24 DEC 94 / TV Highlights: Seasonal retrospectives heave into view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With its hunt meets, sporting fixtures and panto openings, Boxing Day is
traditionally frivolous, as opposed to the spirituality and gravitas we have
so far observed.
Watchable films start at 8.05am (BBC2) with Little Women, 1949 vintage, when
the young Elizabeth Taylor gave signs of becoming a delightful comic
actress.
Good films on all four main channels; my selection would include True Grit
(2.55pm, BBC1), veteran John Wayne and enchanting Kim Darby in the western
with the quaintly formal dialogue (and at least one pentameter worthy of the
Jacobeans: 'He never played me false until he killed me'); Valentino in The
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (3.25pm, C4); and Bergman and Peck as shrink
and possibly murderous patient in Hitchcock's Spellbound (12.30am, BBC1).
Pride of place goes to the posthumous premiere of the late Dennis Potter's
last completed work, Midnight Movie, a story of obsession and tortuous
longings.
I know Potter is canonised, but will this redeem his latterday tendency to
lugubrious self-indulgence?
And so to post-Boxing Day Tuesday.
BBC2 rather pusillanimously schedules Baa Baa Black Sheep for 3pm. Michael
Berkeley's opera blends an unhappy episode from Rudyard Kipling's childhood
with his later creations from The Jungle Book. Jonathan Moore's original
production for Opera North was highly praised. Barrie Gavin does it for
tele-vision.
Elsewhere seasonal retrospectives heave into view. Films of the Year
(10.50pm, BBC1) is for those who can stand Barry Norman's unremitting
autopilot chirpiness. Video Nation Review of the Year is much more
absorb-ing - all human life is there.
Talking of distinctions, the film alleged to have lost more money in America
than any other arrives on C4 when The Adventures of Baron Munchausen takes
the air - cast including Alison Steadman, Oliver Reed and an un-Faginesque
Jonathan Pryce.
And the originally derided but fascinatingly alive film of Othello, directed
by Orson Welles, surfaces in a restored version (C4, 10.35pm). Welles
himself plays the Moor to Michael MacLiammoir's Iago. Setting Roderigo's
murder in a Turkish bath was necessitated by the shoestring budget and lack
of costumes. Like much else in the film, it works brilliantly.

FT  24 DEC 94 / TV Highlights: Gee, thanks for some dismal schedules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apart from the token gestures of Midnight Mass (11.45pm, BBC1) and Carols
from Canterbury (11.20pm, ITV), the powers that be have shovelled together a
mixture of routine (Casualty, Birds of a Feather), mediocre old films and
mid-Atlantic tat for Christmas Eve on the cynical assumption that alcohol,
decorating or stocking-filling will keep the proles otherwise occupied. Why
waste quality on a combined Christmas Eve and Saturday?
Channel 4 sees fit to herald Christmas with both Eurotrash (11.05pm) and The
Word (2.20am). At least this is British garbage. Elsewhere the main concern
seems to be to reassure us that we are still the 51st state.
Fay Weldon's She Devil appears in its Hollywood guise (11.20pm, BBC2). Even
Dame Edna is promised 'from head to toe in stars and stripes' in that
traditional Yuletide venue, Hollywood, with such Christmassy figures as
Barry Manilow. BBC1 gives us the supremely irrelevant Michael Moore's TV
Nation (8.55pm) with such seasonal topics as law-breaking American firms and
where to send American troops in 1995, and Tony Bennett - Unplugged
(10.35pm, if anyone's interested).
ITV gives us - wait for it - Peter, Paul and Mary, followed by McCloud.
Channel 4 goes one better in obscurity with a stand-up comic in Chicago. Gee
thanks.
The dismal story continues on Christmas Day. Channel 4 does its own thing by
scheduling, against the Queen (3pm), the Rev Jesse Jackson, one hopes more
coherent than usual, sandwiched between two old Danny Kaye films. C4
highlights include a ghost story first shown on ITV, the artist formerly
known as Prince, and Harry Connick Jr (9.50pm), not to be confused with
Harry Connick Jr - a Profile which you may have caught on ITV at 5am if
roused by excited stocking-openers.
The hallucinatory nightmare quality of C4's programming may be alleviated,
or then again intensified, by the mad moonlit pentatonic cruelty of
Puccini's Turandot (3.15pm), in a San Francisco production designed by David
Hockney.
BBC2 remembers it is British and turns to the Royal Opera House for its
cultural offering, Verdi's Aida (7pm) in Elijah Moshinsky's production. The
Radio Times describes this as 'acclaimed', the use of which as a synonym for
'disastrous' is new to me.
ITV goes cutesy with seasonal editions of Blind Date and the 1960s policier,
Heartbeat, while American comic Robin Williams swims with 60 wild dolphins
(10pm). 'You could say you've achieved maximum mellowness,' he remarks. Of
all the things you could say in such circumstances that would be the last
one to occur to me.
Project X (9.45pm) portrays a US Air Force pilot teaching chimpanzees to
operate a flight simulator. I anticipate a sequel which shows them planning
Christmas television schedules.
Fair's fair, though: ITV does give us Kiri Te Kanawa and Co singing carols
in Coventry (11.15pm). Introduced by David Frost, but nothing's perfect.
BBC1 trumps the competition with comedy: a new series of One Foot in the
Grave begins at 9pm, with the rightly lauded Richard Wilson as cantankerous
Victor Meldrew and the insufficiently praised Annette Crosbie (his wife).
Victoria Wood: Live in Your Own Home (9.40pm) makes a double dose of bliss.
And I shall sneak a look at the compilation Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In
(6pm, BBC2) to see if it was as good as we thought at the time . . .
But for me Christmas Day's highlight is the riveting version of Dickens'
Hard Times (3.10pm, BBC2), with a sumptuous cast - Bob Peck, Alan Bates,
Harriet Walter, Bill Paterson, Richard E. Grant, Alex Jennings - that reads
like a roll-call of the profession's brightest and best. And it probably
cost a fraction of one episode of Martin Chuzzlewit.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Glossary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Discount: Investment trust shares traditionally sell for less than their
underlying asset value. The gap between the two is known as the discount. In
the 1974 bear market, discounts were as wide as 45 per cent and although
they have mainly narrowed to well under 10 per cent in recent years, they
add an additional uncertainty to investment trust share price prospects. The
sharp narrowing of the discount is another reason why investment trusts look
better than unit trusts on longer-term comparisons.
Peps: Some, but not all, unit and investment trusts can be put into a
general personal equity plan which shields investors against both income and
capital gains tax. The Pep rules are that you can put Pounds 6,000 into a
general Pep (and a further Pounds 3,000 into a single company Pep). To
qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 general Pep allowance, a minimum of 50 per
cent of a plan's assets must be held in European Union shares. A trust which
has more overseas investment, but is still 50 per cent invested in shares,
is non-qualifying and limited to a Pep content of Pounds 1,500.
Performance: Tables like these are full of traps for the unwary. Trap 1:
don't expect them to tell you which trusts will do best in future - they are
merely a historic record. Trap 2: don't make minute comparisons of unit and
investment trusts - the unit trust figures take account of the spread
between buying and selling prices; the investment trust ones take mid-market
prices in both cases. So comparisons flatter investment trusts.
Volatility: Shows the absolute variability of a trust's performance. As a
rule of thumb, the more volatile a fund's progress, the higher the return
investors demand from it to compensate for the additional risk. Unusually
volatile funds should be avoided by anyone investing over the short or
medium term or those who cannot afford big losses. But investors who can
afford to take a long-term view may want to have some high risk/high reward
trusts in their portfolio to spice it up.
Yield: Even this has traps for the unwary. Most unit trusts charge their
management expenses against income, so the yield is net of expenses. But a
recent rule change means that trusts are allowed to charge some or all of
their management expenses to capital, thus inflating the yield. Our managed
funds pages identifies those trusts which charge to capital. Investment
trusts used all to charge expenses against income, but some now charge some
against capital.
Split capital trusts: Caveat emptor. If you do not already know what they
are, you would probably be wiser to avoid them. They are companies with more
than one class of share capital. The traditional variety is relatively
simple: income shares get all the income; capital shares get any capital
growth over the life of the trust. But nowadays splits are highly complex
with several different types of security with differing rights, and aimed to
satisfy different investment needs.

Norway's finance ministry tried to tamper with an investigation into alleged
tax violations by central bank governor Mr Torstein Moland, a key official
said yesterday. Mr Jan Gotaas, head of the Oslo Tax Board overseeing the
investigation, said a finance ministry official had attempted to change the
way Mr Moland and others were being examined for allegedly breaking tax
laws. 'I know this from good and reliable sources,' Mr Gotaas, also a
justice ministry official and a member of prime minister Mrs Gro Harlem
Brundtland's Labour party, told Reuters. Mrs Brundtland's government
survived a no-confidence vote last May after the opposition attacked its
choice of Mr Moland.
Tax directorate official Ms Ingrid Tveit yesterday dismissed Mr Gotaas'
remarks, saying he had misunderstood a report.
The Oslo Tax Directorate is probing the role of Mr Moland and 148 others in
K/S Airbus A320, a limited partnership founded in 1990 for financing
aircraft purchases. At issue in Mr Moland's case is whether he knew that a
stake he held in the partnership was subject to a repurchase agreement at
the time he bought it and thus did not qualify for tax breaks. Mr Moland,
who has denied wrongdoing, invested NKr75,000 (Pounds 7,000) in the project,
claimed tax breaks and sold in 1991.

FT  24 DEC 94 / World News in Brief: Takeover activity drives London market
up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The driving forces behind the London stock market this week have been the
agreed bid for Portals, the security paper manufacturer, from De La Rue, and
the Trafalgar House bid for Northern Electric, which triggered a wave of
takeover speculation throughout the utilities areas. The FT-SE 100 index
ended the day 8.3 points off at 3,083.4, its first decline in six trading
sessions, but remained 69.8 points, or 2.3 per cent, higher on the week.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Private View: 'Oh no, it wasn't like that at all . . .' -
Snow White, alive and well in the Black Forest, tells Christian Tyler how
her life has been misrepresented by Disney and the press
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Following the princess's instructions, I crossed the Rhine at Strasbourg and
drove south down the E35 Autobahn. After 30kms or so I turned the car's nose
towards the distant hills of the Black Forest, still shrouded in morning
mist.
For half an hour I motored through a picture-book landscape of sloping
pastures and timbered farmhouses with overhanging eaves and elaborately
carved balconies.
'Follow the signs to Willingen,' she had said. 'You'll find us on the edge
of the woods above . . .'(she named a village, begging me not to reveal it).
'Take care on the bends,' she added. 'I dented the BMW coming up the other
day.'
The woods in the little valley had been cut back to make room for a cluster
of what looked like municipal starter-homes. But the cottage beyond them was
instantly recognisable, even though the turf had gone from over the porch
and the facade had been rendered in pebble-dash. There was a burglar alarm
above the mullioned window.
I crossed the stream and parked beside a pink glass-fibre flamingo which
stared into an ornamental pond. A modern extension projected into the back
yard where a circular clothes-line swayed under the weight of many small
garments.
Having heard the scrunch of tyres on gravel, the princess was waiting at the
door. She was thick-set to the point of plumpness and her hair was grey. But
her movements were graceful and her manner was confident. Behind the
old-lady spectacles, the beautiful eyes were wide and candid; her
complexion, the legendary complexion, looked as smooth as a girl's.
'Come in, come in,' she said gaily. I ducked and entered the poky front
room, startled to see how little it had changed. There were knick-knacks on
the mantelpiece, an oil cloth on the table and a television and video
recorder tucked discreetly under the staircase. For the rest, the place was
defiantly antique, as if the world had not moved in 57 years.
The princess made coffee and I came quickly to the point. Have you seen the
video that Disney has just released, I asked.
'We thought it charming,' she replied, 'quite charming. But not very
accurate.' She sighed and smiled in the same breath.
What vexed her most, strangely enough, was the film's treatment of her
stepmother, the wicked queen. 'You know, I am certain she never meant to
harm me,' the princess declared firmly. 'She was jealous, of course, of
Papa's affection and she did behave very badly. But it was me who decided to
run away from home. I was rather naive in those days,' she added with a
coquettish glance.
What about the disguise, I said, and the poisoned apple?
The princess laughed. 'Oh, the pedlar outfit wasn't any sort of disguise.
She was frightened of meeting the boys, that's all. But she wanted to see if
I was all right and she brought me a few little things: some pink laces, and
a comb - and the apple.'
Which nearly killed you.
'Well, yes. But it could have been something else I'd eaten.'
According to the original story, I said, your stepmother was invited to the
wedding, was given a pair of red-hot shoes and made to dance until she
dropped.
'Good gracious, no]' exclaimed the princess. 'Really, one can't believe
anything one reads in the papers these days. People are not as horrid in
real life as you people seem to imagine.' I was stung by the rebuke, but
forbore to quote my impeccable source. 'No,' she continued, 'mother did
rather overdo things - she loved parties, of course - and she put her back
out, poor thing. She died not so long ago: a choking fit, the doctor said.'
This was disappointing news. I began to wonder if my journey had been a
mistake.
Princess, I said, you are called 'Snow White', aren't you?
'Well, it is something similar. Schneewitchen is what darling Papa used to
call me.'
What is your real name?
The princess looked prim. 'I think I should not answer that,' she said.
I asked her about the seven dwarfs and her countenance softened once more.
The 'film people' had taken liberties with their characters and names, she
said. I thought it wise not to repeat some of the names the Disney studio
first came up with: Flabby, Goopy, Gabby, Nifty, Jumpy and Awful.
'The boys were rather hurt, because they were never so untidy or
ill-mannered as they were made out to be. But I think they saw the funny
side.'
The gold mine (it is a diamond mine in the film) had been closed by the
owners, she explained, and 'the boys' had been offered redundancy cheques.
They had formed a workers' co-operative and with help from the bank had
continued mining until the better seams were exhausted. The bank refused,
however, to put up the investment needed to open new galleries.
So what do they do now?
It was a story which has become familiar all over Europe. The one we know as
'Doc' had taken up medicine and was running a successful practice in a
village near Schonwald. 'Happy' had a public relations job with the Black
Forest tourist board, while 'Sneezy' had moved to Basel where he tested
anti-histamines for a well-known pharmaceutical company.
As for 'Grumpy' ('not Grumpy, please, he is a sensitive person'), he owned a
woodworking studio nearby where he and a couple of apprentices turned out
high-quality souvenirs - rustic chairs, cuckoo clocks and so forth - for the
summer tourist trade. Every Sunday he played the church organ.
Less fortunate were 'Bashful' and 'Sleepy'. Officially unemployed, they made
a modest living as local handymen and landscape gardeners. They were the
only two who still lived permanently at the cottage.
'There is a little money left over from the mine and I help when I can. So
you cannot say any one of us is badly off,' the princess said.
I coughed apprehensively and asked about 'Dopey'.
Snow White clapped her hands. 'You would never guess, now, would you? Go on,
guess]'
I scrabbled for an answer that would sound neither offensive nor yet
unrealistic.
The princess laughed triumphantly: 'A computer programmer - in Stuttgart]'
So it is just the three of you living here now?
'What do you mean?'
I shifted uneasily, uncertain how I was to introduce the topic. I mean, I
said, after you and the prince, er. . .went your separate ways.
'You have been misled,' said Snow White, and her eyes flashed. 'Where do you
get such information? Well, really]'
So it's not true?
'Of course it's not true] We live very happily, always at the Schloss, and I
come over here as often as I can to keep an eye on things.'
I'm sorry, I said. It's just that I read. . .
'I shall forgive you. It is no secret that Karl can be a little. .
.difficult sometimes, especially now that he has retired from the bank. But
then so can I. We are none of us getting any younger. I should say we are
still very much in love.'
You didn't know each other very well before you married. . .
'No we didn't, not at all. It was love at first sight, everyone knows that.
It may not be fashionable to marry so quickly these days,' she continued,
her lips pursed. 'I notice also it is not so fashionable to learn good
manners at table. That does not make it wrong.'
At the end of the film, I said, he carries you off on his horse towards a
fantastic castle. Was that Neuschwanstein, which mad Ludwig II of Bavaria
built?
'That's right. Karl was a little naughty, pretending to me to own such a
place. I think it was because he loved me and wanted to make a big
impression. He had only rented it for the wedding and the reception, and of
course our first night.' Snow White looked down demurely.
Millions of people all over the world feel nostalgia about your story, I
said, especially at Christmas. Do you feel nostalgia too?
'About the big forest, I do. Oh, and for the little animals, which were so
tame and so sweet. They are too afraid to visit us now.'
Do you have any regrets?
'I was lucky to be born as I was, and I had some bad things happen, too. But
no. The world has changed very much, of course, but in so many ways it is
better.'
She waved her hand round the room. 'What use is regret? We have money
enough, we play and sing, we have our jokes. And we shall all be here
together for Christmas. Look, I am making a special pudding.'
How do you feel about the old days?
'You know, it is so long ago. For me it is like. . .like a fairy-tale.'
And you lived happily ever after?
'Well, why not?'

FT  24 DEC 94 / It's wonderful to blow your own trumpet: Critics of the
national lottery who decry its vulgarity are merely the latest in a long
line of British killjoys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sullied by scandal, battered by bungs and drowning in drugs and dirty money,
British sport reaches the end of a turbulent year determined to re-assert
its authority over the miscreants who have brought it such shame.
I quote from a national newspaper report: 'Liam Daish, the Birmingham
captain, has been suspended for impersonating Louis Armstrong while playing
a trumpet thrown to him by a fan during Saturday's 4-0 win at Chester.'
Now it is high time that the disgraceful practice of British footballers
impersonating famous jazz musicians was brought to the attention of the
authorities. Note, however, that the booking and subsequent suspension was
prompted, not by the playing of the trumpet per se, but for impersonating
Louis Armstrong.
The hapless Daish must now be sitting at home wondering glumly: could he
have got away with Dizzy Gillespie or Miles Davis? Was his impression
punished for being unconvincing?
What finally tested the patience of the referee? The arrogance of a
jumped-up, overpaid whipper-snapper crooning: 'Then I think to myself, what
a wonderful world]' into his face? Disrespectful or what? No wonder he saw
yellow.
The sad truth is that in sport, as in all sectors of British society, we
mistrust showmanship to such an extent that chastisement becomes a knee-jerk
response.
Poor Daish wanted to raise a few warm smiles on a cold afternoon, but
blowing your own, or even another person's, trumpet is simply not done.
Displays of originality, ostentatious eccentricity or unwarranted emotion
are still considered vulgar, pushy or self-seeking; admonishment is the
automatic antidote. We are simply not a showbiz kind of people.
That is only partly true, however. For every so often, an outbreak of mass
vulgarity occurs which sends the castigating classes reeling in
self-righteous fury; for it tells them that, deep down, we all want to break
out of the straitjacket of national temperament which so inhibits our every
move.
Such an analysis is the only way I can make sense of the utterly
disproportionate amount of invective spent on rubbishing the National
Lottery and the harmless little programme set up to announce its weekly
results.
This has been criticised, amid much wind-baggery about the BBC's national
mission to inform and the decline of civilised values, for being loud and
tacky, for pandering to people's worst instincts, for lacking
sophistication. What do these critics expect? Presenters dressed in Armani
suits, music by Philip Glass, and Joan Bakewell drawing the balls for George
Steiner to read out the numbers?
The programme is a scandal, they say, the lottery itself is a scandal, the
desire to win a grotesque amount of money is a scandal; and there we have
the nub of the matter.
It is no coincidence that these rabid exchanges have taken place during the
hysterical, over-consumptive month of December. Christmas is neither the
religious festival we think it ought to be, nor the mass celebration of
materialism we think, in our gloomy moments, it has become.
Christmas has come to symbolise the struggle within us between two worlds
which cannot be reconciled.
Those few moments on the BBC every Saturday evening, the crudest, most
potent glorification of get-rich-quick values yet devised in our country, do
more than prick at our consciences; they constitute a full-frontal assault,
a devastating reminder of the struggle we all face in balancing the worldly
and the holy.
To mount this assault in the run-up to Christmas was asking for trouble; it
must have been obvious that, not liking the message, we would turn on the
messengers.
So the poor old BBC gets it in the neck because, while we spend most of our
lives trying to swell our coffers with the least possible effort, that
couple of minutes it takes to pick those balls out strikes us as indecently
hasty.
Well, a pox on our hypocrisy. I love the lottery. I love dreaming about what
I would do if I won and I shall tune in without shame every week to see if I
am destined to be a future Mr X.
I love a world in which you can be just a few nail-biting seconds away from
an Pounds 18m fortune.
What a wonderful world]

FT  24 DEC 94 / All in the Mind: Alcohol goes straight to your ears - Andrew
Derrington on why drinking makes your head spin and affects your sense of
balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DERRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a scientific fact, confirmed at thousands of Christmas parties every
year, that drinking alcohol affects our balance. Observant drinkers will
note that alcohol induces a sensation of rotation, in a direction that
depends on the position of the head. If you drink heavy water instead of
alcohol the spin will reverse direction.
The explanation of this spinning sensation highlights the exquisite
sensitivity of the sensors and control circuits in the brain that enable us
to feel stable as we totter soberly about our daily business.
Three sources of information are used: accelerations of the head, detected
by the vestibular organ in the inner ear; movements of the neck and body,
signalled by the muscles and joints; and movements of the objects about us,
signalled by the visual system. Alcohol exerts its effect on the vestibular
organ.
Information from the different sources is rigorously cross-checked before it
reaches consciousness, and before we take corrective action.
Nodding or shaking our head causes violent acceleration signals from the
vestibular organ, but these are consistent with the signals from the neck,
so we feel stable. We hardly notice the movement.
We also move our eyes so that head movements do not generate visual signals.
We take for granted the speed and accuracy of the vestibulo-ocular reflex,
which controls these eye movements.
Any inaccuracy in the VOR shows up as an instability in the visual world. A
common example is the vertigo we experience when we change our spectacle
prescription.
Changing glasses changes the magnification of the eye, and hence the size of
the eye movement that perfectly compensates for a given head movement. As we
get used to the spectacles we adjust the VOR and the world becomes stable
again.
Because the input (head movement) and output (eye movement) of the VOR can
be measured precisely, it is one of the best understood control systems in
the brain. But even now it holds surprises.
One of the latest is that the compensation for the visual distortion
produced by spectacles is learned and remembered. When we change spectacles
we adjust the VOR instantly. We can even learn to change the size of the VOR
depending on whether we look up or down to compensate for bifocals.
You can test your VOR by shaking your head rapidly from side to side while
reading this. You can see clearly while you shake or nod your head, but not
if you keep your head still and move the paper. When your head shakes, the
VOR moves your eyes at exactly the right velocity to keep them pointing in
the same direction in space. When you shake the paper, visually controlled
corrective eye movements are too slow to compensate.
Head rotation is detected by a part of the vestibular organ called the
semicircular canal, a loop of fluid-filled tubing embedded in the skull
bone. The tube is blocked by a barrier called the cupula. When the head
rotates in the plane of the canal the fluid tends to lag behind, pressing
against the cupula.
The pressure, detected by special neurones called hair cells, gives you the
signal that your head is spinning. We have three semi-circular canals on
each side of the head. Each is positioned to signal rotation in a different
direction. The VOR responds to rotation with an oscillating pattern of
eye-movements called nystagmus.
The eye moves in the opposite direction to the rotation at exactly the same
speed, and then flicks rapidly forwards. Nystagmus gives an exact indication
of the state of the VOR. The commonest clinical test of the VOR is ingenious
but crude. Syringing the ear with hot or cold water stimulates the
semi-circular canals by causing expansion or contraction of the fluid in
them. The 'caloric nystagmus' that results is easy to detect.
We used to think that caloric nystagmus was caused by convection currents,
but experiments on Skylab showed that this cannot be so. Caloric nystagmus
occurs in space, where there is no gravity to produce convection currents.
In contrast, although it has not been tested in space, the spinning
sensation induced by alcohol does depend on gravity. Otherwise, its
direction would not depend on the position of the head. Alcohol stimulates
the canal because alcohol in the bloodstream makes the cupula lighter than
the surrounding fluid, causing it to float.
The resulting upward pressure on the cupula is identical to that caused by
rotary acceleration of the head, and is interpreted as such by the brain.
Mixing two parts of heavy water with one part alcohol neutralises this.
Unfortunately, the high price of heavy water and the effects of alcohol on
the nervous system make this an unrealistic way of keeping a clear head.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Sport: Underdog that does not bite - Cricket / Simon Hughes
argues that Britain's teams can learn to stop losing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You would never know from the dreadful recent performances of some of
Britain's national teams that the British invented most of the world's main
sports. Between 1860 and 1885 the British codified almost two dozen games.
The country's diligent colonists launched them on the dirt tracks and dust
bowls of the Empire.
But now, in team sports at least, Britain teeters on the brink of a
precipice. Its footballers failed to reach the finals of the World Cup. In
hockey, cricket and rugby league, British teams are no match for the
Australians. The England cricket team on tour in Australia lost twice to
Australia's cricket academy and was beaten in a one-day international by the
part-timers from Zimbabwe last week.
In due course the dictionary writers might decide to list 'England Test
Collapse' as all one word. Whenever England's cricketers take the field,
they do so more in hope than expectation. They seem to be caught in the
downward spiral with the echo of a laughing Kangaroo in their ears. Losing
has become a cycle that is hard to reverse.
But it can be done. Australia suffered the same disease in the mid-1980s and
took action. It invested hugely in setting up the Australian Institute of
Sport, realising that sport had become a science. It established schools of
excellence, employed specialists and drilled home the ethic of winning even
in primary schools. Practice became fun rather than a chore and the Japanese
philosophy of Kai Zen (constant improvement) coursed through competitors
veins. As a result the familiar brawny bravado of Australian teams has been
replaced by clinical efficiency and a remorseless zeal.
'Winning is the science of being totally prepared,' said Dr Peter Terry, a
sports psychologist at the West London Institute. It is a message some
British teams are not heed-ing.
In sport boardrooms there are some dyed-in-the-wool attitudes among the
ageing policy makers. Other countries move forward, embracing new concepts
and approaches, Britain does not.
A strange gene in the British make up produces a distaste for striving too
hard - it is better to hold something back than go for broke. The absurd 'We
didn't need that in my day,' rejection of new methods is rolled out as a
reason to stick with the status quo.
Look at coaching. Keith Fletcher, a suburban personality whose lack of
adventure worked within the domesticity of county cricket, administered the
same inane warm-up routine for 99 consecutive days during England's tour of
the Caribbean last winter. During his reign England have won four Tests and
lost 13, but he will almost certainly see out the other half of his
five-year contract. The former England batsman Bob Woolmer, whose meticulous
preparation and brilliant man-management transformed Warwickshire, has been
lured to mastermind South Africa's re-emergence.
Dave Alred, an American football coach, helped the England rugby union
fly-half Rob Andrew to kicking perfection against Canada a fortnight ago,
but received the cold shoulder from Twickenham. Australia have hired him.
These sports are run by unwieldy committees made up largely of non-sportsmen
or people who played the game 20 years ago. They are out of touch. For the
last two months Ray Illingworth, the chairman of England's cricket
selectors, has not even been in the same hemisphere as the team. He says he
is in Bradford rather than Brisbane because of his restricted contract.
In the long term, reform has to start with school sport. In the short term,
Dr Terry has a few suggestions.
'You've got to create positive vibes, England prepared for the West Indies
tour by watching videos of a previous series when batsmen were ducking and
weaving and taking painful blows on the body. That put them immediately in a
tentative state of mind. I have encouraged players like Graham Gooch to look
at film of themselves dominating a particular opponent and they seem to have
found it helpful. I don't advocate abandoning traditional methods of
preparation, but you can always add to them.'
In cricket's old fashioned environment video analysis and psychological
enhancement are not seen as important. Dr Terry's official association with
England has ended.
The Australians use every trick at their disposal to undermine visitors.
Immediately before the first Test in Brisbane, England played in chilly
Tasmania. Their preparation for the one-day international series involved a
match on a cabbage patch in Canberra against a team of local civil servants.
Mike Atherton admitted he had not seen the itinerary before they left.
When touring teams visit England they receive cosy warm-up matches and a
conveniently planned fixture list. They are allowed into the nets at Lord's
before the England players. The British cosset opponents. This approach
percolates on to the field.
Recently, Nelson Mandela said: 'I was brought up in a British school and at
the time Britain was the home of everything that was the best in the world.'
Britain's sports have a glorious past. The trouble is, some of its sports
administrators are still living in it.

Sydney Harbour on Boxing Day will host the largest fleet of yachts ever
assembled for a long ocean race. With 380 boats, the entry for the 50th
running of the Sydney-Hobart classic is more than double the highest
previous entry. The previous biggest fleet in the Sydney-Hobart was a mere
179 yachts in 1985.
To cope with the number of competitors on the water, the race committee is
running four starts: the two groups of veteran yachts from 20 and 30 years
ago will leave the shelter of the Harbour 30 minutes before the traditional
1pm start. Heading the fleet will be 15 of the world's fastest and most
powerful maxi-yachts, their sights fixed on breaking the record for the
630-mile course and taking race sponsor Kodak's Pounds 50,000 prize.
'To collect the cash, the first yacht must cross the line before 3.36am on
December 29 to break Kialoa's 1975 record of two days 14 hours 36 minutes,'
said race chairman Bill Sherman of the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia.
Among those with the best chance is the British-owned Longobarda, 80ft long
and pride of City property man Mike Slade, but under charter for this race
to a Tasmanian syndicate called The Dairy Farmers. Chris Law, a regular at
the wheel of Longo-Bongo, will helm.
Alan Bond, the disgraced entrepreneur, is likely to be following the race
with interest. In 1989 he built a maxi named Drumbeat with the aim of
smashing Kialoa's record, but never managed it. Under her new name Congere,
the US-owned maxi is one of the favourites. However, she will have to get
past the Whitbread twins. New Zealand Endeavour, 1994 Whitbread race winner
in the maxi-class, and Yamaha, W60 winner, are competing. Both are designed
more for a marathon than a sprint but could do well.
Among the new yachts the 66ft pocket-maxi Exile is attracting most interest.
Designed by the Reichel / Pugh team which secured the 1992 America's Cup for
Bill Koch, Exile has a radical construction. Almost everything in the hull
and on deck is in carbon fibre, even the twin steering wheels and the
pedestal winches. The keel is of stainless steel and the towering
four-spreader mast of aluminium.
Owner Warwick Miller has been repaid well for his expense. On her first
outing in early December, Exile blitzed much bigger yachts and took line
honours in the Cruising Yacht Club's short ocean race.
When the first fleet sailed for Hobart in 1945, there were just nine
competing yachts. Two of these, Archina and Winston Churchill have been
completely refitted and will be racing again next week. The instigator and
winner of that first race was a British naval officer, Captain John
Illingworth. In his 36ft Rani, he took both line honours and first place on
corrected time. This feat was not equalled until 1972.
Britain's best year was undoubtedly 1969, in the 25th anniversary race. The
late Sir Max Aitken's boat Crusade was first to finish and took line
honours, a victory accorded some prominence in the Daily Express of the day.
Edward Heath, shortly to win the 1970 general election and become prime
minister, won on handicap at the helm of Morning Cloud. For three days they
had a dream ride down the coast, holding the same spinnaker for 67 hours.
Then came a savage storm that had Heath and crew desperately bailing with
buckets as the bilge pumps failed. Then came a nail-biting drifting finish
up the estuary into Hobart.
Morning Cloud was the last British yacht to win the Sydney-Hobart, although
four years ago there was a huge controversy when the Whitbread maxi Rothmans
was disqualified and lost the race after a row over sponsorship.
After a stormy and exhilarating ride across the Bass Strait, Rothmans,
skippered by Lawrie Smith had shredded several spinnakers and the only one
left intact was a small kite with the sponsor's logo prominent - against the
Sydney-Hobart rules to use. It was miles from land so there was no
promotional value in flying the sail and Smith warned the race committee by
radio that he was about to do so, but the breach was spotted by a
photographer in a press aircraft and the damage was done.
If records are to be broken this year, the fleet will need a north-easterly
breeze and come out of Sydney Heads under spinnaker, holding the kites for
the next 48 hours or more. It is a relatively rare weather pattern for New
South Wales, hence the longevity of Kialoa's record.
At least as likely is the famed 'southerly-buster', which produces big seas
in the formidable Bass Strait between the mainland and Tasmania and an
on-the-nose gale.
The other exquisite form of torture for competitors is the routine calms and
zephyrs in the sheltered estuary of the Derwent River which meanders nearly
20 miles from the open sea to Hobart. In many races, leaders have stormed to
the mouth of the Derwent and then crept up-river, being overtaken by
smaller, lighter rivals.

FT  24 DEC 94 / FT Ski Expedition: Snow gets in the way of skiing - Arnie
Wilson is halted by the Highway Patrol on Interstate 70
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are nearing the end of their attempt to ski
every day of 1994 on a round-the-world expedition. They are spending the
last few days of their odyssey in North America
There is still no let-up, even though it is Christmas. We faced a journey of
almost 1,000 miles to get from Crested Butte in Colorado to Jackson Hole in
Wyoming, where we started our journey almost a year ago. But we needed
somewhere to ski en route - hence the plan to visit a resort in Utah.
We chose Brian Head as our 'stepping stone' - a resort I had always wanted
to ski because of its unusual name. But 373 desolate miles after leaving
Crested Butte - the last 100 through the remote Fishlake National Park in
Utah's Rocky Mountains without a single sign of habitation, except for the
occasional deer - our route was barred by two Highway Patrol cars.
'We've had to shut the Interstate,' said one of the officers.
'The weather's really bad five miles ahead and there are 17 cars abandoned.
You'll have to find somewhere to spend the night here in Rich-field.'
And so our dash south to Brian Head was halted in its tracks. The local
paper, the Richfield Reaper, had a field day. Even in Utah, where they claim
to have the 'Greatest Snow On Earth', it is almost unheard of for Interstate
70 to close.
So we headed north instead, to Snow Basin, owned by Sun Valley, Idaho. It is
to be the venue for the men's downhill in 2002 if Salt Lake City at last
gets the Winter Olympics.
The omens were good when we arrived: Snow Basin's logo is almost identical
to that of Nottingham Forest, my favourite football team. And here was
Utah's legendary powder in abundance.
It had been snowing at Snow Basin for hours and now there was more than
enough - the resort could even have exported a few inches to the barren
slopes of Europe.
Meanwhile Crested Butte, our launching pad for this latest adventure, is no
longer the ghost town it was 40 years ago. Today, the old town - perhaps the
most quaint, colourful and higgledy-piggledy community in the Rockies -
attracts hordes of people by offering free skiing in the run-up to
Christmas.
With its legendary extreme-skiing terrain as well as benign family skiing,
it also attracts great skiers. Dave Swanwick the new world extreme skiing
champion, whose parents are both British, lives there, the Olympic
gold-medallist Bill Johnson is the resort's 'Ski Ambassador', and Martin
Bell, the British downhill racer is going to run a series of ski clinics
there next spring.
After the long drive north from Snow Basin, we finally approached Jackson
Hole and the twinkling fairy-lights of Teton Village below the huge monolith
of Rendezvous Mountain.
Here, our year-long odyssey had begun 350 days earlier, and we started to
feel a little emotional.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Success in seclusion - Mary
Bunter discovers a hotelier hidden in an Algarve almond grove
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARY BUNTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just look at that,' Bill Hawkins says, almost to himself, as we pull up in
the turning circle edged by fig trees and bougainvillaea which fronts his
country-house hotel in Portugal.
It is perhaps not surprising that he is still filled with pride each time he
arrives at the steps to the sprawling, gracious, 18th-century former
farmhouse billed as 'the Algarve's most picturesque hotel'.
It has been a 10-year uphill climb against soaring interest rates. He has
had little support from banks, whether in Portugal or in the UK, to achieve
his ambition of building a four-star establishment renowned for its cuisine.
Now the Monte do Casal, perched on a rise a mile or so from the village of
Estoi, attracts a following of holidaymakers who return year after year, and
sometimes two or three times a year, to enjoy the good life the hotel has to
offer.
Some 30 per cent of bookings are repeat visits, and many others stem from
personal recommendations.
The hotel is also featured in the Sovereign brochure, and now several other
holiday companies are interested in taking it on to their books.
'The only way you're going to succeed initially is by using a tour operator,
although you might not want to,' says Hawkins.
He arrived in the Algarve with his wife and two small children 10 years ago.
They bought the semi-restored house on a former 50-acre almond plantation
for an initial investment of Pounds 100,000 from family finances and a bank
loan, and started a decade of hard work.
The first year there were only seven rooms, three of which were suites. Year
three saw the bar and dining room constructed from the old coach house. By
the fifth year the hotel looked much as it does now.
On top of the purchase price, Hawkins spent Pounds 250,000 on renovation.
The money came mainly from ploughing profits back into the business.
Interest rates in Portugal were running at between 28 and 30 per cent while
Hawkins was developing the business and he found that neither British nor
Portuguese banks would accept the building as collateral.
The guests were, by comparison, easier to find. In 1984, Hawkins advertised
in British newspapers and soon the hotel was attracting people looking for
something a little different in the Algarve.
And different it is - most other hotels in the Algarve of comparable
standard have 200 beds or more. The Monte do Casal has 12, five of which are
suites with their own sitting rooms and French windows that open on to
private terraces where guests are served a leisurely breakfast.
Hawkins is not only the owner and host but head chef, too. He has come
through the rigours of training with the Savoy Group, including some time at
Claridge's. He has also worked in Bermuda, at the Reefs Hotel, and in
Switzerland, at the Hotel des Beques.
He cooks with the help of his Portuguese assistant chef six nights a week
and most lunchtimes, catering not only for the hotel guests but many outside
visitors as well.
It is a stressful existence which would not suit every would-be escapee from
the British rat-race.
'Coming to the Algarve was a real challenge. I wanted to develop my own
hotel from scratch, with a very individualistic, English country-house
feel,' said Hawkins. 'It must have worked - we had one couple come to stay
who had booked purely on the strength of a recommendation from other guests
at a dinner party.'
Monday is his day off - a time to play tennis with friends, or take a drive
along the coast for dinner at one of the picturesque establishments he
recommends to his clients.
At the Dom Joao restaurant in Fabrica, he is greeted as an old friend. He
asks what local fish is good on the menu in Portuguese - he has taught
himself the language. When it is time to leave, he wistfully promises the
owner that one day, they will go fishing together.
One casualty of the hard work and long hours involved in running the hotel
is Hawkins' marriage. His wife Carol, who previously ran the hotel with him,
is now back home in England with their two daughters.
Another could be the overexposure of this unspoilt area. The never-ending
stream of tourists needed to feed the business will inevitably contribute to
eroding the 'alternative Algarve' of which Hawkins is so fond.
Each new batch of guests at Monte do Casal is greeted by Hawkins on their
first morning. He presses a map of the area into their hands and gives
advice drawn from his personal experience on the most picturesque routes and
areas away from the crowds.
Most, if not all, of the hotel's rival establishments are the other side of
the notorious N125 highway which cuts through the Algarve.
It separates the concrete purgatory of its over-developed coastal tourist
developments from the unspoilt interior of cork trees and peasant farmers -
Hawkins' 'hidden Algarve'.
Running parallel to the N125 is a newly-built motorway, which in two years
will join the Algarve to Lisbon, opening the area further to tourism.
'Tourism has its downside. It can completely destroy the natural charm of an
area if development is allowed unchecked,' says Hawkins.
'But the Portuguese government seems to have learnt from earlier mistakes
and I'm hopeful the area will become more accessible while retaining its
character.'
In the meantime, with an annual turnover of Pounds 500,000 and an occupancy
rate of 80 per cent, his hotel has other, more pressing problems.
Each year in about December, Hawkins returns to England to interview staff
to replace those who inevitably move on in this peripatetic business. He
advertises in The Lady, looking for that certain something which will make
all the difference to British guests at Monte do Casal.
He says: 'It's very difficult, because the staff in a small hotel such as
this make or break the atmosphere. It's one of the trickier recipes'

FT  24 DEC 94 / Outdoors: A Volvo snow ride - Motoring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was proper Father Christmas country. The firs and birches hung heavily
with hoar frost. The surface was snow that had packed down into rutted ice.
In the day-long Arctic twilight, the main problem was deciding where the
snowbanks ended and the road began.
The big estate car I was driving through Sweden felt re-assuringly
sure-footed and could be persuaded easily to take bends sideways in a
spectacular-looking, but entirely controllable, four-wheel drift. It was
Volvo's latest 2.5-litre, six-cylinder 960 with five-speed manual
transmission, studded tyres, and a differential that locks automatically
when the rear wheels spin at low speeds on ice.
As I flung it around, I wondered what the average Volvo estate owner in
Britain would make of it all. Volvo estates are esteemed in the UK as family
hold-alls ideal for school runs and camping holidays - and by antique
dealers as the nearest thing to a van that is still a most comfortable car.
Motoring magazines - read mainly by enthusiasts who judge all cars by their
0-60mph (0-96kph) acceleration times - have poured scorn on the traditional,
rear-wheel driven Volvos. They are dismissed as unwieldy, boring machines
bought by the status-conscious and safety-obsessed.
I have never gone along with this. In the past 20 years, I have driven
Volvos extensively, from the 240 version onwards. Some trips involved
three-day, mid-winter journeys from the Gulf of Bothnia to Bodo in northern
Norway, or from southern Sweden to Kiruna, near Murmansk. Others were in
Britain, where the year-round hazards of heavy traffic are different.
In Arctic Scandinavia, you must keep your eyes peeled for reindeer emerging
from the forests and the flashing amber lights of a distant snow-plough.
Until the front-wheel driven 850 came along recently, Volvo cars have had
rear-wheel drive only - certainly, never four-wheel drive. In Britain, many
believe that front-wheel drive, with the engine's weight increasing
traction, is better for driving on snow and that, for serious snow of more
than an inch or two, four-wheel drive is essential.
Volvo disagrees. It says four-wheel drive has become a fad in the past
decade and that, in any case, it does not guarantee that a car will be free
from wheel-spin. To be totally effective, a 4x4 car must have locking or
power-distributing differentials on both axles.
According to Volvo, four-wheel drive justifies its extra weight, cost and
complication only when a car has to force its way over difficult terrain, or
has a very high power-to-weight ratio. Not having four-wheel drive in its
technological armoury, there could be an touch of special pleading in this.
But any 4x4 owner who has tried to get going on slightly sloping wet grass
or black ice will know what the company means.
The answer to safe driving on snow and ice is three-fold: the right kind of
tyres - ideally, fitted with studs; anti-lock brakes; and a differential
that locks on a rear-drive car, or allocates the engine power to the wheel
with most grip on a front-drive car. (Locking the differential on a
front-drive car would cause severe steering problems).
Winter tyres with treads that stay grippy at low temperatures are even
better when fitted with 100 or more studs which actually dig into the top
millimetre of an icy surface. The trouble is, they also dig into tarmac or
concrete and wear out roads. For this reason, Germany banned them years ago.
If you know you will be driving on snow for half the year, you fit a set of
studded tyres in October and hope to be able to take them off in April. This
would be a pointless expense in Britain where unstudded, all-season tyres
such as the Goodyear Vector, Vredestein Snowstar or Semperit Top-Grip SLG
are the best option; they combine the virtues of winter and summer tyres.
Before having fun on the closed tracks of the Arctic Driving Centre, I drove
one of Volvo's latest three-litre 960 saloons for 200km on roads that had
been snow-ploughed but otherwise left alone. With a self-locking
differential and automatic transmission in winter mode, it started in third
gear. Wheel-spin, even when pulling away on a slope, was minimal.
As it was the first time I had driven on hard-packed snow for a year, I took
no liberties. Not so on the way back from the centre. Having reminded myself
how stable and controllable a Volvo on studded tyres could be - even when
panic-braked - I drove as I would in a summer-tyred car on wet roads.
No, I promise there were no dramatic moments. Just a feeling that Britons
who drive Volvos - like most of those who drive Range Rovers - have
absolutely no idea how good they really are in the conditions for which they
were bred.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Property: Yours for a million
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'On the first day of Christmas my true love sent to me. . .'
Here is a list for dreamers. Ever thought what a Pounds 1m would buy in the
way of a home? Ever imagined that perfect house that you might, one day,
afford if you won the lottery?
You would be lucky to find someone on Christmas Eve duty in an estate
agent's office . . . but you never know, Christmas is a time when wishes are
sometimes made real. Here is a Pounds 1m property for each of the 12 days of
Christmas.
Christmas Day demands a family home big enough to hold all the relations
once a year. The 1847 red brick Bell Hall at Belbroughton, Worcs, is spot on
for price and size, and boasts a billiard room, a covered swimming pool, an
art gallery and a 12th century chapel for family carols. (John D Wood,
Oxford, 01865-311522).
Boxing Day needs a hunting and shooting property. For a change from the
Boxing Day meet in Bicester, Oxfordshire, try Virginia in the US. Ricochet,
near Charlottesville, has 292 acres of wood, pasture, creeks and springs,
stabling for eight, and views to the Blue Ridge mountains. A large log
cabin, dating from 1848, has been added to the house to create a family room
and new master bedroom. (Frank Hardy, Charlottesville, 001-804-296 0134,
Dollars 1.25m).
Day III. If the US is too distant and you want an English base, Pounds 1m
would buy the 15th century Upton Farm near Guildford, Surrey, with stables,
barn, fine gardens and a two-bedroom lodge with 11.5 acres, seven of them a
paddock. (Browns, Guildford, 01483-31166).
On Day IV your thoughts may turn to sunnier climes. A newly- built villa, at
Bar sur Loup in Provence, has a spectacular view over the Gorges du Loup
down to the sea, 15km away, and a pool so that you need not trek down to the
coast to swim. It is set in 2.5 acres of oaks and olives. (SPA Properties,
London, 071-483 0606, FFr8.5m.
Day V offers a piece of traditional France, the 12th, 15th and 17th century
Chateau du Belet in Perigord, beautifully restored by a Paris antiques
dealer.
Outbuildings include a dovecote, barn and lodge, and it has 112 acres with
the calme absolu that the Guide Michelin awards a rocking chair for. An
ideal base for degustation of truffles and foie gras. Some rooms are still
unrestored. (Philip Hawkes, Paris, 00331-42 68 11 11, FFr10m negotiable).
Day VI is for southern Africa, where a game lodge in Zimbabwe, with a
9,000-acre estate, costs precisely Pounds 1m. Elephants, lions, leopards and
cheetah await you. The lodge has five chalets. (Harrison &amp; Hine, London,
071-600 6660).
In many countries New Year's Eve is the night to play cards, which will tell
you your fortune for the coming year. If you are devoted to racehorses,
buying a stud could be a winning bet. Leading jockey Pat Eddery is selling
Barrettstown, near Aylesbury, Bucks, for Pounds 1m. It must be a good sign
that it is the birthplace of the first Pounds 1m yearling (Trojan Prince).
The farm has two cottages, a top quality yard and 72 acres of smartly railed
paddocks. There is outline planning permission for a large house. (John D
Wood, as above).
Celebrate New Year's Day with shopping and culture in New York. Beaney
Pearce in London offers three suggestions for apartments around the magic
million (sterling): 106 Central Park South, a big (2,800 sq ft)
seventh-floor, three-bedroom flat for Dollars 1.6m, or a two-bedroom
apartment on the 24th floor for Dollars 1.495m; and at 721 Fifth Avenue a
two-bedroom (1,500 sq ft) on the 48th floor for Dollars 1.5m. (071-589
1333).
On Day IX, whims may change. Your beloved may opt, instead, for a New
York-type experience in London. That is not so easy to find, but the
Manhattan Loft Corporation will come to the rescue, with four
penthouse-lofts in its Soho Lofts development in Wardour Street, W1. Each
penthouse has a curved roof on a steel frame. Prices range from Pounds
850,000 (1,850 sq ft) to Pounds 1.15m (2,400 sq ft). A Conran restaurant
will take the basement and ground floor of the building. (071-495 6707).
For Day X a Regency country house near the north Norfolk coast is the
suggestion. Savills in Norwich offers a long lease at Pounds 1m on
Sheringham Hall - a straightforward but handsome classic design by Humphry
Repton, built between 1812 and 1817. Six acres of gardens come with the
house, but the park and woods stay with the National Trust, which is the
freeholder. (01603-612211).
Day XI. Thoughts turn to a period house in the country. The Old Manor, at
Aldbourne, Wiltshire, built in 1740, could be the answer.
This long, symmetrical red brick house with a slate roof looks essence of
Georgian. Its surprise is on the garden side, where a columned conservatory
runs almost the length of the building. (Savills, London, 0171-499 8644,
offers over Pounds 1m).
Twelfth Night is the last day of Christmas cheer. Time to think of work
again. What is on offer at around Pounds 1m in London? Two possibilities, at
Pounds 1.1m each, are 1 Prince Albert Road, NW1, a Nash house overlooking
Regent's Park (John D Wood, St John's Wood, 071-722 5556), or 1-2 Connaught
Square, W2, interconnecting houses on the Hyde Park estate. (Parkways,
071-813 0022). Or for Pounds 995,000 consider the turn of the century red
brick 49 Bedford Gardens, W8, in Kensington between Campden Hill Road and
Kensington Church Street. (John D Wood, Kensington, 071-727 0705).

FT  24 DEC 94 / Travel: Woe to Joy as Japan falls to Schiller - Gerard Baker
tries to understand why Beethoven's Ninth Symphony takes such a firm grip on
the Japanese at this time of year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I caught the first few bars of the familiar tune one morning as I headed for
the subway station. 'Freude, schoner, Gotterfunken, Tochter aus Elysium . .
.'
Behind me, a beWalkmanned middle-aged Japanese gentleman was belting out
Schiller with more brio than I imagine even its author felt as he penned
those famous lines. There was nothing particularly unusual about the scene.
The socially-dependent Japanese escape into a kind of delinquent solipsism
when they slip on their headsets, and I knew well enough that they have a
strong penchant for western classical music (if you have ever heard Japanese
classical music you will probably know why).
But what I did not know then, and only later discovered, was that the early
morning chorister was probably preparing to take part in one of the oddest
of Japanese rituals. For every new year, in what can only be described as a
national mania, the country is completely hooked on Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony.
In late December and early January, hundreds of performances of the Choral
symphony, or the Daiku, meaning 'The Ninth', are held throughout Japan.
They range in skill level and sense of occasion - from the world's best
orchestras playing to packed houses in the costliest pieces of real estate
in the world, to desultory gatherings of the amateur, the tuneless and the
tone-deaf under the moonlight and the influence of drink in snowy mountain
villages.
This year more than 70 concerts are planned in Tokyo alone - and that is
just the official sort, for which enthusiasts pay up to Y150,000 (about
Pounds 950) per head.
Elsewhere, in the pretty joyless surroundings of Tokyo's concrete maze, the
amateurs hopefully intone the Ode to Joy.
Someone, somewhere, once estimated that up to one third of the entire
Japanese population - 40m - hear a rendition of the Daiku over the new year
period.
This might appear hard to fathom anywhere outside Japan. Cross-cultural
influences are limited and it is not easy to imagine a third of the
population of the US taking up sumo or 25m Germans putting in overtime at
the karaoke parlours.
But in Japan, a country hardly lacking in its own cultural heritage, the
capacity to absorb western influences seems limitless.
That capacity produces its nadir of poor taste in the Christmas season.
Although less than 2 per cent of the populace professes Christian belief,
the Japanese enter into the spirit of yuletide with all the enthusiasm of a
small child confronted with a pile of presents on Christmas morning, and
about the same degree of spiritual awareness.
From gaudy lights and carol muzak to pine trees (at Pounds 15 per foot
surely the most expensive bits of conifer anywhere in the world?) and
round-the-clock showings of Hollywood's most saccharine seasonal creations,
Japan enjoys a particularly noisome merry Christmas.
The Daiku fixation is the most extreme (and the least unappealing)
manifestation of that embrace of things western. For weeks beforehand,
singers brush up on their German pronunciation.
That is no easy task for most Japanese since the letter L defeats many of
them and German has far more vowel sounds, so phrases such as Flugel weilt
are rendered almost incomprehensible. Public radio stations help, though, by
providing weekly tuition from the middle of November on how to sing the
Daiku.
As with most traditions, no one seems to have the definitive explanation as
to how it started. Theories range from the implausible - German prisoners of
war in Japan (Japan?) in 1917 used to chant it on circuits of the compound -
to the improbable.
One theory has it that it was first performed by a German conductor on
contract to a Japanese orchestra during the second world war - a thesis that
leaves one with the unnerving thought that what is now the official anthem
of the European Union was once a kind of battle hymn of the Axis powers.
Mercifully, most experts think its provenance is more recent - its present
popularity is probably the result of a media embellishment in the early
1980s of an obscure rural tradition. But much harder to answer is the
question: why has it captured the imagination of a whole nation in such a
spectacular way?
The sophisticated view, to which many Japanese cling, is that the
combination of Schiller's words and Beethoven's music attests to earth's
beauty and the harmony of man and nature - subjects close to the hearts of
Japanese, appar-ently.
It was striking that at the official launch of the latest political party in
Japan - the Shinshinto, or New Frontier Party - earlier this month, the
Ninth was waved like a talisman, explicitly invoking a spirit of
co-operation and harmony otherwise noticeably lacking in the proceedings.
What better time for the nation to express that harmony than at the start of
a new year?
A more cynical explanation is that the chorale appeals to the basic Japanese
demand for uniformity. The need for thousands of people all to be doing
exactly the same thing at the same time is almost a model of Japanese
society at work.
There is as little scope for individuality in singing the Ode to Joy as
there is on the production line, the office, the home or the beer hall.
It is the musical expression of Japaneseness - perfect togetherness where,
even if someone departed from the lyrics, he would never be heard and would
be shamed back into conformity.
That might be a little unfair these days as Japan's confidence in its own
perpetual social cohesion is starting to shake a little. And maybe the
simplest theory, that it is just a good tune, and the Japanese have
excellent taste, is the correct one.
In any case, it beats getting drunk and offensive in London's Trafalgar
Square.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Travel: Cuba, cash-strapped and jerry-rigged - Nicholas
Woodsworth visits a small town where everyone lives in the past, and even
lighting the kitchen stove is a challenge

Is there any sense to the world of holiday travel? Not a great deal, I
decided as we banked in low over a palm-fringed coast and oohs and aahs of
anticipation rose from the throats of 200 French-Canadians.
Cuba is not for everyone, it seems - especially not for Cubans. In the last
few years the threat of imminent extinction - by sharks, by storms, by
shipwreck, by exposure or drowning - has done little to deter tens of
thousands of Cubans from hopping into flimsy rafts and paddling madly out to
sea, away from Cuba. One has to wonder what even greater threats at home
push them to so desperate a form of travel.
Or does one? No one aboard this Canadian holiday charter flight seemed to be
wondering at all. As we touched down on Cuban soil at Varadero airport, an
entire plane-load of rowdy pleasure-seekers broke into enthusiastic
applause. There were cheers and whistles all round. It was as if we were
arriving in the promised land.
A couple of days passed, and I began to realise that for recession-bitten,
snowbound Canadians, we indeed had. Varadero, Cuba's largest beach resort,
was everything their travel agents promised - the cheapest Caribbean package
holiday on offer. With the US market out of reach, Canadian budget tourists
are among Cuba's best customers.
What matter if Cuban tourism is ruled by institutionalised inefficiency, by
a sort of Manana-Marxism? What matter if the showers are temperamental, if
service is as slow as maple syrup in January? The rum is cheap, the white
sand beach is 20km long, and the winter sun shines with a kindness that can
make a grown Canadian cry.
I soon got the hankering to try a different kind of tourism. I am as fond of
sea and sun as anyone else, but quickly grew tired of the hotel
barbecue-and-cabaret-show atmosphere. How often can you listen to
'Guantanamera', after all, without feeling it is time to move on?
What about a little conventional tourism, I wondered, some sightseeing
around the island?
It seemed easy enough to arrange. There were car hire agents and travel
advisers sitting bored to tears behind hotel lobby desks. 'Take a jeep,'
they urged me, smiling reassurance and thrilled to have a customer. 'Visit
historic Trinidad.'
And so I did. It was not long, though, before I discovered that there is
little of the conventional about any holiday travel in Cuba.
*****
Why, I wondered as I barrelled along the Ocho Vias - the great eight-lane
motorway that cuts a swathe down the middle of the island - was mine the
only vehicle on the road? Was the highway closed? Had there been flash
floods, earthquakes, some other dreadful calamity? But no, I realised after
driving 100 more kilometres and spotting at least a dozen other vehicles -
this was just another day in cash-strapped, jerry-rigged, muddle-on Cuba.
Desertion by the former Soviet Union and four years of economic crisis has
left little transport in Cuba. There is not much petrol. There are few spare
parts, few private cars, few state trucks to get produce to the hungry
cities. Roadside hopefuls stand for hours flagging down anything on wheels.
Drivers resort to prayers, bits of old wire and constant roadside tinkering.
Not even the state itself, it appeared, was immune to breakdown - outside
Jaguey Grande, I passed two grey-uniformed policemen sweating under the hot
sun as they patiently pushed their little East German-built police car down
the road.
Near the town of Aguada de Pasajeros, I turned off the motorway towards the
sea. Some four hours away, at the foot of the Escambray hills, lay the
little town of Trinidad. If the Ochos Vias indicated Cuba's drift away from
the modern age, life along these smaller country roads seemed to presage its
return to a pre-industrial past.
Heading for sleepy, tin-roofed villages where nothing moved, paired bullocks
drew wooden carts along at infinitesimal speeds. By the roadside an unhusked
rice harvest lay drying in the sun. Egrets hunted for frogs at the edge of
sugar cane fields. Straw hats perched on their heads and machetes swinging
from their belts, men on horseback rode out of the towns to tend their crops
and herds of hump-backed Zebu cattle.
The whole perspective was so unhurried, so timeless and so close to the
margins of subsistence that were it not for the bright blue Caribbean nearby
I might have thought myself in one of the more forgotten corners of Africa.
The impression of a return to some sort of pre-consumer age only
strengthened as I drove along the cobbled streets on the outskirts of
Trinidad. 'Jabon] Jabon]' housewives appealed loudly to me from their front
doors. It is not only soap that has recently disappeared from their daily
lives; if rural Cubans eat better than the citizens of Havana, the
manufactured essentials of modern life - everything from shoes to light
bulbs to cooking pots - are often out of reach.
Half an hour later I was standing in Luz Garcia's kitchen while she made me
coffee. With the household rationed to just one small box of matches per
month, even lighting the stove to boil water had become an exercise in
ingenuity.
Beside the stove Senora Garcia kept a little metal dipper with a twist of
cotton at its end. To get a flame she removed it from the bottle of alcohol
in which it sat soaking and ran it lightly over the two exposed wires of a
live electrical cord. There was a short circuit, a crackle of sparks, and
suddenly, a flame.
The trick was not to short out the lights at the same time. The other trick,
of course, was to ensure there was a supply of cooking gas to ignite, no
mean feat in Cuba these days. In order to keep their household functioning,
the Garcia family scout out tourists like me. With the dollars earnt from
accommodation and meals, they are able to supply their more pressing needs.
The Garcia's house was a large, airy building with vastly high ceilings.
Need had transformed what had once been a courtyard rose garden into a
courtyard vegetable garden. But inside there were still intimations of a far
more opulent past. There were doors and furniture of cedarwood, coloured
glass windows, and large diamonds of black and white Italian marble on the
floor.
Everyone in Trinidad, said Senor Garcia, lives in the past. In their
determination to preserve their 16th-century Spanish colonial town,
residents here would not change a shutter or a tile.
It was not so surprising, he added. Trinidad looks back to the golden age
when slave labour and more than 50 sugar plantations brought vast wealth and
European sophistication to an isolated town. When mechanisation sent world
sugar prices plummeting in the 1850s, Trinidad's better-off citizens sailed
away and the town, cut off by the surrounding Escambray mountains, was left
to its memories.
It was untouched and forgotten for a century. The 1950s brought not only the
first road to the town, but Fidel Castro's revolution. So set in their ways
and ferociously resistant to change were Trinidadians by this time that many
took to the Escambray where they waged counter-revolution. They were wiped
out after a bitter five-year campaign, but Trinidad's conservative bent
remains.
And so a walk later that afternoon proved - the past was everywhere in
Trinidad's colonial churches, convents, towers, squares, courtyards and
cobbled streets. Each pastel-tinted house, with its wrought-iron window
grills, carved wooden beams and iron-studded doors was a small museum in
itself. A little treasure, the town has been declared a site of world
cultural heritage by Unesco.
But will the world come flocking to Trinidad on the strength of it? It
appeared unlikely to me that evening when I visited the town's most popular
watering-hole.
In La Canchanchara bar, the oldest building in town, normal service was held
up as local hotel, bar and restaurant workers met to thrash out problems.
There was no transport to the Escambray resort hotels high in the hills -
should employees hitchhike, apply for lorry transport, wait for Havana to do
something? The argument raged. In the end it appeared that bicycles were the
most realistic, if also the most exhausting option.
No sooner was a vote to be held on the matter than the room went pitch
black. Power failures in Trinidad are almost as common as cuts to the town's
water supply. The vote was summarily cancelled until the next meeting, and
the workers filed noisely out.
A candle and a drink were eventually found. I sat in the quiet meditating on
the day. The past was all very well, I thought, but in subtle doses. Cuba
seemed so far plunged into a confusing darkness that for the moment there
were few signs of where the future lay. I sat a few minutes more watching
bats swooping about the ceiling of La Canchanchara, then drained my glass
and felt my way back through cobbled streets to bed.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Travel: Christmas Krakow keeps the faith - Christian Tyler
absorbs history in a city where Christmas eve tradition includes church and
a family feast, yet Auschwitz is just a short taxi ride away
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER

<TEXT>
At 11.30pm an invisible hand unlocked the doors of St Mary's basilica on the
corner of Rynek Glowny, the market place which is the largest medieval
square in Poland.
By the time the Archbishop of Krakow and a dozen assistant priests had
mounted the high altar to celebrate midnight Mass there was standing room
only. Even after the chimes of midnight had rung, people continued to press
through the doors and into the throng.
The altar was scarcely less crowded than the nave. In the centre, surrounded
by acolytes, stood the archbishop, a white-haired, dignified figure who
looked too old to be successor to the last incumbent of the Krakow
episcopate - Karol Wojtyla, otherwise known as Pope John Paul II.
Lanterns radiated weak light, while the chains from which they hung
disappeared into the basilica's gloomy vault. In the dimness, all eyes were
drawn forward to the tableau vivant being enacted on the high altar where a
gilded reredos, 13 metres high, reflected the light of a thousand candles.
Polish Catholicism may be primitive, and the power of the Church may be
extraordinary in a post-communist country, but it has certainly guaranteed
the survival of the Christmas traditions which many westerners feel have
vanished from their own festival.
That afternoon there had been a double queue of last-minute customers in the
liquor store as the shops closed up and families retreated indoors for
wigilia, the Christmas eve celebration. Poles, it is well known, like to
drink; but they do not celebrate Christmas by getting legless and spewing in
the street. No doubt they spend more money than usual, but they do not
behave as if Christmas were the joyful summit of the retailing year.
It was dusk, about 4.30pm, when the waiter brought the bill for our
Christmas lunch. He had been smilingly solicitous all afternoon. Now he was
showing signs of distress, for he wanted to go home to his family.
The bill he laid amid the ruins of the feast had so many digits in it there
was hardly room on the paper. The majestic sum of 1,487,000.00 zlotys was in
reality a modest outlay for a west European. A six-course meal for three
people at the Wierzynek, the best-known restaurant in the city, including
vodka with the herring a la cracovienne, Ukrainian champagne to accompany
stuffed cabbage, soup, mushroom pierozki and breadcrumbed carp, cost less
than Pounds 50.
On Christmas Day, the streets of Krakow were deserted. In the country
suburbs, however, on the high banks of the river Vistula, families were out
walking. Many carried yew branches, or whole Christmas trees, which they
were taking to the cemeteries to lay on the graves of their dead. In the
church of one convent, a small boy stood in front of the crib, mesmerised by
a beautiful angel with blonde hair who waved a torch back and forth with her
clockwork arm.
Southern Poland was grey and drizzling. The snow which had whipped across
the German-Polish border and had been piled high in upper Silesia had now
petered out altogether. Even on the high Tatras, which stand like a rampart
100km south of Krakow, there was only the thinnest coating of white.
If this part of traditional Christmas was missing, it did not matter. The
old city centre of Krakow, formerly the royal capital, is one of the most
atmospheric in Europe.
Although the walls surrounding the 13th-century town were knocked down in
the early 19th century and the moat filled in to make gardens, the medieval
bones are clearly visible underneath their neo-classical facelift.
From the surviving barbican on the north-east side to Wawel Castle by the
Vistula on the south is a 10-minute walk with enough inside its 78 hectares
to occupy 10 days.
In the centre of the great square where traders sell flowers, cheap woollen
jumpers and fake caviar stands the colonnaded Cloth Hall. Its long arcade of
shops is a good place for Christmas presents: amber jewellery, embroidered
linen, carved wooden figures and boxes, fur caps and waistcoats. (All
Poland, of course, is selling Red Army surplus such as badges, caps,
binoculars, knives, bayonets and - under the counter - guns.)
Beside the Cloth Hall is the tower of the former town hall. Its main
surviving office is to house a good beer cellar with permissive opening
hours. On the western side is the Jagiellonian University, one of the oldest
in Europe, where Copernicus studied astronomy and the present Pope - who
apologised for the Roman Catholic church's anti-Copernican mistakes -
studied drama and literature. Leonardo da Vinci's 'Lady with an Ermine',
rated by some his finest portrait, is to be found in the Czartoryski museum.
At any time of year, Krakow is the obvious place from which to make the
pilgrimage to the former death camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau. If you have the
stomach for it, there is a lot to be said for hiring a taxi and going alone
in the cold, grey midwinter when the excursion coaches have departed.
Auschwitz I, a solidly-built pre-war army barracks, is where the exhibits
are laid out and the history explained. But to see the vast Birkenau camp
under a blood-red sunset and to stand by the twisted ruins of the gas
chamber-crematoria where more than a million Jews were exterminated is to
understand what is meant by 'the banality of evil' - industrialised mass
murder.
Steven Spielberg's film masterpiece, Schindler's List, has no doubt helped
put Krakow on the map. It was to Krakow that Oskar Schindler came to start
in the war supply business, here that the sack of the long-established
Jewish ghetto of Kazimierz (so horrifyingly depicted by Spielberg) occurred,
and close by that the Plaszow labour camp was set up. From its bland
modernised interior it is not obvious, however, that the large Cracovia
hotel, a few hundred yards from the city centre, was where Schindler is said
to have ingratiated himself with his Nazi protectors.
Yet Krakow is a rare example of a continental European city that shows no
wartime scars. Nor would the visitor guess that a few kilometres from the
centre is the vast steelworks of Nowa Huta, responsible for half the
country's output and most of the city's pollution.
The works was put there deliberately by the former communist government to
give bourgeois Krakow some appropriate proletarian balance. It has done no
damage to the spirit of the place - and especially not to the Christmas
spirit.
