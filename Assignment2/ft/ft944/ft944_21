Wednesday: The initial estimate of US GDP growth in the third quarter is
expected to be revised upwards, from 3.4 per cent to 3.5 per cent. A more
substantial upward revision would spark speculation about further interest
rate increases from the Federal Reserve.
Thursday: The purchasing managers' index is one of the month's earliest
economic indicators in both the UK and the US. The UK version should give a
further guide to the price pressures on the corporate sector; the Bank of
England has expressed concern that output price inflation might be passed
through to the High Street. Prices are also a concern in the US; in October,
the index's prices component was at its highest level since June 1988.
Friday: The increase in non-farm payroll employment has been one of the most
closely-watched US indicators. Last month, the figure which provoked
inflationary concern was a jump in average hourly earnings. A fall in the
unemployment rate from October's 5.8 per cent would also be seen as a sign
of future price pressures. UK official reserves are expected to have edged
up by Dollars 25m in November.

28 MONDAY
Norway on a knife-edge
The Norwegian government and its allies in business and industry hope to
pull off the surprise of the Nordic autumn by winning a Yes vote in the
country's referendum on joining the European Union. With Austria, Finland
and Sweden already having voted in favour of membership, Brussels is hoping
Norway will make it a clean sweep of the applicant countries.
Russian first deputy prime minister Oleg Soskovets visits Japan to sign
trade and investment accords designed to put some life back into economic
ties between the two states. Soskovets has said that 'political interests
should be set aside as a subject of negotiations' - meaning he does not want
to talk about the Kurile Islands, which Russia has had since the end of the
last war and which Japan wants back.
UK politics: The government could fall if a rebellion by Eurosceptics in the
ruling Conservative party forces a losing vote on increasing Britain's
European Union budget contribution. If that happens, the cabinet has pledged
to resign, precipitating a general election.
Mid-East peace: Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, meets Israeli foreign minister Shimon Peres in Brussels on the
eve of a critical two-day meeting of international aid donors.
European Union foreign ministers prepare in Brussels for the European
Council summit in Essen on December 9-10. Subjects include: Bosnia and a
strategy for enlargement to central and eastern Europe. A draft agreement of
Turkey's planned customs union with the EU, scheduled to take effect on
January 1 1996, will also be discussed.
Dry crossing:
The English High Court begins hearing a request from Eurotunnel, operator of
the Channel tunnel, for duty-free sales within the European Union to be
declared unlawful. Duty-free sales are not allowed on Eurostar trains
traversing the tunnel. Eurotunnel says present duty-free regulations give
ferries and airlines an unfair advantage and are a nonsense in the single
market.
Saleroom: A colourful landscape, Flower Garden, by the Austrian artist
Gustav Klimt is the highlight of Christies' auction of Impressionist and
Modern art in London tonight. Painted about 1906, it should top Pounds 4m.
FT Surveys: Pakistan and Energy Efficiency.
Holidays: Albania (Independence Proclamation Day), Panama.
29 TUESDAY
Britain awaits its Budget
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke (left) unveils his second Budget this afternoon
against an unusually favourable background of stronger than expected
economic growth and low inflation. In spite of the government's
unpopularity, the chancellor is expected to refrain from cutting taxes and
focus instead on cutting government expenditure and reducing the budget
deficit in 1995-96 and subsequent years.
It is thought likely that Clarke - a self styled 'son of the industrial
Midlands' - will act to help small businesses as part of a strategy for
sustained growth and low inflation.
Congress tackles Gatt: The US House of Representatives meets in a special
'lame duck' session to vote
for the implementing legislation giving approval for the Uruguay Round pact
agreed last December. Supporters say they may round up almost 300 votes,
well above the 218 that are needed for passage.
Then on Thursday, the Senate votes on the Uruguay Round legislation, which
needs 60 out of 100 votes to pass. It is expected to be close, although the
endorsement last week by Senate Republican leader Robert Dole should help to
carry the day.
Mid-East peace: Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation start talks
in Cairo on the next stage of
Palestinian self-rule: the redeployment of Israeli troops out of areas of
the West Bank that are still occupied, and the procedures for holding
national Palestinian elections.
After a recent upsurge in violence and tension between the PLO and its
Islamic opponents, Israel and the PLO are seeking ways of speeding
implementation of the peace accords which are running some 9 to 12 months
behind schedule.
Franco-German summit: Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois
Mitterrand will lead their respective delegations to the 64th Franco-German
summit, a two-day affair in Bonn.
Foreign, defence and economic ministers are among those who will be speaking
to each other about handing over the European Union presidency to France,
the European council in Essen in early December, and the forthcoming summit
of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to be held in
Budapest on December 5-6.
FT Surveys: Bristol and Global Custody.
Holidays: Albania (Liberation Day), Liberia.
30 WEDNESDAY
Ireland seeks a government
Ireland's parliament is due to reconvene to vote on a new government, after
the break-up two weeks ago of the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition and the
resignation of Albert Reynolds as prime minister. He has been replaced as
party leader by Bertie Ahern, the former finance minister, who hopes to
replace him as prime minister as well.
Italy's Berlusconi government will hold a crucial meeting with trade union
leaders. Its outcome will determine whether an eight-hour general strike
goes ahead on December 2. The strike has been called to protest against the
1995 budget and in particular plans to cut benefits in Italy's state
pensions system. The government is ready to make concessions but the unions
will keep everyone guessing until the last minute - not least those planning
to travel to Italy on Friday.
BCCI affair:
Creditors of the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International will be
watching carefully as a planned settlement put forward by the liquidators
Touche Ross goes before courts in Luxembourg. Further ratification of the
deal, based on a Dollars 1.8bn contribution from the government of Abu
Dhabi, is needed in London and the Cayman Islands. An earlier deal fell on
appeal in Luxembourg.
Asylum in Europe: Justice and home affairs ministers of the European Union
begin a two-day meeting in Brussels. They are expected to conclude two
agreements on asylum policy, on minimum procedural guarantees and a draft
model for bilateral readmission agreements with third countries.
There is some concern among human rights groups that the proposals fall
short of international standards.
Saleroom: Anything by Beatrix Potter, the children's book writer and
illustrator, is always much in demand and Sotheby's expects bids of up to
Pounds 4,000 for a fragment of a diary she kept in August 1905. It covers
her reaction to the death of her fiance and publisher Norman Warne from
leukaemia. A watercolour of Cinderella's coach (detail below) that she gave
to Warne on the day he proposed in July 1905 is expected to fetch about
Pounds 20,000.
Holidays: Philippines (Bonifacio Day).
1 THURSDAY
Nato ministers meet
Nato foreign ministers in Brussels confer in the shadow of mounting
US-European differences of policy on Bosnia, and arguments over how quickly
the alliance should expand eastwards (to Dec 2). The US is expected to press
for clearer and faster procedures for admitting members.
Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, addresses the Western European
Union in Paris. Kozyrev is expected to moot a new security order for Europe:
he has recently talked of 'surpassing' Nato and the CSCE in search of an
all-European group.
Mexico's president-elect Ernesto Zedillo starts a six-year term, continuing
the Institutional Revolutionary party's 66-year grip on the post. Zedillo's
inauguration speech will stress stable economic growth and political and
judicial reform as the theme of his presidency.
World Aids Day: The French government and World Health Organisation hold the
Paris Aids Summit - 42 countries are expected to attend.
Saleroom: The autograph of Schumann's Second Symphony is auctioned at
Sotheby's in London and may fetch Pounds 800,000 (Dollars 1.3m).

Holidays: Portugal (Independence Day).
2 FRIDAY
Strife in former Yugoslavia
Foreign ministers from the 'contact group' - consisting of the US, Russia,
the UK, France and Germany - try to reach agreement on how to promote a
peace settlement in Bosnia and if possible Croatia as well. The meeting
follows a warning from John Major, the UK prime minister, that the group
must intensify its efforts because time is running out.
Russia, in a sharp disagreement with the US, has warned against further use
of air power by Nato and blamed the Bosnian government for the latest
fighting.
Georgia's president Eduard Shevardnadze and rebel Abkhaz leader Vladislav
Ardzinba hold talks in Geneva with Boutros Boutros-Ghali, UN
secretary-general, and Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister.
Negotiations between officials in Geneva in November produced some progress
towards a political settlement, but none on the vexed issue of the return to
Abkhazia of 250,000 refugees.
Saleroom: Sotheby's in London offers for sale a letter written by
Alain-Fournier, author of the romantic novel Le Grand Meaulnes. It is the
only known letter written to his first love Yvonne, the inspiration for the
heroine of the same name in the novel. It is estimated up to Pounds 3,500
(Dollars 5,740).
Holidays: United Arab Emirates (National Day).
3-4 WEEKEND
Taiwan votes for governor
On Saturday, Taiwan holds for the first time popular elections for the
mayors of Taipei and Kaohsiung cities and the governor of Taiwan province,
the area outside the two biggest cities. The polls represent an important
step in the island's democratisation and are seen as a vote of confidence in
the ruling Kuomintang. They are also a gauge of public sentiment on
relations with China, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province.
Japan's Diet is scheduled to finish its extraordinary session on Saturday,
but it will probably be extended to ensure ratification of the Gatt Uruguay
Round agreements.
Northern Ireland's hardline Democratic Unionist Party holds its annual
conference in Dungannon on Saturday. Its leader, the Rev Ian Paisley, is
becoming increasingly isolated in opposing the Northern Ireland peace
process being orchestrated by the governments in London and Dublin.
The Swiss vote on Sunday on a law which would give the police powers to
detain foreigners indefinitely. Tourists need not worry, however. It is
aimed mainly at drug dealers who, once inside Switzerland, throw their
passports away and apply for asylum. Zurichers' patience with the open drug
scene seems to be running out.

FT  28 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: Gilt dealers looking for a tight Budget
 -Government bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At a time when children are busy compiling their wish-lists for Santa Claus,
gilt market participants have drawn up their own wish-list for Mr Kenneth
Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, ahead of tomorrow's UK Budget.
To be sure, gilt analysts' and traders' hopes for a market-friendly Budget,
containing spending cuts and a reduction in the public-sector borrowing
requirement (PSBR), are high.
'True to the gilt market's hair-shirt mentality, the feeling is: the tighter
the Budget, the better,' says Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi
International. 'Most people are looking for fairly severe fiscal tightening
on the tax and spending front.'
On the revenue side, the market is keen to see the tax increases announced
last year implemented in April. The planned measures include a cut in the
tax rate for married couples' allowances and mortgage interest relief to 15
per cent from 20 per cent, and an increase in the value-added tax on
household fuel and power to 17 1/2 per cent from 8 per cent.
Observers also hope Mr Clarke will rule out any tax cuts before spending and
government borrowing are brought further under control.
Meanwhile, the combination of faster economic growth and lower inflation are
likely to cause a drop in spending.
This summer, official PSBR forecasts for this year and next were cut by
Pounds 2bn on account of the rise in tax revenue following the economic
upswing.
Mr Ifty Islam, an economist at Merrill Lynch, estimates that the Treasury
will be able to cut the control total (public spending excluding cyclical
social security and debt interest payments) 'by at least a further Pounds
3bn this year and around Pounds 4bn in the financial year 1995 - 96 on the
back of reduced assumptions on inflation'.
In addition, there is widespread talk that a cut in the 'contingency
reserve' - a sort of war chest to cover unforeseen expenditures - could
sharply reduce government spending. The reserve has been set at Pounds 7bn
for 1995-96 and at Pounds 10.5bn for the following year.
Indeed, some argue that the reserve has outlived its usefulness and should
be abolished altogether, sending a clear warning to government departments
not to overshoot their spending limits.
Mr Simon Briscoe, an analyst at SG Warburg, favours such a move: 'When you
look at the record of the last few years, the extra money has rarely been
needed.'
Reducing or abolishing the reserve could take a large chunk out of the PSBR,
which would cheer the gilt market considerably.
As a result of spending cuts and rising tax revenue, the current year's PSBR
forecast, which was cut this summer to Pounds 36bn from the original Pounds
38bn, is expected to be revised downward further, some say as low as Pounds
31bn. The 1995-96 PSBR forecast is expected to be lowered to around Pounds
20bn from the current Pounds 28bn estimate.
Other specifically gilt-market related goodies might include an announcement
of a fully-fledged market for gilt repurchase agreements, or repos, and a
move to pay gilt coupons gross of withholding tax.
The two are closely linked, for many say that a move to gross dividend
payments would facilitate the establishment of an efficient repo market,
which in turn would boost market liquidity.
Gross coupon payments could also increase gilts' appeal to overseas
investors. Currently, only some gilts are issued free of tax to residents
abroad (Fotra); if non-residents buy non-Fotra gilts, they have to go
through a time-consuming procedure of reclaiming the 25 per cent withholding
tax.
A move to gross coupon payment would open up the whole market, rather than
just a segment of it, to overseas investors.
However, any promise to establish a repo market is unlikely to be translated
into immediate action. 'It would take some time - possibly up to a year -
until the market was operational,' says Mr Shepperd.
Any measures which will keep a lid on inflationary pressures will also be
warmly welcomed.
'The government should not shoot itself in the foot by raising taxes to such
an extent as to boost inflation,' warns Mr Briscoe.
Amid concerns over the inflationary effect of rising petrol duties, there
has been market talk that some normal increases in drinks duties may not be
implemented.
Although a tight Budget would favour gilts over the longer term, it may not
provide much near-term support.
In part, that's because much of the good news - if it materialises - has
already been priced into gilts, which have put on a strong performance in
recent weeks. Indeed, some warn that such a Budget could prompt a 'buy on
the rumour, sell on the news' response.
Moreover, the political risks attached to gilts will remain, even if - as
expected - Prime Minister John Major wins today's parliamentary vote over
higher contributions to the European Union. The December 7 gilt auction,
which was announced on Friday afternoon, is also likely to cap any
Budget-induced rally.
The biggest risk, however, would be if a tight Budget this year were seen as
a prelude to a loose one next year.
'If fiscal prudence is a tactical ploy to set up a pre-election windfall,
rather than a genuine long-term attempt to cut borrowing, the response is at
best going to be a half-hearted two cheers,' cautions Mr Shepperd.

<TEXT>
Can the Treasury bond market hang on to last week's gains in the face of
evidence that the US economy continues to grow strongly? The first test
comes later this week, with the National Association of Purchasing
Management index on Thursday and November employment figures on Friday.
An unexpectedly high NAPM reading a month ago set the stage for the Federal
Reserve's last interest rate rise. This month, the index is likely to match
or even exceed the 59.7 it hit then.
The real news, though, may not be in the headline number but in the prices
paid component of the index, where future inflation may lurk (this hit 79.9
in October and is expected to climb further).
Non-farm payroll growth, meanwhile, is generally expected to have jumped
again after October's brief lull, with job gains of 250,000 or more in
November.
These figures will be preceded on Wednesday by the third-quarter GDP report:
at anything from 3 to 3.4 per cent, the growth rate may have moderated from
the second quarter but is still above the Fed's target rate.
Of course, the bond market may shrug off such news, confirming a
newly-discovered confidence in the Fed's determination to stamp on
inflation. But that would represent a real change of heart from the rest of
this year.

<TEXT>
Weakness on the Tokyo stock market last week prompted hopes of lower
short-term interest rates and the 10-year benchmark bond fell almost 10
basis points to close at 4.64 per cent on Friday.
While the Bank of Japan is unlikely to lower short-term rates to support
share prices, further weakness in the stock market will boost confidence in
the bond market. Economic indicators this week should also reinforce the
view that bond yields have discounted too much of an economic rebound.
'Data released over the remaining weeks of 1994 will continue to bolster
market sentiment,' forecasts Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo. It notes that
yields in the secondary market on Industrial Bank of Japan debentures have
already started declining.
While industrial production figures for October, to be released on
Wednesday, may show a slight month-on-month rise, labour figures for the
same month and retail sales data from large stores, to be released on
Tuesday, are likely to indicate weak support for the economy by consumers.
The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged from September at 3
per cent, while retail sales are expected to fall by around 2.5 per cent.
The small enterprise index, which shows sentiment among small business
owners, is also expected to be weak.

FT  28 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: Borrowers cash in on tumbling prices -
Syndicated loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Underwriters for the jumbo Dollars 5bn loan for the Kingdom of Sweden should
be lined up this week, and the deal will then go out to syndication.
To judge by recent events in the syndicated loans market, it will receive an
enthusiastic response, even at the keen price of 8 basis points over London
interbank offered rate (Libor), and should be signed by Christmas.
Sweden is the latest beneficiary of tumbling prices in the lending market,
where margins have fallen by up to 50 per cent in the past year. It has
moved early to refinance two outstanding loans, both maturing next year and
costing 15 to 25 basis points over Libor.
Ms Christine Holm of the Swedish National Debt Office said: 'Pricing in
loans has come down and that on bonds has increased since the beginning of
the year. For us it is an excellent opportunity as it gives us cheaper
finance than we have outstanding.'
International borrowers are not alone in exploiting current low pricing.
East Midlands Electricity, the UK power utility, moved early and asked
Chemical Bank to arrange the refinancing for a loan maturing next September,
and obtained a price of 15 basis points over Libor for the Pounds 350m,
five-year deal.
Although the low price raised eyebrows in the syndicated loans market, in
the end the deal was oversubscribed but not increased.
Mrs Lesley Hamer, treasurer of East Midlands, said: 'We were oversubscribed
a fair amount and had to scale back. Obviously, there are banks prepared to
lend at that level, and we are very pleased with the group of banks we have
got.' She said there are 13 banks in the loan, 'three European, two US, and
eight Japanese'.
East Midlands may have set a benchmark with the deal, which replaced a loan
taken out at 15 basis points over Libor in September 1990, just days before
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait sent pricing up.
Intense competition among banks for assets has since driven pricing back
down, which in turn has sparked a rush to the loans market.
This has been charted by the Bank for International Settlements' latest
quarterly report on financial market trends*.
The BIS report details the seemingly inexorable rise of the syndicated loan.
While rising from Dollars 136.7bn in 1991 to Dollars 221bn in both 1992 and
1993 and Dollars 177.6bn in the first three-quarters of this year,
syndicated loans remain behind bonds but are increasing in popularity as
bond markets become more turbulent.
Globally, bond issuance remains larger than loans, with Dollars 333bn of
completed bond deals in 1992, Dollars 438bn in 1993 and Dollars 309.7bn in
the first nine months of this year.
More specifically, in the US and the UK, syndicated loans remain streets
ahead of bonds. The total of international bonds by UK and US issuers was
the equivalent of Dollars 53bn in 1992, Dollars 59bn in 1993 and Dollars
51.8bn for the first three-quarters of this year. In the US and the UK,
loans were the equivalent of Dollars 117bn in 1992, Dollars 105bn in all of
1993 and rose to Dollars 121.5bn in the first three-quarters of 1994.
The increasing popularity of loans stems partly from the fall in the price
of bonds and the consequent rise in the interest paid on them, or their
yields. Earlier this year, Lloyds Bank brought a loan to the market for 3i,
the UK investment group, at close to the pricing of 3i sterling bond issues.
As well as low pricing, borrowers are also attracted by the flexibility of
loans.
Much of the financing for the Foinaven oilfield in the Atlantic off the
Shetland and Orkney islands will be arranged through a Dollars 250m
syndicated loan, being arranged by Chase and Chemical Bank, which have
agreed to underwrite it.
The loan will finance the production of a floating production, storage and
offloading (FPSO) system. Bankers met on Thursday to discuss the loan, which
is expected to be for seven years priced at some 100 basis points over
Libor.
Mr Kaare Gisvold, president of Golar-Nor, the Norwegian company behind the
FPSO, said: 'Apart from pricing, it is flexibility that makes bank funding
more attractive for this kind of thing.'
However, when it comes to choice between a bond and a syndicated loan,
pricing is undoubtedly behind the return to favour of lending.
One driving force behind the fall in pricing is the presence in the market
of Japanese banks, which have turned aggressively to overseas lending in the
face of a weak domestic market.
It may be no coincidence that eight Japanese banks are in the syndicate that
provided the keenly-priced loan to East Midlands but to judge from the
current crop of bank results from Tokyo, Japanese banks seem to be enduring
a grim period.
Rival syndicated loans teams may be searching Japanese banks' accounts for
signs that trouble at home will lead to less of an appetite for foreign
adventures. Whether company treasurers will take the same attitude is
debatable.

All eyes in the gilts market will be on Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
as he delivers the Budget tomorrow. Most budgets have a theme, such as Mr
John Major's 'Budget for savers' in 1990, and this year's effort looks
likely to to be, whether or not it is spelt out in public, a budget for
gilts.
The chancellor is expected to take the benefit of reduced public spending
totals, the result of lower inflation and higher growth, in the form of a
smaller public sector borrowing requirement.
Having thus pleased the gilts market, he can concentrate on pleasing the
electorate with tax cuts in his 1995 and 1996 Budgets.
The consensus forecast is that he will knock Pounds 5bn off the 1995 - 96
control total for public spending but Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond
research at Yamaichi International (Europe), thinks the cut could be Pounds
7bn.
The market is also expecting to see moves to allow an open repo market,
which would improve liquidity. One step which might be announced is that
income on gilts will be paid gross of tax in future.
Gilts have been buoyant in the run-up to the Budget and were boosted last
week as investors appeared to switch from shares to bonds in the face of
Wall Street's weakness. The Bank of England will hope the Budget is well
received; it is revealing details of its latest auction stock on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
The German bond market put on a show of strength last week after the more
favourable inflation figures and lower than expected money supply growth.
But some economists reckon this upturn was misplaced.
'We can detect precious little in the recent data that could serve as a
justification of the bond market rally these last days,' said Mr Adolf
Rosenstock at the Industrial Bank of Japan's Frankfurt office.
'We interpret it instead as a spill-over from the rally in the US bond
market, which we consider a bear market still.'
It came as no surprise that the Bundesbank left interest rates unchanged on
Thursday. The bank is waiting for a more marked slowdown in M3 growth and
inflation and stronger evidence of wage moderation before deciding whether
to opt for a final discount and Lombard rate cut in the present economic
cycle.
'The Bundesbank could have some reason to cut rates,' reckons Mr Norbert
Braem of Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Key interest rates have not reached the
lows seen in previous cycles.
'The Bundesbank will be ready to support the economy to some extent,' he
added. There is no reason for this now, he says, but there could be in 1995
if economic recovery stalls because of increased D-Mark strength or sluggish
private consumption.

MOSCOW
The Moscow Commodities Exchange plans to start trading rouble-denominated
white sugar futures today, Reuter reports.
Trading will be for standard one-tonne contracts with January the first
delivery month. There was no starting price set for the contract.
BAHRAIN
Bahrain plans to develop a bond market to provide financing for the
industrial sector.
Two companies have so far issued bonds this year. The bond market would
serve the region as part of overall plans to develop the exchange.
Other steps will include urging the private sector to set up new companies,
encouraging private companies to go public and speeding up the process for
cross-listing of companies.
The BSE will also encourage commercial banks to extend banking facilities to
share investment. An average of 6m shares worth BD2m (Dollars 5.3m) a week
are traded.
The volume of shares traded on the BSE dropped by 4.7 per cent in the first
half of 1994 to 155m shares worth Dollars 98.1m from 163m shares worth
Dollars 106.1m.
PERU
The Lima stock market has been rated by a World Bank study as the second
most profitable emerging market in the world between January and October,
rising by nearly 60 per cent in dollar terms.
Only the Brazilian stock market surpassed it, rising by 77.1 per cent in
dollar terms in the first 10 months.
The Lima stock market grew by 88.7 per cent in dollar terms in 1993 and
122.4 per cent in dollar terms in 1994, the World Bank added.

With the results season in its last week, and very few companies reporting,
investors will be focused on overseas stock market movements and the
currency market. A further fall in the yen could prompt further
profit-taking by overseas investors, depressing the Nikkei index, while
traders expect buying of shares to be limited to public postal and welfare
funds.

The market is set for another week dancing to the US tune, where the
overnight sell-offs on Wall Street sent the Hang Seng index plunging last
Tuesday and Wednesday and left the market 8.2 per cent down on the week,
writes Louise Lucas.
US data will be keenly scrutinised by Hong Kong investors for signals on the
strength of the US economy, and any leads that this will provide for bond
and equity markets.
Domestically, there is little expected this week to influence investors and
trading is likely to concentrate again on blue chips.
The property sector, under pressure since the local interest rate increase
the week before last, will continue to be viewed warily.

Analysts are looking for a stronger performance from equities, with support
coming from the bond market and further interest in cyclicals.
UBS expects that after last week's good figures from Thyssen and BASF, the
market will react positively to strong third-quarter figures from Bayer
today and Hoechst on Wednesday. This should raise interest not only in
chemicals but also in other cyclicals, such as capital goods.
October industrial production figures are due and James Capel says the
strength of orders in September points to a 0.5 per cent month-on-month
rise.

Norway goes to the polls today to decide on membership of the European
Union, but the market has its supporters, even if, as last week's
increasingly close polls suggested, the electorate rejects the idea. Goldman
Sachs forecasts that share prices could rise by 15 to 20 per cent in the
coming year, even with a 'no' vote.
'If Norway were to join the EU, we think the market could offer a somewhat
higher return of 20 to 25 per cent,' the investment bank said. Its favoured
stocks include Norske Skog, Norsk Hydro, Bergesen, Kvaerner and Orkla.
'Given relatively strong fundamentals and attractive relative valuation, we
regard any significant downturn in the near future as a good buying
opportunity,' Goldman said. It based its stance on favourable macroeconomic
prospects and a strong earnings growth outlook.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dutch market, which had a difficult time at the start of last week under
Wall Street's influence, is expected to be a beneficiary of the Fed's rate
rise and the better than expected M3 figures.
On the corporate front, Nedlloyd's third-quarter figures are due Wednesday
and Amev's nine-month figures on Thursday.
Looking at the longer term, the Amsterdam market has been put on the
overweight list by European strategists at Merrill Lynch, which said that
relative to other European markets, p/e valuations appeared to be
attractive. Company earnings were seen to be growing strongly in 1994, and
there was no reason why this upward trend would not continue, especially as
inflation was forecast to remain 'subdued'.
However, Merrill warned, while there was nothing in particular to concern
investors there was also little to get excited about, and expectations of a
growth in earnings had largely been discounted.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Milan - Other Markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trade in Italian equity futures begins today but analysts expect the
contract to smoulder, rather than explode into life, on its debut. The
Fib-30 contract, based on Italy's 30 most traded stocks grouped in the
revamped Mib-30 index, is a vital weapon in Milan's battle to become a
thoroughly modern market and is expected to provide a welcome boost to
liquidity - eventually.
However, the anticipated benefits will be slow in arriving, due to a mix of
seasonal and technical factors, with a delay in moving stocks to cash
settlement likely to restrain the system's use.
One analyst said the contracts were arriving at a time when volumes on the
bourse were already very low.
Dealers added that many houses will not be able to use the new instruments,
even if they wanted to, with half of the 99 work stations requested expected
to be out of action today because full communications networks are not yet
in place.
Stock exchange officials have predicted that the contract will draw daily
trade of around L400bn, but most analysts said that was likely to be at the
top end of turnover in the opening weeks, with trade in the underlying
shares stumbling to just L353bn last Thursday.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Emerging Markets: Sterling the focus in budget week -
Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling will be a focus of market attention this week, with the political
tribulations of Mr John Major and the presentation of the 1995-96 budget on
Tuesday providing a focus for traders.
Although the chances of the government falling today over a vote of
confidence on the European Union finance bill appear remote, analysts say
that last week's row over the EU has placed a lid on sterling.
A further question mark hanging over the pound will only be removed on
Wednesday when it emerges whether or not Mr Major will face a leadership
challenge this year.
Tomorrow's budget is not expected to have much impact on sterling. Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is widely expected to announce a substantial
cut in spending totals, while maintaining revenue neutrality. Mr Neil
MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, said sterling appeared to be
comfortable in the DM2.40-45 bracket.
Two other political events which will occupy markets will be the outcome of
today's referendum in Norway on EU membership, and the ongoing tribulations
of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister.
Contrary to the position in Denmark, Sweden and Finland - which have all
voted in favour of EU membership - opinion polls in Norway have always shown
a majority of voters against the EU. Although the vote promises to be close,
analysts say the outcome may not have much bearing, other than in the short
term, on the krone.
Mr MacKinnon said volume analysis of Citibank clients suggested that most of
them anyway held long D-Mark positions against the krone, suggesting that
the downside from a No vote would be limited. A Yes vote might bring
short-term appreciation, but Mr MacKinnon said: 'As we saw in Sweden, a Yes
vote doesn't guarantee you currency appreciation.'
Last Friday, the lira hit a record low of L1,038.25 against the D-Mark.
Continued uncertainty about the future of Mr Berlusconi's government, and
the impact this will have on the budget, have led some analysts to predict
that the lira will weaken to L1,050 or, in extreme cases, to L1,100.
After the Thanksgiving break, dollar watchers will this week have some fresh
data to focus on, principally in the form of November's jobs report.
Sentiment towards the dollar has improved appreciably recently, but it is
sensitive to market perceptions about whether monetary policy is
sufficiently restrictive.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Shares likely to dance to Wall St tune - New
York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the blitzing it received in the wake of the Thanksgiving week massacre
on Wall Street, the UK equity market is in desperate need of a tonic. This
could come tomorrow when Mr Kenneth Clarke delivers his second Budget to the
House of Commons.
Only those fortunate (or in the current climate, unfortunate) enough to sit
around the Cabinet table in 10 Downing Street, plus a handful of Mr Clarke's
most trusted lieutenants, know the dark secrets of his red box.
However, if the FT-SE 100 is to make any worthwhile progress for the rest of
the year, there needs to be some good news in the budget. Indications to
date offer little comfort to the market. But the improving trend in public
finances could enable Mr Clarke to offer some good news on the public sector
borrowing requirement for 1995, which has recently been estimated at Pounds
23bn to Pounds 24bn.
One thing that would certainly upset the market would be any further
reduction in the tax credit on dividends paid to non-taxpayers such as
pension funds.
As UBS, the securities house, pointed out recently, a shift from the current
20 per cent to 15 per cent, for example, would lead to a fall in the FT-SE
of around 2 1/2 per cent. But UBS says changes in this area are much less
likely than a year ago and gives them only a 20 per cent chance of
occurring.
Given that most market strategists and economists are expecting a broadly
neutral Budget, it seems likely that the UK equity market will again dance
to Wall Street's tune.
After recent experience that could spell danger, Goldman Sachs strategist
Sushil Wadhwani points out that the recent weakness in global equity markets
largely derives from fears that the US economy may have a 'hard landing'. He
says the Fed is 'likely to remain aggressive' and expects a further
tightening of at least another 100 basis points between now and March,
warning also of the 'potential threat of mutual fund outflows'.
Mr John Reynolds, global strategist at NatWest Securities, warns that
'should the (US) rate rises currently implied in the futures markets become
reality, the outlook for global financial markets would look decidedly
uncomfortable'.
He says the futures market is already discounting a further 200 basis points
rise, but takes the view that the US economy 'is much closer to slower
growth than many believe'. Let us hope he is right.
The week brings a batch of important company results. A prop to a faltering
equity market recently has been the dividend flow. Dividends announced
recently mostly continue to surprise on the upside. One of the UK's biggest
water companies, Severn Trent reports this week and should easily achieve a
double-digit dividend increase.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Investors fear Fed-induced recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors this week will continue to wrestle with fears that the Federal
Reserve may induce recession through tighter and tighter monetary policy.
But economists do not expect a repeat of last week's severe falls as a good
deal of the worry about higher interest rates has been absorbed by the
market, at least for the moment. Such apprehensions could resurface,
however, if economic news this week continues to show strong inflationary
pressures in the economy.
Perhaps the most important piece of data will be Friday's employment
figures. A consensus of economists expects non-farm employment for November
to show an increase of about 225,000 jobs. If the figure is significantly
greater, it could ignite fears that the Fed will move sooner rather than
later to increase interest rates.
Investors will also get early indications of the strength of the economy
through a preliminary reading of the gross domestic product due out on
Wednesday and a report from the National Association of Purchasing Managers
on Thursday. Market-watchers will be looking for hints of consumer spending
habits during the holiday season, the strongest part of the year for
retailers.
Early in the week, investors will probably be looking for bargains amid the
rubble of last week's sell-off that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average
plunge more than 90 points last Tuesday, its biggest drop since last
February. That fall only compounded five days of losses, which saw the Dow
drop nearly 120 points overall even after a 33 point rebound on Friday.
The interest rate increases that battered the stock market had the opposite
effect on bonds, which rose last week in mirror image to the decline in
share prices.
Laszlo Birinyi, president of research firm Birinyi Associates, expects this
week's market to be steady, but somewhat lower as investors recover from
last week's slide. 'The history of these declines has been that once the
market stabilises and people realise that there was much more noise than
significance to them, they will be back.'
Ultimately, the Dow will return to the broad trading range it has maintained
for most of the year in the 3,800-point range, he says.
One indication that there could be a steadying of the market comes from
Friday's performance of cyclical stocks, which generally bear the brunt of
fears about recession. Those shares bounced up further than the Dow on
Friday, with Morgan Stanley's index of cyclical stocks up 1.13 per cent
compared with a 0.92 per cent increase in the Dow.
Other analysts are not so optimistic about stocks. Although hope remains for
a year-end rally, most are bearish about the general trend for the next few
months.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Israeli groups woo London and New York
investors - International offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The efforts of Israeli companies to raise capital from international
investors - highlighted by this week's roadshows for Tadiran, the
electronics concern - are poised to move into a higher gear.
Tadiran, one of more than a dozen technology or export-oriented Israeli
enterprises to come to the international markets in the last couple of
years, hopes to raise up to Dollars 80m through a simultaneous offer of
shares in New York and London, and a listing in Tel Aviv.
However, following progress this year towards a peace settlement in the
region, a wider range of Israeli companies are coming to the market seeking
to raise capital. Mr Niel Siebag-Montefiore, corporate finance director at
BZW, said recently that European institutional investors were increasingly
willing to buy Israeli stock.
'Three years ago, Israel was still a financial pariah in Europe but there
has been a huge change since and investors now accept Israel as just another
country suitable for foreign investment,' he said.
A banker with Lehman Brothers, which has been involved in 18 deals since
1991 and now has an office in Tel Aviv, says international investors have
begun to regard Israel as an emerging market.
At the same time, political progress should end Israel's international
isolation, opening up new markets for its exporters as well as closer
economic integration with its neighbours.
'Investors believe Israel will become a regional centre,' he says.
In total Israeli companies are expected to seek to raise up to Dollars 2bn
next year.
In the biggest deal, Bezeq, the state-owned telecommunications company, is
expected to sell 25 per cent of its shares to raise about Dollars 700m. The
offering, which will cut the government's stake to 51 per cent, will be made
in New York, London, Tel Aviv and possibly a market in the Far East. Morgan
Stanley has been appointed to advise on the sale.
The government also wants to sell 22 per cent of Israel Chemicals, the
country's leading chemical and fertiliser company, through a global offering
in February 1995. The sale will reduce the government stake to 28 per cent
and is expected be worth Dollars 190m. Wertheim Schroeder is advising on the
privatisation and Lehman Brothers will be the global co-ordinator.
A third serious candidate for privatisation by global offering in 1995 is El
Al, the state-owned airline. The government plans to sell 51 per cent of the
company worth Dollars 75m-Dollars 200m. BZW is expected to advise on the
sale.
Large private companies seeking a listing include Africa Israel, a leading
investment company with interests in property, insurance and tourism, which
plans to raise Dollars 150m - Dollars 200m in New York, London and
Frankfurt. Morgan Stanley has been appointed global co-ordinator.
Koor Industries, Israel's largest industrial group, expects to reduce its
holding in Tadiran to 52 per cent. In addition, Koor expects to offer a
large tranche of shares for sale on international markets by mid-1995. The
Histadrut, Israel's trades union federation, plans to sell the 22 per cent
stake in Koor owned by its Hevrat Haovidim holding company to repay heavy
debts.
Zim Israel Navigation, which ranks among the world's 10 largest container
shipping companies, also expects to make a global offering in 1995.
The government is also considering the possibility of selling shares in the
big two banks - Bank Hapoalim and Bank Leumi.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Emerging Markets: A surge of funds to eastern Europe - The
Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fund managers have in the past fortnight raised Dollars 300m for investment
in the emerging markets of eastern Europe in the largest burst of
fundraising since the fall of communism five years ago.
Shares in the Baring group's Dollars 180m First NIS Regional Fund and
Pictet's Dollars 56m First Russian Frontiers Trust begin trading this week.
Invesco's East Europe Development Fund has also tapped the markets, for a
Dollars 75m boost. Nor are the latest efforts the last: CS First Boston and
Edmond de Rothschild Securities are designing a Czech Value Fund to invest
in undervalued domestic Czech voucher funds.
And the regional and country funds are the most public face of portfolio
investment into eastern Europe. General emerging markets funds managed by
Templeton, Genesis, and others are also committing investment although they
make no disclosed allocation to the former communist bloc.
Even some hedge funds, burnt by the bond markets, are also turning for high
returns to east European investments. Quantum, the fund run by Mr George
Soros, the self-confessed speculator, bought a shareholding in Fotex, the
Hungarian retail company. Mr Soros, who has set up charitable foundations in
eastern Europe, recently put aside his concern about conflicts of interest
and allowed his funds to invest in the region.
Altogether the inflow of portfolio investment probably now exceeds that of
foreign direct investment. International investment banks like CS First
Boston have found to their surprise that securities trading that arises from
financial investment has rapidly overtaken fees earned from mergers and
acquisitions advice as a source of revenue.
This record burst of activity is all the more striking for its timing.
Rising interest rates have drawn investors out of equity and especially out
of marginal markets, which is what east European bourses still for the
moment remain.
The three established east European stock markets, Warsaw, Prague and
Budapest, are all down on their peaks earlier this year. The Prague index
fell 34 per cent between its introduction in April and October. Warsaw share
prices, which rose the fastest, have halved since March.
The two largest funds launched during eastern Europe's stock market boom,
CSFB's Dollars 200m Central European Growth Fund and Baring's Dollars 120m
Emerging Europe Trust, have both suffered declines in net asset value. They
fell victim, an emerging markets analyst says, to the general tendency for
managers to raise cash during a bull market and invest into the market as it
drops back.
Nor have funds with a longer track record all performed so much better. John
Govett's Hungarian Investment Company, which raised Dollars 100m in 1990,
now has a market capitalisation of Dollars 71.5m.
In as unpredictable a region as eastern Europe there is a resounding
investment success for every failure. Invesco's EEDF, headed by Mr Roy
Bracher, has shown compound annual growth in NAV per share of 41.5 per cent,
a far better record than any western investment fund.
Mr Bracher compares his approach with that of Warren Buffett, the legendary
US long-term investor. 'We invest in companies that we know and like,' he
says. Mr Bracher prefers low-tech industries like chocolate and ice-cream
making. EEDF leans towards unquoted investments and takes a relatively long
time horizon - two to five years.
The strategy, or at least EEDF's performance, was enough to persuade
investors to commit another Dollars 75m to the fund. It may also show
investors in general that it is possible to make money in eastern Europe.
Equity in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, also looks fundamentally
more attractive than it did. The price correction has killed the prospect of
dramatic and immediate capital gain, and has made fundamental value more
attractive. But, says Ms Nancy Curtin, head of emerging European investments
at Baring Asset Management: 'It has eradicated a lot of the frothiness in
the markets.'
But the strongest new draw of all is Russia. It is no accident that two of
the three new funds are aimed at the former Soviet Union, and EEDF also says
it sees good value in Russian companies.
The market has opened up tremendously in the past few months. Mass
privatisation has put about 80 per cent of the corporate sector into private
hands. Most of these companies are an investor's nightmare, but a few - like
Lukoil, the oil company, and Gazprom, the gas producer - are what one fund
manager calls 'world-class companies'.
Oil assets were privatised at about 4 US cents a barrel of proven reserves.
That measure has since tripled, but still stands far short of the Dollars 7
that a barrel of oil in the ground would cost if an investor bought a US oil
company. A telephone access line in Hungary, another former communist
country, commands a stock market valuation 10 times that of a Russian one.
Fund managers believe that is cheap, even after factoring in Russia's
particular risks - the sheer opacity of the companies and the burden upon
them of providing social services. 'All but nationalisation has been
discounted in these market values,' says Ms Curtin.
The fear of shares simply disappearing from registers and other horrors of
custody and settlement are enough to put off all but the hardiest or
foolhardiest of investors. One Russian investor recently accused an
aluminium company of erasing Dollars 300m worth of its shares.
But Chase Manhattan and other international banks are moving to set up
custodial services which at least approach the standards required by western
investors. Moreover, Mr Anatoly Chubais, the new deputy prime minister for
the economy, has put securities reform at the top of his agenda.
The discounts should narrow as custody and settlement improve, and Russia's
equity market emerges from its infancy. Emerging markets funds hope they
will gain as valuations in east and west converge.
But ease of investing is a mixed blessing for these specialist entities.
Their own backers are pension funds, unprepared or legally prohibited from
investing in markets without proper custody. Emerging markets funds are
indispensable intermediaries.
Already some of the largest Russian banks and natural resources extractors
like Gazprom, the gas company, are planning issues of global depository
receipts.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Markets: The point of maximum danger - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you take the word of 40 leading European industrialists, the region's
manufacturing companies are now at the 'point of maximum danger' in the
economic cycle. The report, prepared by the European Round Table ahead of
next month's European summit in Essen, also argues that it is an illusion to
believe that economic recovery signals an end to Europe's competitiveness
crisis.
The authors are right to draw that conclusion. Nine-month trading figures
from Bayer and Hoechst, the German chemical and drug giants, which are
expected today and Wednesday respectively, are likely to confirm many of the
points raised.
Pre-tax profits are expected to have rebounded from last year's depressed
levels, but margins in some product areas are expected to show the effects
of growing competition. In chemicals and petrochemicals in particular, the
breathing space which margins have enjoyed recently may be shortlived.
Competitors' new capacity which comes onstream shortly in Asia and America
is expected to increase competition both in those countries and within
Europe.
The authors are right to point out, too, that one of the threats to profits
is that wage settlements will edge upwards. They argue that at this stage in
the economic cycle manufacturers often 'let loose' on costs, especially
wages. Given the current backdrop of continent-wide industrial unrest,
investors would be wrong to dismiss that threat. The authors may, though,
make rather too much of this factor; it is too early to conclude from the
current disputes that Europe's historically rigid wage structures have
persisted through recession intact.
The report's gloominess about Europe's high costs of energy,
telecommunications and transport may also be warranted.
When such markets are deregulated, the reduction in costs can be rapid: the
liberalisation of European voice telephony, combined with privatisation of
many of the telecommunications operators, is a case in point.
Siemens, the German industrial group, says that European prices for
switching and transmission equipment have fallen in real terms by about 7
per cent in each of the last three years, and by even more in Germany. The
cause is partly recession and partly the increasingly open procurement
policies adopted by its customers, including Deutsche Telekom, Germany's
state-owned telecoms monopoly, whose privatisation is forthcoming.
But while companies across Europe will eventually benefit from lower
telephone charges, the liberalisation puts great pressure on the margins of
suppliers, such as Siemens. Last year it reported a fall in new orders, and
analysts are concerned that, despite spending 15 per cent of revenues in its
communications divisions on research and development, it will struggle to
hold margins and market share within Europe.
The paradox is that European companies want the benefits of liberalisation -
such as lower utility costs which will enable them to compete better abroad
 -but resent such measures when they stimulate competition on those
companies' home turf.
Similarly, while the 40 companies represented in the Round Table have called
for cuts in public spending, much of the European pharmaceutical industry
has been threatening governments that if public spending on drugs continues
to be squeezed, great damage will be done to research and development, and
so to the competitiveness of some of Europe's largest companies.
In some sectors, the opposition of Europe's largest companies to such
cost-reduction measures may stall them completely. Tomorrow's meeting in
Brussels of European Union energy ministers will serve to highlight the
obstacles to the Commission's drive to liberalise Europe's energy markets.
The proposals to allow rival energy companies access to countries' power
distribution networks has met with ferocious complaints from power
companies.
Given such opposition, investors may well be sceptical that European
institutions will in the end be willing to make the changes necessary for
competitiveness.
That should not, though, distract investors from concern they should also
feel about the prices paid for investments outside Europe. Not least,
European chemical and pharmaceutical companies have made a string of forays
in the past year into healthcare in the US, Asia and Eastern Europe.
Hoechst, for one, has spent heavily on moving into emerging east European
markets, and is negotiating several joint ventures in China. Mr Jurgen
Dormann, Hoechst's chairman, has said that he aims to double sales in Asia
to 20 per cent of group turnover.
But the concern for investors is whether that is an adequately profitable
escape from competition at home, given the ferocious competition already
present in non-European markets.
Mr Dormann acknowledged earlier this month that Hoechst had 'perhaps' paid
too high a premium in last year's Dollars 546m purchase of 51 per cent of
Copley, the US generic drugs maker. Moreover, despite Hoechst's anxiety to
add several more mid-sized pharmaceuticals companies to its
recently-acquired US interests in generic drugs, it says that it is waiting
until acquisition multiples become more reasonable.
It may have a long wait, however: there is little sign that they are doing
so. Meanwhile, as investors brace themselves to hear the price paid in the
sector's next takeover, they cannot afford to take too much comfort from the
recovery of core earnings. While this week's results should confirm that
picture, that is no guarantee that profit margins will be intact five years
from now.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Markets: Debate on Emu timing hots up - Economics Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European issues continue to fascinate and alarm. But while attention in the
UK has been focused on today's Commons debate over contributions to the
European Union budget and the British cabinet's 'suicide pact' to fend off
the threat of a backbench Tory revolt, discussion elsewhere in Europe has
shifted back to economic and monetary union.
Half-forgotten pledges in the Maastricht Treaty have gained a new lease of
life. The European Commission, in the person of Mr Giovanni Ravasio, its
director general of economic and financial clauses, set the ball rolling
about ten days ago when he declared that Emu was a 'feasible option' for
1997, the first target date in the treaty.
Since then, some formidable figures have waded into the debate on the side
of caution. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, has stated his
conviction that 'monetary policy integration in Europe can only be the
outcome of a lengthy process.' He later criticised the Maastricht
convergence criteria for low inflation and manageable budgetary positions as
'unambitious'.
Interviewed by a French newspaper, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
pronounced the Maastricht timetable 'completely dead', while making clear
that he was sympathetic to Emu as a general objective.
Last week in Brussels, Mr Antonio Martino, the Italian foreign minister,
challenged the whole idea of the Maastricht approach of gradual convergence
towards Emu as 'economically fallacious and politically dangerous.'
Convergence was 'neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for monetary
unification,' Mr Martino said.
Complaining that the 'convergence paradigm' might result in the division of
Europe into a club of supposedly virtuous countries that met the criteria
and others deemed unfit for such an exclusive club, Mr Martino called
instead for a 'monetary constitution' for Europe. 'Those of us who believe
that monetary unification is desirable should concentrate on identifying the
rules most suited to that end.'
In less than a fortnight, four significant personalities have pronounced on
a subject that Mr John Major in September 1993 said would have 'all the
quaintness of a rain dance and about the same potency.' True the voices are
discordant. But they show that the debate in Europe about Emu is hotting up.
The accompanying chart shows why. Europe's economy is recovering strongly
from recession. A healthy EU economy has usually stimulated greater economic
and monetary integration.
The latest commission forecasts suggest that EU economic growth will
accelerate to an average of 2.6 per cent this year, from 0.4 per cent in
1993. It has projected growth of 2.9 per cent next year, followed by 3.2 per
cent in 1996.
Government deficits should drop: to 3.9 per cent of EU gross domestic
product by 1996. True, this forecast is above the Maastricht criterion of 3
per cent. But it is based on unchanged policies. Mr Ravasio has predicted
that a majority of member states could meet the excessive deficit criterion
before the end of 1996 'if consolidation efforts are undertaken.'
But there is more to making Emu work than meeting Maastricht criteria. Mr
Malcolm Levitt, EU adviser of Barclays Bank, has pointed out that the
'boring bits' of Emu, such as the introduction of Ecu notes and coinage,
adaption of payments and accounting systems, conversion of electronic card
facilities in shops and restaurants and the resolution of legal
uncertainties, could take five years.
Mr Levitt's argument is that is already too late to contemplate Emu starting
in 1997. For Emu to start in 1999, the second date envisaged in the treaty,
preparations would have to begin now.
This is not yet the case in the private sector. Mr Levitt reports that
companies are largely unaware of what needs to be done. The few banks and
companies that have studied the issue are uncertain about the precise
timetable and scenario and are therefore not making the investments
necessary for introduction of a single currency.
Things are more advanced in the public policy area. The European Monetary
Institute this month secured the approval of central bank governors for a
'master-plan' aimed at completing the technical arrangements for the
proposed European System of Central Banks by the end of 1996.
Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, the EMI president, has also produced a suggestion
for moving to Emu by the end of the century. He says the EU should consider
irrevocably fixing the exchange rates of its currencies, but delay before
introducing the Ecu, the single European currency.
Mr Lamfalussy's idea for a phased introduction of stage three of the
Maastricht Treaty would hand over responsibility for monetary policy to a
European central bank with the fixing of currencies. It would allow time for
dealing with technical problems, such as common banknotes or compatible
payments systems.
The Maastricht Treaty says that Emu should go ahead in 1999, even if only a
minority of EU members meet the treaty criteria. The Lamfalussy suggestion
could make this a feasible option. But for Britain, it raises the prospect
of even greater political ructions than at present.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Markets: Light clouds over coffee talks - Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Members of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries are to meet in
London on Friday to discuss changes in the market situation. They could have
more to discuss than seemed likely when the meeting was scheduled.
The association was formed to organise a retention scheme aimed at reviving
coffee prices, which came into effect just over a year ago. Its initial
success in lifting prices to 2 1/2 -year highs resulted in the suspension of
retention, even before the market surged on news of damaging Brazilian
frosts in June and July.
With concern over a subsequent drought in Brazil driving prices to 8 1/2
 year highs - more than three times the levels prevailing at the inception
of the scheme - Friday's meeting might have been expected to be largely
self-congratulatory. But recent events have introduced an element of doubt
into market prospects.
Since the Brazilian government gave its official assessment of the size of
its damaged 1995-96 crop - which was broadly in line with market estimates -
prices have tumbled. A higher than expected figure for Brazilian coffee
stocks released last week accelerated the slide and nearby robusta futures
prices in London dipped below Dollars 3,000 a tonne, more than Dollars 1,000
less than the September peak.
The market remains well above the level that the retention scheme was
designed to support, but with chart analysts suggesting that further falls
could be on the cards, delegates at Friday's meeting may not have such a
rosy picture to review as they might have hoped.
Other events this week include a five-day meeting, starting today, of the
International Natural Rubber Organisation. Agreement is expected to be
reached on the extension of the price-stabilising 1987 International Natural
Rubber Agreement for another year after its scheduled expiry on December 31.
Wednesday sees the release of the International Wheat Council's latest
monthly crop report.

FT  28 NOV 94 / International Company News: Bad debt disposals hit Japanese
banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Substantial bad loan write-offs reduced recurring profits - before
extraordinary items and tax - at Japan's long-term credit banks and trust
banks in the six months to the end of September. However, most banks were
able to report higher operating profits in a more favourable interest rate
environment.
The three long-term credit banks, which are principally wholesale lenders to
Japanese companies, saw combined pre-tax profits fall by 20.1 per cent. The
decline was largely the result of the disposal of bad debts accumulated
during the collapse of asset prices in recent years.
Write-offs reduced outstanding non-performing loans to Y1,800bn (Dollars
1.82bn), a fall of 19 per cent on a year earlier. However, these figures do
not include restructured loans, where interest rates have been cut to assist
borrowers in severe trouble.
Analysts estimate that if these were added to the total, bad loans would be
approximately double the disclosed levels.
The long-term credit banks used gains from sales of equities to offset the
write-offs, but these were not enough to cover the full charge and pre-tax
profits declined as a result.
There were mixed fortunes in operating profits. The Industrial Bank of
Japan, the largest of the three, managed to take advantage of lower discount
bond rates to record a 32 per cent increase in operating profits, but the
two smaller banks both saw operating profits fall.
They attributed the decline to lower profits on government bond investment
income than last year, when they benefited strongly from sales of bonds as
interest rates fell.
For the full year to the end of March the three banks expect combined
pre-tax profits of Y126bn, up by 18.6 per cent from 1993 - 94.
The trust banks, many of which have had severe difficulties during the
period of falling asset prices and resulting problem loan increases, also
pursued an aggressive policy of writing off bad loans.
As a result, they reported combined pre-tax profits lower by 23 per cent at
Y48.7bn. But operating profits for most of the banks were sharply higher -
by an aggregate of 57 per cent.
The trust banks said the improved operating profits were the result of the
fall in interest rates in the previous six months - September 1993 to March
1994 - which, because of the structure of their assets and liabilities, was
not reflected in margins until the first half of the current financial year.
Most banks reported declines in outstanding non-performing loans, with one
exception - Nippon Trust. The bank was taken over two months ago by
Mitsubishi Bank in an attempt to rescue it from its enormous burden of bad
loans. At the time of the takeover, Mitsubishi warned that bad loans were
set to rise for some time.
The increase in Nippon Trust's bad loans accounted for the fact that
aggregate disclosed non-performing assets rose by 1.1 per cent between March
and September this year, to Y2,700bn.
However, like the long-term credit banks and the city banks, the trust banks
said that they expected to clear their bad debt problem within three years.
Sumitomo Bank: In last week's tabulation of the Japanese city banks'
half-year results, the figure for Sumitomo Bank's increase in non-performing
loans should have been 7.5 per cent.

FT  28 NOV 94 / International Company News: Israel sells 26% controlling
stake in Bank Mizrahi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SILVER

   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Israeli government has sold a controlling interest in Bank Mizrahi, the
country's fourth-ranking bank, for Dollars 110m. The buyers, the
Ofer-Wertheim consortium, purchased a 26 per cent stake with an option to
acquire a further 25 per cent within 18 months.
Mizrahi is the first of the 'big four' banks to be privatised. The
government acquired major holdings in all of them for Dollars 7bn in 1983
after the collapse of an elaborate system run by the banks for ramping up
their own shares.
Mr Gill Leidner, managing director of MI Holdings, the government agency
charged with selling off the state's stake, said yesterday: 'The Mizrahi
sale is a major step forward. It will definitely push things ahead for the
sale of the other three big banks.'
He described the Dollars 110m sale price as 'reasonable' but admitted he had
hoped to raise more. Mizrahi last week reported a 25 per cent drop in net
profits for the third quarter of 1994, to Shk26.1m (Dollars 8.6m) from
Shk36.2m in the same period of 1993. Earlier this year the bank was valued
for MI Holdings at Dollars 450m to Dollars 500m.
The Israel-based Ofer-Wertheim group is controlled by the brothers Mr Sami
and Mr Yuli Ofer and two businessmen, Mr Muzi Wertheim and Mr Abe Feinberg.
The Ofers control 50 per cent of the consortium, with Mr Wertheim and Mr
Feinberg holding 25 per cent each.
Mr Leidner explained that even if they did not take up the option to buy
another 25 per cent of Mizrahi, the chance that anyone else would be able to
buy anything close to it was theoretical.
MI Holdings sold the state's 42.5 per cent stake in IDB Holding, the
industrial investment arm of Israel Discount Bank, the country's third
largest bank, for Dollars 350m in 1992 but has still to sell the bank
itself. In 1993 the government sold the smaller Israel Union Bank for
Dollars 85.5m.
Mr Leidner is negotiating to sell the second biggest bank, Leumi, to
Republic Bank of New York. He expects the sale to be completed during the
first half of 1995. An international tender is to be issued for the leading
bank, Hapoalim, within the next two months.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Launch expenses of low-cost cigarette brands and an oilseeds business
decline restricted sales and profit growth of India's biggest tobacco
company, ITC, Reuter reports from Bombay.
ITC reported an 11 per cent increase in gross sales to Rs22.77bn (Dollars
726m) and a 30 per cent rise in net profit to Rs1.16bn for the half year to
September 30 but the earnings increase was modest compared with the general
trend of many companies posting more than 100 per cent rises for the half
year, analysts said.
'It is a little disappointing for a market which is used to better results
from ITC,' said one. 'They focused on high volume sales of low cost brands
in rural India. This is a good strategy in the long run, but marketing
expenses eroded margins.'
ITC, which is 31.5 per cent owned by BAT Industries of the UK, recorded a
6.4 per cent increase in cigarette sales in value terms after several years
of stagnant growth. Cigarettes contribute to more than 60 per cent of ITC's
sales.

FT  28 NOV 94 / International Company News: KIO plans write-off of Grupo
Torras debt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) plans to write-off Pta184.4bn (Dollars
1.4bn) to bring its Spanish holding, Grupo Torras, out of receivership under
the terms of a settlement proposed to minority creditors.
The development represents the formal acknowledgement by the KIO and by its
parent, the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA), of Kuwait's continued
interest in Grupo Torras despite a legal feud between former and present
managers of the company that led to an application by Grupo Torras for
protection against its creditors in December 1992.
The proposed write-off is the equivalent of 90 per cent of the Pta205.4bn
owed by Grupo Torras to KIO/KIA, a debt total that represents 93.5 per cent
of the total sum owed by the Spanish company to its creditors. The remaining
6.5 per cent of the debt, representing Pta14.4bn, is highly dispersed among
financial and public institutions and among bond holders.
The settlement proposes a sliding scale: minor creditors, owed less than
Pta1m, would be repaid 97 per cent of their loan to Grupo Torras within
three months; Creditors who lent between Pta100m and Pta1bn are being asked
to write-off 80 per cent of their loans and will be repaid the balance
within six months.
The creditors have until January 21 to approve the settlement but this
approval is a mere formality for under Spanish law such an agreement
requires a favourable vote representing 75 per cent of the debt owed, a
proportion that is well below the threshold of the direct Kuwait loans to
Grupo Torras.
The chief beneficiaries of the KIO's proposed write-off will be Torraspapel,
a paper group owned by Grupo Torras, and Ercros, the holding's fertiliser
division. Both companies were placed into receivership before Grupo Torras
itself collapsed and they have since received considerable financial backing
from the KIO.

<TEXT>
Canadian pulp and paper producers are expected to report a sharp climb in
profits in the final quarter of this year, driven by rising prices for pulp,
newsprint, fine paper and packaging.
Tembec, a big eastern producer, provided a taste of things to come when it
reported a profit of CDollars 72.9m (USDollars 53m), or CDollars 2.24 a
share, for the year to September 30, a swing of nearly CDollars 122m from a
loss of CDollars 48.6m, or CDollars 1.33, a year earlier.
The CDollars 65m proceeds from a financial restructuring accounted for part
of the increase and the rest came from higher selling prices, especially in
the September quarter. Costs were stable.
Since September 30, prices worldwide have risen further for nearly all
Tembec's products. The company exports to more than 50 countries. The latest
fiscal year showed sales of CDollars 575m, up 32 per cent.
Tembec's 50 per cent-owned French pulp mill contributed CDollars 3.9m in
operating income and the 41 per cent-owned Ontario newsprint affiliate
contributed CDollars 6.9m.
Most of Tembec's operations are based in north-western Quebec.

<TEXT>
Benguet, the Philippines' leading mining company, reported net profits for
the nine months to end-September of 13.8m pesos (Dollars 0.58m), a steep
drop of 95.7 per cent from the previous year. Total operating revenues
amounted to 2.24bn pesos, down 6.3 per cent.
The results were affected by poor ore grade which 'significantly improved'
by the start of the fourth quarter of the year. The company expects full
recovery by the first half of 1995.
Gold production, Benguet's principal activity, suffered a decline following
an earthquake that damaged part of the Antamok mine, with the clean-up later
delayed by heavy rains. Losses from its Antamok open-pit mine in the January
to September period reached 42.1m pesos, down, however, from the previous
year's 70.3m pesos.
Copper production, on the other hand, slowed in the third quarter due to
breakdowns in the Dizon mine's concentrator plant.

Alphameric, the information technology systems supplier, has announced a
number of actions as part of its expansion plans. They include a Pounds
2.75m acquisition, a Pounds 1.89m placing and open offer, a share
subscription and the conversion of preference shares.
The company also announ-ced pre-tax profits of Pounds 323,000 for the six
months to September 30, a rise of 81 per cent on the comparable Pounds
178,000.
It is acquiring the outstanding 25 per cent in AlphaServ by buying Ambrose
Consultancy for Pounds 2.75m satisfied by the issue of 6.88m shares of which
2.67m are being placed at 37.5p a share. There is a 3-for-13 clawback.
A further 3.56m shares are being placed under the same terms to raise Pounds
885,000 for working capital and to fund expansion.
Sejin Electron, a South Korean keyboard manufacturer, is subscribing for 3m
shares at 41.5p, subject to South Korean government approval.
The company also plans to convert the 500,000 9 3/4 per cent convertible
preference shares held by 3i into 1.2m ordinary shares. The conversion rate
is 2.41 per convertible against the 1.38 set out in the articles of
association.
If the plan goes through Alphameric will pay the Pounds 137,000 arrears on
the preference shares. An EGM is to be held on December 19.
The profit rise was achieved on turnover 19 per cent ahead at Pounds 6.3m
(Pounds 5.28m). Earnings per share doubled to 0.8p (0.4p).
Mr Alan Benjamin, chairman, said that if the present level of progress was
sustained the company could be in a position to restore dividends in
1994-95.
The shares rose 1p to 41p on Friday.

Minmet, the Dublin-based electronic information, mining and exploration
group, is raising IPounds 630,000 (Pounds 620,811) through a 1-for-6 rights
issue and the placing of up to 5m new shares at 2.5p per share.
The new funds will be invested in Russia Money, an on-screen information
service joint venture, Solent Trees, a mature trees business, and the
group's Russian gold interests.
The group is also negotiating with Gulf Explorations Consultants, a US shell
company in which Minmet has a 23.8 per cent stake, a possible paper bid for
Minmet by Gulf.
Mr Paul Bristol, chairman of Minmet, said that if a Gulf bid were accepted
by Minmet's shareholders, the new entity would seek to revive its listing on
Nasdaq, which may be considered a more suitable market than Dublin for
raising funds for Russia Money and the group's Russian gold mining
operations.
Mr Bristol said he hoped the negotiations with Gulf would be completed
before the December 18 deadline for the rights issue.
Shares in Minmet closed unchanged at 2 3/4 p on Friday.

FT  28 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Halifax faces competition hurdle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The proposed merger between the Halifax and Leeds building societies faces
several regulatory hurdles before members can vote on it next March, the
most immediate of which is over competition.
The Office of Fair Trading has confirmed that it has launched a preliminary
investigation to see whether it should be blocked on competition grounds.
Although there is some question whether the combined society would have 25
per cent of the UK residential mortgage market, the merger qualifies for
vetting as the society being taken over, the Leeds, has assets of Pounds
20bn.
The OFT will hope to complete its inquiry within a month, after which it
will make a recommendation to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary.
He will then decide whether to allow it to go through, unchallenged or with
conditions, or whether to refer it to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
A full MMC inquiry would take three months.
If the proposal clears the competition hurdle, the merger should be
straightforward. The procedure involves 'a transfer of engagements' which
amounts to a tra-nsfer from the Leeds to the Halifax of all the Leeds'
assets, liabilities and members.
A transfer statement explaining the detailed terms of the merger will be
sent to members of both societies next spring, after which they must both
obtain the approval of their investing and borrowing members.
The conversion of the merged society to a bank is more onerous, but the
societies have the successful Abbey National precedent to follow.
The first step would be to form a successor company and get a clear
indication from the Bank of England that it would be authorised as a bank
under UK banking legislation. Special provisions attach to the new company.
Its memorandum and articles must protect it from takeover for five years.
The conversion must then be approved by the merged society's members and the
Building Societies Commission. A special resolution requiring a 75 per cent
vote in favour must be passed by investing members. In addition 20 per cent
in number of those eligible to vote must pass the resolution. Borrowing
members must approve by a simple majority.
To induce members to vote, the societies plan to offer all members free
shares in the new company as the Abbey did. By doing this rather than
offering cash, they should avoid the problems into which the Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester/Lloyds Bank deal ran.

FT  28 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Yorkshire stirs societies' pudding - The
sector's reaction to the merger plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the second time this year building societies are hoping to prove that
reports of the sector's demise are premature.
But the agreement between Halifax and Leeds Permanent building societies,
two of the UK's biggest, to merge and then to become a public limited
company and a bank has set them a serious challenge.
Reaction now is different from responses to the announcement in April of
Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn agreed cash bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester
Building Society, the UK's sixth largest.
Then there was less to put societies on the defensive. The Lloyds offer
could be seen as a sign of its strength in the core markets of home loans
and retail savings, while increased interest from potential purchasers could
not be a threat since the mutual ownership regime protects societies from
hostile takeover.
By contrast, last week's announcement by the two Yorkshire-based societies
planted two doubts.
First, if Leeds, the fifth largest society with assets of Pounds 20bn, did
not feel large enough to survive alone, what would happen to smaller
societies?
Second, if Halifax - almost twice as big as the second largest - believed it
had to convert to plc-status in order to compete effectively in personal
financial services, how could other large societies do so while still
shackled to the regulatory restrictions on societies' activities and
funding?
Despite these concerns, the remaining large societies are not planning a
suicide pact.
'You can never say never, but there are no powers we want that we will not
be getting anyway, and capital is not a problem, so why convert?' says Mr
Peter Robinson, managing director of Woolwich Building Society, the UK's
third largest.
Indeed, societies can see some advantages for themselves from the Halifax
move - for example in the disappearance of the Leeds brand and discussions
with the Treasury about new powers for societies.
Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary, has said the government
wants a separate societies' sector to flourish. Consequently, Mr Brian
Davis, chief executive of Nationwide, the second largest society, believes
the deal strengthens the case for greater flexibility so societies can
compete more effectively in their present form.
The common refrain among large societies is that above a certain minimum,
size is not everything. They can focus either on developing a particular
niche - as Bradford &amp; Bingley is seeking to do as the largest independent
financial adviser - or on a strong regional franchise - such as Northern
Rock's position in north-east England.
While in the short term those tactics are not undermined by the Halifax
move, the agreement does intensify the pressures for change over the next
few years.
In particular, the deal makes it much more likely that a large society
planning to merge or convert will now decide to do both.
The case for a pre-conversion merger is that the larger a society is when it
becomes a plc, the better-placed it is to deter potential predators. If the
Leeds had decided to float on its own, it could have been destabilised by
speculation about a hostile bid well before it could have been taken over.
The argument for adding conversion is that, as members are increasingly
aware of the value of their membership, they need the promise of shares
tomorrow to persuade them to back a deal which does not bring much, if any,
immediate financial benefit.
Mr Peter White, chief executive of Alliance &amp; Leicester, says the society
will not be making any 'panic decisions', since getting the right partner is
more important than simply enjoying the idea of a match.
Societies do not need to panic now. But with the reasonable assumption that
there will be further large mergers, they would probably be well-advised to
join a dating agency so as not to be left on the shelf.

For the six months to September 30 the company reported a 34 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.74m to Pounds 2.34m, on turnover
55 per cent ahead at Pounds 45.7m (Pounds 29.4m).
Earnings per share rose 33 per cent to 7.51p (5.66p) and the maiden interim
dividend is 3.4p. Cash was strong at Pounds 8.8m.
The company distributes storages systems for all levels of computer apart
from mainframes.
Mr James Wickes, managing director, said trading had been strong throughout
the period. The price of equipment was falling but customers needed more
storage to support larger networks.
Mr Richard Jewson, chairman, said since the company floated earlier this
year, it had signed distribution agreements with International Business
Machines and had been appointed UK distributor for AT&amp;T's personal
computers.
He said growth had continued despite capacity constraints, adding that,
since the second half of the year was traditionally stronger than the first,
he was confident of a satisfactory performance for the year.

The company will kick off what is expected to be a controversial interims
season for the England and Wales regional electricity companies when it
reports on Thursday. Profit figures for the first half of the year are
always of limited significance but the recs' dividend rises always provoke
criticism. Seeboard is expected to be relatively restrained, with analysts
forecasting rises of about 16 per cent. However some of its peers are likely
to go beyond 20 per cent. The Labour Party seems bound to renew calls for a
windfall tax on utilities.

spirit - Other Companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Another hefty restructuring charge will depress pre-tax profits at Grand
Metropolitan, the drinks and foods group, by Pounds 280m to around Pounds
650m for the year ended September. A similar charge a year earlier cut
profits to Pounds 630m. It might have managed a few percentage points of
underlying profit growth in the latest year.
The City hopes GrandMet will spell out on Thursday what the charge,
announced in October, will entail. The other key area is the performance of
IDV, its spirits business, particularly in the US.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Investment banks take stock after telecoms battle: After
nearly four years of courtship, Deutsche Telekom rings Goldman Sachs' bell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER, RICHARD LAPPER and NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For executives of the world's top investment banks, last weekend must have
been one of the most relaxing for some time.
Those not celebrating their success, after Friday's announcement from the
German government of which banks would play leading roles in the Deutsche
Telekom share issue, could at least enjoy an end to months of tension.
When Goldman Sachs was named as the foreign bank in the global consortium
for the equity sale - which at some DM15bn (Pounds 5.8bn) is the biggest
ever in Germany and one of the world's largest - it was finally confirmed
that the US bank's assiduous courtship of the German telecommunications
concern and its chairman Helmut Ricke, had paid off.
The global consortium takes responsibility for the co-ordination of demand
and placement in consultation with regional lead-managers. Along with
Deutsche Telekom and the German government it will also decide on allocation
of shares between the domestic German market and the four other regions.
The international group acts as intermediary between regional leaders and
the company.
The choice of a US bank was virtually certain. Deutsche Telekom's decision
to seek a US listing to tap as many American institutional and private
investors as possible meant a US bank would inevitably have a head start,
joining Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank at the top of the global consortium.
Although the decision was taken last Monday at a meeting with Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, who was alert to the political implications of the choice of
lead banks, it was kept quiet at first. This was to give the government time
to work out final details and avoid the news clashing with the presentation
of the newly re-elected government's legislative programme.
Keeping banks and the media on tenterhooks was 'a deliberate diversionary
tactic', said one government official. Even Deutsche Bank only knew of the
definite choice of Goldman Sachs on Thursday night. Deutsche, too, received
a boost on Friday with its appointment as spokesman for the global
consortium, also responsible for the overall bookbuilding process in which
investor interest is assessed before the share price is fixed. This was seen
as a political attempt to help Deutsche, Germany's biggest bank, after its
image problems over the Metallgesellschaft and the Schneider property
debacles.
Dresdner Bank had earlier looked like taking the top German prize after its
success with the recent Lufthansa privatisation. In the event, it shares the
leadership of the German sub-consortium - likely to account for more than
half the share sales - with Deutsche, while the latter is a joint manager
(with Merrill and Goldman) in the American placing, and co-leader for the UK
tranche (headed by Warburg) and for Asia (led by Daiwa). France's Paribas
heads the consortium for the rest of Europe, with Dresdner as co-manager.
The whole issuing structure is finely balanced and designed to put the top
banks in geographical areas at the head of the regional consortia.
From the start, Goldman always looked most likely to fare best in this
overall share-out. It had courted the German company for nearly four years,
having first called on its executives in February 1991, well before the Bonn
government announced plans to raise capital for the state-owned company
through the international markets.
Other leading investment banks also spent years cultivating Deutsche
Telekom. One US investment banker said: 'Anybody who hadn't been all over
this should be fired. If somebody rolled up a year ago without investing
time I think they were a little optimistic.'
But Goldman Sachs was particularly determined. Mr Scott Mead, a managing
director of the communications and technology group within the investment
banking division, and one of a core team of six executives involved in the
deal, said it was a 'a top priority for a large number of our senior
management' - a formidable claim for a bank known for its relentless pursuit
of business.
In its initial contacts, Goldman Sachs explained its views about the global
telecommunications industry which it believes was poised to expand rapidly.
'There was nothing tangible at the time, but we were firmly convinced that a
commercial and corporate structure was the best way forward for
telecommunications companies,' explained Mr Robert Morris, a managing
director of Goldman's global equities research. 'Whether it was 1991 or
1995, our belief was that you would have privatisation throughout Europe and
the rest of the world. In a sense we thought it was inevitable.'
Early in 1992, Goldman held a series of meetings with the group in
connection with roadshows designed to introduce German government bodies to
the international capital markets. 'This was an unofficial exercise designed
to help them know what they would confront when privatisation came,' said Mr
Mead. 'We organised the meetings to help explain the equity story.'
In spring 1993, Goldman worked with the international arm of Deutsche
Telekom on its bid for a stake in Matav, the Hungarian telecommunications
concern. Deutsche Telekom eventually bought a 30 per cent stake in Matav for
Dollars 875m.
DT was always the favourite but Mr Morris claimed: 'They won even though
they were not the highest bidder. So it was obviously satisfactory.'
In 1994, Goldman worked closely with DT and France Telecom when the two
European companies invested some Dollars 4.2bn in Sprint, the US
telecommunications concern. Between these deals, Goldman's executives worked
hard to cultivate the relationship.
For at least six - and usually 10 - executives based in Frankfurt and
London, the DT deal was a priority. Goldman even moved Mr Morris, its
pre-eminent telecoms analyst, from the US to London last year in order to
help with the Telekom campaign.
The bank used every opportunity to strengthen its ties with DT, keeping the
company informed about the progress of other international privatisation
deals in which it has been involved.
'We filled them in on our views on the evolution of technology and the
background to privatisation, said Mr Morris.
Goldman was heavily involved in the sale of Singapore Telecom in 1993, and
this year has been in three large deals. It was a book-runner in the sale of
Tele Danmark, the Danish company, Thailand Telephone &amp; Communications and
Indosat, the Indonesian long distance telecommunications company.
While the fees to be earned by the various banks from the Deutsche Telekom
deal are clearly attractive at DM400m or more, Goldman says the real value
of the deal is strategic.
'This is a deal which every institution we talk to will be interested in.
And for our German office and our telecommunications business it is of
extraordinary importance,' insisted Mr Mead. 'A relationship with Telekom
has a pay-back you can't measure in terms of fees,' he added.
Rightly or wrongly, said Mr Morris, 'there is a perception in the
marketplace that if you have passed the test in Germany you have passed
German engineering standards in relation to telecommunications flotations.
It shows that the doors fit snugly and the wheels are tight.'

FT  28 NOV 94 / Company News (This Week): Chemical giants bullish on
prospects - Bayer/Hoechst
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After BASF set the tone last week with news of a three-fold increase in
third-quarter profits, offset by a warning that the squeeze on costs will
continue, much the same is expected from Bayer and Hoechst's nine-month
results, due this week.
Bayer, expected to publish today, has been bullish on prospects for most of
the year, and although improvements on the BASF scale are not to be
expected, analysts point out that the Leverkusen group avoided crashing
quite so dramatically in the recession as its compatriot competitors.
Pre-tax earnings for the third quarter may increase by a third or more,
according to most estimates, thanks mainly to health care and strong foreign
operations, Bayer's trusty buffers against cyclical crunches.
Like BASF, Hoechst is expected to report continued pressure on margins from
severe price competition. Although no details are expected, volume growth in
traditional chemicals operations in Germany has far exceeded reported
increases in sales.
At the same time, pre-tax profits will certainly rebound vigorously in
comparison with the dismal DM143m (Pounds 58.30m) reported in the third
quarter of last year.
According to Mr Jurgen Dormann, chairman, the net result will be a doubling
of the Hoechst share price by the end of the decade.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Company News (This Week): Period of strong growth enhanced
by Quantum leap - Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson's full year figures on Thursday are expected to show a modest
increase in pre-tax profits to around Pounds 1bn, before disposal gains of
more than Pounds 300m. Underlying earnings per share are forecast to show
little change at 14p.
Strong growth at the operating level will have continued in the fourth
quarter with trading profits rising by almost a third in the year. But the
impact will have been largely offset by a Pounds 250m swing in the interest
bill.
This stems from the increase in US debt following the Pounds 2.1bn
acquisition of Quantum Chemical at the start of the year combined with lower
income on Hanson's sterling deposits.
The figures should confirm that the Quantum deal was very well timed.
Quantum made little more than Pounds 35m before interest and tax in the year
to September 1993. But ethylene and polyethylene prices have since risen
strongly, and analysts believe Quantum could have made almost Pounds 180m
last year. After interest its contribution will have been around Pounds
100m.
Profits from Hanson's other cyclical business, particularly construction
related, have also picked up strongly and US coal profits have recovered
following the long and expensive strike at Peabody.
Hanson's other chemicals business, SCM, has been slower to turn and is
expected to report lower profits. But its prices have also hardened and it
should move ahead again this year.
Thanks to disposals, such as the flotation of Beazer's housing operations,
debt will have been reduced from Pounds 3.4bn to about Pounds 2.5bn over the
year cutting gearing from 86 per cent to around 55 per cent.
Hanson has already signalled that it will pay a fourth quarterly dividend of
3p, making a total for the year to 11.7p, a rise of 2.6 per cent.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Privatisation lures cash to Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emerging markets funds have raised Dollars 300m (Pounds 182m) to take
advantage of mass privatisation in Russia and its neighbours, marking a
surge in interest by investors in the region.
Placings by two new regional funds and one existing one have taken to more
than Dollars 1.5bn the pool of financial investment earmarked for eastern
Europe.
Pictet, the Swiss private banking group, has attracted Dollars 56m for its
First Russian Frontiers Trust, and gained the first London listing for a
fund of its type.
Trading in First Russian Frontiers, sponsored by stockbrokers Cazenove,
begins tomorrow in London. On Wednesday the Barings group, which has raised
Dollars 180m for its First NIS Regional Fund, expects those shares to be
listed in Luxembourg.
An established fund, Invesco's East Europe Development Fund, has expanded by
tapping the markets for an extra Dollars 75m and trading in the new share
issue began at the end of last week on the Irish Stock Exchange.
The proliferation of east European regional funds is the most visible sign
that investor interest has withstood the rise in international interest
rates. General emerging market funds, hedge funds and even pension funds
have contributed to a record flow of financial investment into Russia
estimated at Dollars 500m a month.
Gazprom, Russia's main gas producer, has hired Kleinwort Benson of the UK to
sell a 9 per cent shareholding internationally. Such action by Russia's
natural resource giants will draw in even more financial investment.
Many of the earlier regional funds have weighted their holdings towards the
more mature east European markets of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.
But Russia's mass privatisation programme has produced a huge supply of
equity at valuations that fund managers describe privately as 'laughably
low'. The market capitalisation of the Russian oil sector values a barrel of
proven reserves at 10-15 cents, compared with Dollars 7 in the US.
The Pictet fund aims to invest 35 per cent in Russia and 25 per cent in the
relatively unexplored Balkan duo of Romania and Bulgaria. The fund has scope
to invest in more than 20 markets including locations such as Bosnia, Serbia
and Azerbaijan.
The Barings fund also targets Russia and the newly independent states of the
old Soviet Union. 'It is very, very risky but the value is unparalleled in
terms of what you see in other emerging markets,' said Ms Nancy Curtin, head
of emerging European markets at Baring Asset Management. Invesco's East
Europe Development Fund, which has the best recorded performance of any fund
investor over one and three years, also plans to increase the Russian
weighting in its portfolio.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Singer to pay Pounds 45m for control of Carnegie
</HEADLINE>

Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant banking group, is to buy a controlling
stake in Carnegie, the international broking house, from Nordbanken of
Sweden.
The group, which owns the UK broking house Collins Stewart, is expected to
announce the details - possibly as early as tomorrow - in conjunction with a
convertible share issue to raise the necessary cash.
It is thought to be paying around Pounds 45m for a 55 per cent stake in the
company. It will take the equity business while Nordbanken will retain the
Swedish bond and money broking arm.
The purchase and fund-raising are likely to be carried out by Barclays de
Zoete Wedd, Singer's broker. The company was not prepared to comment
yesterday but a market source said: 'The financing is still being decided
but the deal is imminent.'
Singer has a diversified growth approach, acquiring sizeable stakes in
Associated Nursing Services, Edgar Hamilton - the Lloyd's of London broker -
and People's Phone, an independent provider of mobile phone services.
It also has a large property portfolio which contributed almost 20 per cent
to interim profits in September.
It has a significant cash pile and is one of the best capitalised merchant
banks in the UK according to banking analysts. While it could afford to
raise the extra money for the purchase without tapping shareholders, it is
believed to be keeping cash for other ventures. For example increasing its
22 per cent stake in People's Phone.
Nordbanken, said yesterday: 'We have been seeking a buyer for over a year.
We are concentrating on offering standardised products to private
individuals and small and medium-sized companies while Carnegie specialises
in medium and large companies and wealthy individuals.'
Nordbanken, the worst casualty of Sweden's 1992 banking crisis, was bailed
out by the government two years ago and is now set for privatisation after
reporting healthy interim profits in August. Earlier this year, it had been
in talks about selling Carnegie to Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Late spurt by Yes side as Norway votes on joining EU
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Final opinion polls showed the Yes campaign gaining ground as Norwegians
began voting yesterday in a referendum on joining the European Union. A
majority in favour when votes are counted tonight would reverse Norway's
rejection in 1972 of membership of the then European Economic Community.
The No side has led the contest throughout the year, but a spurt by
supporters of Norwegian membership since neighbouring Sweden voted to join
two weeks ago has encouraged Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the prime minister,
and her Labour government, to believe that victory is possible.
In a final campaign push on Friday and Saturday, Mrs Brundtland appealed to
Norwegians not to leave the country isolated now that Sweden and Finland,
its fellow Nordic nations, had elected to join the EU. Calling the
referendum the most important decision facing Norway since the second world
war, she said the Yes campaign was gaining momentum and called for a high
turnout to ensure victory. 'Get off the sofa and vote,' she said. 'We are
almost there.'
The last opinion polls yesterday showed a continued lead for the No side of
about 52 per cent against the Yes side's 48 per cent. The No side argues
that membership will erode Norway's independence and control over its oil
and fish resources. But all polls showed significant gains for the Yes camp.
The government and its pro-EU backers in the Conservative opposition party
and the business community are banking on winning over most of those making
up their minds at the last minute.
The No side, however, is hoping its great strength in the rural and remote
northern regions will be sufficient to defeat an expected majority for
membership in urban areas, particularly in the Oslo area, where about a
third of the 3.6m voters live.
Tensions between the two camps boiled over in televised debates on Friday
night when Mrs Brundtland accused Ms Anne Enger Lahnstein, the principal
leader of the No campaign, of lying when she said EU membership might weaken
trade union rights. Ms Lahnstein demanded an apology, but Mrs Brundtland was
unrepentant.
Polling stations in about half the country's municipalities opened for
voting yesterday and a heavy turnout was reported. The bulk of the
electorate will cast their ballots today, with polls open until 9pm.
Officials warn that if the outcome is very close, the result may not be
clear until early tomorrow.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Insurers want Pounds 10m limit on company employee risk
cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many UK companies face difficulties in obtaining adequate - or even the
legally required - amounts of insurance cover from next year for deaths and
injuries at work, corporate risk managers and insurance experts say.
Government officials will hold urgent discussions this week with insurance
industry representatives about a decision by insurance companies to stop
selling employers liability policies with unlimited cover. Insurers plan to
impose a basic Pounds 10m claims limit on policies renewed from January.
The move has created confusion about the extra protection companies will
need to buy. Mr Alan Fleming, executive director of the Association of
Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce (Airmic), said: 'Many
companies may be left without adequate cover against possibly very
significant losses - to say nothing of the fact that they may not be meeting
their legal obligations.'
Airmic is alarmed that insurance companies have yet to draw up details of
policies that would offer the extra cover companies may require - even
though there is little more than a month to go before the new limits are
applied.
Insurance companies have imposed the cap because of the escalating cost of
employers' liability claims. Insurance premiums have already risen sharply,
but the 1988 Piper Alpha disaster, which resulted in claims for death and
injury totalling about Pounds 125m, caused insurance companies to believe
that unlimited cover was no longer possible.
The insurers' move means companies are having to assess the extra protection
needed to meet the cost of possible workplace incidents including
large-scale disasters, however unlikely. They also have to ensure that they
comply with the 1969 Employers' Liability Act, which says an employer must
have at least Pounds 2m of cover. That will not be a problem for many
companies. But the definition of 'employer' is unclear and each subsidiary
of a large group may need Pounds 2m of protection.
That means the total insurance requirement of a large corporate group may be
so large that it has difficulty in obtaining the cover needed without
excessive increases in premiums.
A private report circulated by Sedgwick, the insurance broker, warns that
'insurers we have contacted have indicated that an employer liability policy
in the form required by the Department of Employment will be very difficult
to achieve'.
The Sedgwick report expresses 'concern that such a difference of view about
the legislation can appear to have arisen between the government and the
Association of British Insurers'.

FT  28 NOV 94 / IMF aid for Russia at risk in row over budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Resistance by Russia's parliament to tough government budget plans was
threatening the loss of massive foreign aid as an International Monetary
Fund team arrived in Moscow at the weekend for crucial talks.
In the coming weeks the government will face a harsh choice between
placating the parliamentary deputies and losing the chance of aid - which
might total Dollars 13bn (Pounds 8.3bn) for 1995 - or meeting the IMF's
criteria and provoking a confrontation with the Duma, or lower house.
The IMF's team of senior officials is to begin final talks on various forms
of assistance. Officials say the team has tough questions about next year's
budget and is determined to tighten its assumptions and projections. The IMF
does not believe that the projections for tax revenues will be met, nor that
spending can be kept within the forecasts.
However, the government was warned on Friday by leading deputies, including
those from parties that back economic reforms, that even the present budget
proposal was too severe to attract majority support. The Duma voted
overwhelmingly to form a joint parliamentary-government committee to work on
the budget and propose changes, and report back before December 10.
Deputies representing special interests such as the agriculture and defence
industries have been particularly aggressive in demanding much higher
spending than is foreseen.
Mr Mikhail Zadornov, head of the parliamentary budget committee, said the
budget was 'completely unrealistic' in almost every respect: in its
assumptions of the level of tax revenue, of the sale of treasury bills and
on its central innovation to reject any funding from central bank credits,
the main engine of inflation in previous years.
President Boris Yeltsin called together national and regional leaders in the
Kremlin on Saturday to express his apparently full support for the budget.
He claimed that the crisis in the economy was 'close to being overcome' and
said there could be 'no way back to high unchecked inflation'.
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, gave an even more glowing
prospect - saying that the budget strategy could make '1995 the year of
financial stabilisation, 1996 the year of overcoming economic depression and
1997 the year of steady economic growth'.
The only room for compromise could come if the Duma refrains from
confronting the government and does not pass the budget. In that case, the
government would fund the budget month by month.

FT  28 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Brazilian stock market this year has been the world's best-performing in
dollar terms, up an astonishing 80 per cent. But last week the Bovespa index
plummeted nearly 10 per cent. The question is whether it was a hiccup in its
progress or represented the start of a more fundamental derating.
In part, the descent was due to the general fall in international equity
markets. Investors have also been locking in profits during reassuringly
thin trading. But the key to longer term growth will be the incoming
government's ability to control inflation which has already fallen from a
peak of 50 per cent to 3.5 per cent a month. Some commentators believe that
if inflation can be successfully controlled, the economy could expand 6 per
cent a year for the next decade. Private sector earnings growth could be
spectacular in an economy expanding that fast.
Investors must hope the record of past Brazilian governments represents no
guide to the future performance of this administration. After all, the
latest economic plan is the seventh in eight years. However, this time there
is consensus that a return to hyper-inflation must be avoided at all costs.
All depends on the administration's ability to control the budget deficit. A
positive conclusion to the constitutional reform necessary to limit the
spending power of regional government is not guaranteed, but the chances are
better than for many years. Until those reforms are agreed, probably not
before June, the market will remain highly volatile. But if reform is
implemented, then prospects are bright, with Brazil set to become an
important constituent of international investment funds. If not, all bets
are off.

FT  28 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Syndicated loans
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Margins on international syndicated loans have shrunk to wafer-thin levels.
The Bank for International Settlements confirmed as much in its quarterly
survey last week. The most credit-worthy companies can currently borrow for
as little as 15 points above the London inter-bank offer rate, compared with
as much as 50 points just two years ago. That is lower than the level
reached during the last cycle.
The reason for the keener pricing is an imbalance in supply and demand.
Banks, awash with capital following improved financial results and a decline
in bad debts, have been anxious to build their loan portfolios. But the
corporate sector, busy paying down debt, has not had much appetite for
borrowing. Competition between banks has forced margins down. For companies,
raising money through syndicated loans is doubly attractive, given the high
yields they currently pay for issuing bonds. Cut-throat competition is
worrying, however. With spreads so narrow, few banks are making money.
Moreover, in their efforts to win business, they have competed by loosening
covenant terms. That could store up trouble during the next economic
downturn.
One might think banks would walk away from such unprofitable business. The
snag is that many see syndicated loans as loss leaders, on the back of which
they can sell corporations more profitable products such as derivatives.
There is therefore little chance of a pick-up in margins. In fact, with
Japanese banks expected to rush to make loans by the end of their financial
year in March, a further squeeze is likely.

FT  28 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: German bunds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was encouraging news for the German bond market last week. Growth in
October's M3 money supply worked out at an annualised rate of 6.9 per cent,
suggesting the Bundesbank will come close to meeting its target of 4 to 6
per cent M3 growth for the year. Year-on-year inflation was down to 2.6 per
cent in November - further progress towards the Bundesbank's 2 per cent
objective.
The favourable outlook is blighted somewhat by continuing uncertainty over
German fiscal policy, which cannot be cleared up until after the tight 1995
budget has been agreed later this month. The wage round for next year
presents another risk. But, given the backdrop of improving inflation and
money supply data, it is not absurd to suggest that the Bundesbank may cut
short-term rates one last time during the current economic cycle, perhaps
early next year. To some extent it does not matter whether short-term rates
are cut or not; sentiment towards bunds will improve even if rates are
merely left on hold throughout most of 1995. This seems more likely than the
monetary tightening still anticipated by the Euromarkets.
Improving fundamentals have helped bunds over recent months; they have
regained their traditional premium to comparable US issues. The
outperformance is more marked for US investors because of the weakness of
the dollar versus the D-Mark. This may encourage profit-taking at signs of a
pronounced rally, but if last week's tentative worldwide shift from equities
into bonds gathers momentum, bunds will clearly benefit.

FT  28 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Milking the cash cows
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK corporate sector is sucking in cash at a rapid rate. Industrial
companies are running their largest financial surplus since the early 1980s.
So far, companies have chosen to use the cash to improve their balance
sheets. They paid off Pounds 3.1bn of borrowings in the first half of the
year and increased their cash deposits. The desire for financial strength is
fair enough, but this has been at the expense of dividend payouts and
capital expenditure.
Generosity to shareholders has proved surprisingly limited; dividends fell
between the second half of last year and the first half of the current year
on a seasonally adjusted basis. However, investors have benefited recently
from the trend towards share buy-backs - notably by Boots and the regional
electricity companies - and full-year dividends are likely to be up a
handsome 10 per cent.
More worrying is the stagnant capital expenditure in the third quarter. The
stock market tends to be sceptical when companies announce large capital
expenditure plans, as, for example, when Hanson recently declared its
intention to spend Dollars 438m expanding capacity in the US. But this
scepticism is wrong-headed, if investment supports long-term earnings
growth. The dearth of capital expenditure probably reflects the impact of
high real long-term interest rates. But with inflation low, companies should
arguably adjust to less ambitious profit targets.

FT  28 NOV 94 / The generals' big business offensive: Simon Holberton and
Tony Walker examine the increasingly powerful commercial role of China's
armed services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the west coast of Hainan, the large Chinese island next to to Vietnam, a
mini-Hong Kong is taking shape. In 30 sq km, two private companies are
building container docks, warehouses, offices, flats and hotels for a
HKDollars 18bn free port development.
One of the companies, Kumagai Gumi, is an associate of the Japanese
construction company of the same name and well known among international
investors. The other, China Poly Group, is relatively unknown, but is on the
way to becoming one of China's biggest conglomerates.
Headquartered in Beijing, China Poly is led by a major-general of the
People's Liberation Army (PLA) and 'owned' by the PLA General Staff. It is
perhaps the most aggressive investor, at home and abroad, among increasingly
assertive business groups controlled by China's sprawling
military-industrial complex.
This thickening web of manufacturers, and investment and trading companies,
falls into two categories: one headed by businesses such as Poly Group and
under direct PLA control; the other involving defence industries turned to
civilian production under the control of China's State Council, or cabinet.
They are prime examples of what Mr John Frankenstein, senior lecturer at the
University of Hong Kong's business school and an expert on China's military
business, calls 'Chinese bureaucratic entrepreneurialism' - the involvement
by government officials, including increasingly the military, in
free-wheeling business ventures.
This phenomenon has left members of China's military-industrial complex
poised to play a greater role not only at home, but internationally. A
role-model which China's military businesses may try to emulate is that of
the China International Trust and Investment Corporation (Citic), one of the
country's first experiments in western-style corporate capitalism. Citic's
Hong Kong subsidiary, Citic Pacific, now vies with the likes of Jardine
Matheson and the Swire group for the title of Hong Kong's leading business
conglomerate. Citic Pacific's parent in Beijing owns international assets
from aluminium smelting in Australia to steel and pulp paper operations in
north America.
Trading houses such as Poly Group and the Xinxing Group, which is owned by
the PLA's General Logistics Department, may come in time to rival big
Japanese trading companies. Indeed, China's new conglomerates already
resemble Japanese trading houses in one important respect: after the second
world war the Japanese companies numbered many former military officers
among their staff and were run along military lines.
The military's involvement in business is one of the most striking
by-products of 15 years of economic reform. This transformation started in
1978, the year China began opening to the world. Since then sectors such as
electronics and shipbuilding have forged ahead. According to Mr Wu Zhao,
chairman of the Association for the Peaceful Use of Military Industrial
Technology, formed in 1987 to spur defence conversion, some 76 per cent of
production on average in defence factories is now for civilian use.
The decision to beat swords into ploughshares among China's estimated
600-700 defence factories has made China's former arms industries dominant
in some consumer products areas such as motor-cycles, washing machines and
electric fans. The six main defence industries - nuclear, space, aviation,
ordinance, electronics and shipbuilding - account for 20 per cent of China's
machine industry output, by value.
At the same time, general purpose trading, manufacturing and investment
companies have mushroomed under the umbrella of the Central Military
Commission (CMC) - the apex organisation of the PLA and fount of political
power and patronage.
Experts in Hong Kong on the Chinese military have no doubt that the
emergence of companies such as Poly Group and Xinxing Corporation is only
the beginning. 'I think they will develop into small kingdoms, given their
autonomy and independence from other PLA authorities,' says Mr K P Ng, a
research director at the Hong Kong Chinese University.
Military industries under the State Council have also made a surprisingly
quick transformation from secretive offshoots of the old military-industrial
complex to serious corporate players. Among the more successful are
organisations such as China Electronics Industry Corporation (Chinatron),
China Shipbuilding Trading company (CSTC), China North Industries
Corporation (Norinco), China Great Wall Industry Corporation (GWIC), which
is involved in building satellite launch vehicles, and China National
Aero-Technology Import-Export Corporation (CATIC).
Apart from Poly Group, the most active among companies under the direct
control of the PLA are Huitong, a general purpose trading and investment
company; Xinxing, and its sister corporation Sanjiu, or the 999 Group, which
produce pharmaceuticals among many other activities; and Jingan, which is
owned by the People's Armed Police and produces security equipment.
Adding immeasurably to the weight of these corporations-in-the-making is the
leading role in their management of the so-called 'princelings' - sons and
daughters of China's political elite. Well-connected Chinese are deeply
involved in some of the most prominent companies which include:
China Poly Group, founded in 1984 to compete with Norinco in external arms
sales, partly out of envy over the profits being made by Norinco. The
company's name in Chinese, Baoli, means to 'keep the profits'.
The president of China Poly is major-general He Ping, director of the
Equipment Department of the PLA General Staff which is responsible for
overseeing PLA businesses and liaison with the Commission for Science,
Technology and Industry for National Defence (COSTIND) - the lynchpin body
in China's efforts to modernise its military hardware by applying high
technology. Perhaps more important, Major-Gen He is also the son-in-law of
Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, and his wife, Deng Rong, is Deng's
'favourite' daughter and the author of last year's top-selling biography of
the Chinese leader.
Other top figures associated with China Poly include Mr Wang Jun, son of the
late Wang Zhen, a former Long March veteran and Deng associate. In addition
to his duties as chairman of China Poly, Mr Wang jr is also president of
Citic.
The range of China Poly's businesses is vast. In addition to the Hainan port
development its activities include shipping, finance, property, electronics
and telecommunications. It also control two companies listed on the Hong
Kong stock exchange ' Poly Investments and Continental Mariner, a shipping
company.
Norinco has achieved the highest profile among new defence entities with
some 157 factories under its control in a network that extends across China
but whose stronghold is in the heavily-industrialised north-east. Norinco
grew out of the Fifth Ministry of Machine-Building industry, a secretive
organisation responsible for China's conventional weapons manufacture.
Norinco is involved in a broad range of activities, including arms sales,
trading, construction, real estate, finance and car manufacturing. A sign of
its clout is that it is one of few Chinese organisations authorised to raise
capital abroad. Last month it raised Dollars 185m for its China North
Industry Investment trust, listed in Dublin and Singapore.
Xinxing Corporation has spread its tentacles across China with a branch at
virtually every leading logistics depot. Among Xinxing's main businesses is
pharmaceuticals through Sanjiu which has plants in southern China. Xinxing
has also established offices abroad, including one in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong has become increasingly important as a venue for an evolving
relationship between representatives of the PLA and defence industry
businesses and powerful overseas Chinese entrepreneurs. This relationship is
likely to prove mutually beneficial to the broader ambitions of companies
such as China Poly and Xinxing, no less than it will to the designs on the
mainland of Chinese billionaires such as Mr Li Ka-shing. The partnership is
increasingly likely to take the form of joint ventures in areas such as
property and possibly infrastructure development in China.
When Xinxing opened its Hong Kong office with great fanfare in December 1992
on hand to greet Lt Gen Zhang Bin, deputy director of the General Logistics
Department, were a clutch of Hong Kong tycoons, including Mr Li, and Mr T T
Tsui, the Hong Kong and London bus operator with long-standing PLA
connections.
While China's military leaders have looked askance on the money-making of
sections of the PLA, involvement in business now seems so deeply embedded
that it would be impossible to imagine the military withdrawing from its
lucrative sideline activities. There is also a practical reason for this
involvement in business.
China's nominal defence budget for this year stands at Yn52bn, but this
vastly understates the cost of maintaining the Chinese military. Western
military experts believe the actual cost is two or even three times this
amount. Additional funding from business has thus become critical to
maintaining a functioning military at a time when defence has been the poor
relation among China's 'four modernisations'.
However, the PLA high command has become concerned that it may lose control
over these business empires and worried about the widespread perception that
many of those engaged in business have profited personally.
In 1992 the CMC set up an audit commission in an attempt to restrain some of
the excesses. The CMC has also sought to prevent the continued proliferation
of PLA enterprise by consolidating its management at group army level. China
has some 24 group armies, each of which commands about 50,000 troops.
Worries about the 'commercialisation' of the PLA have been expressed by no
lesser figures than generals Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen, vice chairmen of
the CMC. The two Long March veterans warned last year that 'all sorts of
unhealthy attitudes and negative phenomena' were endangering the development
of a professional military. Their warnings have come too late, however, to
prevent soldiers' business or bingshan becoming big business.

At last a seating plan for the London Underground. Rupert Saunders, an
enterprising cove who runs the Clever Map Company, has published a Pounds
2.50 pocket guide which tells where to sit on the London underground for the
speediest connection on leaving the tube.
Passengers taking the Piccadilly line at Knightsbridge for Kings Cross, for
example, should board, the fourth carriage from the front. Beyond Kings
Cross, the tip is to sit in the last carriage.
'If someone saves 10 minutes a day by using the Tube Hopper map, it is the
equivalent of an extra week's holiday a year, ' enthuses Saunders.
Observer would still prefer to know which carriage to sit in to avoid being
mugged.

Thank goodness. The UK economy's day of reckoning has now been postponed.
Bill Martin, chief economist of brokers UBS, who has long been one of the
gloomiest City Cassandras about the state of the UK economy, has had second
thoughts.
After months of predicting that the UK economy would melt down next year,
Martin's team has now officially announced it was wrong. 'Our official
forecast was premature,' admits Martin in a UBS circular. He now predicts
that 1995, like 1994, will 'represent the economy's best inflation and
growth performance for 30 years'.
However, don't get carried away by this upbeat assessment. Martin has not
conceded defeat yet. If strong growth continues, the economy will still
overheat, he predicts - but the shock will now come in 1997, instead of next
year.
If he gets that one wrong then Martin may have to consider following the
example of Goldman Sachs' chief US economist Bob Giordano, and spend more
time with his family.

The things they teach you at Harvard Business School. Greg Dyke, the former
chief executive of London Weekend TV, would probably not have been guest of
honour at last Saturday's annual dinner of Labour's Fabian Society had he
not been on a crash course in management at Harvard in the mid-1980s.
Dyke, the man who made Roland Rat a household name when he was helping
salvage TV-am from union excesses, told the Fabians that he had Harvard to
thank for rekindling his interest in their cause. Expecting to learn about
the virtues of American capitalism, instead he was bombarded with talk about
the need for private companies and employers to grow more ethically
responsible. Suitably impressed, Dyke switched off thoughts of Mrs Thatcher,
and tuned in to Labour's message.
If only getting the Labour party elected was as easy.

Anyone who knows anything about Greek mythology will find Bill Rooney's
choice of come-back vehicle a trifle bizarre. Little more than a year after
he was forced off the board of Spring Ram by institutional investors upset
by three profit warnings in eight months, Rooney has taken control of
Atreus, a bathroom goods supplier. According to Greek legend the House of
Atreus was cursed and the story of his family 'is virtually unrivalled in
antiquity for complexity and corruption', according to the Encyclopedia
Britannia.
At one point Atreus serves Thyestes, his elder brother, the flesh of
Thyestes' own son, whom Atreus had earlier slain. Welcome back Bill.

All rather odd. Sir Donald Gosling, founder and major shareholder of
National Car Parks and the venture capitalists who had planned to buy his
company, are off to lunch at the Savoy on Friday to celebrate the collapse
of their Pounds 650m deal.
The occasion is the Saints and Sinners charity lunch. Is this a sly dig at
venture capitalist Prudential Venture Managers following its unwillingness
to put up the last Pounds 50m? Alternatively, maybe it is a belated
recognition by Gosling that NCP's second largest institutional shareholder
is probably worth keeping happy. Interesting to see who picks up the
champagne bill.

Poland's bankers are not looking forward to New Year's Day. After the
festivities of the night before, they will have to be at their desks busily
lopping noughts off bank balances.
It is all part of a campaign to restore the value of the Polish currency. It
was planned some time ago but has taken longer than expected to implement.
The NBP, the central bank, says that it has been waiting for inflation to
come down before giving the go-ahead. However, there may be other reasons.
Originally the central bank had ordered its new bank notes - depicting
Polish towns - from a German printer. They were ready in 1992 but have not
been issued because the anti-forgery devices are out of date. That's the
official story anyway and the central bank has been at pains to deny what
some newspaper reports suggest is the real reason - not only was some of the
paper for the print run stolen, but a bundle or two of notes fell off the
back of the aircraft coming in to land in Poland.
Whatever the motive the NBP shelved the Polish towns and went to Thomas De
La Rue for a new set costing 'a few hundred billion zlotys' according to
Hanna Gronkiewicz Waltz, the bank's head. These notes depict a trio of
medieval monarchs who are supposed to symbolise the hope that this year's 28
per cent inflation will have fallen to 17 per cent next year and 9 per cent
in 1997.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Halifax and after
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyds Bank's approach to Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society earlier
this year was widely recognised as the start of something big. Yet few
foresaw that it would be the catalyst for an upheaval in the building
society movement on the scale that now seems possible in the light of the
proposed merger between the Halifax and Leeds Permanent building societies.
If the plans for marriage and subsequent conversion into a public listed
company meet with the requisite approvals, nearly a third of the building
society movement's Pounds 280bn assets will disappear overnight. The
psychological shock to the rest of the movement will be traumatic.
There is, of course, nothing completely new in finance. The original merger
between the Halifax Permanent and the Halifax Equitable in 1928, from which
the present Halifax was formed, will remain the biggest historic building
society merger in relation to the size of the industry until the present (or
some other comparable) merger is consummated.
The difference here lies in the change in status, since the Halifax and the
Leeds are proposing to follow Abbey National's route to the stock market. No
building society can henceforth dodge the question of whether mutual
ownership continues to serve a worthwhile purpose.
The case for a wholly separate regulatory regime for a shrinking number of
societies that are banks in all but name will also require radical
rethinking in the Treasury. The wider issue is whether a retreat from
mutuality is a matter for regret.
Regulatory constraints
A high level of home ownership, which was the chief social purpose of the
societies' mutual ownership, has already been achieved. Meanwhile, mutuality
within the framework of the 1986 Building Society Act imposes regulatory
constraints on building societies' attempts to become fully-fledged
financial services groups. By its very definition such a restricted form of
ownership implies lack of access to large-scale capital and an inability to
make acquisitions for paper.
Nor does mutuality provide the best means for dealing with the legacy of the
past. The high streets are overstocked with building society branches - a
consequence of non-price competition in the days of the old building society
cartel. These outlets deliver a proliferation of products that look
increasingly similar. That points ultimately to declining profitability and
the need for fewer branches. The experience of building society mergers so
far is that mutuality does little to promote such rationalisation.
Accountability to shareholders seems more likely to deliver on this score.
Competition policy
That is one reason to feel relatively unconcerned about the competition
policy aspects of the Halifax-Leeds proposal. The two societies' joint 20
per cent share of outstanding mortgage advances may sound high. Yet no other
large developed country has as many nationwide retail banks operating in
such a competitive environment; and the commitment of the Halifax and Leeds
to cutting branch costs hardly points to upward pressure on prices.
For all that, mutuality still imposes discipline in the use of capital. The
Halifax and Leeds, admittedly, are conscious of the way money burned a hole
in the TSB Group's pocket after its flotation and have no wish to raise much
new capital. Yet the recent history of the clearing banks contains notorious
instances of rights issues being squandered - a longer term hazard.
The case for such discipline is unlikely to carry weight with incumbent
building society management. And in the absence of real accountability, a
further contraction in the number of building societies will be driven more
by the survival instincts of management than anything else.
That implies, after Lloyds' initiative with Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, there
may well be attempts to pre-empt unwelcome takeover approaches by making a
comfortable choice of partner under the accommodating regime of mutuality.
It also suggests that the managers of larger building societies may seek to
emulate the directors of privatised utilities in acquiring lucrative share
options via stock market listings. Either way, the game has changed forever.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Discomfort in Europe's south
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the hearts of Europe's policymakers, hope springs eternal.
Faster-than-expected recovery from recession has revived the idea that a
group of countries centred on Germany could attain economic and monetary
union as early as 1997. Yet there is an unfortunate corollary to the
improved prospects for the European 'core'. Economic divergences in the
continent's periphery, particularly the EU's southern members, are
increasing at a disconcerting pace.
Action to cope with the south's economic challenges has been half-hearted or
curbed by political difficulties, or both. This is underlined by
developments as diverse as the problems dogging Italy's 1995 budget plans,
Spain's rejection of advice on structural reform from the International
Monetary Fund, and the delay to Greece's privatisation programme.
These are matters of concern for the whole EU. A growing gap in economic
performance between north and south would greatly strain the EU's cohesion.
It would further impair the EU's ability to help resolve the troubles on its
Mediterranean fringes, increasing the chances that north African instability
could spill over to Europe. In addition, by undermining necessary efforts to
restructure budgetary and farm support arrangements, a widening north-south
gap would upset the EU's planned enlargement to eastern and central Europe.
Economic shortcomings
The shift in Europe's centre of gravity after the fall of the Berlin Wall
has helped to expose the south's economic shortcomings. Corporations seeking
sites for investment regard southern Europe with more scepticism than a few
years ago. In the five years before 1989, annual average growth in Italy,
Spain, Portugal and Greece was 3.5 per cent, 0.3 percentage points above the
EU average. Between 1990 and 1994, growth in these countries has fallen to
1.2 per cent, 0.4 points below the European average.
Greece has been a chronic under-performer for the last decade, but
below-average growth in Spain, Portugal and Italy is much more recent.
Efforts to reduce inflation differentials have been only partly successful,
and prices in all four countries (particularly in Greece) are still rising
at beyond the EU's 3 per cent average. While monetary policy has remained
anti-inflationary, fiscal performances have become increasingly wayward.
According to the Commission's latest forecasts, the four southern states are
the sole EU members where government borrowing will exceed 5 per cent of
gross domestic product in 1995.
Rising indebtedness
Budgetary imbalances have accentuated government debt build-up, especially
in Greece and Italy, where indebtedness is more than 120 per cent of gross
domestic product. Excessive public sector indebtedness is not limited to the
south, as shown by the examples of Belgium or Sweden. During the next two
years, however, according to the Commission's forecasts, debt as a
proportion of GDP in the four southern states will continue to grow, whereas
it will be falling slightly for most other EU members. Even for Spain and
Portugal, the likelihood that debt can approach the Maastricht target of 60
per cent of GDP by the end of the decade is increasingly remote.
Deteriorating fiscal positions in the south have disturbed capital markets.
Yields on southern Europe's bond markets have risen by about 3 percentage
points since January, roughly twice the rise for D-Mark bonds, weighing
heavily on the south's recovery potential. The risk is that large budget
deficits and high interest rates will be self-feeding impediments to growth
and employment.
In these circumstances, governments seeking a return to sustained growth are
walking a tightrope. The south's structural weaknesses cannot be overcome
without painful measures, particularly in reforming labour markets and
welfare systems. The implemention of such corrective action leads to
political difficulties, further lowering investor confidence. Yet without
such restructuring, the task of adjustment will become still more difficult.
If growth migrates permanently from the south, the EU is unlikely to be
robust enough to enlarge itself to the east.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Church not pervasive in Irish
politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr OLIVER O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'No bad thing for Ireland' (November 21), said the
political crisis in Dublin exposed some vital questions, first among them
whether Ireland can claim to be a secular state while the Roman Catholic
Church continues to wield a pervasive influence in political life.
You might care to read your correspondent, John Murray Brown's, reports of
the crisis. Brown barely, if at all, mentions the Roman Catholic Church. The
crisis was about politics and distrust between Mr Dick Spring and Mr Albert
Reynolds, arising principally out of the beef tribunal report last August.
Mr Spring's unexplained reservations about the former attorney general,
promoted and then denounced by Mr Reynolds, had probably as much to do with
the attorney's role in protecting Mr Reynolds in the course of that inquiry
as with the style of the attorney's catholicism.
The delay in the processing of the extradition warrant was the fuse, not the
explosive, in Ireland's political explosion. The politics would have been
the same, no matter what the profession of the child abuser. Despite the
spreading of misleading rumours, no evidence of church interference in due
process was found. It doesn't amount to pervasive influence in political
life. Besides, Irish voters have long since reconciled church attendance
with independent action as citizens. Few people, especially politicians, pay
much attention to what bishops say about political questions, in Ireland as
in England.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Deutsche Bank does not need any
lessons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr N J F B SAMENGO-TURNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your coverage of the news that Deutsche Bank is to move its non-D-Mark
investment banking operation to London, and further integrate Morgan
Grenfell, seemed to smack of a little football-terrace xenophobia and
jingoism (Survey of Germany, November 21). As an independent observer
unconnected with either house, the message I received from the FT was of a
British victory of a sophisticated investment bank showing the way to a vast
banking Euro-bureaucrat.
When it comes down to who is benefiting from whose investment banking
expertise, I feel that you have got it the wrong way round - unless you
believe that a small domestically-focused mergers and acquisitions bank
which made a hash of its equity securities operation can teach a great deal
about non-M&amp;A investment banking to a parent that has topped Eurobond league
tables, has figured heavily in international equity issues, and runs a
thriving range of capital markets operations (including gilts and
derivatives).
Your articles informed me on at least two occasions that investment banking
is an 'Anglo-Saxon culture' business, whatever that ghastly Americanism may
mean. I am no geographer, but I would imagine that such great names as
Warburg, Lehman, Samuel, Schroder, Salomon, Rothschild, Goldman, Hambro and
Kleinwort have at least part of their roots rather closer to Frankfurt than
London. Put another way, maybe the Saxons will triumph over the Anglos, as
Germany's pre-eminent position in industrial Europe is mirrored in the world
of investment banking.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Suddenly we have a world upsurge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suddenly the world upturn has moved so far into its stride that boom may be
a more appropriate word than mere recovery. Indeed commentators from the
financial sector are already worrying whether the boom might not become too
much of a good thing.
These international developments have important implications both for
tomorrow's UK Budget and even more for the meeting between the chancellor
and the governor of the Bank of England eight days later on December 7. For
in the present world environment the last thing the UK economy needs is a
domestic stimulus or even unnecessary red ink in the Budget. The improved
fiscal outlook should be enjoyed entirely in the form of a more rapid move
towards eliminating the budget deficit. Even the CBI accepts that UK base
rates will need to rise by about 1 3/4 percentage points. The first move
should be made in days.
It is fruitless to seek the causes of the pronounced world recovery. There
are inherent tendencies for world demand to rise in line with world
productive capacity; and it is the slumps and booms that require
explanation. The US economy was being actively stimulated by cheap money
until last spring and the subsequent tightening has been well short of
draconian. In West Germany there was not so much a recession as a move from
the excess demand resulting from unification spending.
Unfortunately the interest rates required to remove this excess demand were
too high for the rest of Europe where a genuine recession was produced. But
with German short interest rates now back to normal and a very sharp
recovery in that country's eastern Lander, the special depressing forces
have ended. Least noticed of all, Japan has at long last snapped into a
recovery in spite of continued deflation in domestic producer prices. What
seems to have happened is that Japanese producers have again adjusted to an
excessively high exchange rate and an over-cautious monetary policy by
levering costs and prices downwards.
The US investment firm of JP Morgan contends that capacity utilisation in
industry is already above its long-run average - not just in the US, but in
the OECD as a whole. One reason for this is the shallowness of the recession
of the early 1990s. That recession was greeted with cries of pain because it
struck more than previous downturns at the more articulate financial and
white-collar sectors. The last business cycle was also unusually
unsynchronised; the US was already recovering while Europe was entering
recession.
Morgan economists argue that one or more year of spritely outward growth
will result in operating rates akin to the late 1980s when economies were
very strained. This applies especially to countries such as the US, Canada,
Australia and those 'on the periphery of Europe' that have given their
economies a kick-start from devaluation.
The above analysis is disputed by the rival investment bank of Goldman
Sachs, which argues that companies tend to be too gloomy about their
capacity at this stage of the business cycle; that new types of electronic
equipment can be run more nearly flat out; that some of the inflationary
strains can be taken by importing more from the developing countries; and
that employing more workers, for instance in shift work, can make existing
capacity go further. But the Goldman Sachs economists do not dispute either
the existence of a pronounced world upturn or the need at least for the Bank
of England and the US Federal Reserve to tighten policy again (in spite of
the latter's recent tightening).
My own view is that macroeconomists and financial analysts do not have a
special insight into the technicalities of productive capacity. They would
do much better to analyse world growth in terms of nominal demand, measured
by nominal gross domestic product or one of its derivatives, and whether
that needs to be restrained, stimulated or (most often) left alone.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Flaw in schools' league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SEAN LAWLESS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I feel your A-level league tables ('Schools' league tables', November
22) have a flaw: the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service points
score should be calculated on the top three A-level results gained by the
candidate, not the total for several exams, thus giving a maximum score of
30 points. By counting A-levels above the three results required for
university entrance, your tables become overshadowed by sixth forms that
encourage their highest achieving pupils to take five or more A-levels, for
the purpose of improving the school, and not the pupil's results.
A pupil with three 'A's is clearly able to deal with A-level exams extremely
well, while a pupil gaining a string of five 'C's shows less sign of
understanding his subjects, and should not be counted as having achieved as
much. This is the line taken by university admission tutors. Sean Lawless,

FT  28 NOV 94 / A chip or two off the old barriers: Michael Smith explains
why progress in opening up Europe's energy markets has been slow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five years after launching a campaign to liberalise Europe's energy markets,
the European Commission has made only limited progress in increasing
competition among electricity and gas producers.
Amid concern over the effects on consumers of dismantling what are in many
cases state-owned monopolies, many energy companies have stubbornly resisted
attempts to open up the market.
Liberalising markets will be high on the agenda when European Union energy
ministers meet in Brussels tomorrow. The Commission regards the creation of
a free market in power and gas as one of the most important elements in
creating a single market for goods and services.
'How can you ask, say, the chemicals or metals industries to compete without
access to energy on similar conditions?' asks Mr Claus-Dieter Ehlermann,
director-general of the EU competition directorate. 'What is at stake is the
credibility of the internal market and the competitiveness of European
industry.'
One reason for the slow progress in liberalising European energy markets is
the relative lack of competitive or public pressure. The need to deregulate
parts of the telecommunications market was clear to most EU member states,
as technological changes made existing national and European regulations
less relevant. And consumer pressure for cheaper air fares encouraged
progress in the airlines industry.
In the absence of such pressures, there are powerful lobbies against greater
competition. National energy monopolies have encouraged their customers to
believe that change in gas and electricity markets might threaten safe
delivery of supplies and push up prices. To many consumers, the scope for
competition looks limited because it makes no sense to have rival
electricity grids and gas pipe networks.
There is also opposition to change from the workforces in the gas and
electricity companies, which amount to 1m people in the EU. Concern about
potential job losses is heightened by the experience of the UK electricity
market, one of the first to be deregulated, where some companies have shed
more than half their staff.
A single energy market would not necessarily break up large integrated
monopolies. But it would remove their monopoly rights to gen-erate power and
supply it to the customer.
The Commission argues that such competition would make utilities more
efficient: prices would fall and become more uniform across the Union. It
has adopted a two-pronged approach for achieving this.
The first prong involved forcing countries to end statutory monopolies
enjoyed by national utilities to import and export gas and electricity,
which the Commission says are illegal under EU law. Several cases are
progressing through the courts, though none has yet concluded.
The second prong is legislation to improve competition within member states.
A proposed directive, first drafted in 1992, would require energy companies
to 'unbundle' themselves, by separating the financial accounts of their
production, transport and distribution arms.
This would make it more difficult for these companies to subsidise
loss-making parts of their businesses out of the profits from their monopoly
over distribution of energy. New companies would then find it easier to
enter the market, if they could see that they were able to undercut the
energy utilities in particular parts of the business.
The main stumbling block to agreement on the directive is what is known as
'third party access', obliging energy companies to allow competitors to use
their networks for an 'appropriate' charge.
Thus PowerGen, the privatised UK generator, could supply electricity to
French industrial companies through the French national grid. Currently, if
it wants to export to France, PowerGen can do this only by selling power to
Electricite de France, the monopoly power company.
Third-party access is opposed by most European power and gas companies, with
the support of many members of the European Parliament and some of the
larger governments. They argue that energy needs special protection from
competition, because of the size of investment needed in the industries.
Long-term planning would be more difficult if they were subjected to full
competition, endangering security of supply, at a cost to at least some
customers.
There are also fears of cherry-picking - that large energy users might be
picked off by foreign energy companies, leaving the national company with
the less profitable users. In Italy there are fears that if other countries
were to supply large energy users in the north, the poorer south could be
left to shoulder the costs of the indigenous system.
And companies in countries such as Germany and Belgium fear they could not
compete with their counterparts in, say, France, because of different
regulatory, taxation and social regimes. Some German companies say they are
not against third-party access in principle, and are as efficient as their
foreign competitors. But their prices are higher as a result of an
obligation to buy expensive German coal.
Similarly, Mr Michel Loncour, a strategy manager at Tractebel, the Belgian
energy company, says that competition will be unfair if companies operate
under different national rules: 'Europe needs harmonisation on issues like
environmental protection, the security of nuclear plants, taxation,
subsidies and the cost of capital,' he says.
The Commission is currently considering a common energy policy for Europe,
but agreement is politically difficult and some years away. That offers
little immediate help in creating a free energy market.
The Commission could consider formulating a final directive around the
concessions already made by opponents of more reform. For instance, most
countries would probably agree to unbundling the accounts of electricity
monopolies and introduce competitive tendering for new plants.
In an attempt to win agreement on third-party access, the Commission has
agreed the idea of a 'negotiated', rather than automatic, right to access to
power networks. This would allow host companies to refuse access on the
grounds that security of supply could be threatened, with an arbitration
system for disputes - a compromise that most of those in favour of
liberalisation would consider accepting.
However, opponents to reform think even 'negotiated third-party access' goes
too far. Some, including the French, want to introduce a concept of a
'single buyer' as an alternative to third-party access. Under this
arrangement, deals between electricity users and foreign suppliers would
have to be reached through the host country's transmission system operator,
which would be the sole purchaser of electricity supplies within that
country.
Reformers, already concerned about the concession on 'negotiated'
third-party access, believe the single buyer concept would lead to little
change. 'If too much is conceded, the introduction of competition could be
logjammed for a decade,' says Mr John Baker, chief executive of the UK's
National Power generation company. 'It may be preferable to wait three or
four years, since a delay might enable them to get the important principles
through.'
Free-marketeers like Mr Baker believe that liberalisation is inevitable:
increasingly, countries such as Italy, Spain and the Netherlands are
starting to deregulate their energy industries. In Germany, once a strong
opponent of change, supporters of third-party access include Mr Gunter
Rexrodt, economics minister.
In addition, the Nordic countries that will join the EU next year are likely
to support liberalisation, since they have already deregulated their energy
markets. Nonetheless, the scale of opposition means that real progress on
liberalisation could take years rather than months.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Airport proposals lack support of UK
airline industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr D R HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The call by the free-market Adam Smith Institute for the development of
Northolt and Redhill aerodromes to relieve pressure on Heathrow and Gatwick
('Plea for two more London airfields', November 21) is not supported by the
UK's airline industry.
The fundamental flaw in the Northolt and Redhill proposals is that they will
not create new peak time capacity at Heathrow and Gatwick to accommodate an
extra 30m passengers per year, as the Adam Smith Institute claims. This is
because business aircraft currently only use those take-off and landing
slots at Heathrow and Gatwick that cannot be used by airlines because they
fall at the wrong time of day for scheduling purposes.
Although Northolt is close to Heathrow, surface links and, in poor traffic
conditions, the road connection along the A40, M40 and M25 are too
unreliable. The Heathrow Express will not pass near Northolt. The
attractiveness of Northolt to interline and feeder traffic is therefore very
low. Furthermore, Northolt is used for ministerial flights and will soon be
the base for the Queen's Flight. Commercial schedules cannot be interrupted
by these categories.
The current Redhill proposal is too small in scale and has too short a
runway to provide a genuine relief for Gatwick. No leading airline supported
the proposal at the recent planning enquiry.
While we have no objection to the creation of a dedicated business aircraft
facility at Northolt, airlines believe that new capacity must be provided
where it will expand and complement existing facilities along the
Heathrow-Gatwick axis.
We hope the secretary of state for transport will initiate the process of
ensuring that London's two main airports will avoid gridlock and that
business and leisure passengers will retain the ability to gain access to
airports of their choice.

Not the cheeriest way to round off Monday, but The New Middle Ages (11.15pm,
BBC 2) is totally riveting. Expert predictions of new plagues, mysticism and
millennial panic are all the more impressive for lack of portentousness or
hysteria. Old enemies return in newly medicinally resistant shape 'almost in
cataclysmic proportions'. New killers emerge, including Ebola, a 'level four
monster' according to American Richard Preston (Aids is only level two),
which needs a biological space-suit to handle and could, if released, assume
Black Death dimensions. Professor Norman Stone evokes the Wars of the Roses
and 'robber barons' to describe our new tribalism.
Yet, as the medieval mind held to religious certainties, so today scientists
fitfully discern a pattern in nature, a 'mysterious organising principle'.
And the fanatic, unctuous gleam of a member of the architectural profession
certainly recalls the privileged medieval church: unaccountable, disdainful
of the populace, and inflicting misery in the name of its own superior
wisdom.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Arts: Soprano shines in glowing, timeless Traviata
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was no lack of advance publicity for the Royal Opera's new production
of La traviata, though in the circumstances that was not surprising. Any
opera-house appearance by Sir Georg Solti, now 82, is going to be an event,
even more so with him conducting La traviata for the first time in his life.
When he invited Richard Eyre, the artistic director of the National Theatre,
to try his first venture into opera, the stage was set for a major operatic
event.
What the hype failed to do was get the right person in the spotlight. When
Verdi wrote La traviata, the role of the conductor was only just being
properly defined and producers were non-existent. The opera stands or falls
depending on its lead soprano. In Venice, in 1853, it was a fiasco (Fanny
Salvini-Donatelli was overweight and off-form). At Covent Garden, last
Friday, the soprano shone and the whole evening glowed with her.
Angela Gheorghiu is a rising star. The Royal Opera has nurtured her
carefully over the past few years, starting her off with Zerlina in Don
Giovanni, then moving her on to Puccini's Mimi, and its patience has been
rewarded. Making her entrance as if she is stepping out of a Winterhalter
canvas, she looks and sounds born to play Violetta. One dab of iced water
out of the champagne bucket and she is running up and down the scales of
'Sempre libera' as if she has been singing the music all her life.
Perhaps her Romanian predecessor, Ileana Cotrubas, hit the solar plexus
harder (her joyous laughter in Violetta's final moments still sends shivers
down the spine 20 years on), but even she had not mastered every detail like
this. Gheorghiu barely sings a phrase that has not been refined with the
vocal equivalent of a nail-file. Every dot and dash in Verdi's score, every
tone colour, was there; and what a joy to hear so much quiet singing.
That is where Solti has played his part. Decca is recording these
performances live (word about Gheorghiu has spread quickly in the business),
and it will get music-making as scrupulously prepared as in any studio
recording. Solti was adamant about performing the opera without the usual
cuts, so we get rarely-heard second verses, not just automatic repeats, but
each time given with new meaning. One could sense the audience was really
listening.
For his part Richard Eyre has worked with Gheorghiu to build a believable
character. This is basically a traditional production, which keeps its eye
on the ball. Sound old principles like character development count for more
than eye-catching quirks. The first meeting of Violetta and Alfredo is a
typical example: he starts by sitting modestly on the other side of the
drawing-room, then circles his prey before tentatively planting a kiss on
her cheek in time to the duet's final chord.
Like Gheorghiu, Frank Lopardo as Alfredo sings with exemplary attention to
detail and sensitivity - their duets together are lovers' whispers, not
grand opera bawling. But I do wonder what they would make of him in Milan,
where Italianate top notes count for more than musicianship. Leo Nucci lacks
the vocal elegance for Giorgio Germont (try the old 78s recorded by
Battistini) but worked hard to phrase broadly under Solti's tutelage. There
were useful cameos from Leah-Marian Jones as a spiky Flora and Gillian
Knight as Annina.
Are Bob Crowley's needlessly lavish designs the main drawback? Not so far as
design quality is concerned per se. Swirling staircases and
heavily-ornamented gold ceilings make handsome settings for the public
scenes, although it was illogical to have the stage area so cramped for
those when the private scenes are so spacious. Alfredo's country retreat is
a veritable palace and Violetta dies in what looks like a white-shuttered
aircraft hangar. The music and the drama demand the opposite.
The problem is that the bulkiness of the sets makes the intervals as long as
the acts in between. I suspect that audiences in the future may curse this
production as they go into Act 3 at the time of night when they were hoping
to be on the train home. For this run of performances, though, nobody is
likely to mind. Forget the 23.10 from Waterloo. So long as Gheorghiu and
Solti are making music, time stands still.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Arts: Warm welcome for Khovanshchina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No harder to pronounce than 'Khrushchev' (and much easier than 'Shchedrin'),
Mussorgsky's ultra-Russian Khovanshchina earned a warm welcome to the
English National Opera repertoire last week. Perhaps for budgetary reasons,
the ENO seems to have staged fewer historical epics of late than it used to,
though its Cinemascope stage invites them. Still, the number of
epic-historical operas that have been composed is hugely disproportionate to
the number of masterpieces; and among those few, Khovanshchina - a bag of
'unfinished' sketches though it is - must stand near the top in any
thoughtful ranking.
In the ENO programme-book, Paul Griffiths argues persuasively that
'unfinished' and fragmentary was just what Khovanshchina had to be. It is
the Russian opera about the looming impact of Peter the Great; but neither
Peter nor his close relatives could be depicted on the stage. Therefore
Mussorgsky gave his dispassionate attention to the lesser players and their
factions, drafting his own libretto as he went: the worried conservative
boyars, the Westernising sophisticates, the unregenerate Old Believers in
ancient orthodoxy.
Since they all lost, they could not shape the ultimate story, which neither
began nor ended with them. In Francesca Zambello's cool, skilful production,
the rival groups strut their forces and connive in turn, none favoured above
the others. The focal point of Alison Chitty's sets is a metal-frame pillar
which unfolds to become walls, bridges, bleachers; the only elaborate
costumes are those needed to establish roles and ranks. The complicated
plotting is rendered unusually clear - and mercifully it takes three and a
half hours instead of the predicted four.
The leaders are cast from strength: Willard White's imperious, dignified
Prince Khovansky, Kim Begley's dandyish Prince Golitsyn, Gwynne Howell's
lofty Dosifey, the Old Believers' leader. For greater depth of character, we
should probably need to have real Russians. The young bass-baritone Paul
Whelan makes a striking debut as the sinister boyar Shaklovity, with Howard
Haskin a clever Scribe, and as tragic Marfa Anne-Marie Owens is all anxious
urgency and warmth. Cathryn Pope and Maria Moll make creditable work of
their shrill, ungrateful roles as Emma and Susanna.
On Thursday the conductor Sian Edwards found vivid touches in many scenes,
less in the way of steady breadth. The sense of panoramic unfolding was
unconfident: she tends to run at things. (Even the marvellous 'dawn' prelude
stammered slightly, with a singularly pallid clarinet and a misfired
climax.) Later performances should expand more grandly. The second act
risked sagging, though at the start of the third the sight of Khovansky
dallying with his Persian slave-girls in a swimming-bath cheered everybody
up.
The ENO has opted for Shostakovich's version. Mussorgsky got no further with
a full orchestral score than two short passages; as with Boris Godunov,
Rimsky-Korsakov published his own version after the composer's death - more
expertly bright than the amateur Mussorgsky could have devised (or might
have wanted to), much cut and with many fussy 'corrections' to the stark
harmonies.
In the latter respects Shostakovich is incomparably more faithful, but he
indulges a very sweet tooth for chiming effects. (Mussorgsky had been dead
ten years when Tchaikovsky first introduced the celesta for his Sugar-Plum
Fairy.) They supply instant theatrical Affekt, of course  - just as Rimsky's
prinked-out orchestration did, and no less of a modern distortion. This fine
ENO production should gain depth and patina with time, without need of those
dubious cosmetics.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Arts: MTV awards in Berlin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was an awesome sight. The curtain rose to reveal one of the most dramatic
backdrops in the world, the Brandenburg Gate; not a painted pastiche but the
real thing, swathed in blue light. After this moment of grandeur the first
MTV European Music Awards found their level when a bearded figure with
solicitor's glasses bounded on stage looking worryingly like Sammy Davis
Jnr. He turned into George Michael singing, of course, 'Freedom'.
Berlin was the perfect spot for this new pop prize, not because of its
political significance but because pop music, and the clubs it spawns, is
about the only activity Ossies and Westerners enjoy together. They certainly
mobbed the venue, described as 'the largest temporary structure in the
world', and built abutting the Gate. And they did not seem to mind the Coca
Cola logo crawling all over it.
This was the West in all its tacky brilliance.
The new awards, called the Matthews for no obvious reason, seemed
immediately timeless: media creations like supermodel Naomi Campbell and a
girl from Baywatch handing out 'globes' to stars who either smarmed over, or
clowned with, the audience, a reputed 240m homes world wide.
To some amazement Take That was voted Best Group, which suggests we must
expand their shelf life from four to five years. Among the other newish
names, Prodigy won Best Dance, and Crash Test Dummies, Breakthrough Artist
of 1994.
But the awards also showed up the terrifying conservatism of pop - Best Male
was 35-year-old Bryan Adams; Best Rock band Aerosmith, the heavy metal
outfit blasting through their third decade. Mariah Carey was the safe Best
Female.
The event was cherishable for its musical vignettes: the decidely quaint
Bjork, who crawled out of a hole dressed like a raspberry mousse, skipped
around the stage singing 'Big Time Sensuality', rolled around on her back
and disappeared again into weirdo land; George Michael, who is in legal
limbo, premiering a new song (a certain smash) called 'Like Jesus to a
Child', backed by enough strings to parcel Christmas; Tom Jones, who after
years as an object of mockery has suddenly become a pop icon, introducing
the show with inadvertent Teutonic humour; and, most priceless of all, a
cameo song from 'the artist formerly known as Prince', climaxing with the
sad mantra, 'Peace to George Michael. Peace to MTV. But death to Prince.'
That's one mixed-up mannikin millionaire.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Media Futures: Salford hits superhighway. . . - Stephanie
Flanders explains how the city plans to make the most of broadband cable
networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Think of the path-breakers in the information revolution, and your mind
probably turns to business moguls like Bill Gates or techno-wizards at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Few would add Salford City police
force to the list. Yet the partners in a new venture in north-west England
are aiming to do just that.
Nynex CableComms, one of the three largest cable operators in the UK, is
teaming up with Salford's city council and universities to make the area,
near Manchester, a test-bed for exploring the interactive potential of
broadband cable networks in the provision of local services.
They are not there yet. But the project is already helping to overturn some
of the received wisdom about where the first lanes on the information
superhighway might lead.
The American-owned cable operator, the licensed cable provider for the
region, has spent the past six months agreeing the terms of the experiment
with local partners. These are: the City of Salford, the University of
Salford and University College Salford (which will merge into a single
university in the middle of 1996).
Provisionally entitled 'GemiSys 2000', the plan is that the three parties
will collaborate in setting up local experimental broadband services in a
range of public-sector settings. 'We're not talking about the traditional
video-on-demand type stuff,' says John Edwards, Nynex's regional director in
Salford. 'The five areas are crime prevention, community service, health,
education and training and local business development.'
The choice of sectors emerged from discussions with public servants from all
over the city, held earlier this year. Experiments in the US with a
Massachusetts-based interactive medicine channel and various
distance-learning programmes have already shown the scope for applying the
new fiber-optic technology to health and education. But crime prevention?
'The acting chief superintendent of police was at one of the sessions,'
explains Jane Bentley, one of the project co-ordinators at University
College Salford. 'Nynex gave a quick technical demonstration, and that
triggered a lot of ideas. We were worried at first, because the policeman
was the only one not saying anything. But right at the end, he suddenly came
out with a whole list of ways he could use the network: everything from
sending out high-quality identikit images to transmitting DNA and other
records to other stations.'
It will be several years before some of the more ambitious ideas are
translated into reality, if ever. But the partners are hoping to start early
pilot projects in most, if not all, of the five areas by the start of next
year.
'There's a number of opportunities that I think could be exploited pretty
readily,' says John Willis, chief executive of the city of Salford. 'For
example, we can't afford to staff as many council information centres as
we'd like. I think we could move fairly quickly towards using the network to
supply information about local services more efficiently. We're talking
months, rather than years.'
For their part the two universities are planning to use the project to build
on their established interest in developing commercial and educational
applications for the new information technologies.
'The Open University, as currently conceived, has taken current technology
about as far as it's possible to go,' says John Squires, principal of
University College Salford. 'What we're talking about here, among other
things, is the possibility for a kind of Open University, Mark 2, that
exploits the benefits of interactivity in an accessible and exciting way.'
For the cable operator, which expects to invest around Pounds 20m in the
project, it is clearly an opportunity to foster goodwill among the local
community. This can be in short supply for a company that spends most of its
time digging up streets. But the company also sees a long-run commercial
rationale.
John Edwards, regional manager for Nynex, admits that the company's earliest
encounters with local councils are usually to discuss holes in the road and
burst water pipes. 'You try to offer them the carrot of the broadband
network that will follow. Initially, they're not that interested: they want
to know why the roads are in such a mess. But more recently we've had some
very positive discussions.'
Cable operators elsewhere in Britain have similarly tried to foster good
community relations within their franchise areas. 'The geographical nature
of the franchise system means that the operators are very locally focused',
says Niall Hickey, press spokesmen for the Cable Communications Association.
'They want to establish themselves as good corporate citizens.'
This has led a number of companies to build up links with local schools and
other public bodies. In Croydon, for example, United Artists Communications
has now cabled up around 85 per cent of the local secondary schools, at
heavily discounted prices. The company is now working with local teachers to
see how scheduled cable programmes can help in teaching different parts of
the curricula.
By and large, such projects have tended to look at how schools and others
might take advantage of cable services that already exist. But the
commercial - and technological - bottom line to all the civic-worthiness is
the need to foster demand for fiber-optic services which have yet to be
invented.
The UK cable industry plans to invest around Pounds 10bn by the end of the
decade laying cable networks nationwide. At present, cable providers can
earn a return on this investment offering entertainment, a banned segment of
the market for British Telecom, as well as standard telephone services. But
the ban will be lifted sooner or later - sooner, if BT's lobbying is
successful.
By then, BT is likely to be able to offer popular video-on-demand services
over its existing telephone network. All the cable companies would like to
see evidence that they will be able to earn a return from services which are
only possible on their (higher-capacity) networks.
Nynex has now laid cable for about one fifth of the 2.5m homes, and 150,000
businesses, in its 17 franchise areas. Salford is a little further
developed: the company hopes to have 40 per cent of the local network laid
by the end of next year.
It will be a while before there is a comprehensive network nationwide, so
most of the first practical demonstrations will necessarily be
geographically confined. But the logic of the Salford project is that
finding ways to let people interact, locally, is not merely a stop-gap to
them interacting with the world outside.
There are two reasons for this. First, local public agencies could be a
fertile source of potential fiber-optic applications in their own right,
responsible for a wide range of information and activities to which the new
technology could usefully be applied.
The second reason is that it is not only suppliers of new technology that
must walk before they can run. The development of applications must, to some
extent, be demand-led. And consumers and businesses are more likely to think
of new products to demand if they have already seen the network fill a local
niche.
'No-one is denying that broadband networks can allow you to be talking to
the world', says Carl Grose, executive director of Nynex for the north-west.
'But when it comes down to it, you're still talking about people. We're not
going to make money offering facilities that are somehow 'worldwide', but
are actually anonymous at a local level.'
Critics bemoan the lack of a 'big picture' in the government's piecemeal
approach to re-cabling the UK for the interactive era, since it could mean
that some parts of the country get left behind.
Yet the Salford project indicates that, for all the worries about universal
coverage, some individual communities could benefit from the rather limited
horizons of the companies laying cable in their area. Indeed, Salford's
first trip down the information superhighway may be just round the corner.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Media Futures: Magazines score big with factor X
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new breed of magazines is making a splash in the US. So-called Generation
X publications with self-consciously unconventional covers and enigmatic
names like Who Cares, Bikini, Wired and Monk, are the latest trend in
magazine publishing. They are aimed at - and usually published by - the
18-to-30-year-olds who comprise Generation X, and their numbers are
expanding fast. Among this year's entrants: Swing, Axcess and Might.
The slant of the magazines offers a new way to court a demographic segment
that
the entertainment and advertising industries have found elusive and
difficult to please.
'They allow advertisers to appeal to young trend-setters,' says Harvey
Goldhersz, assistant media director and Generation X guru at the Grey
Advertizing agency in New York.
Early Generation X magazines were launched with low budgets and low
circulations, but the latest versions have more financial beef behind them.
The magazines will not reveal the size of their funding, but savvier ones
like Swing, Wired and Axcess are sleek and laden with advertising. Swing,
which bowed in last month, reportedly sold a respectable 200,000-plus copies
of its first issue.
Magazines like this can be a god-send, says Goldhersz, because they allow
advertisers 'to tap into the mindset of Generation X and keep
up with what's hot and what's not.'
The term Generation X was coined because of the difficulty of labelling
today's 18-to-30-year-olds. Unlike the baby boomers of the 1970s and the
'me' generation of the 1980s, Generation X seems to older observers to lack
strong identifying characteristics.
The magazines' editorial content offers some clues to the vagaries of
today's youth. Unconventionality is a key feature. James Monk, editor of
Monk magazine, for instance, leaves messages calling himself 'The Mad Monk'
and can only be reached at various motels across the US.
Many of the magazines place as much emphasis on technology as on clothes.
They interview bosses of multimedia and software firms, and run articles on
microchips, the Internet and virtual reality. Most of them attract a great
deal of technology advertising, along with more predictable ads for
clothing, music and entertainment. Who Cares shows yet another side of
Generation X: it is
targeted at young volunteer workers.
The magazines may not work for all advertisers, some of which may well stick
to tried-and-true outlets like MTV and Sports Illustrated. But many
advertisers seem happy to have found a new way of communicating with such a
huge number of consumers.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Media Futures: . . . but drivers face bumpy ride - Study
highlights first skirmish in a UK multimedia war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Traffic is beginning to build on the European information superhighway.
Some vehicles are still experimental. The Unom project (Users, Network
Operators and Manufacturers), for example. has Matra Ericsson Telecom as
prime contractor, and aims to bring banking advice and facilities to
customers through self-service kiosks. It is funded by the EU's advanced
telecommunications research programme.
Others are run-in and carrying passengers. In Denmark, Homevision, now three
years old, is distributing multimedia information - text together with video
pictures - about residential properties for sale over its network.
In the UK, Wigwam Information is providing a similar service and has five
trial sites, including an estate agency owned by the TSB high street bank.
The criminal element has not been slow to take advantage of these services,
however. In Sweden, video footage of the interior of a house sent over the
network was used to plan a burglary.
These examples of current developments on the information superhighway are
used by Analysys, a Cambridge-based telecommunications consultancy, to
underline its conviction that multimedia is here to stay, driven by growing
demand for information and entertainment and the declining cost of computers
and communications.
In a new report it warns that existing players are in for a bumpy ride. In
particular, it sees British Telecommunications' announcement earlier this
month of market trials of video-on-demand, home shopping and banking over
its existing network as the first skirmish in a UK multimedia war.
The spoils for the winner will be considerable. According to Analysys: 'For
the incumbent telecoms operators, this changing environment represents an
opportunity to establish leadership in the new generation of fixed telecoms
services that will succeed basic telephony.
'Domination of broadband provision in the local loop will be the key; the
first operator to reach the home or small/medium-sized enterprise with
affordable broadband access will be in an unassailable position for many
years to come.'
Broadband refers to the network capacity needed to transmit voice, text and
video interactively over telecommunications lines. The local loop is the
connection between a telephone subscriber's home and the telephone exchange.
In Britain, BT is forbidden from broadcasting entertainment over its network
under government rules that will not be reviewed until 2001. This is to give
the fledgling cable companies the opportunity to establish themselves in the
market place. However, cable companies are allowed to offer voice telephone
services, and Analysys says that in the short term these services offer
lower risk than multimedia: 'Demand is well established and equipment to
support them is readily available at low cost.'
It goes on to warn, however: 'Cable TV operators should neither ignore the
long-term potential of multimedia, nor delay so long that they lose their
current advantage.'
Choosing the critical point at which to enter the conflict and what
resources to employ will remain difficult questions for the big players.
Despite a sharp decline in the cost of technology, building a network to
support multimedia services still requires substantial investment. 'Network
operators will need to be confident that there is scope for adequate
returns,' Analysys says, pointing out that in business it may be difficult
to justify investment in multimedia services qualitatively.
'A recent trial of internal video-conferencing for a financial institution
in London found that away-from-desk time could be reduced by 60 per cent.
But real gains in productivity are difficult to isolate from other factors
influencing performance,' says Analysys. Residential users, on the other
hand, may be prepared to pay for a broad range of services through basic
subscriptions and additional premium payments for special services.
Analysys argues that these charges are unlikely to meet the cost of
providing the service and that part of the income for the network operator
or service provider will have to come from savings in overheads.
A retailer, for example, could make substantial savings by cutting down on
retail premises and warehousing. Electronic payment for goods could
eliminate much of the administration costs of traditional payment systems.
Advertising is another potential source of revenue, although it is by no
means clear how it might operate on the information superhighway.
Subscribers might pay a premium for accepting material without advertising
or receive a discount for accepting it.
Analysys says the advent of multimedia services will bring fundamental
reforms in long-distance telecoms tariffs for both residential and business
customers, pointing out that existing costs would put, for example,
video-on-demand well beyond the pocket of the average subscriber.
It will also have profound consequences for the regulation of telecoms
services throughout Europe. 'There is a great deal of ambiguity in existing
regulatory frameworks which must be resolved quickly if early growth is to
be encouraged ..Europe must create a uniform environment across different
member states if it is to realise the full potential of networked
multimedia,' says Analysys. There will be no room, in other words, for
drivers on the wrong side of the superhighway.

FT  28 NOV 94 / People (Names in the News): The peak of Groen's career?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A holiday in the Himalayas would seem to be the perfect spot for pondering
the future of one's career if one lives in the unending flatness of the
Netherlands, writes Ronald van de Krol. Or so it was for Harry Groen, the
driving force behind the international expansion of Dutch credit insurer
NCM, who returned from Nepal last week and announced he would be resigning
in May after more than 30 years at the company.
His surprise resignation is the second big upheaval within the three-man NCM
board this year. In August, the deputy chairman Dick Bruinsma quit abruptly
in circumstances which have never been fully explained. Bruinsma has not yet
been replaced.
Groen denies that his own departure is the result of tension with the
company's board of supervisors following Bruinsma's resignation. 'After 31
years at NCM, of which 20 years were in a director's role and seven spent as
chairman, the time had come to reconsider my future,' he says.
Still only 50, Groen joined NCM as a 20-year-old clerk and quickly worked
his way up the corporate ladder. Under his stewardship, the credit insurer
took a great leap into international expansion when NCM acquired Britain's
Export Credits Guarantee Department when the UK government privatised in
1991. Since then, it has found partners or opened offices in Israel, Sweden,
Norway and Belgium.
Groen says he has absolutely no idea what the future holds for him now. 'No
idea' is also his response to whether he will stay in financial services or
even whether he will remain in Amsterdam.

FT  28 NOV 94 / People (Names in the News): Riverso - mutual benefit to
Barings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As if Alitalia chairman Renato Riverso did not have enough to do piloting
Italy's state airline through a turbulent restructuring, he has now taken on
the chairmanship of Baring Brothers (Italia), writes Andrew Hill.
There are five professionals in Barings' Milan office who maintain close
contact with another five-strong team in London. Small beer, compared with
the sprawling Alitalia empire, or Riverso's previous remit as chairman and
managing director of IBM Europe. Nevertheless, Riverso, 61, sees the job
taking up '10 or 20 per cent' of his time, as against 50 per cent at
Alitalia.
Paradoxically, he thinks supporting foreign competition could give a boost
to the underdeveloped Italian investment banking sector. 'The Italian
financial world needs to grow in knowledge and experience in the various
segments of the business, and this is an area where the contribution of
foreign banks is vital,' says Riverso.
Barings, London's oldest merchant bank, is keen to advise on more
privatisations, and expand corporate finance advice to the country's
thriving small- and medium-sized companies. Indeed, the only area in which
the new recruit is unlikely to benefit Barings is in winning more business
from Alitalia itself: the airline is advised by JP Morgan, admits Riverso.

cockpit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
There were rumours earlier this year that Jean Pierson, chief executive of
Airbus Industrie, was going to eject from the cockpit of the world's second
biggest aircraft maker, writes John Ridding. However, the decision to ask
him to stay on for another three years suggests that Mr Airbus may at last
be able to push through a long overdue shift to a less unwieldy corporate
structure.
By extending Pierson's contract until March 1988, shareholders of the
four-nation aerospace consortium have opted not to change both the chairman
and chief executive of Airbus in the same year. Daimler-Benz chairman Edzard
Reuter took over as chairman of the Airbus supervisory board last March and
the renewal of Pierson's contract not only reduces the risk of turbulence in
the boardroom but maintains the balance between French and German interests
in the consortium. Aerospatiale of France and Dasa of Germany both hold a
37.9 per cent stake, while British Aerospace owns 20 per cent and Spain's
Casa owns 4.2 per cent.
The maintenance of the Franco-German division of the top two positions was
not a foregone conclusion. Germany, through Dasa, has been seeking to extend
its influence in the day-to-day running of the company and had considered a
reshuffle of the management.
British Aerospace, Dasa and Pierson have argued that a shift towards the
status of an ordinary limited company is increasingly necessary. It would
increase the transparency of the organisation and promote greater
efficiency. Airbus is not obliged to publish audited accounts and acts more
as a marketing consortium whose members own the group's assets and share
manufacturing contracts. Now that the 54-year old Pierson has been
reconfirmed, one of his first tasks may be to push through a reform of
Airbus's legal status as a GIE or groupement d'interet economique.
Such a change would help Pierson in his principal challenge - closing the
gap on Boeing. In this respect 1994 has started rather well, with Airbus
winning orders for 69 new aircraft, or 55 per cent of the market for
aircraft of more than 100 seats. As the consortium admits, however, this is
a short time by the standards of the airline industry. It is also a short
time in terms of Pierson's new tenure.

FT  28 NOV 94 / People: Germany's man of tomorrow and his problems of today
/ A look at the challenge facing Jurgen Ruttgers, recently appointed as the
country's first minister for the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Freshly installed as Germany's first minister for the future, Jurgen
Ruttgers faces a busy time dealing with some matters from the past before he
can hope to look very far ahead.
One job in particular - the establishment of a national academy of sciences
 -seems tailored to provide him with the experience he will need when he
gets round to dealing with the responsibilities loaded on to his 43-year-old
shoulders by Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Ruttgers, head of a combined super-ministry in charge of education, science,
technology and research policies, has already been warned by friendly
observers that the federal (some might say tribal) make-up of the German
scientific community provides it with an in-built resistance to
centralisation and political tampering.
But Bonn has decreed that a national body is needed to complement and
provide a point of contact with similar organisations in other
industrialised countries. During Ruttgers' maiden ministerial speech on
Friday, he won promises of support from the opposition Social Democrats,
despite lingering suspicions that the academy of sciences might turn out to
be a pure propaganda factory.
It is now up to Ruttgers to build the necessary consensus, which will
require him to test in an alien environment the skills of persuasion which
he has hitherto only applied in smoke-filled back rooms in the Bundestag.
The new minister was formerly chief whip to Chancellor Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union,
and respected among conservatives and Social Democrat opponents alike as a
thoughtful and persuasive politician.
Since he first took his seat in the Bundestag in 1987, he appears to have
risen through the upper parliamentary atmosphere without creating any of the
enemies customarily found smouldering in a shooting star's wake. He endeared
himself to his party leadership by taking on complex and apparently
thankless assignments, such as the challenge of an esoteric and decade-old
inquiry into how to monitor and assess the impact of new technologies on
society.
It was a process initially regarded with deep suspicion by the liberal Free
Democrats, the junior coalition partners, and the opposition. But Ruttgers
won through, and now the Bundestag has a modest advisory bureau: not because
the government wanted it, but because Ruttgers apparently came to believe in
the concept.
'Those who want to take advantage of the liberating potential of technology
must improve their understanding of the short- and long-term effects and
side-effects of (related) political decisions,' he was to comment later.
As that quotation suggests, Ruttgers, described as using his brain more than
his elbows while in the chief whip's job, may not be the snappiest wordsmith
in the Bundestag. But his adherence to such principles is likely to make him
more than a match for the Greens and other outright techno-antagonists in
parliament.
He returned to the theme again on Friday when he repeated a previous
acknowledgement that there were limits scientific progress could not
overstep, particularly where human dignity might be impeached. But the
question of whether mankind was already capable of doing everything it had
to be able to do to handle hunger, unemployment, sickness and environmental
damage demanded an answer, he said.
Principles aside, the minister of the future also showed himself a master of
the art of making a promise and then suggesting that its fulfilment might
not be terribly important.
Spending on future-oriented projects would be increased, he proclaimed. But
money was not the real issue. 'Innovation starts in the head,' he said, and
German minds were more in need of change and innovation than any
departmental budget. The Jeremiahs and doubters had the upper hand, he
added.
He will find no shortage of such types in regional educational authorities,
nor among the autonomy-minded scientific research institutes, where the
minister is charged with balancing the various and often conflicting
requirements of vested interests in local, regional and federal government,
industry and academia.
One of the chancellor's favourite projects, for example, is to reduce the
time students spend at university before entering work. As the chancellor
enjoys saying, Germany cannot afford to educate people up to the age of 30
and then allow them to start drawing retirement pensions at 60.
Industry, meanwhile, demands that university study should be funded by loans
rather than grants, and complains that highly-specialised German college
courses turn out too few of the business-minded, broadly-based graduates
increasingly to be found on the payrolls of international competitors.
At the same time, the business world demands that 'excessive' expenditure on
basic research in government-funded institutes should be diverted into work
more relevant to the needs of an economy which has a structural deficit in
innovation. According to the electronics industry association, ZVEI, only 50
per cent of basic research projects in Germany have any economic relevance.
The dislocation of the relationship between business and government, the
responsibility for which many lay at the door of a neglectful Chancellor
Kohl himself, has been painfully exposed by the wrench of recession.
The coalition's ideas for an academy of science and a research, technology
and innovation council as a central clearing house for political, business
and scientific ideas, is intended as part of the cure for the neglect.
Drafting grand ideas and even leading the intended participants to the
meeting table is the easy part. Planting the idea that innovation might
start in their heads is the real job facing the minister of the future, who
will be assured of a substantial future of his own if he pulls it off.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Architecture: Welcomed in the hillside - The work of Niall
Phillips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I have long admired the work of the architect Niall Phillips. There has been
a spate of publicity for his new buildings in Wales, and the announcement of
a Royal Institute of British Architects award for the Castell Henllys
educational centre in Dyfed marks his Bristol-based firm as one of the most
outstanding in Britain.
During the 1970s, Phillips worked with two brothers who described themselves
as 'artist constructors'. Their work was largely in Somerset and in and
around Bristol, and it represented a bold - if sometimes awkward - attempt
to bring good modern architecture to the English village and countryside.
In many ways the Organ brothers were catalysts because they saw clearly
where run-of-the-mill modernism had gone so wrong. They also saw the low
quality of so much speculative housing development that appeared on the
edges of most villages in the 1960s.
Much of the inspiration for Phillips's work comes from his intense regard
for the site. His Welsh buildings are all in beautiful countryside, but they
are enhancers, not damagers. They grow from the land - not by some phoney
imitation of the vernacular but by original inspiration.
He set up his own office in 1981 in Bristol having enjoyed a time working on
the repair of old buildings on a Society for the Protection of Ancient
Buildings scholarship. This undoubtedly helped his appreciation of materials
and his understanding of the integrity of old structures. Many houses on the
Welsh borders have benefited from his skills, and he is an active
conservationist working with the Vivat Trust and rescuing unwanted and
unloved buildings.
His work came to my attention particularly in connection with the conversion
of some farmyard buildings that had been covenanted to the National Trust.
The conversion of Lower Treginnis farm, near St David's, for the Farms for
City Children charity (which takes inner-city children on working breaks to
the countryside) is both sensitive and vigorous.
There are wonderful features at Treginnis - windows low enough to the ground
for small children to look out of; a great bay window in the dining room;
comfortable (but not twee) inglenook fireplaces.
The Welsh Wildlife Centre is a very special building. Phillips won the
commission in a limited competition and the brief was for a centre which
would include a field laboratory, classrooms, restaurant, an exhibition room
and the inevitable shop.
The site is on the south bank of the River Teifi near a disused railway line
that once ran north to Cardigan. The client was the Dyfed Wildlife Trust,
which was sensitive in its briefing about the need for an energy-efficient
building that could demonstrate 'the sustainable use of natural resources.'
The immediate environment was considered 'fragile', although rich in the
flora and fauna of the river marshes.
By deciding to let the new building nestle its three storeys against a steep
escarpment, the architect both sheltered the structure and made it feel at
home. By going to three storeys, less of the vulnerable land was used up by
the footprint of the building, and the top floor could be used for the cafe
with glorious views over the reed beds.
From behind, the building simply shows its timber galleries and wooden
shingle roof. This unassuming and quiet elevation is little preparation for
the agreeable shock that you are in for on reaching the front, where the
shop and exhibition area and the main restaurant are housed behind an
elegant glass wall, beneath a roof that is curved like a Welsh coracle.
The drama of this large high space is such that you feel as though you are
in a very large and beautiful tree-house. The views from the top floor are
stunning, and the carefully controlled use of materials relates the new
building to the colourful autumn trees and the restrained palette of the
marshes.
The base of the whole building roots it to the site because it is carefully
made of local stone. The decision to mix old and new technologies - timber
and frameless planar glass - was a bold one, and succeeds brilliantly. It is
precisely the way that this architectural firm marries old and new
technologies while utterly respecting its sites that makes it an outstanding
one.
Another educational visitors' centre was recently opened at Castell Henllys,
near Haverfordwest in the Pembrokeshire coast national park, and here
Phillips used materials that come entirely from local sources. He spent only
Pounds 250,000, and provided a place that is mainly for children who gather
among its tree-trunk columns in an almost Hobbit-like way.
The roof of this centre is covered in turf that continues to produce a fine
crop of wild flowers and meadow grasses. This little building, surrounded by
tree-trunk seats for the children and magic rings of local stone, could be
criticised as sentimental. In fact, it is not. It is entirely appropriate
both for the site and for the children, who love it.
Phillips has worked on a larger scale and in towns. His conversion of Ebley
Mill in Stroud, Gloucestershire, into offices for the local authority, and
the transformation of New Mills at Wooton-under-Edge into a high-tech
engineering plant, demonstrate how to re-use redundant industrial buildings
effectively.
Niall Phillips is typical of a few architects who ignored the madder aspects
of the booming 1980s and stuck to their principles of sustainable
architecture. He and his disciples are the architects of the future.

An astonishing 2 per cent of Americans - that is three times the population
of Birmingham - claim to have been abducted by aliens, and they can't all be
mad. Psychologist Susan Blackmore investigates them for Horizon (Monday
8.00-8.50pm, BBC2) and finds enough similarity between their accounts of
being taken away by little grey men to intrigue her - and us. Is it a
variation of false memory syndrome, or is there a more obvious physical
cause? The programme takes the matter seriously and thus raises a few
unintentional laughs, but remains completely absorbing.
Channel Tunnel investors may well be chuckling tonight as Panorama
(9.30-10.10pm, BBC1) asks if there is an inherrent flaw in roll-on, roll-off
ferries. When The Estonia went down in the Baltic sea, it was the second
major disaster involving such vessels in seven years. In both cases large
numbers of lives were lost. Are warnings being ignored? Is cost a more
pressing consideration than safety at sea?
Matthew Parris sets out to puncture PR puffery. In Bad Ideas Of the
Twentieth Century (Tuesday 9.00-9.45, C4), the former MP argues that whether
directed towards good or bad ends, PR always ends up sullying the
individuals concerned.
High Interest (Sunday 5.10-6.00pm C4) lives up to its title with a frank
profile of George Soros, the financier whose dealings contributed to
Britain's exit from the ERM. Soros has annual earnings as high as
Sainsbury's profits, but gives half of them to charity, not all of which is
gratefully received. He talks about his strategy, his losses and his
do-gooding with disarming honesty.
Kruschev was as subtle a strategist as the Red Queen and her impulsive
beheadings. Timewatch (Sunday, 9.00-10.00pm, BBC2) reveals how he would take
a revolver with him to meetings in case argument didn't work. The man was so
feared that Brezhnev, after giving orders to have him killed, lost his nerve
and sobbed. This fascinating profile, which traces Krushchev's rise from
peasent to potentate, has some extraordinary stories, including the blackly
comic one of how Stalin's body was removed from its place next to Lenin's in
the dead of night.

CRICKET: Australia v England, November 25-29, 1st Test, Brisbane.
Australia's curious decision not to enforced the follow-on, after skittling
England out for a paltry 167, means that the 1st Test - and England's agony
 -spills into this week. Spinner Phil Tufnell rediscovered the art of
serious wicket-taking on the third day, but it looks like being a long, hard
winter for England supporters.
GOLF: Sun City Million Dollar Challenge, December 1-4, Sun City,
Bophuthatswana.
The course, designed by Gary Player, is spectacular and the prize money
staggering. Twelve of the world's top golfers compete for Dollars 1m. On his
home ground, US Open winner Ernie Els will be favourite with local fans and
the bookies.
CHESS: World Olympiad, December 1-13, Moscow.
The battle between Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov over who runs Russian
chess means their side is likely to be missing Karpov's talents on Thursday,
when the 120-nation biennial contest starts. Private banker Duncan Lawrie
sponsors a Nigel Short-lead England team, which hopes to improve on the
three silver medals and the bronze England have won in the past decade.

Twenty-seven film-going days to Christmas, and distributors are bringing out
the heavy artillery. Lord Richard Attenborough, long suspected of being
Santa Claus in disguise, comes clean in Miracle On 34th Street. The film,
opening this week, updates the 1947 comedy about a department-store Father
Christmas who doesn't quite behave according to plan. Miracle has had a
10-gun critical salute in the US, where they enjoy the sight of
distinguished Limey actors forced to remake Hollywood classics. For Britain,
it may provide Yuletide cheer in a thinly-supplied season.
Though Macaulay Culkin and Danny DeVito are back with us in soon - one in a
cartoon/live-action fantasy, the other in a comedy about Arnold
Schwarzenegger getting pregnant (sic) - the only sure treat to date is last
week's commendation: the Gothic and glorious Nightmare Before Cristmas.
Alternatively, you could pile up the videos by the flickering VCR. Snow
White and Jurassic Park are current chart-toppers. But why not be
adventurous and try John Sayles's Passion Fish, the moving, quirky tale of a
Louisiana-dwelling TV actress (Mary McDonnell) rediscovering her life after
a paralysing accident; or Kieslowski's White, the bleakly funny second part
of his 'three colours' trilogy, all about corruption, longing and l'amour
fou. If adventurousness fails, there is always the two-year-old Ace Ventura:
Pet Detective. Jim The Mask Carrey puts in an early bid for superstardom,
helped by a dog and a dolphin. For children of all ages, or anyone
house-bound by the Christmas spirit.
And a postscript for repertory cinema lovers. The National Film Theatre
begins two piquant seasons: one devoted to women screenwriters - yes, they
were up and running in Hollywood long before feminism got started - and the
other to 'Shakespeare: The Musical' - Kiss Me Kate, West Side Story, The
Boys From Syracuse. As Verdi realised in Otello and Macbeth (also present):
just because a man is the world's greatest playwright doesn't mean he can't
be improved by a good tune.

FT  28 NOV 94 / This Week: FT Guide to Boss of the Year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain is holding its breath this week: not so much for tonight's
confidence vote at Westminster, or tomorrow's Budget, but for the result on
Wednesday of the Boss of the Year award. What is the origin of 'boss'?
Dictionaries say it is derived from the Dutch word baas, meaning master or
uncle, and is probably related to the old High German basa (aunt). The word
can have slighly perjorative connotations - when used, for example, in
relation to politicians who control a party machine - though the
once-sinister BOSS (South African Bureau of State Security) is an acronym
and strictly no relation. In Australia, boss-cocky is an informal term for
especially overbearing bosses. Companies called Boss have had mixed
fortunes. The German menswear business Hugo Boss - which has a Boss men's
fragrance - has been making a good contribution to the profits of its
Italian parent, Marzotto. The British fork-lift truck manufacturer Lancer
Boss, however, went into receivership earlier this year and is now owned by
the German company Jungheinrich.
Is there a typical boss?
A typical UK director is a 52-year-old male, though the age range is late
teens to early 90s. Women are outnumbered 35:1 in British boardrooms. Until
he stepped down earlier this year as non-executive deputy chairman of the
south coast motor group Caffyns, the oldest incumbent of a publicly quoted
company was thought to be 92-year-old Lord Shawcross.
How many other bosses can you boss?
Professor Sir Roland Smith, former chairman of British Aerospace, used to be
the record holder with 11 non-executive directorships (he now has a mere
six). At the last count, George Duncan led the field with eight.
Who is the toughest boss?
Lord Sheppard, chairman of Grand Metropolitan, holds this distinction in
Britain, according to one poll, though he was once reputedly so mild on a
visit to an American subsidiary that his hosts thought they had the wrong
man. Certainly he sounds tame by comparison with T J Rodgers, ceo of
California-based Cypress Semiconductors and America's toughest boss in 1993,
according to Fortune. Rodgers routinely reduces employees to tears, and has
developed what is known inside the company as 'killer software' - that
tracks down and penalises employees by stopping their cheques. He told one:
'I am willing to see your children's tuition payments go away and for you to
lose your house and go on welfare ..'
Who is the meanest boss?
Earlier this year the FT made a valiant attempt to unearth this unworthy
individual, but the 'competition' was quickly abandoned in the absence of
suitable nominations. It is no doubt prejudicial to say so, but perhaps the
media ogre Robert Maxwell should have had the honour conferred posthumously
(to be held in perpetuity).
Who is the highest paid boss?
Michael Eisner of Disney, with Dollars 203m, topped a Business Week survey
last April measuring all remuneration (including stock options). Lou
Gerstner's Dollars 7.7m of salary, bonus and other payments heads a
Wyatt/Fortune list published in July. Peter Wood, chief executive of the
Royal Bank of Scotland's insurance subsidiary Direct Line, wins the UK's
biggest prize - a Pounds 21m 'contract variation' this year plus a Pounds
350,000 salary. According to Labour Research, an independent consultancy, 71
UK directors received more than Pounds 100m between them in share dividends
last year (among them, payouts to Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber of Really Useful
Holdings of Pounds 13.3m and to David Sainsbury of grocer J Sainsbury of
Pounds 11m).
Which car do bosses typically like to drive?
A poll conducted by Reward and the Institute of Directors puts the Jaguar
way ahead, even though its popularity fell from 84 per cent to 79 per cent
last year. Mercedes was second.
Why is there a Boss of the Year award?
Largely, one suspects, to generate publicity on local radio and in local
newspapers for the international distribution company sponsoring the event.
This year's finalists include 35-year-old Henry Stewart, boss of the
London-based IT training company Happy Computers, who personally inspired a
4pm ice-cream break for clients and staff, allows staff to choose their own
titles and job descriptions, and arranged for a bouncy castle to be hired
for a recent agm. The current Boss of the Year is Reg Key of Chubb Fire.

FT  28 NOV 94 / This Week: Sailing away from the boardroom - Sport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Accountants are not expected to do the circus books for a decade before
suddenly deciding to perform in the Big Top. Nigel Rowe was never, in fact,
a bean-counter. But as group corporate affairs director of BOC, he spent
more than a decade orchestrating the company's sponsorship of its solo
round-the-world yacht race.
All those years being the suit among a sea of yellow wellies obviously had
an effect on Rowe, 53, for here he is in Cape Town, competing in the race
aboard his own 50ft yacht Sky Catcher, and embarking on the 7,000-mile
second leg through the freezing, lonely Southern Ocean to Sydney.
Rowe's career is on hold while he takes a year's leave of absence from the
boardroom to scratch an itch that became a nagging compulsion. He is short
of money, sometimes short of motivation - in short, enduring all the trials
and tribulations that he had watched, as a detached observer, during the
past three BOC races. (The race has been held every four years since 1982).
Sky Catcher's skipper found that several transatlantic crossings lasting
three weeks or so had hardly prepared him for 52 days of solo racing between
the race-start off Charleston, South Carolina, and the first-leg finish in
Cape Town's Table Bay.
'It was exhausting beyond belief, with just an hour or so's sleep at a time,
and I came to hate the monotony of tinned food,' Rowe told me. After two
weeks' Cape sunshine, he is bearded and tanned.
Being intensely competitive, and having spent thousands of pounds he could
ill afford to make Sky Catcher go a little faster, Rowe also suffered
agonies through making some unfortunate routing decisions across the
Doldrums and finishing a whole 10 days behind the Class II leaders.
Some of his enforced leisure went into starting an account of his voyage for
publication next year. Most race accounts are written by professional
yachtsmen, who have little experience of life away from the sea. What
promises to make Rowe's book more absorbing is the semi-detachment of a
successful middle-aged man looking at an escapade that has more emotional
than rational underpinning.
For example, after his last business meeting in London, Rowe made the
somewhat childish gesture (his words) of ripping off his tie and stuffing it
into a Tottenham Court Road rubbish bin.
Here is his account of his first evening at sea on the first leg. 'I felt
strange and unsettled. I loaded the CD player. Paris Texas first up, then
Leonard Cohen's Songs From a Room. Then more like it that were in harmony
with the melancholy I felt. These feelings needed some freedom to express
themselves and be felt ..
'It was a new recognition of the magnitude of the undertaking ahead of me,
and the fact that despite all the time, money and effort that had gone into
the project over the past couple of years, this was still only the
beginning. It had cost a lot just to get to this point, but now the
planning, the preparations, the talking, had come to an abrupt halt and now
the job itself had to be done.
'I had put so much at risk to do it - at the very minimum an uninsured boat
that had soaked up every penny of my savings - and the anguish I was putting
others ashore through while I was at sea alone was something I could not
ignore.'
These were first-night nerves. But worse was to come. After a
week-and-a-half at sea, Rowe realised that through a combination of
inexperience and stubbornness, he had sailed into a large, windless 'hole'
just south and east of Bermuda.
Some of his rivals were clocking 300-mile days, while Sky Catcher drifted
around like the proverbial painted ship on Coleridge's painted ocean. Rowe's
account is painfully honest:
'Finally, I cracked. My diary entry for September 29: 'After another bad
night and little prospect of improvement in the next couple of days, I
realise that making up the ground I've lost is virtually impossible.' After
all the time, preparations, expense and other sacrifices, I'd managed to
blow the race in the first couple of weeks. It was no one's fault but mine.
I'd read it all wrong and taken a very bad decision on the weather - and the
price was too much to bear.
'That afternoon I stood in the cockpit, clenched fists in the air, and
screamed at the top of my voice: 'Giiiive meeeee mooooore wiiiiiind]' I
stamped my feet. I thumped the side of the cockpit with my fist until it
hurt. Then I did it all over again before slumping into the bottom of the
cockpit feeling both better and worse after my tantrum.'
Of course, things improved. The breeze arrived, the sun shone, dolphins
criss-crossed the bow-wave and Rowe found an unexpected bottle of champagne
cooling in the bilge. Life can't all be bad when you've got a year off and
your suits are locked in the wardrobe back at home.
Whether choosing to confront the competitive pressures of an event like the
BOC race is a sensible thing for a middle-aged executive to do seems
doubtful to me. Certainly the spice of competition and the locker-room
camaraderie are vivid ingredients of the experience. But it has a brutal
downside, as Rowe has discovered: winning and losing.
Perhaps spectator sports arose because so few of us are willing to tolerate
the brutal intensities between first and last place down in the arena - or
out on the ocean. I look forward to Rowe's next despatch from Sky Catcher.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Rewind your body clock - Health in the air
/ tablets might control the jet-lag, but BA aims to save passengers from
themselves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As a regular traveller and news junkie, I am an avid fan of Cable News
Network and the BBC World Service. Usually, the first thing I do on arriving
in a hotel room after a long flight is switch on the television and catch up
with what has happened while I was airborne.
The problems begin when watching television becomes an enforced alternative
to sleep. Flipping through the channels while sitting bolt upright in an
unfamiliar bed in the small hours is not my idea of a good time. Battling
against a wall of fatigue the next day is even worse.
Over the years, such torment has led me to search systematically for a
jet-lag cure that really works. Apart from regimes which involve fasting for
several days before a flight - a remedy as painful as the affliction - I
think I have tried almost everything.
Going easy on food and alcohol and drinking plenty of mineral water
in-flight helps a bit. So does Dioralyte, a rehydrator which restores body
fluids removed by cabin pressurisation. Arnica, a homoepathic treatment for
shock, can also make a difference. Camomile tea induces bed-time drowsiness
without the morning-after effects of sleeping tablets.
But all are only partial solutions. It was not until last summer that I came
across something which really seems to attack the causes of the problem.
Called melatonin, it comes in the form of tablets which you dissolve under
the tongue at bedtime, starting three days before a flight and continuing
for three days after.
I have used melatonin so far on two trips to the far east and one to the US.
It has done the trick each time, enabling me to sleep soundly for several
hours during the flight and adjust quickly to the local time-zone on
arrival. So much so that after a recent 19-hour journey from Seoul via Hong
Kong, which landed at Heathrow at 5.30am, I was able to enjoy a friend's
birthday party that evening and do a full day's work the next day.
What is melatonin's secret? According to Clive Cookson, the FT's science
editor, it is a natural substance and its efficacy is scientifically based.
It works by supplementing the hormone which sets the human body clock and is
normally produced only during hours of darkness.
Melatonin is sold by health stores and is not a registered pharmaceutical.
It has therefore not undergone extensive laboratory testing. As one of its
first guinea pigs on the FT, I am being closely monitored by sceptical
colleagues waiting for me to turn green or suddenly go bald.
So far, I am happy to report, there has been no evidence of side-effects. It
is also reassuring that melatonin is widely used by scientific researchers
into jet-lag. Anyway, any adverse symptoms would have to be pretty bad to
equal the ordeal of severe jet-lag.
Melatonin is available from Revital Health Stores, 3a The Colonnades,
123/151 Buckingham Palace Road, London SW1 W9RZ

FT  28 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Rub your nose, hook a finger in your ear .

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES JENNINGS

<TEXT>
Business travellers on stressful long-haul flights are generally forced to
work out for themselves how to deal with the crapulous exhaustion that
results from many hours in the air with little diversion other than food,
drink and a flickering TV screen.
But do-it-yourself regimes can be useless. Avoiding excess and keeping to
the path of virtue so that you get off your aircraft feeling half-way human
is not only a hit-and-miss affair but calls for the sort of self-restraint
that few possess.
Which is why British Airways launched its Well-Being in the Air scheme last
year to try to save passengers from themselves. The scheme was an umbrella
concept which took in, inter alia, abstinence from alcohol and red meat,
much exercise, organised rest, and sprays and gels to stop the skin from
drying out. Its aim was modest: 'To reduce the effects of flying and help
you arrive in better shape.'
Initially the scheme was only a partial success. As a BA spokesman puts it:
'Some of the exercises were a little vigorous, and people tended to end up
waving their arms about madly. Some were even unlucky enough to clout their
neighbours.'
As for the dietary restrictions: 'The special well-being menu was based on
the yin-yang principle which, in reality, meant it was heavily vegetarian -
at times, positively vegan - which didn't suit everyone.' Nor was everyone
impressed by the relaxation tape.
So BA tried again this year, with an improved programme that includes a tub
of rehydration gel to neutralise cabin air, a rose water facial spray to
relieve dry skin, and a soothing eye compress to freshen tired and puffy
eyes.
The programme also boasts a new relaxation tape with a commentary by
psychologist Dr Avic Sigman. And the airline suggests that occasionally you
bring your knees up to your chest five times, hook the tips of your fingers
in your ears and lean your head over, and rotate the tip of your nose with
the palm of your hand.
Is anyone taking advantage of BA's thoughtfulness? 'Well, if one passenger
does it, quite a lot of them start to do it,' says BA. No figures have been
collected to find out how popular the scheme has become, but there have been
hundreds of requests for the Well-Being brochure. 'We even got a call from
the FBI, asking if they could use our exercise programme for their new
recruits.'
This may be an idea whose time has yet to come. A mini-poll of those
airlines which might have been expected to provide something similar - such
as Swissair, United Airways, Cathay Pacific and Virgin Atlantic (which
offers aromatherapy on the ground) - produced denials or obfuscation.
Only Japan Airlines seemed interested in offering a comparable service. It
does not offer a complete programme but will give you an in-flight health
drink containing royal jelly and kiwi fruit juice, a honeycomb face-mask
which helps prevent dehydration in the nasal passages, an audio relaxation
tape, and a list of in-seat exercises (less strenuous than BA's).
The fact is that well-being programmes will remain a rarity so long as
competitive advantage depends on being seen to offer the traveller more, not
less. When you consider the airlines' efforts to promote in-flight
consumption, it is not surprising that most passengers - no matter how
experienced - will tend to capitulate and eat and drink what is bad for them
the moment it appears on their laps.
On a long flight self-denial is of only limited help in overcoming jet-lag,
the most serious physiological drawback of long-distance flying. No
well-being programme can compensate for this massive derangement of your
internal clock. Nor, say some, can anything else, including such recently
tested remedies as Chinese acupressure, intense-light regimes and the
hormone melatonin (see accompanying story).
If you are going to feel fairly dreadful whatever you do on an aircraft, you
might as well indulge yourself.

Pacific to the Persian Gulf, via satellite consortium Skyphone.
The service will become global when software is installed shortly at ground

FT  28 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Jamaica safer than US
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Crime-weary Jamaica is touting the results of a new study which found that
visitors are at higher risk in various US cities than in Jamaica. A study by
Richard Bennett of American University, Washington, found that visitors are
three times more likely to be killed in the US capital than in Jamaica.
Using 1992 statistics, the study compared Washington, Orlando, Miami and New
York with the Jamaican resorts of Ocho Rios, Montego Bay, Negril and Port
Antonio. It was found that Jamaica's resorts have a combined murder rate of
22.58 per 100,000, compared with 75.21 per 100,000 for Washington and 37.89
per 100,000 for Miami.

Business travellers tired of Japan's drab 1970s-style international hotels
may find comfort in the Tokyo Westin in Yebisu Garden Place, the shopping,

reports Emiko Terazono. Done up in 'neo-classical European style', it is one
of the few hotels in Tokyo with any character. Until next February, prices
in the hotel start from Y19,500 per person, including breakfast. After that:
from Y28,000 per person.

A galaxy of writers, including seven Nobel laureates, published a literary
snapshot of the world last week with diaries of a day plucked at random:
April 29 1994. The French magazine Le Nouvel Observateur compiled accounts
by 240 writers and called them A Day in the World. Colombia's Gabriel Garcia
Marquez says he was woken on April 29 by a telephone call to his hotel room
and a woman's voice saying: 'Felipe expects you for dinner at eight.' A
frequent traveller, the writer checked his location by consulting the sign
he had posted by his bedside the night before: 'I am in Madrid.' His dinner
host was Spanish prime minister Felipe Gonzalez.

The Philippines Supreme Court has found German airline Lufthansa guilty of
turning away a Filipino passenger with a valid ticket to Africa. It ordered
the airline to pay him Dollars 23,200 in damages, reports Reuter. The court
said the carrier's failure to fulfil its obligations to a former Philippine
Central Bank director on his way to Malawi was aggravated by the rude
behaviour of a Lufthansa employee in Bombay. The customer was 'bumped' by
Air
Kenya, with which Lufthansa has a pooling agreement, on a flight from Bombay
to Nairobi. The Lufthansa officer in Bombay threw down the man's passport
when asked to help, the court said. The court said that under an arrangement
between members of the International Air Transport Association, Lufthansa
guaranteed that carriers like Air Kenya would honour customers' connecting
flights. '(His) trip by several successive carriers is regarded as a single
operation' of the German airline, the court said, explaining its ruling
against the airline.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Management: Sharp knives at Tenneco - Laurie Morse describes
how the company managed to cut away Dollars 1.5bn in 'failure' costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dana Mead, chairman of Tenneco, last week stood before 450 top managers from
the company's six divisions in Houston's convention centre and asked them an
important question: after two years of relentless cost-cutting and
restructuring how many thought the effort was running out of steam?
Mead expected that as many as half would say yes, that the corporate
overhaul that had shaken Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 910m) of what Tenneco calls
'failure' costs out of the system was now cutting too near the bone, and
that the managers who had faced the challenge were fully extended. 'There is
an exhaustion factor,' he said later. 'We've been on red alert for a long
time. Someone asked me when things will get back to normal, and I said,
'this is normal'.'
By way of the interactive keypads with which the conference tables were
equipped, the answer flashed on an oversized screen within seconds; only 18
per cent of the managers in attendance felt the effort was flagging.
That response is certainly a tribute to Tenneco's quality programme,
arguably one of the most far-reaching and successful mounted in the US.
Designed and implemented with the help of Armand 'Val' Feigenbaum, the
veteran US quality consultant, the programme is in large part responsible
for Tenneco's turnaround from a Dollars 750m net after-tax loss in 1991 to a
net profit of Dollars 412m last year.
Feigenbaum may not be as internationally renowned as the late W. Edwards
Deming and Joseph Juran, who are usually credited with pioneering modern
'quality' ideas. But the author of Total Quality Control, written 43 years
ago, can also claim to be one of the founders of the worldwide quality
movement.
The original link with Feigenbaum and his brother Donald, principals of
Pittsfield, Massachusetts-based General Systems Co, was forged by Mead's
predecessor Mike Walsh. A public-prosecutor turned corporate-turnaround
expert who died of brain cancer this year at age 51, Walsh took over as
Tenneco's chief executive in 1991 as losses at the company mounted.
Having already employed Feigenbaum's General Systems Co consultancy at
Cummins Engine, where he had been charged to head off competition from
quality-oriented Japanese companies, and again at Union Pacific, Walsh was
convinced that a quality effort would produce dramatic results at Tenneco.
Making the group's six mature companies (all in slow-growth industries)
competitive on the basis of lowest operating costs was one of the few
options available when he took over.
At that time Tenneco was drowning in Dollars 6bn of debt, which represented
about 70 per cent of its capital; faced a Dollars 750m, or Dollars 5.57 a
share, loss for the year; and all six of its divisions had declining
operating earnings. The dismal results came in spite of income from Dollars
7bn in asset sales that year.
Its acquisition in 1985 of JI Case, a farm and construction equipment
company, had proved disastrous. High costs, out-of-control inventories, a
cut-throat pricing policy and a farm recession threw Case into a tailspin
almost the minute it was acquired. Subsequent efforts to save the subsidiary
left the other divisions - an auto components manufacturer, a packaging
company, the natural gas pipeline, Newport News Shipbuilding and Albright
and Wilson chemicals - short on capital.
By 1991, Case's portion of the company's loss was Dollars 620m, with an
additional Dollars 461m in restructuring charges tagged on.
Walsh did two things almost immediately that have had a lasting effect: he
brought in his old friend Dana Mead, an International Paper executive, and
put him in charge of mending the open wound at Case. He also called the
Feigenbaums and asked them to join Tenneco's operating committee. This group
of top officers - including divisional chiefs - is responsible for running
the company on a day-to-day basis.
Within three months Walsh's team had targeted nearly 15,000 jobs for
redundancy, sold Dollars 1.3bn in assets, slashed Tenneco's bloated dividend
by half, reduced capital spending by Dollars 350m and issued Dollars 700m in
new equity. It also initiated the Total Quality Management initiative guided
by the General Systems consultants.
The General Systems approach to finding so-called 'quality costs' is more
like an ongoing fitness programme than a crash diet, Tenneco managers say.
Quality costs are defined at Tenneco as the price the company pays for
things done wrong, things thrown away or returned, or for the time that
product and people sit waiting without generating revenue.
'We had been doing cost-of-quality programmes for some time, and thought we
were competitive within our industry,' says Dick Snell, chief of Tenneco
Automotive. 'Then Val (Feigenbaum) came in and broadened all the categories.
By another definition our quality costs were a respectable 5 1/2 per cent of
our revenues, but using Val's system, we found our quality costs were 24 per
cent.' (Tenneco's overall revenues last year were Dollars 13.2bn.)
Cross-functional quality teams were formed, cost-cutting goals were set for
every person in the organisation, and progress was monitored daily, weekly
and monthly. The goals, and techniques used to meet them, were communicated
to employees through 'cascading' training: top executives attended classes
knowing they would have to teach the material to their subordinates. Line
employees became an integral part of the process, including
union-represented labour.
Constant feedback from the General Systems staff kept everyone on track.
Snell says: 'The quality initiative became visceral to us, people could
understand it. In the automotive business, where margins are narrow, success
depends on being low-cost producers.'
Using the Feigenbaum brothers' processes, Snell's division looked in unusual
places for failure costs, and found millions of dollars lying on the shop
floor. Examining the scrap from pieces of car exhaust systems punched out of
sheet metal, employee quality teams valued the useless leftover bits at
Dollars 7m-Dollars 8m a year.
'We put a cross-functional team of engineers and designers on the problem,
and within 18 months they had cut the scrap by half,' Snell says.
Countless additional savings were engineered in other areas of Tenneco in a
process that worked from the bottom up. When management discovered that
headquarters staff felt immune to the cost-cutting goals, Mead sent an
ultimatum - no exceptions, no excuses.
Ilene Gordon, vice-president of operations, says General Systems not only
provided a high-tech database for corporate benchmarking, but it also
created a means of communicating best practices to all of the divisions'
operations, something lacking at the disjointed conglomerate.
General Systems has 11 staff members assisting various Tenneco divisions
full time, most with on-site offices. The Feigenbaums' initial quality
review suggested one out of every Dollars 4 Tenneco earned in sales in 1991
was wasted in useless costs, for a total of about Dollars 2.5bn.
The company's primary goal became taking out half of those costs over a
three-year period. Tenneco reached the goal a year ahead of schedule. Of the
Dollars 1.6bn saved, Dollars 690m has gone to the bottomline in profits, and
the remainder has been reinvested in the company. Mead points out that the
costs targets were hit in relatively flat markets, with nearly flat
revenues.
Val Feigenbaum says Tenneco took out costs at about twice the rate of any
comparable American company - the best results of any group he has advised
in the US, Europe or Japan. He attributes the success to the unwavering
dedication of Tenneco's executives to the process.
Still, he says, Tenneco is just getting started. With quality costs whittled
to 17 per cent of revenues, the goal next year is to reduce such costs to 10
per cent, or another Dollars 1bn, and ultimately to reach world-class levels
of 5 per cent.
Feigenbaum, whom Mead calls his 'stealth guru', warned Tenneco employees at
the Houston meeting that the company needs to achieve considerable top-line
revenue growth merely to move out of the category of 'average' performance.
'You will be attempting to do something only a handful of American companies
have been able to pull off: to continue to build your American business
while expanding throughout the world,' he says.
That challenge also troubles 58-year-old Mead who, besides continuing the
cost-cutting programme pioneered by his predecessor, has charted a course of
global expansion. His problem is that while Wall Street gives the company
credit for its excellent management systems, Tenneco's stock has dipped from
Dollars 52.62 a share at year-end to about Dollars 41 recently.
Operating earnings may be rising and successful public offerings of
newly-profitable JI Case Corp may have boosted Tenneco's cash by nearly
Dollars 700m, but analysts still assign a 'conglomerate discount' to the
group and worry about the cyclical nature of its businesses.
Mead is consequently under pressure to make a Dollars 1bn acquisition in one
of the three areas he has identified as Tenneco's core businesses:
automotive parts, packaging and natural gas. But he has decided to take a
conservative approach, reinvesting in domestic packaging operations, buying
a German auto components company (Gillet) to fill a gap in that part of the
business, and acquiring a small US power-generating firm to enhance the
group's natural gas division.
Over the long haul he sees Tenneco's future in fast-growing emerging
markets, and each of his company's six divisions has foreign expansion plans
and joint venture prospects. Meanwhile, Mead intends to get Wall Street's
attention by extending the group's quality programmes, and boosting its
sub-standard return on capital by employing the now popular system of
'economic value added' to measure profitability. His aim is for 15 per cent
growth in annual operating earnings, with analysts expecting Tenneco's 1995
earnings to reach Dollars 4.25 a share.
The next phase of Tenneco's cost-push will attack an inbred part of the
company's culture. Its six disparate divisions have long operated as
independent companies, rarely sharing economies of scale. This year it has
embarked on a project aimed at getting divisions to share purchasing,
billing, finance, computer and personnel services, and to boost automation.
Internal studies estimate that savings from consolidated administrative
functions will add about 40 cents a share to Tenneco's bottomline within two
years.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Management: Pioneers and Prophets - Tom Burns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few managers around the world have heard of Tom Burns, a former professor of
sociology at Edinburgh University. Yet he created a string of concepts which
have had an increasingly powerful international influence since he retired
13 years ago. They have improved western management practice immeasurably -
and made millionaires of several famous American pundits who embroidered
them.
Burns, now 81, has written a new preface for The Management of Innovation,
the pathfinding 1961 book which he wrote with GM Stalker, a psychologist. It
has been reissued by Oxford University Press with a justifiably fulsome
endorsement from Warren Bennis, one of America's best-known leadership
experts. He describes it as 'a major classic' which was 'way ahead of its
time' when published.
Written in refreshingly plain English, it is a riveting read and brims with
insight after insight. Yet it was based heavily on a relatively modest study
of the human and organisational difficulties which established Scottish
companies experienced when they tried to develop and make electronic
products.
The most significant breakthrough concept, much repeated since, was that
machine bureaucracies of the type advocated by Max Weber (see last week's
column) are far less effective at dealing with change and instability than
what Burns and Stalker christened 'organic' forms of organisation.
Closely allied new concepts, all of them far-sighted, were:
That innovative organi-
sations are 'networks', in which control, authority and communication flow
not from the top, but to and from the greatest loci of expertise and
knowledge within the organisation. That individual behaviour in an organic
organisation is influenced more by a perceived community of interest with it
than by any contractual relationship. In other words, to use today's jargon,
'shared vision and values' are vital.
That lateral communication between people of different rank, resembling
consultation more than command, is more important than communication up and
down the hierarchy.
That the most effective way of managing innovative projects is through
multi-functional teams, led by the same manager from initial concept through
to production and launch.
That teams of different specialists - for instance from design, engineering
and production - operate far more effectively if they 'live close together'
 -or, to use modern jargon, are 'co-located'.
As so often when breakthrough thinking originates in Europe, few American
writers have given Burns and Stalker the enormous credit they deserve. Apart
from Bennis, one of the exceptions is David Nadler, whose 1992 book
Organisational Architecture has become one of the most influential analyses
of all the interconnected complexities of how modern business organisations
operate - or should do so.
The reissued Burns and Stalker deserves to join Nadler on bookshelves on
both sides of the Atlantic and further afield.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Management: Out of synch with the Internet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I attended an internal market research briefing the other day. All extremely
wonderful. Just as it started, the FT's marketing supremo breezed in and sat
down beside me.
'Hi,' she said, breathlessly. 'I'm seeing a lot of you on the Internet.'
']]]]' I replied, with the eloquence of a Patrick White character. '????'
She said: 'It is you, surely?'
I said: 'I am not available on the Internet. Nor will I be available on
Odyssey, the constellation of 12 satellites that will operate at
medium-earth orbit - MEO, it's called - and provide simultaneous
multi-regional communications services to users on a global basis by about
1999.'
'Well,' she said. 'It sounds like you. There is without question a person on
the Internet passing themselves off as you, with bits of your persona.
Really most convincing.'
I wondered if she was using 'persona' in the Jungian sense. (You never know
with that lot.) But her news set me thinking. Why should anyone wish to
impersonate me on the Internet? Is it a good impersonation?
I imagine that the impersonator has mastered the obvious elements: my
serenity and cool; my been-there-got-the-T-shirt-but-go-on-surprise-me act;
my cosmopolitanism; and my humorousness and charm.
But what about the less obvious aspects, the ones that must be difficult for
an impersonator on the Internet to grapple with, such as my caringness and
sharingness? If the person impersonating me on the Internet would like some
tips, they should ring me on the telephone and speak to the horse's mouth.
Do not reverse the charge.
Belatedly, I have been scrolling through the supplement produced by
Marketing magazine that describes the latest winners in the Advertising
Effectiveness Awards organised by Britain's Institute of Practitioners in
Advertising.
These awards focus on convincing demonstrations of the commercial
contribution advertising makes to business success, and attracted, this
year, 74 detailed case histories from 30 ad agencies on behalf of some of
Britain's biggest advertisers, including British Airways, BT, Cadbury,
Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever, Whitbread and - the big winner - BMW, as well as
many with far smaller ad budgets.
The advertising business loves awards. Almost every night, it seems, there
is a loud and vulgar dinner-do at some London hotel at which admen award
each other a sackful of prizes. At one of these bacchanals, several years
ago, I watched fascinated as the guest speaker, Sir James Goldsmith, was
pelted with bread rolls by some of the rowdier revellers on the fringes of
the ballroom for a speech deemed too rightwing for an audience of agency
long-hairs.
I thought about throwing a roll myself, but was distracted by a drunken
argument at the press table which ended in a face-slapping. (Goldsmith stood
his ground. His sang-froid was admirable.)
It is because the ad business is so promiscuous with its prize-givings that
the IPA's effectiveness awards - based, as they are, on very solid case
studies - stand out like a bishop in a nightclub. They are the serious side
of advertising.
Take the Health Education Authority's HIV-Aids prevention campaign, which
won a silver award. You may recall that in its early days this campaign was
rubbished by some critics for its 'apocalyptic' tone. But the criticism was
stupid. This campaign, via the BMP agency, has done the trick in keeping HIV
and Aids before the public gaze. Additionally, condom usage among
16-to-34-year-old Britons has zipped smartly higher.
Over the six years to 1993, the HEA's campaign cost Pounds 15.4m. On the
basis that it costs at least Pounds 30,000 annually to support someone with
Aids, it is calculated that the campaign has paid for itself if it helps to
prevent, on average, 51 cases of HIV infection a year.
What is significant is that the prevalence of Aids in Britain had dropped
from 93 per cent of the European Union average in 1984 to 54 per cent last
year.
Funnily enough, the striking thing about advertising is not its
effectiveness, but its ineffectiveness. It is breathtaking how much
expenditure is wasted.
One of the reasons is that advertisers use mass media to communicate with
quite small target audiences. This plunges some adpeople into gloom. They
wail and slash their breasts - forgetting, it would seem, that salvation is
round the corner: that in the information superfuture, the fragmentation of
the media into thousands of glittering shards will greatly boost the
effectiveness of their ads.
Perhaps you think you are impervious to advertising. Almost certainly you
aren't. But the likelihood is that it will become astonishingly effective as
techniques improve. In hundreds of years' time there will still be
prize-giving bacchanals in ritzy London hotels - and long-hairs hurling
rolls, or so I shouldn't wonder.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Rentokil tops poll of its peers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rentokil, the highly profitable business services group, has replaced
pharmaceuticals giant Glaxo as Britain's most admired company, according to
a survey today.
Queens Moat Houses, the debt-ridden hotel group, was least admired, although
Lonrho and Eurotunnel were only just ahead in the poll published by
Management Today magazine in association with Loughborough University
Business School.
The survey covered the 10 biggest quoted companies by stock market
capitalisation in each of 26 industrial sectors.
The chairman, chief executive and five other directors from each of the
businesses were asked to rate companies in their sector on a scale of one to
10 on the basis of nine criteria. These ranged from management quality,
financial soundness and ability to recruit and retain top talent to
innovation, community and environmental responsibility and use of corporate
assets.
Sector analysts at 10 leading investment companies were also asked for their
opinions.
Aside from Rentokil and Glaxo - the latter topped the previous survey in
1992 - Marks and Spencer, SmithKline Beecham, Unilever, Reuters and Shell
were all well regarded and retained their places in the top 10. Among less
familiar names Electrocomponents, the electronic and mechanical components
distribution group, and Bowthorpe, the manufacturer of specialist
electronics, were eighth and 10th respectively.
Companies making the greatest strides from the 1992 survey included
supermarket group Asda (up from 239th place to 198), Whitbread (161 to 25)
and British Steel (189 to 54). Among the biggest losers were the exhibitions
group Blenheim, which has been plagued by poor results, profit warnings and
internal dissent (down from 80 to 256), pharmaceuticals group Wellcome (11
to 108) and Enterprise Oil, the unsuccessful bidder for Lasmo (79 to 222).
Rentokil was considered best value as a long-term investment and the best
user of corporate assets. GEC was regarded as the most financially sound,
while Vodafone's management and British Airways' marketing were seen as the
best quality. Glaxo was judged to have the best capacity to innovate.
In the conglomerates category BTR beat Tomkins and Wassall into second and
third place respectively. HSBC was top in banking, followed by Lloyds and
Abbey National.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Malaysia ban 'cost power contract'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Malaysia's ban earlier this year on placing government contracts with UK
companies has cost Parsons Power Generation Systems a contract worth more
than Pounds 100m, says the company's parent, Rolls-Royce Industrial Power
Group.
The contract, for two 500MW steam turbine generators for the new Port Klang
power station, would have helped Parsons overcome the orders gap it faces.
Negotiations with the Malaysian authorities were halted when the trade ban
was imposed in February, after the Sunday Times newspaper alleged bribes had
been offered to senior Malaysian politicians by a UK company.
The ban gave Parsons' US rival, General Electric, an opportunity, and it was
announced last week that it had won the contract.
Mr Richard Maudslay, managing director of Rolls-Royce Industrial Power
Group, said: 'We were very close to winning it. These things happen. You
have to get on with it. It's unfortunate but we will still continue to be
active in the Malaysian market.'
He said that previously the Gulf war halted a contract with the Iraqis.
The loss of the Port Klang prospect reduces Parsons' chances of clinching
new orders soon enough to avoid further job cuts. Manufacturing work on
existing export contracts finishes next summer. Its main Newcastle upon Tyne
base employs 2,100 people, but 400 jobs are going over the next month and
200 temporary jobs are to be phased out.
Hopes of avoiding further redundancies hinge on winning an order from
Singapore for two 600MW steam turbine generators for the Tuas power station
early next year, and reaching agreements on at least one of three Indian
power station projects.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Tories train big guns on Dudley West seat: Labour successes
in council polls have intensified by-election campaigning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour today steps up the intensity of its campaign to wrest Dudley West
from the Conservatives in a parliamentary by-election, buoyed by striking
success in two local polls.
Results from Dudley Borough Council by-elections in two of Dudley West's
eight wards in the past four weeks have shown a 30 per cent swing to Labour
and resulted in the capture of council seats once considered an exclusive
Conservative preserve.
The by-election for the West Midlands constituency, to be held on December
15, follows the death of John Blackburn, who took the seat for the
Conservatives in 1979 and strengthened his hold in the elections of 1983 and
1987. But in 1992 his majority slipped in the face of 3.85 per cent swing to
Labour.
Mr Graham Postles, the Conservative candidate, is defending Blackburn's 1992
majority of 5,789. Labour calculations suggest that a swing of slightly more
than 4 per cent, a small movement compared with those indicated by the
council by-election results, would lead to a win for its candidate, Mr Ian
Pearson.
The narrow margin between the main candidates has turned Dudley West into a
battleground for senior politicians.
Mr Jeremy Hanley, the Conservative party chairman, has already visited. Mrs
Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, is in the constituency today and
Mr John Maples, Conservative deputy chairman and chronicler of
disillusionment among the party faithful, is expected later in the week.
Conservative officials promise a visit from either a cabinet minister or a
senior party official every day during the campaign.
Three members of Labour's shadow cabinet - Mr John Prescott, Mr Jack Straw
and Mr Frank Dobson - have been electioneering in the constituency. Ms Ann
Taylor is expected today and it is likely that Mr Tony Blair will appear
later with his vision of the new Labour party.
The Conservatives have already started hammering away on the theme that
Labour is not to be trusted and the result of the by-election will depend on
the degree to which Black Country voters see Mr Blair's Labour party as
practical and free of the ideological baggage of the past.
Dudley West is not natural Labour territory. With 75 per cent home-ownership
it has many of the same social characteristics as Guildford and Winchester.
The western borders of the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation are
traditionally prosperous.
Unemployment rates in five of the eight wards are less than 6 per cent. That
of another ward is close to the national average at 9.3 per cent. Only in
the industrial wards of Brierley Hill, with 17.8 per cent unemployment, and
in Brockmoor and Pensnett, does Dudley West look like a Midlands inner-city
constituency.
Apart from Mr Postles and Mr Pearson, the other announced candidates for the
by-election are Mr Mike Hadley (Liberal Democrat), Lord David Sutch (Monster
Raving Loony Party), Mr Andy Carmichael (National Front), Mr Mike Nattrass
(New Britain Party) and Mr Malcolm Floyd (UK Independence Party).

FT  28 NOV 94 / Auditors oppose disclosure of 'letter'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Company auditors and managers believe that publication of the 'management
letter' would improve corporate governance - yet most auditors do not want
to disclose the contents of the letter, says a survey published today.
The 'management letter' allows auditors to advise management on accounting
methods, internal controls and ways to improve efficiency. It is never
disclosed to shareholders, in spite of their technical role in being
ultimately responsible for the appointment of the auditor.
The survey, by the department of accounting and financial management at the
University of Essex, was based on interviews with 105 top auditors and 181
managers at the top 100 listed companies.
Auditors, asked to score the benefits of publication between one for 'none',
and five for 'great extent' gave an average figure of 3.12 in terms of
improving shareholders' assessment of management competence. However, 63 per
cent of auditors rejected suggestions that they should formally report on
company procedures in their audit report.
Professor Michael Sherer of the University of Essex said: 'It is somewhat
ironic that whilst auditors are appointed by shareholders to monitor the
activities of management, shareholders have little means of evaluating how
effectively auditors are performing their monitoring task.'
Mr Gerry Acher, head of audit at accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, said
although he had not studied the research he felt management letters were of
little use to shareholders. He said: 'It would be like buying a car and
being given a technical assessment of the fuel-burning qualities of the
vehicle.'

FT  28 NOV 94 / Beer town left flat after Pirelli move northwards: The
reasons for the tyre maker's decision to transfer operations from Burton on
Trent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Much of the fizz has gone out of the economy of Burton on Trent. But it has
nothing to do with the beer for which the Staffordshire town is renowned.
In spite of the breweries which dot Burton's skyline, Pirelli, the Italian
tyremaker, was for decades the town's biggest employer - until last year,
when 700 jobs went almost at a stroke with the end of car tyre-making. Now
truck tyre-making has gone, with another 300 jobs.
Mr Carlo Mazzantini, the UK chairman and managing director, heads an
administrative staff at Pirelli's UK headquarters, still on the town's Derby
Road. SMC and Central Tyres, Pirelli's fast-fit and tyre retailing chains,
have moved in with their warehousing operations. But research and
development has been moved out and soon some vestigial production operations
such as compounding and fabrication will also go, leaving fewer than 300
people working for the group.
Burton's car-tyre production has been transferred to a more modern plant at
Carlisle, 150 miles to the north-west. Its location, far from any car
plants, is the legacy of past regional aid policies.
Pirelli has committed itself to investing Pounds 20m in upgrading and
expanding its Carlisle facilities to double its production from 10,000 tyres
a day before the transfer.
The Carlisle plant, which employs 875 people, is also being given a new
design and development role in a Europe-wide restructuring of Pirelli's tyre
production capacity.
The restructuring has started to return the Italian group to profit, after a
string of heavy losses. Mr Marco Tronchetti Provera, group chief executive,
in London for this month's Pirelli calendar launch, made clear that the
restructuring envisaged a stand-alone future for Pirelli after its costly
and abortive attempt to take over its rival tyremaker, Continental of
Germany.
The UK upheavals are part of a European consolidation in which more than 20
plants have closed and resources have been moved to some of the remaining
80. Nearly 12,000 jobs have been lost worldwide, leaving fewer than 40,000.
Mr Mazzantini said: 'In January 1993 we were producing 5,000 car tyres a day
at Burton with a production workforce of 700, and 10,000 at Carlisle with
nearly 1,000. Now, with 800 fewer people, Carlisle is already producing
13,000 to 14,000 tyres a day. And that is with a higher level of quality and
without major investments.'
A mid-term target is 15,000 a day with half the total UK production
workforce of January 1993, rising to 20,000 as the full benefits of
investment in new plant and equipment are realised.
Truck tyre production has almost certainly left the UK for good, however,
prompted partly by the worst slump in continental Europe's commercial
vehicle markets since the second world war.
Mr Mazzantini said: 'Europe's truck market collapse could not be overcome.
No one was to blame. We need strategic production units and at 7,000 to
8,000 truck tyres a day Burton was too small.'
The Carlisle facility is being pushed into the unfamiliar role of developing
premium tyres for some of Europe's more up-market carmakers.
One early result is a sole-supplier contract with Jaguar for its new XJ
saloon range. Purpose-designed tyres are also on the stocks for Saab and
Volvo, Rover Group and Toyota's and Honda's UK 'transplant' car factories -
for which the Carlisle plant will also be the supply source.
Mr Mazzantini said: 'Everyone wants tailor-made products now.' That means
flexibility in tyre development and manufacturing processes to a degree that
the tyre industry could not have contemplated a few years ago - batches of
fewer than 400 of a type are now regarded as viable. Much of the planned
investment centres on more flexible, high-quality processes.
Carlisle will concentrate on premium sector tyres, where prospects for
profits are brightest.
Such profits do not, however, come from original equipment supplies to
vehicle makers. Margins here are almost non-existent. The attraction is in
replacement sales. Mr Mazzantini said: 'When it comes to high-performance
and prestige cars like Jaguars the pull-through is very strong. If the car
has been fitted originally with Pirellis it is certain that the driver will
replace them with the same tyres.'
It was not surprising, he added, that this was the market sector in which
Pirelli mainly wanted to be. The UK tyre market has 107 brands jostling for
sales, of which 99 are in the 'commodity' sector - sold almost entirely on
price rather than performance. Korean and east European tyremakers have been
targeting this sector. 'Countries like Poland and the Czechs are looking
mainly for hard currency, so they don't care what price they sell at,' Mr
Mazzantini said.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Radical agenda urged on Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A call for the government to abandon consolidation in favour of a radical
agenda of reform was issued yesterday by a prominent rightwinger on the Tory
back benches.
Mr Edward Leigh, the former technology minister identified as a key figure
behind efforts to promote a leadership challenge to Mr John Major, warned
that a 'steady as she goes' policy risked becoming 'steady as she sinks'.
Mr Leigh, a strong critic of the decision to drop privatisation of the Post
Office, said the government had to weave the traditional threads of Tory
philosophy into a populist and radical programme for the next century.
He said in a pamphlet published by the Conservative Political Centre that
the platform should be based on the notion of 'responsible individualism'.
That meant empowering individuals through the market economy while equally
supporting the creation of an 'ethical' society through leadership and
legislation.
Alongside traditional Tory commitments to strong defence, law and order, and
firm support of British sovereignty in Europe, the pamphlet suggests a range
of new policies.
He also calls for the present leadership rules to be replaced by a framework
which would ensure one contest during the lifetime of each parliament.
Meanwhile, Mr William Powell, Tory MP for Corby, last night called on Mr
Major to resign and stand for re-election, to end speculation about his
leadership.
He told BBC Radio Five Live that he did not want to see a leadership
challenge, but believed Mr Major could end the speculation and reimpose
party discipline by winning a leadership contest.

FT  28 NOV 94 / 'Third of women workers' low paid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As many as 4m women - more than one third of female workers - earn less than
two-thirds of median male weekly earnings, research published today by the
Equal Opportunities Commission shows.
In a survey of low pay based on data from the Social Change and Economic
Life Initiative and the British Household Panel Study, the report predicted
that 30,000 additional low-paid jobs would be created by the year 2000.
These would mostly be in the part-time service sector where women
traditionally find work. The survey also reported that women earn 79.5 per
cent of men's wages on average.
Women who are low paid are likely to have few, if any, educational
qualifications, work part-time in semi-skilled or unskilled jobs, have
limited full-time work experience, and work in small, private sector firms
in non-unionised jobs.
Low pay appears to have a life-cycle element as there is a high percentage
of low pay - 82 per cent - among women under 20 years old. Between the ages
of 21 and 30 the proportion drops to 37 per cent to 43 per cent and rises to
47 per cent to 57 per cent as women approach retirement age.
Cohabiting women have the lowest percentages of low pay, while divorced,
separated and widowed women have a slightly lower incidence of low pay than
married women.
The survey found a correlation between education and pay. Only 10 per cent
of women with degrees or teaching qualifications are low paid while 68 per
cent of those without qualifications are low paid.
The report suggested several causes for low pay. These include the lack of
access to training and education combined with gaps in affordable childcare,
the concentration of women in low-paid sectors of employment, gender
definitions of men and women's skills resulting in lower status for women
and the absence of a statutory minimum wage.
Ms Clare Short, Labour's shadow minister for women, said: 'This is
confirmation of what the Labour Party has been saying - that the
government's deregulation of the labour market is leading to millions being
trapped in low pay and on benefits - and the majority of them are women.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats yesterday challenged Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, to recoup Pounds 2bn over two years by tackling waste and
inefficiency.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, the party's Treasury spokesman, said the savings would
allow Mr Clarke to cancel the proposed rise in value added tax on domestic
fuel to 17.5 per cent. Instead he could cut it from 8 per cent to 5 per
cent.
Mr Bruce identified 10 areas which could bring savings of Pounds 820m in the
first year and Pounds 1.3bn in the second year.

Tesco, the supermarket chain, has protested to its rival J. Sainsbury over
the order to remove a Tesco 20-page Christmas advertising supplement,
containing Pounds 7.50 worth of vouchers, from copies of the Radio Times on
sale in Sainsbury stores.
Sainsbury sent out the order by computer but soon withdrew it. It said it
had been 'an error of judgment'.
Sir Ian MacLaurin, Tesco chairman, yesterday wrote to Mr David Sainsbury,
his opposite number, expressing his surprise at the initial move.
He said: 'This seems a most improper, if not illegal, action. It denies your
customers the opportunity to learn of the quality and value of the Christmas

FT  28 NOV 94 / Telstra announces corporate service
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Telstra, the telecommunications group owned by the Australian government,
said yesterday that it plans to launch an international telephone service
for UK-based corporate customers.
Telstra acquired a licence to operate in the domestic UK market in April. At
the time it said it would offer a range of domestic voice and data services,
and resale services to Australia.
However it now plans a broader international call service aimed at
corporations and financial institutions.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Forestry reforms under attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's plans for introducing market reforms into the way Britain's
forests are run will come under criticism today by two environmental groups,
Deborah Hargreaves writes.
The Council for the Protection of Rural England and the Royal Society for
the Protection of Birds fear that imposing a more business-like structure on
Forest Enterprise, the commercial arm of the Forestry Commission, could be a
way of preparing it for privatisation.
In August the government announced Forest Enterprise would become an
executive agency under its 'next steps' programme aimed at increasing
efficiency. This followed widespread opposition to plans to sell the 1.1m
hectares of state-owned woodlands.
The environmental groups are concerned that the new agency will be forced to
operate too much like a private-sector company at the expense of public
benefits. But the public will not be impressed if the agency proposal turns
out simply to be a way of privatising by the back door.'

FT  28 NOV 94 / Newsprint chief warns prices may rise 30%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices for newsprint are likely to rise by a further 15 per cent next year
on top of the 15 per cent already signalled for January, according to the
head of the UK's biggest plant.
Mr Ramsay Hampton, chief executive of Aylesford Newsprint, a joint venture
between SCA, the Swedish forestry group, and Mondi, the European paper
company, said the additional increase 'would only get us back to the level
of nominal selling prices in 1989' after the deep recession from which the
paper industry was only now recovering.
He said: 'We are negotiating with the newspaper proprietors and they are
never very happy to accept price increases, but I think they do remember
where the prices have come from. Paper makers have been under extreme cost
pressure for many years.'
Aylesford Newsprint has invested Pounds 250m in building Europe's biggest
100-per-cent-recycled newsprint mill in Kent, which will be up and running
by June next year.
The attraction of recycling waste paper has improved considerably over the
past year after virgin pulp prices doubled, pushing waste paper prices up by
100 per cent in Europe.
Aylesford has started running its combined heat and power plant at the site
and will commission the water and effluent treatment facility before the end
of the year.
The new paper machine will have the capacity to produce 280,000 tonnes of
newsprint a year, mainly for the UK market, which is 70 per cent supplied by
imports. This brings the capacity of the plant to 370,000 tonnes.
Aylesford is one of the first newsprint mills to use recycled paper as its
only raw material - most newsprint producers use a mix of recycled and
virgin material.
The company has approached hundreds of local authorities to set up the
country's biggest collection scheme for waste paper. It plans to have 5,000
collection banks in place by June at a total cost of between Pounds 3m and
Pounds 5m.
Mr Hampton said the used newspaper and magazine banks will supply 60 per
cent to 65 per cent of the plant's needs. If the recycling effort is
successful, Aylesford expects to double its capacity.
The market has turned from one in which paper merchants were virtually
paying companies to take waste material away to one where they are pushing
through large price rises.
Mr Hampton said: 'The problem in the UK was that there were few outlets for
recycling waste paper and suddenly the collection system was bigger than the
capacity for using it. We want to interest people in collecting it again as
we can provide an assured outlet.'
SCA and Mondi, part of the Minorco group, joined forces a year ago to chase
investment in Europe in the recycled sector.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Tory Eurosceptics switch to long-term strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party's leading Eurosceptics yesterday shifted their sights
beyond the battle over the European Union budget to the ground on which they
will fight further moves to European integration.
Mr John Major was warned that his survival through the immediate crisis
engulfing the party would not weaken the resolve of a sizeable swathe of
Tory MPs to block the transfer of any new powers to Brussels.
The sceptics appeared increasingly divided about today's vote on higher
British contributions to Brussels. Many acknowledged pressure from their
constituency associations to support the government and several signalled
their intention to fall into line.
But other potential rebels were trying to rescue the rebellion by securing
commitments from at least 15 backbenchers that they would abstain rather
than vote for the EU finance legislation.
The hardliners, said to include Sir Teddy Taylor, Mrs Teresa Gorman and Mr
Tony Marlow, calculate that if the number of abstentions is larger than the
government's present Commons' majority of 14, Mr Major will be forced to
drop the threat to suspend any rebels from the parliamentary party. Their
assessment was flatly rejected by Tory party managers, who insisted that
rebellion on an issue of confidence would give Mr Richard Ryder, the chief
whip, no option but to exclude dissidents from the parliamentary party. On
that basis ministers hope the number of rebels can be squeezed down to half
a dozen or fewer irreconcilables.
The government's tactics have prompted a number of the sceptics to switch
their focus to the government's negotiating stance at the EU's
intergovernmental conference in 1996.
A shift to the right in the political centre of gravity on the Tory back
benches since the Maastricht treaty has strengthened the sceptics' case that
there should be no further transfer of sovereignty.
The central demands were listed yesterday by Mr Norman Lamont, the former
chancellor, who earlier this autumn raised the possibility of British
withdrawal from the union if it moved further along the road to a federal
Europe.
The principal aim is to persuade Mr Major to rule out any British
participation in a single European currency. Failing that the sceptics -
backed by a much bigger group of backbenchers and by some members of the
cabinet - are determined that the prime minister should promise a referendum
on economic and monetary union.
Mr Lamont's call for a government white paper to provide the basis for a
comprehensive debate in the party before the 1996 conference has support
stretching beyond the hard core of Eurosceptics.
In spite of assurances from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, that
other European governments are not seeking a further drive towards
centralisation, the sceptics want to box in Mr Major well before the
conference.
Some insist that the outcome of the conference, as well as any decision on a
single currency, should be submitted to a referendum. Sir James Goldsmith,
the businessman and Euro-MP, yesterday announced plans to finance a new
political party aimed solely at giving people a say over whether Britain
should join a 'European superstate'.
Sir James, who is already giving financial backing to Euro-sceptics, accused
'fudging' politicians of blocking a referendum as bureaucrats in Brussels
stripped individual countries of their sovereignty to build a single state.
He said on BBC's Breakfast with Frost: 'The people have a right to vote.
They can force a referendum, they can bust the log-jam of the politicians.'

FT  28 NOV 94 / MPs seek views of ministers' energy experts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A committee of MPs is seeking advice from a government-appointed panel of
experts on next year's flotation of the National Grid and other topical
energy matters.
The Commons trade and industry committee has asked for the views of the
government's Energy Advisory Panel on clean-coal technology, competitiveness
in the electricity generation and supply sectors, and the National Grid. It
has asked the panel to respond by the end of March.
The committee's move is novel because the panel was set up to advise
ministers.
The Department of Trade and Industry said last week that the question of
whether the panel could advise other people had never been raised. If it
was, it would be considered, the department said.
The National Grid, the power transmission company in England and Wales,
which is owned by the regional electricity companies, is expected to be
floated on the London Stock Exchange next summer. The flotation price could
be as high as Pounds 5bn. The committee has asked for the panel's views on
what consequences the flotation will have and how the proceeds should be
distributed.
The 16-member panel, which was announced in last year's coal white paper,
was set up to advise on the 'interpretation' of information in the
government's annual energy report and its implications for future market
developments.'
Members of the panel include executives from the energy sector,
conservationists, academics and representatives of trade union and consumer
interests.
The regional electricity companies are discussing flotation plans with the
government, which holds a golden share in the National Grid, and are likely
to announce details within the next few months.
The flotation is likely to take the form of a demerger whereby shareholders
in the regional companies would be given new shares in the Grid. The
companies are expected to load the Grid with debt of about Pounds 750m to
help pay a Pounds 1bn tax bill and consumer rebates of more than Pounds
200m.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Companies seen to tighten discipline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many of Britain's companies have tightened disciplinary procedures for
employees and increased the range of disciplinary offences during the past
six years, according to a survey published today by the independent Labour
Research Department.
It found that 79 per cent of 147 procedure agreements covered in the survey
had been tightened or modified over the period. 'The range of possible
offences is increasing and cover a wide variety of issues not previously the
subject of discipline including smoking, sex and race harassment and
computer-related offences,' says the report.
The body suggested there was 'some evidence to suggest that companies have
used the recession and the lengthening unemployment queues to tighten up on
discipline'.
The proportion of workplaces considering sexual and racial harassment as
matters of gross misconduct by employees has risen from 3 per cent in 1988
to 16 per cent.
The survey found that 54 per cent of company procedure agreements provided
for a formal hearing before the imposition of any discipline. Employees had
the right to union representation in a disciplinary case in 77 per cent of
workplaces but in only 49 per cent did this provide for a formal hearing.
Only 3 per cent of workplaces allowed their employees to see their personal
files. As many as 98 per cent of agreements provided a right to appeal,
compared with 79 per cent in 1988.
While 61 per cent of workplaces gave employees at least three warnings
before dismissing them, one in three companies provided for the suspension
of an employee in a disciplinary case, with the average suspension being
five days.
The survey suggests employee representatives are experiencing difficulties
with procedures either because management want to amend them or because the
procedures may not be operated quite in the way they had been laid down.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Report on durability of consumer goods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer goods should be made to last longer rather than being sent for
recycling when they are no longer required, says a report by an economic
think-tank published today, Deborah Hargreaves writes.
The New Economics Foundation says longer-lasting products would be much more
beneficial to the environment than recycling, which the report's author
criticises as inadequate and a 'third-rate' option. Mr Tim Cooper, the
author, says more than 6m large kitchen appliances, 3m vacuum cleaners and
2m cars are discarded in Britain each year.
He criticises the current emphasis on recycling, noting that recycling
itself uses energy and adds to pollution.
Mr Cooper says that recycling is preferable to landfill, but should be
ranked third after waste reduction which involves building longer-lasting
products, and re-using products and their components.
The report claims that companies could gain a beneficial marketing edge by
producing more durable goods. It also advocates significantly longer
guarantees for products and a shift in taxes from labour to energy and raw
materials.

The Economic and Social Research Council, a government agency, has launched
a Pounds 1.4m research programme that might help chancellors make better
predictions about the electoral and economic impact of Budget proposals.
The programme will focus on people's economic values, beliefs and behaviour.
It is based on the council's contention that 'there is a lot more to what
people do than simply the money in their pocket'.
The 'economic beliefs and behaviour programme' will involve 52 researchers
at 17 universities. They will work on 13 projects covering areas such as
taxation, pension and benefit provision, as well as investment and
entrepreneurship.
The programme will try to assess how far cultural beliefs and moral values
as well as shifting ideas about consumerism or entrepreneurship interact
with conventional incentives based on money.

FT  28 NOV 94 / NHS staff crisis feared as forecasts attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Health Service could face a shortage of nurses and occupational
therapists in the next few years because of flaws in the system for
predicting staffing needs.
A report by the Institute for Manpower Studies for the NHS executive says
regional health authorities in England have been forced to make 'heroic
assumptions' about future staffing needs for nursing and occupational
therapists in England. The report, which has not been published, says
workforce planners face 'lack of reliable data' in deciding on the
allocation of training places.
Since the 1991 NHS reforms the 14 English regional health authorities have
been responsible for identifying demand for newly qualified staff. The NHS
executive conducts an annual poll of each authority and develops a five-year
plan to make sure a national supply of trained staff is maintained.
But the report says the short-term nature of the service contracting process
with staff makes long-term forecasts difficult. In addition, it says, little
historical data about turnover of staff is available to the regional health
authorities.
The length of training programmes and the over-reliance on current
productivity levels also skews forecasts, it says. The report points out
that private-sector healthcare employers are often unwilling or unable to
contribute to the exercise and therefore training needs can be
underestimated.
The report says that workforce planning is not given a high priority. 'All
too often,' it says, planning appears to be 'delegated to junior staff in
personnel, who lack the authority to challenge staffing assumptions'.
The Department of Health said the executive was considering the
recommendations in the report, which also recommends options for improving
data collection and forecasting methods.
The Royal College of Nursing, the College of Occupational Therapists, and
Unison, the main health service union, say that regional determination of
training needs is flawed because it leaves gaps in forecasts. They believe
central determination of needs is required.
Mr Tom Bolger, RCN director of education, said the number of training places
for nurses had dropped 33 per cent since 1987. He said he had heard reports
that health authorities in London and the Thames region could not fill
nursing vacancies and that advertised jobs in nursing journals had doubled
in the past 12 months. He said: 'Unless something drastic is done to
increase the number of students then we are likely to have a crisis of
shortages in the future.'
Ms Georgina Smith, director of education at the College of Occupational
Therapists, said: 'I think there is going to be a training crisis as the
health service continues to be devolved.'

The chancellor may be heartened to learn that according to a cross-section
of people contacted by the Financial Times, the public does not expect much
good news in tomorrow's Budget.
Mr David Rist, marketing director of the British Shoe Corporation,
responsible for the Hush Puppy shoes Mr Kenneth Clarke wears, said consumers
remained cautious and were not spending.
He said: 'It would be nice if the chancellor could make a gesture which
would boost confidence. But I simply cannot see it. Tax cuts are simply not
on the agenda.'
Mr Paul Handley, finance director of Mansfield Brewery, the beer-drinking
chancellor's local brewer, said: 'We are constantly told the economy is
coming out of recession but the consumer has still got to come out of the
closet. People are still worried about their mortgages, their jobs.'
Our interviewees, whose reactions to the Budget we will report on Wednesday,
include chief executives, small businessmen, a farmer, a pensioner, a writer
and an unemployed man in Britain's worst unemployment blackspot.
Most disliked the idea of further cuts in direct taxation, if the price to
be paid was increases in indirect tax.
Ms Sara Gibb, a Lloyd's Name and administrative secretary of the Gooda
Walker Action Group, said: 'I object to the idea of taxation by stealth. We
are led to believe that because personal tax bands are changed we are going
to be better off. But in fact any gains are offset by huge increases in
indirect taxes.'
Value added tax on fuel remains particularly unpopular. Mr Richard Woodall,
superstore manager at Asda in Norwich, said that the government would be
unwise to make any increase in VAT or any other indirect taxes because of
consumers' nervousness.
Those involved in business were keen to see encouragement for capital
investment. Mr Robin Saxby, chief executive of microchip company Advance
Risc Machines of Cambridge, favoured lower corporation tax and the return of
100 per cent first-year depreciation allowances for capital spending.
Mr Richard Butler, a 44-year-old Tory voter who farms 1,500 acres in
Wiltshire, wanted more generous capital allowances on investment in farm
buildings and machinery.
Mr John Jermine, chairman of Chesterfield mining concern NSM, wanted
increased capital allowances for companies.
But Mr Jermine, who described himself as a high Tory, did not want any cut
in direct taxes. He said: 'I think direct taxes are low enough. We are
competitive with other countries. A lot needs to be done in areas like the
country's infrastructure.'
Others warmed to the theme of cost-saving through greater government
efficiency. Mr Bertie Grotian, a former army officer who runs a marquee
hiring company, said: 'If you look at the Ministry of Defence there must be
one bureaucrat for every soldier. There is plenty of scope for cuts in the
inflated bureaucracies.'
Ms Leisha Fullich, director of education for the London borough of Lewisham,
said: 'I am not saying I favour increases in public spending but something
does need to be done about the environment and education.'
Employers are interested in the chancellor's National Insurance intentions.
Mr Richard Sayer, a Northumberland estate agent who employs eight people,
said: 'Any increase in NI contributions would be crushingly bad.'
Some, including Mr Sayer, would welcome tax cuts.
But Mr Peter Chapman, an unemployed South Shields design engineer and Mr
Alastair Fyfe, duty control manager for European Passenger Services, backed
tax increases if the money were to be used to support key services, notably
the National Health Service. Mr Chapman is a Labour party member, Mr Fyfe a
potential Liberal Democrat voter.
Mr Grotian, who pays himself Pounds 21,000 a year, employs five full-timers
and 10 casuals in the summer, said: 'After taxes and emergency taxes, it is
not worth an unemployed person working. He or she is better off on the
dole.'
Government policy stability was a key concern. Mr Andrew Pimblett, managing
director of crane manufacturer Street Cranes, which employs 150 people,
would like to see manufacturing helped. 'But I do not want anything
short-term. The last thing we need is another boom and bust,' he said.
As an exporter he would prefer interest rates not to change. And Mr Sayer
warned that any rise could give out the wrong messages. He said: 'The
mortgage interest rate isn't so critical as the world thinks. What is far
more critical is the way the public interprets any change.'
Mr Sayer spoke for many in saying mortgage interest tax relief was no longer
a big issue, since its value in real terms had already been whittled down.
Any glimmer of hope focused on reduced duties on beer, wine, spirits and
tobacco to counter cheap cross-Channel imports. Mr Handley at Mansfield
Brewery said he would welcome such a move.
But for Mr Michael Watson, a Newcastle tobacconist, no conceivable reduction
could close the gap of almost 300 per cent between his prices and those of
'smuggled tobacco' sold in local pubs and clubs.
Mr Chapman said: 'What will be needed from this Budget is something to give
people encouragement and hope.' But he isn't holding his breath.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Boost for economic forecasts launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Economic and Social Research Council, a government agency, has launched
a Pounds 1.4m research programme that might help chancellors make better
predictions about the electoral and economic impact of Budget proposals,
Peter Norman writes.
The programme will focus on peoples' economic values, beliefs and behaviour.
It is based on the council's contention that 'there is a lot more to what
people do than simply the money in their pocket'.
The 'economic beliefs and behaviour programme' will involve 52 researchers
at 17 universities. They will work on 13 projects covering areas such as
taxation, pension and benefit provision, as well as investment and
entrepreneurship.
The programme will try to assess how far cultural beliefs and moral values
as well as shifting ideas about consumerism or entrepreneurship interact
with conventional incentives based on money. The programme's authors believe
such an approach could have warned the government of the outcry that
followed last year's Budget announcement of value added tax on domestic
fuel.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Lessons to learn in keeping the peace: The successful UN
operation in Mozambique
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the next three months, UN peacekeeping operations will be drawing to a
close in Mozambique and Somalia - the former a qualified success, the latter
an unmitigated disaster.
In Mozambique, 7,000 UN troops have overseen the implementation of a peace
accord which ended a 17-year civil war, demobilised 75,000 combatants, and
helped Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo) guerrillas organise
themselves into a political party and contest peaceful elections.
In Somalia, a much larger and costlier UN mission has been unable to restore
peace to a nation shattered by clan warfare. The UN pullout from its
fortified bunker in Mogadishu will be a dangerous and undignified affair.
Attempts to make rival warlords talk peace have failed, and the UN has long
since dropped the pretence of trying to control the armed factions battling
for supremacy in the capital and its hinterland.
But Mr Aldo Ajello, the tough Italian diplomat in charge of the UN's
operation in Mozambique, does not believe in models. 'What worked in
Mozambique will not necessarily work elsewhere,' he said in Maputo, as he
prepared to leave for a well-earned rest. 'There was a real will to restore
peace here. No-one can impose peace on a people who wish to continue
fighting.'
It was not as simple as that. Mr Ajello, who arrived in Mozambique two years
ago, saw immediately that the agreement signed between Renamo and the
Frelimo government would collapse under the pressure of the one-year
timetable for demobilisation and elections.
'We had to introduce some flexibility into the calendar,' he recalls. 'The
accord was too complex, there were not enough people to implement it, and
the people were not good enough.' After 17 years of fighting, most Renamo
leaders were not well versed in implementing peace, while the Frelimo
government, in power since 1975, resented the loss of sovereignty implicit
in the UN's tutelary role.
'We had to give time for both parties to overcome their distrust of each
other, and we had to adapt the UN mission to the reality on the ground,' Mr
Ajello says.
The former enemies, however, dragged their feet over the demobilisation of
their combatants. Mr Alfonso Dhlakama, the Renamo leader, kept his best men
in the bush to strengthen his hand in political negotiations. The elections,
rescheduled for October 1994, looked an unlikely prospect. Mr Ajello decided
Mozambique could not survive another year of uncertainty, but he also
realised that Renamo would not contest elections without the resources to
fund its transformation from a military into a political machine.
'People were shocked that the UN was prepared to fund a former guerrilla
movement,' Mr Ajello concedes, 'but the only way to make this mission a
success was to forget conventional wisdom.' The imbalances were too great.
To make Renamo function as an equal partner in the peace agreement, it
needed houses in Maputo, telephones, faxes and cars; Mr Dhlakama needed to
be given the trappings of a political leader.
Mr Ajello believes Dollars 17m (Pounds 10.3m) - the cost of funding Renamo's
election campaign - was a small insurance premium to add to the UN's Dollars
500m peacekeeping operation in Mozambique. 'We gave him enough to ensure he
had too much to lose if he returned to war,' says Mr Ajello.
The gamble almost failed. On the eve of the poll, Mr Dhlakama suddenly
announced he was pulling Renamo out of the contest, convinced it would be
fraudulent. Forty-eight hours of frantic negotiations finally brought him
back into the fold. The election resulted in a Frelimo victory, but with a
smaller margin than had been expected, and Mr Dhlakama accepted the outcome.
Mr Ajello is cautious about drawing broader lessons from the UN's
controversial funding of a guerrilla movement. He believes it worked in
Mozambique because the guerrillas were so obviously tired of war. In Angola,
Somalia and Rwanda, where armistice accords collapsed, Mr Ajello is not sure
political funding would have helped turn the tide in favour of peace.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Cliffhanger in Uruguayan poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING

<DATELINE>
   MONTEVIDEO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Uruguayan exit polls pointed to a virtual three-way tie between the main
presidential contenders, leaving voters waiting early today for definitive
results of the closest election in years.
The polling group Equipos Consultores, in common with other polling
organisations, put Mr Tabare Vazquez, candidate of the left-wing Encuentro
Progresista, marginally ahead of rivals from the Blanco and Colorado
parties, with a projected 27 per cent of the national vote.
Encuentro was seen as winning easily in Montevideo, the capital.
Equipos put the governing Blanco party, which has two presidential
candidates - Mr Alberto Volonte and Mr Juan Andres Ramrez - on 23 per cent
and Colorado, whose main candidate is former president Julio Maria
Sanguinetti, on 21 per cent. Under Uruguay's electoral system, the president
must come from the winning party and is not necessarily the candidate who
collects the most votes.
However, Equipos director Mr Agustin Canzani stressed that a very high 24
per cent of those questioned in exit polls refused to say which way they had
voted.
Mr Canzani said supporters of the more traditional Blanco and Colorado
parties were less likely to divulge their voting preference, rendering
Encuentro's apparent lead less conclusive.
Other polling organisations, including the statistics department of the
University of the Republic, projected less than three percentage points
between the first and third-placed candidate.
'At this stage, it would be irresponsible for me to predict who is going to
win,' said Mr Canzani, but 'Encuentro's results are looking better as time
wears on.' Other analysts agreed that it was too early to make predictions,
saying the result could be defined by as few as 15,000 votes.
The results of elections will determine whether Uruguay pushes ahead with
the free-market reforms cautiously introduced by President Luis Alberto
Lacalle.
Both Blanco candidates would try to revive the privatisation process and to
cut social security costs, while Mr Vazquez and, to some extent Mr
Sanguinetti, would probably put a break on the liberalisation process.
Whoever becomes president will have to deal with a Congress - whose members
were also being elected yesterday - almost certain to be split three ways
between the main political blocs. Mr Sanguinetti said last night that
Uruguay's electoral system almost inevitably produced 'political
fragmentation' and made 'governability a difficult matter'.

<TEXT>
Jordan and Israel yesterday announced the establishment of diplomatic ties
in line with last month's peace treaty leading to full normal relations
after a 46-year state of belligerency, Reuter reports from Amman. A joint
communique issued in Amman and Jerusalem paved the way for exchanging
ambassadors and opening embassies in Amman and Tel Aviv by December 10, as
set out in the treaty. A party of schoolchildren will go to Israel tomorrow
to attend celebrations in Haifa, becoming the first group of Jordanians to
enter Israel formally since November 14, when both countries opened the way
for visits.
Hundreds of Israeli tourists have flocked to Jordan in the past two weeks.
The statement added that both countries hoped the move would promote
comprehensive peace, development and co-operation. They will now formally
exchange letters nominating ambassadors. King Hussein personally chose Mr
Marwan Muasher, 38, Jordan's former Middle East peace team spokesman and a
US-educated computer entrepreneur, as Jordan's first envoy to Israel.
The cabinet appointed Mr Muasher ambassador at the foreign ministry on
Saturday and is expected to send his papers to Israel soon. Israel has yet
to name an envoy to Jordan.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Mexican party turns on accuser
</HEADLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary party has launched a fierce
counter-attack against Mr Mario Ruiz Massieu, the former deputy attorney
general who last week resigned after claiming senior party figures had
blocked the investigation into the assassination of his brother, Mr Jose
Francisco Ruiz Massieu. The party formally accused him of defamation and
calumny.
Mr Ignacio Pichardo, the party president, brought a defamation suit against
Mr Ruiz Massieu, saying the latter had offered no evidence for his
allegations. Mr Pichardo, and Ms Maria de los Angeles Moreno, the number two
party official, accused Mr Ruiz Massieu of using his brother's assassination
to settle personal scores and damage the PRI.
Mr Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the former secretary general of the PRI, was
gunned down outside a Mexico City hotel on September 28. His brother Mario
was until last week responsible for the investigation, and has accused some
10 people of being involved in the crime, including a former PRI deputy.
However, the deputy is missing, and the investigation has stalled in recent
weeks.
Mr Ruiz Massieu says he has put evidence allegedly incriminating Mr
Pichardo, Ms Moreno and Mr Humberto Benitez Trevino, attorney general, in a
sealed box to be opened on December 1, and says Mr Zedillo will have to
decide what to do with the evidence.
Mr Zedillo has hardly commented on the fierce battle between Mr Ruiz Massieu
and leaders of the PRI. But Mr Pichardo and Mr Trevino both come from a
powerful political grouping that has been an important ally of Mr Zedillo.
Mr Ruiz Massieu has given emotional interviews implicitly criticising
outgoing President Carlos Salinas, referring to the PRI as the 'party of
parrots', attacking Mr Zedillo for not returning his telephone calls, and
saying he was considering joining the opposition.

FT  28 NOV 94 / International Press Review: Zedillo in the margins - Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first glance, it was hard to tell from the Mexican press that the country
is to install a new president in a few days. Articles about Mr Ernesto
Zedillo's inauguration on December 1 were swamped by extensive coverage of
Mexico's latest political scandal. This involves accusations - fiercely
denied - that senior officials and members of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary party conspired to block the investigation of the September
assassination of Mr Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the PRI's own secretary general.
However, Mr Zedillo was a constant figure in the margins of the scandal
coverage, with the press noting that problems within the ruling party were
affecting his delicate task of forming a cabinet and promoting political
reform.
The crisis was unleashed by Mr Ruiz's younger brother Mario, who last week
levelled his accusations and resigned as deputy attorney general, chief
investigator into his brother's murder, and PRI militant.
Papers accustomed to touting PRI orthodoxy took to attacking Mario for
disrupting an already complicated transition. The financially troubled
Excelsior alleged that the 'aggrieved brother' had been put up to the whole
affair by another renegade PRI member and media star, Mr Manuel Camacho, and
that the scandal 'was a prelude to the formation of an opposition political
party' led by Mr Camacho and Mr Ruiz. Paid advertisements in several other
papers made the same claims.
El Financiero, the country's main business daily, took a different approach,
theorising that outgoing President Carlos Salinas had orchestrated the
entire Ruiz-PRI conflict to lay the groundwork for Mr Zedillo to 'take
charge' by exorcising the hardline 'dinosaurs' from the ruling party.
One columnist even said the conflict had opened the way for Mr Zedillo 'also
to resign from the PRI, to show he is serious about reform'.
Reforma, known for its independence and sensationalism, flatly declared that
the accused PRI hierarchy had been so politically damaged by the back-biting
that they were going to be left out of the Zedillo administration.
One cartoonist at the leftist La Jornada took a more cynical view, drawing a
picture of the PRI hierarchy completely soaked in mud, but saying: 'We just
have to clean ourselves up a little bit for the cabinet photo.'
The pink financial paper, El Economista, seemed not to care about the who,
what or why of the affair, saying only: 'The political crisis slows the flow
of foreign capital.'
Over the weekend, the only public statement from the president-elect himself
was his offer to respect the freedom of the press. Reporters who camped
outside his office in hopes of eliciting a comment about the Ruiz-PRI
conflict were snubbed, possibly in retaliation for all but ignoring Mr
Zedillo's trip to Washington last week to see President Bill Clinton.
Instead, they were told Mr Zedillo was trying to fine-tune his inauguration
speech.
Judging by other hot stories filling the papers, the new president will have
a lot of issues to talk about in his Thursday address. Conflict is beginning
to simmer again in the southern state of Chiapas, scene of an armed
rebellion this year, according to the government-owned news agency Notimex.
In addition thousands of opposition protesters from the southeastern state
of Tabasco will soon arrive in Mexico City to denounce alleged electoral
fraud in a recent gubernatorial election, noted La Jornada and El
Financiero.
And many papers reported, based on official sources, that the confessed
killer of the PRI's first presidential candidate Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio had
been secretly interrogated and possibly tortured just hours after the
assassination and raised the idea that the murder was the work of drug
traffickers.
With all these problems, veteran columnist Rene Delgado noted that Mr
Salinas was the fifth president in a row to leave office amid political
crisis. 'Zedillo's challenge is enormous. In a few days he will have to face
it,' wrote Mr Delgado in Reforma. 'We hope this time the story will be
different.'

<DATELINE>
   MONTEVIDEO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Uruguayans yesterday voted in what promised to be the country's closest
presidential election for decades as latest opinion polls indicated a
virtual three-way tie between the main contenders.
Polls conducted before campaigning stopped last week put the governing
Blanco party and the opposition Colorado party on 29 per cent each, with the
left-wing Encuentro Progresista coalition just behind on 27 per cent. Few
pollsters were hazarding a guess on the likely outcome, saying the result
could be changed by a swing of only 15,000 votes.
Whoever becomes president will almost certainly lack a majority in Congress
 -whose members were also being elected yesterday - and will have to forge a
coalition in order to govern for the next five years.
The two presidential front-runners were expected to be Mr Julio Maria
Sanguinetti, a former president and candidate for the social
democratic-leaning Colorado party, and Mr Alberto Volonte, a maverick Blanco
candidate campaigning on a 'non-politician' platform.
Close behind in the polls is Mr Tabare Vazquez, the charismatic mayor of
Montevideo who leads a coalition ranging from social democrats to
socialists, communists and former guerrillas. Mr Juan Andres Ramrez,
Blanco's second presidential candidate, is the chosen successor of President
Luis Alberto Lacalle, but has consistently trailed Mr Volonte in the polls.
Results of the elections, not expected to be officially announced until
today, will determine whether Uruguay pushes ahead with the free-market
reforms cautiously introduced by President Lacalle. Both Blanco candidates
would try to revive the privatisation process and to reform the costly
social security system.
Mr Sanguinetti, who has complained that overzealous liberalisation has
harmed Uruguayan industry, would probably adopt less overtly free-market
policies. Mr Vazquez, who enjoys fanatical support in Montevideo but whose
party machinery may be insufficiently well oiled to deliver him national
victory, has sharply criticised the Blanco reform process.
Uruguayans also voted yesterday on constitutional reforms, one of which
would make it harder to reform the pension system, while the other would
guarantee that 27 per cent of public spending went on education. Blanco
candidates say the reforms, both of which stand a reasonable chance of
passing, would seriously weaken already stretched public finances.
Voting is obligatory for Uruguay's registered electorate of 2.3m.

<TEXT>
Islamic gunmen yesterday killed a rabbi and wounded an Israeli policeman
near Hebron on the occupied West Bank. Hamas, the main opponent of the peace
deal between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, claimed
responsibility in a statement issued in the Gaza Strip.
The 35-year-old rabbi, Ami Ulami, was driving north towards the settlement
of Otniel, when gunmen raked his car with automatic fire. The car
overturned, but it was not immediately clear whether he died from the
shooting or the crash. The policeman, a passenger in the vehicle, suffered
gunshot wounds and was recovering in a Jerusalem hospital last night.
Settler leaders claimed authorities had done nothing to bolster security in
the area since two Israelis were killed in a guerrilla attack earlier this
year about 1km from the site of yesterday's incident.
Mr Roni Shechner, head of the local settlements council, said: 'There are
dangerous killers in this area, but the army is thinning its forces, instead
of reinforcing them.'
Earlier yesterday the Chief of Staff, Lt-Gen Ehud Barak, warned the cabinet
that Israel could expect an increase in Palestinian attacks. The prime
minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, is standing by his policy of 'fighting terror as
if there were no peace negotiations, while negotiating as if there were no
terror'.
The attacks are, however, forcing him to move slowly and cautiously. Six
months after Israeli troops pulled out of most of Gaza and Jericho, he has
still to set a date for evacuating the rest of the West Bank, or for
granting the Palestinians safe passage by road between Gaza and Jericho.
Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman who is considering the possibility of
setting up a consultative council in the absence of elections, is
challenging Hamas to accept a share of the responsibility that goes with
influencing Palestinian autonomy.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Saudi Arabia is committing itself in principle to balancing its budget by
the end of the decade, under a new five-year plan in which the government
says it will seek to privatise some state industries, 'rationalise' costly
state subsidies and invite greater private sector investment in
infrastructure and other projects.
The principles are contained in an abstract of the kingdom's sixth five-year
plan, which will come into effect after approval by King Fahd, the Saudi
ruler, on January 1.
The abstract contains only declarations of principles guiding Saudi policy
for the next five years. Details will be included with the plan's full
publication next year. However, it addresses some of the core reasons behind
the kingdom's consistently high budget deficits over the past decade and
hints that the government may be ready to make significant structural
changes to its finances.
Saudi officials recently suggested that the kingdom's next budget, also due
on January 1, might contain specific measures to raise state revenues. Last
year's budget called for a flat 19 per cent cut from all government
departments following the kingdom's 11th successive budget deficit in 1993.
The fiscal gap in 1993 was reckoned by western economists to be Dollars 12bn
(Pounds 7.3bn), or 10 per cent of GDP, though no official figure is
published. A shortfall of around Dollars 6bn is expected for 1994, even
after successful government spending cuts.
However, the document, called General Objectives and Strategic Bases of the
Sixth Development Plan, says the government will 'adopt a fiscal policy
which allows the level of expenditure to commensurate with government
revenues' during the plan's five-year period.
This will be achieved, it says, by finding 'optimum ways to increase
government revenues' without causing 'undesirable social and economic
effects'. This is to include increasing government efficiency, enhancing
private sector investment, particularly in infrastructure projects, and
'developing privatisation programmes'.
King Fahd has already raised the possibility in two recent speeches of
eventually privatising Saudia, the highly-subsidised state carrier, and
parts of the kingdom's telecommunications system. The new document states a
general principle of encouraging the private sector to own and manage 'basic
industries' through the 'timely flotation of the shares of these
industries'.
On subsidies, which at present heavily reduce the prices of power,
telecommunications and water services, the document says the government will
'rationalise the system of direct and indirect subsidies'. It says the
prices of such services 'should not be less than their production cost,
except in rare cases'. While saying that the costs of providing public
utilities should be reduced, the document holds out the prospect of price
rises, adding that these would be implemented 'without jeopardising the
status of low income strata of society'.
The document also places a priority on increasing vocational training and
job opportunities for Saudis in the private sector.
It says the government will seek to 'change attitudes towards certain
occupations which at present are not accepted by some individuals' - a
reference to most Saudis' preference for secure and well-paid public sector
jobs over private sector employment.
It also says the government would 'find suitable means to encourage the
private sector to provide job opportunities' for Saudis, hinting that it may
for the first time introduce specific incentives for companies to hire Saudi
citizens rather than expatriate workers.
More than 4.5m expatriates now work in the kingdom, most of them in private
sector manual, technical or industrial jobs.
Remittances from these workers, mostly from the sub-continent and east Asia,
amount to Dollars 16bn-Dollars 18bn a year, according to local economists.

Taiwan's first vote to eject lawmakers failed yesterday, thanks to low
turnout. Only 18 per cent of the 2m eligible voters in Taipei county went to
the polls in an attempt to oust four lawmakers from the ruling Kuomintang
for their support of a controversial nuclear power plant which the
state-owned Taiwan Power Company plans to build. The leading opposition
Democratic Progressive party, which controls the county, also invited voters
to cast their ballot in a referendum on whether the country's fourth nuclear
facility should be sited in Taipei county. But Taiwan's Central Election
Commission, which supervises polls, has ruled the vote not legally binding
as a law governing referendums has yet to be enacted.
The poor turnout could reflect badly on the DPP ahead of municipal and
provincial elections to be held next Saturday, as opponents are likely to
accuse the DPP of wasting taxpayers' money.

Polish President Lech Walesa has vetoed proposals to maintain income tax
rates at 21, 33 and 45 per cent for 1995. Mr Walesa, who is due to stand for
re-election at the end of next year, argued that the rates were raised from
20, 30 and 40 per cent as a temporary measure in 1994 and should return to
those levels in 1995.
The move could mean that the president is preparing for confrontation with
the government coalition headed by Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the Peasant party
leader, over the budget when it is passed by parliament early in the new
year. A successful veto on the budget would lead to early elections for
parliament whose term expires in 1997.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's Ministry of Internal Trade plans to ease controls on trading of coal
but will keep control over some mines and some coal trading to back
infrastructural development. A growing part of the remaining coal supply
will be freely traded, the newspaper China Daily reported.
China has gradually eased government controls on a number of key commodities
as part of its market-oriented economic reforms. In some cases, such as
cotton, controls have been reimposed because of hoarding and quality
problems. Easing restrictions on coal trading and distribution is intended
to help improve the economic efficiency of state-run coal mines by allowing
prices to rise, the report said.
Subsidies now used to help support indebted mines will be used to finance
state coal purchases at higher prices. China's coal output between January
and October rose 5.8 per cent over the year-earlier period to 920m tons.
Demand for coal, however, is growing at an annual rate of 7.4 per cent.

<TEXT>
RJ Reynolds, the US tobacco company, has developed a virtually smokeless
cigarette, marking its latest attempt to combat the anti-smoking sentiment
sweeping the US. According to the New York Times, which was given access by
the company to tests conducted throughout this year, the cigarette has won
high marks from smokers who have tried it. Reynolds' previous 'safe'
cigarette, Premier, flopped soon after it was launched in 1988.
The new cigarette, known as Eclipse, works by passing hot air over tobacco
without actually setting it alight. The hot air draws the flavour and
nicotine from the tobacco but does not release the tars which produce
noxious smoke and cause cancer. Mr Thomas Griscom, executive vice-president
of Reynolds, is quoted by the Times as saying: 'This is where we hope the
future of the company is.'

FT  28 NOV 94 / Mazda in pact to make Fiesta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford is expected to announce this week that it has reached agreement with
Mazda, its Japanese affiliate, for the production in Europe of a Ford car
for sale under the Mazda badge. The two companies have been examining the
possibility of producing a Mazda-badged Ford Fiesta for sale by the Japanese
carmaker in European markets.
The Fiesta is built at three plants in west Europe: Dagenham in the UK,
Cologne in Germany, and Valencia in Spain. Approval of the project could be
announced this week, but a decision on which plant will produce the
Mazda-badged cars may not be made until early next year. Germany is
overwhelmingly Mazda's most important market in Europe. Production of the
Mazda-badged Fiesta is expected to begin in late 1995 or early 1996 with
output of about 30,000 cars a year.
The plan aims to give the loss-making Mazda group its first production
source in Europe, where it has lagged behind Toyota, Nissan, Honda,
Mitsubishi and Suzuki, which all have car plants already in production or
under development in Europe. Mazda, which is 24.5 per cent owned by Ford,
has suffered a steep fall in west European sales of 9.6 per cent in the
first 10 months of this year in a market that has grown by 4.9 per cent.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Moscow and Tokyo agree to boost ties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia and Japan yesterday signed agreements to improve economic ties and
postpone Russian trade debts. The economic accords mark another small step
towards the normalisation of Japan's strained relations with Russia, seen
until recently as a dangerous and unreliable neighbour.
Mr Oleg Soskovets, Russian first deputy foreign minister, signed four
economic agreements designed to increase trade and restructure a small part
of Russia's Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3bn) debt. Japanese officials quoted Mr
Soskovets as saying: 'We must build trust on all fronts, through political
dialogue, military affairs and regional contact.'
He complained, however, that trade with Japan had declined, and called for a
new high-level bilateral trade committee, chaired by Mr Soskovets and Mr
Yohei Kono, the Japanese deputy premier and foreign minister, to speed up
agreements on tax, investment protection and transport. Mr Kono said,
however, that Russia must put its own economic house in order before foreign
investment would come in significant quantities.
The agreements allow Russia to extend repayments on Dollars 280m of debt to
Japanese companies and the Japanese Export Import Bank over 10 years
following a three-year grace period. There was also agreement to export 5m
cu m of wood a year from Russia's Far East to Japan; a Japanese promise of
Dollars 500m in humanitarian aid; support from Tokyo for Russian membership
of the World Trade Organisation and Japanese support for the Russian
economic reforms.
However, according to the Russian official news agency Tass, the Japanese
refused a Russian request for an extra Dollars 130m of credits above the
Dollars 400m already promised to aid the reconstruction of four huge plants
 -the AZLK car plant in Moscow, the Kamaz truck plant in Naberezhnye Chelny,
the Impuls engineering plant in Petersburg and the Yaroslavl synthetics
enterprise.
The economic agreements continue a process which began with President Boris
Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo just over a year ago, in which he agreed to open
negotiations on the four disputed Kurile islands off northern Japan, seized
by Russia in the last days of the second world war. Tokyo agreed, in return,
to relax its former policy of making any increase in Russian aid conditional
on progress over the islands dispute.
Because of Russia's ownership claim, Japan remains the only member of the
Group of Seven yet to sign a second world war peace treaty with Moscow. The
Kuriles are a popular symbol of both Japanese and Russian national pride.
The Kuriles issue remains - according to a Japanese foreign ministry
spokesman - 'difficult and long-lasting'. Mr Kono brusquely refused a
proposal from Mr Soskovets to discuss economic co-operation on the Kuriles,
saying this contradicted the Japanese position that they must be returned.
Today, Mr Soskovets is due to meet prime minister Mr Tomiichi Murayama, and
other ministers.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Hong Kong railway lets off its head of steam: Contracts are
coming fast after years of Sino-British wrangles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior managers of Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) are
having a busy fortnight. Last week they let contracts valued at HKDollars
6.6bn (Pounds 544m) for the corporation's HKDollars 35bn railway connecting
the colony's new airport to the business district of Hong Kong. This week
managers hope to let a further four contracts for tunnelling and railway
stations.
Mr Hamish Mathers, the corporation's chairman and chief executive, likens
the process to shaking a bottle of champagne for a long time and then
removing the cork. 'In two weeks we have had (a Sino-British) agreement on
overall funding, land has been made available for the railway and the
Legislative Council has approved HKDollars 23.7bn of funds.'
The railway, like the airport at Chek Lap Kok which it is designed to
service, has been a hostage to more than five years of bone-breaking
Sino-British talks on, first, whether to build the project and then, how to
finance it. In between, talks became enmeshed in Britain and China's long
running dispute about Hong Kong's political development.
Unlike the airport, the construction of which has proceeded apace, physical
work on the railway had to wait until China gave its approval to the overall
financing for the project. Although the MTRC was unable to begin
construction until a formal Sino-British agreement it has not been idle.
The contracts awarded last week, and those to be awarded during this and
successive weeks, were negotiated to a stage where they could be formally
awarded the minute a Sino-British deal was sealed. Indeed, in the whole
project there is just one major contract - a HKDollars 3bn-plus mandate for
the Hong Kong island terminus to the airport railway - that is still open
for competitive bidding.
According to Mr Russell Black, project director for the airport railway,
more than a year ago the MTRC decided to embark upon a tendering process
that concluded with the corporation identifying successful bidders and
issuing them with 'option' letters.
'The successful bidder agreed to keep the price bid open for 12 months,' he
said. 'We identified him as the preferred contractor and we assumed the
risks of price escalation due to labour and materials costs, the risk on
currency if that was relevant, and the risk that statutory enactments might
affect costs. We accepted these risks only during the period of delay.'
Mr Black conceded that this was 'a little unusual' but cited a parallel with
London Underground's Jubilee line.
The airport railway constitutes a major expansion for the MTRC. Currently
the corporation runs a rail service of 43km; after completion of the airport
railway the length will rise to 77km. The corporation hopes to offer a
service that takes arrivals to Chek Lap Kok on an 135km an hour journey from
the airport north of Lantau island, to the central district on Hong Kong
island in just 23 minutes.
The additional track will also help relieve congestion on the main rail
service. At present the Nathan road section of the railway on Kowloon is the
most extensively used railway in the world, used by 80,000 people per route
kilometre per hour. The MTRC expects that 25 per cent of users of the
current system will switch to the Kowloon section of what will be known as
the Lantau line.
More than a railway is being built. Above the stations the MTRC in
partnership with local developers, will build 24,000 flats, 16 office
towers, nine hotels (of 5,000 rooms in total) and five large shopping
centres. Private property developers pay for the costs of construction but
share the profits with the MTRC.
Hopes, however, that the airport railway could be completed by mid-1997,
when China resumes sovereignty, may not be realised. Mr Mathers says the
corporation, once China approves borrowings of HKDollars 11.4bn, will
finalise an internal study on when the project can be completed. In the
meantime he is sticking to a previous forecast that the line from the
airport to Kowloon will open in April 1998, and the line to the central
district some time after.
Mr Roger Moss, finance director, is confident that the airport railway can
be built for less than the HKDollars 35bn allocated for the project. He is
equally confident that he can raise the HKDollars 11.4bn of debt for the
project for which final approval is dependent on China's agreement to a
financial accord between the MTRC and the Hong Kong government. The
corporation has investment grade credit ratings from the main rating
agencies.
This is because the MTRC is one of the few public rail systems in the world
which actually makes money. In the first six months of this year it had a
profit after depreciation and interest of HKDollars 500m. It pays no tax due
to accumulated losses currently standing at around HKDollars 1.8bn.
Mr Moss is wary of forecasting when the corporation will return to public
debt markets - it has a requirement to raise HKDollars 6bn a year for the
next four years - but it is clear that he has been engaged in the financial
equivalent of Mr Black's pre-tendering. When China bestows its final
blessing on the airport railway, expect to see equally quick activity in the
capital markets.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Japan's rural rice lobby clings to power despite
deregulation: The old guard is reviving traditional tactics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese government officials often refer to the sacred importance of rice
and the farmers' role as custodians of rural culture as the main reason
against opening the country's rice market. As the only food deemed to have a
soul, and with sacred links to Shintoism and Buddhism, rice was more than
just a commodity.
The reality is, however, that the spiritual importance of rice and the
farming culture is fading for most urban Japanese. Sentimental images of the
furusato - the old home village - are no longer symbols to which they
adhere. The relationship between politicians and the provinces, meanwhile,
has traditionally been more of a material kind.
Such links will be reconfirmed this week when the country's parliament
ratifies the government's Uruguay Round farm package. Parliamentary
discussions on the Y6,010bn (Pounds 38bn) package to help Japanese rice
farmers face foreign competition when Japan opens its doors to imported rice
next year, started last week.
The return to power of the Liberal Democratic party with the Social
Democrats is behind the package conceived last month. Reformists who were in
office at the end of last year forced through an agreement to import 4 to 8
per cent of domestic rice consumption over the next six years.
However, the old guard, relying on rural votes, has gone back to traditional
politicking, appealing to the electorate by delivering large subsidies and
public works allotments.
Politicians from rural areas, who threatened to block the parliamentary vote
on the Uruguay Round accord unless it stipulated financial aid, are
triumphant.
Meanwhile the rice lobby is trying to deflect criticism over its
arm-twisting for subsidies, claiming the deal has yet to be determined. The
Central Union of Agricultural Co-operatives (Zenchu) says the actual net
increase in next year's annual budget is still under negotiation between the
agricultural and finance ministries. 'The media's criticism is not fair
since we don't even know how big the increase really is,' says one Zenchu
official.
But many agricultural economists are less concerned about the amount of
money than how it will be used. Rather than encouraging consolidation of
inefficient small part-time farmers and helping expansion by full-time
farmers, most of the package is linked to public works spending and will
only help to sustain the current inefficiencies.
Of the total, Y3,550bn is allotted to infrastructure including roads and
draining paddy fields, Y770bn is to be spent on cheap state loans and Y890bn
will be used for building facilities in rural areas.
Such funds will only support part-time farmers which comprise 80 per cent of
the farming population and have become a leading barrier to increasing farm
efficiency. They are the main supporters of the co-ops at the centre of the
rice lobby and look after every aspect of rural life while acting as huge
vote-collecting machines during elections.
However, it is already clear that neither farming subsidies nor the co-ops
will revitalise Japan's agriculture. The number of Japanese farmworkers last
year totalled 3.6m, or 2.9 per cent of the country's population, 42.3 per
cent less than 20 years ago. The average age of farmers is 56, much higher
than other industries where 45 is the average.
There are, however signs of change. In January, political reform will usher
in a new electoral system giving urban voters more political clout as a
result of redrawing constituency boundaries although the number of
politicians supported by the farming lobby are not expected to be cut
drastically.
It is also unclear how much effect the loosely worded food law, which
governs the distribution and retailing of rice, will have on deregulation
when implemented next April. The agriculture ministry is said to be under
pressure from the co-ops from shifting too much power to rice growers and
new distributors and retailers.
Professor Yujiro Hayami, who specialises in Japanese farming at Gakushuin
University, says the return of the old political guard will delay farm
restructuring. 'Reform could eventually happen, but by then the industry
could be non-existent,' he warns.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Faint green light for privatisation: Investors' hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND AND MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For two years Mr Serhii Oksanich was a capitalist in waiting. He and a group
of friends established Kinto, a Kiev investment and securities fund, in the
spring of 1992, but for the first two years there were no securities for
them to trade. 'Our main activity for the past two years has been waiting
for privatisation,' Mr Oksanich said.
The failure of Ukraine's first post-independence government to launch
serious economic reforms, including a mass privatisation programme, meant
months of frustration and false starts for Kinto and the other 400
registered security traders in Ukraine.
Over the past few months, however, things have finally began to change. Over
the summer, 150 large and medium-scale enterprises were privatised using the
certificates granted, with a system of daunting complexity, to each
Ukrainian. In a series of closed tender bids to be closed by the end of this
month, 300 more factories have gone on the block this autumn.
But Ukraine's nascent privatisation is one of eastern Europe's best kept
secrets. In Russia and the Czech Republic, committed governments launched
carefully structured, highly publicised mass privatisation programmes. In
Ukraine the sell-off of factories is happening not with a bang but with a
whimper. It has been not a product of policy at the highest levels but the
quiet result of grassroots enthusiasm.
'They've finally let the genie out of the bottle,' Mr Oksanich said. 'The
process is rotten and they've only let a little bit of privatisation happen,
but now that it's started there's no way to stop it. The only question is
the details and the speed of the process.'
The government of former President Leonid Kravchuk, which authored the
current programme, was at best a luke-warm supporter of privatisation. As a
result, the existing plan is awkward and the bureaucracy has held the
process back.
Western aid officials in Kiev describe the existing programme as 'a
disaster'. 'You cannot speak about meaningful mass participation in the
privatisation process,' says Ms Roberta Feldman, of the International
Financial Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank. 'The
programme is complicated and the government did not take a leading role.'
Western officials are optimistic that under the new leadership of President
Leonid Kuchma things will change. They hope that in the new year Ukraine
will begin a public, well-publicised privatisation programme similar to that
of its neighbours.
Businessmen like Mr Oksanich are equally hopeful that, at last, they now
have a government willing to support the development of a market economy
rather than block it. But, like many Ukrainians, who are estimated to obtain
two-thirds of their income outside the official economy, Ukrainian
investment funds are not waiting for the green light from Kiev.
Instead, they have displayed remarkable ingenuity in navigating a multitude
of official road blocks. 'De jure you cannot buy and sell certificates and
foreigners cannot participate in the process,' Mr Oksanich says. 'But de
facto it's easy to get around.' He estimates that about 6m privatisation
certificates have already been invested in Ukraine either in worker buy-outs
or by the investment funds.
A fledgling secondary market in shares in some of these privatised companies
already exists, he says, and he expects about 30 companies to be freely
traded by the end of the year on what he calls 'our baby Nasdaq system'
pioneered a few weeks ago.
Ukraine's subterranean privatisation has already caught the attention of a
few western investment banks active in eastern Europe and Russia. Several
bankers said they were considering setting up operations in Ukraine in the
next few months.
But if privatisation in Ukraine, potentially the largest market in eastern
Europe, has been so devious as to escape the attention of most official
western observers, they are not alone.
Mr Oksanich concedes that for most ordinary Ukrainians 'privatisation
certificates remain largely a myth'.
He says he has avoided paying speeding tickets for the past year by
explaining to policemen how to use their privatisation bank accounts. 'They
tell me they didn't know about this, thank me for the explanation and let me
drive off,' Mr Oksanich says.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Volkswagen to produce new Beetle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen, the German carmaker, has decided to press ahead with the
development of a modern-day Beetle with the aim of starting production
towards the end of the decade, writes Kevin Done, Motor Industry
Correspondent.
VW first showed a 'back to the future' concept study for a new generation
Beetle, 'Concept 1' (pictured above), at the Detroit motor show last January
to gauge market reaction, particularly in the US. The existing Beetle, the
world's best-selling car with output totalling more than 21m, is still
assembled in Brazil and Mexico.
The Concept 1 was designed by Volkswagen's Californian design studio. The
body shape of the new car will be derived from the familiar rounded design
of the old Beetle, but mechanically it would be a modern car. It would have
a front-mounted engine instead of the classic rear-mounted, air-cooled
engine of the old Beetle, and would have modern safety features such as
airbags and anti-lock brakes.
The Beetle, the original 'people's car' which Volkswagen was founded to
build, was designed by the German engineer Mr Ferdinand Porsche in 1934,
shortly after Adolf Hitler came to power. Volkswagen said yesterday that the
most likely production location for the new Beetle was the VW plant at
Puebla, Mexico.

FT  28 NOV 94 / UK, France block Ukraine reform aid

<TEXT>
The UK and France are blocking a joint US-German effort to mount an
international financial aid package to encourage economic reform in Ukraine.
The stand-off is creating further tensions in the transatlantic alliance in
conjunction with US criticism of the European Union's efforts to stabilise
eastern Europe and former Yugoslavia. Last week, President Leonid Kuchma was
given red-carpet treatment in Washington following Ukraine's accession to
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
The Clinton administration is particularly upset by British resistance to
supporting a Dollars 600m (Pounds 365.8m) balance of payments loan to
Ukraine. 'We believe that President Kuchma needs a strong vote of confidence
from the west, and we are very disappointed with the EU's lack of response,'
said a US official.
Ukraine is expected to be discussed informally at today's meeting of EU
foreign ministers in Brussels, but the decisive meeting will take place
among European finance ministers a week later, just before the European
Council summit in Essen on December 9 and 10.
At stake is whether the EU will provide Ecu85m (Pounds 66.9m) out of the
planned Dollars 600m to help to bridge a total Dollars 1bn gap in Ukraine's
balance of payments in the fourth quarter of 1994, according to the
International Monetary Fund. The money is needed to finance energy imports
to keep houses heated, to provide energy for industry, and reduce dependence
on nuclear energy.
The US has already agreed to 'front-load' the package with Dollars 70m in
grants which would rise to Dollars 100m if the EU comes on board. Canada is
putting up Dollars 20m and the Dutch are offering Dollars 5m. Without the EU
contribution, Japan and Russia will hold back, risking a reignition of
inflation and social upheaval, according to an internal IMF assessment.
Britain - backed by France, Italy and Belgium - argues that the EU cannot
take part in balance of payments lending without the security of an
IMF-stand-by loan which contains strict conditions tied to a reform
programme.
The US and Germany argue that conditions already exist following the
disbursement of a Dollars 371m 'systemic transformation facility' - a new
financial instrument created to help former communist countries take the
first steps to economic reform.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, is taking a
particularly hard line. 'The EU is not an international financial
institution,' one UK official explained. 'That's the job of the World Bank
and the IMF.'
France is equally unsure about putting forward an EU loan before an IMF
programme is in place. It has argued that Ukraine's main energy suppliers
and creditors - Russia and Turkmenistan - provide the bulk of the cash.
Italy is pressing for early repayment of outstanding debts.
But the US, Germany and the IMF are pushing for an activist policy to help
Ukraine whose strategic importance lies in its position next to Russia, its
nuclear status, and its faltering nuclear energy industry.
Officials point out that, in fact, the EU is only being asked to provide
Ecu20m net because Ukraine is supposed to repay Ecu65m before the end of the
year. Ukraine's total foreign debt is around Dollars 7bn.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Inquiry looms for Berlusconi
</HEADLINE>

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the embattled Italian prime minister, faces a second
turbulent week with an interrogation by Milan magistrates over allegations
of corruption against the backdrop of a threatened general strike on Friday.
He originally had been expected to be questioned by Milan's anti-corruption
magistrates over the weekend; but his lawyer was said to be unwell and the
appointment was put back until this week.
The delay has permitted the prime minister time to ensure greater secrecy
surrounds the encounter, which is likely to take place at a secret location
in Milan.
Mr Berlusconi was angry at the way news of him being under investigation for
corruption while running his Fininvest business empire leaked out last
Tuesday. He is now anxious to protect the full secrecy of the interrogation
and head off the Milan judiciary's tactic of allowing interrogation extracts
to be leaked immediately to the media.
Political analysts have warned that, should any compromising information
emerge, it would be hard for Mr Berlusconi to sustain his policy of refusing
to resign.
Mr Berlusconi insisted all last week he had done no wrong while running
Fininvest, Italy's second largest private business group. He has accused
magistrates of political vendetta.
However, the magistrates' move follows recent admissions by Paolo, his
younger brother, and by Mr Salvatore Sciascia, the head of Fininvest's tax
department, that L330bn (Pounds 132m) was paid between 1989-92 in bribes to
officials of the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police, to ensure
favourable inspections of company books. The Milan magistrates have hinted
they have further evidence up their sleeve. They, too, have admitted in
interviews their credibility is at stake.
It would be surprising if incriminating evidence against Mr Berlusconi was
found but did not leak quickly. But, if the magistrates exercise their
usually astute political judgment, such information would be unlikely to be
made public until after the issue of Friday's general strike is resolved.
This would create too explosive a situation.

<TEXT>
Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing said yesterday that, under current
circumstances, he would not run in next spring's French presidential
election, Reuter reports from Paris.
'To be a candidate, you have to be in a position to be one. And I am not in
that position today,' Mr Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the centre-right UDF
and president from 1974 to 1981, told TF1 television.
Opinion polls show that many right-wing voters who would ideologically be
attracted to him appear to be switching support to Prime Minister Edouard
Balladur, a member of the RPR and a probable contender. Many UDF leaders
have also said they would back Mr Balladur.
Mr Giscard d'Estaing said: 'Something would have to change before February,
either in the opinions of the French people or in developing events, for me
to change my mind.'

Becoming a German citizen is easier said than done. Not only does Germany
have no immigration laws, but its nationality laws, which date back to 1913,
are based on blood.
Nationality is automatically granted - provided one of the parents is
German. Otherwise, if you have no German relations, and no German spouse,
you must wait at least 10 years before applying for citizenship. Even then,
there is no guarantee it will be granted.
'At first, when I started to address the crowd, they could not believe I
could speak German. Then they were surprised that I did not have a Turkish
accent. And they were even astonished that I was going to stand for
parliament,' says Mr Cem Ozdemir.
Born in 1965 in the town of Bad Urach in the state of Baden-Wurttemberg, Mr
Ozdemir last month was elected to the Bundestag, the first time anyone from
an immigrant family had attained such a status. His election coincided with
a spate of recent attacks on foreigners, particularly in Berlin, and a
renewed debate among Germany's political parties about whether to liberalise
the country's strict nationality laws in an effort to integrate foreigners.
'It was a long road to the Bundestag,' says Mr Ozdemir, a member of the
Greens/Bundnis 90 party. 'But I hope I can have some influence in trying to
make it easier for the German government to integrate the millions of
foreigners who are living in this country.'
More than 6.8m foreigners live in Germany. For economic reasons, many were
invited as Gastarbeiter (guest workers) in the 1960s. But those who chose to
remain soon discovered that despite paying taxes, and meeting all their
social commitments, they were not entitled to vote unless they became German
citizens. The matter is further complicated by the fact that in the case of
the 1.9m Turks living in Germany, the immigrants are reluctant to give up
their Turkish citizenship.
The reason is that they become foreigners in the country of their birth, or
their parents', and lose the right to inherit property. And since Germany
does not allow dual citizenship, many Turks are reluctant to take up German
citizenship.
Mr Ozdemir soon discovered - when he applied for German citizenship when he
was 18 years old - that Turkey was reluctant to relinquish ties. 'Ankara
wants the sons of those Turks living in Germany for military conscription,'
said Mr Ozdemir. Mr Ozdemir claimed that the vast majority of Turks born in
Germany paid a DM10,000 (Pounds 4,000) fine rather than serve in the army.
Mrs Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, head of the federal office for foreigners'
issues, wants children of foreigners born in Germany to be granted dual
citizenship until the age of 18, at which time they can choose their
nationality.
'We have to create the instruments for integrating these children,' she
said. 'The present situation plays into the hands of the far-right
extremists.'
Mrs Schmalz-Jacobsen added that the recent proposals by Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's coalition government for amending the citizenship regulations verged
on the absurd. For instance, if they became law, a child could have German
nationality until the age of 18 provided one of the parents had been born
and had lived in the country for 10 years and the other parent had lived in
Germany for a decade. 'These proposals will be impossible to administer,'
said Mrs Schmalz-Jacobsen.
'Can you imagine the bureaucracy involved and the interpretation of the law?
People will ask had they in fact lived in Germany for 10 years if they had
spent the summer with their grandmother in Turkey. It's a nightmare.'
Mr Ozdemir agrees. 'But the laws will have to change sooner or later which
will make it easier to integrate,' he said. 'The 1913 law is an anachronism.
It will take time. But what I fear is that the politicians are reluctant to
even ask when is the right time to change'.

President Dzhokhar Dudayev, the president of Chechnya, survived a determined
attempt to overthrow him over the weekend as another burst of fierce
fighting erupted in the Caucasian republic.
United opposition forces launched an assault on Friday evening on Grozny,
the republic's capital, and at one stage even claimed to have seized the
presidential palace. But Mr Dudayev's forces appeared successfully to have
repulsed the attack and claimed they had knocked out 20 opposition tanks.
There were no clear reports of the number of casualties.
Mr Dudayev, a former Soviet air force general, has resisted several attempts
by Moscow-backed rebels to depose him since the Moslem republic of 1m people
declared its independence from Russia three years ago. Yesterday, he accused
Moscow of direct involvement in the latest coup attempt and warned that
hostilities threatened to spread the war beyond the north Caucasus and
'throughout Russia'. Chechen security officials yesterday claimed to have
captured 50 Russian fighters and paraded two of them before the press.
But Russian officials vehemently denied direct participation in Chechnya.
General Vladimir Potapov, chief of staff of the North-Caucasian military
district, said reports suggesting Russian regular servicemen had been been
taken prisoner in Grozny were 'malicious slander'. However, he did not rule
out the possibility that former Russian servicemen could have been hired as
mercenaries.

FT  28 NOV 94 / EU to tackle blueprint for enlargement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German presidency of the European Union will today seek agreement on a
blueprint for bringing the former communist countries of central and eastern
Europe into the EU around the turn of the century.
The document, running to more than 100 pages, will be discussed at a meeting
of EU foreign ministers in Brussels. It lays out plans for the six aspirants
from eastern Europe to bring their markets, trade regimes and laws, as well
as foreign and judicial policies into line with the EU.
But the paper stops short of giving a date for EU membership, and skirts the
crucial question of how the Union intends to reform the Common Agricultural
Policy - one of the most daunting barriers to eastern enlargement.
Germany, which hands over the rotating presidency of the EU to France on
January 1, views the document as the centrepiece of next month's European
Union summit in Essen and the strategy to build a 'wider Europe'. But the
summit outlook has been clouded by the apparent German decision not to
invite the six central and east European leaders to Essen, and stalling
among the Twelve over a more generous market access package.
France, Spain and Portugal were said last week to be dragging feet over
plans to reduce use of anti-dumping and safeguard clauses as the six
associate EU members - Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia,
Bulgaria, and Romania - adopt EU laws.
Second, the European Commission has failed to live up to promises to produce
a study on whether accumulation of EU rules of origin would stimulate trade
with the central Europeans, according to a senior EU diplomat. Many experts
believe that relaxing the EU's rules of origin would significantly expand
trade.
EU diplomats are confident, however, that Bulgaria and Romania will win the
same accelerated market access package agreed with the Poles, Czechs,
Hungarians and Slovaks. This would mean free access for industrial products
from January 1 1995, with steel and textiles following in 1996 and 1997
respectively.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia are also set to win an increase of 250,000
tonnes in their quotas for steel exports, following the collapse of the
Commission's rescue plan for the steel industry. Some modified concession on
farm exports will also be on the Essen agenda.
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's failure to invite central and eastern
European leaders to Essen is viewed in some quarters as an unnecessary snub;
but German officials stressed that it was more important to reach a
consensus on how to proceed with enlargement, 'binding in' France and the
Mediterranean countries sensitive to the EU's balance of power tilting to
the north and east.
Separately, ministers are expected to approve a mandate for Brussels to
negotiate EU association agreements with the three Baltic republics of
Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Russia, US square off over security: Differing views about
expanding the role of the CSCE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, discussed the Bosnian
crisis with Serb leaders in Belgrade yesterday, his country was preparing a
much broader initiative aimed at putting Moscow's stamp on the new security
order in Europe.
Russia wants a sharp upgrading of the prestige, budget and powers of the
53-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which groups
the US, Canada, virtually all the countries of Europe and the former Soviet
republics. It will press this idea hard at next week's CSCE summit in
Budapest. The US - whose views on European security will be set out in a
speech today by Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state - also wants the
status of the CSCE raised. But that is where the resemblance between US and
Russian thinking ends.
For Russia, an upgraded CSCE could give Moscow a degree of influence over
security in western Europe, while confirming Moscow's role as the main
player in the security of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
For the US and some European countries - including the ex-communist nations
such as Hungary - boosting the CSCE would work as a sop to Moscow, helping
to calm its objections to the expansion eastwards of Nato.
Yet the latest pronouncements from Russia suggest that Moscow is not ready
for such a trade-off: it wants both to upgrade the CSCE, and to head off the
expansion of Nato.
Russia's prickly mood was underlined when President Boris Yeltsin went to
the border town of Pskov, his most important public engagement this month.
Faced with claims for the return of 2,000 sq km of land which belonged to
pre-war Estonia, he vowed not to give up a centimetre of Russian soil. Mr
Yeltsin's pledge won fulsome praise from the ultra-nationalist Liberal
Democratic party led by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
Estonia, like virtually all the ex-communist states of central Europe, wants
to be integrated into the European Union and ideally Nato. But Moscow is
anything but reconciled to the idea of Nato expanding.
Opinion among Russians, inside and outside officialdom, is firm: 'It's at
least 99.99 per cent against Nato enlargement,' says Mr Sergei Karaganov, a
presidential foreign affairs adviser. 'Everyone believes it would push
Russia into a corner and increase tension, not bring security.'
As for the upgrading of the CSCE, Russia's continuing commitment to this was
underlined last week by Mr Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the foreign affairs
committee of the Duma, parliament's lower house.
He spoke of the need for the CSCE to 'obtain a mandate for the decision of
all questions of security in Europe' and reaffirmed Russia's support for a
CSCE Security Council along the lines of the UN.
Russian hopes of playing a central role in a new European security structure
 -with or without the CSCE - have been boosted by signs of disagreement
between western Europe and the US over Bosnia.
According to the daily Sevodnya, Mr Kozyrev was encouraged by his recent
trip to France and has begun to talk privately of an 'historic
Franco-Russian alliance' as a pillar of a new order in Europe. He has also
suggested that both Nato and the CSCE may be superseded. 'Can't we give an
innovative reply to the entirely new European situation which is emerging
today in the mid-1990s?' the paper quoted him as asking.
Western diplomats in Moscow acknowledge that Russia's opposition to Nato
enlargement is, for now, both firm and heartfelt. But they hope that this
could change if the issue is handled with care, and if Moscow is drawn
further into the Partnership for Peace, a programme for military
co-operation.
On the face of things, US enthusiasm for early moves towards the expansion
of Nato should set alarm bells ringing in Moscow. In today's speech Mr
Christopher is expected to state firmly that Nato must 'begin the process'
of expansion in the coming months.
Mr Richard Holbrooke, the assistant secretary of state for Europe, recently
confirmed the US policy of boosting the CSCE on one hand while keeping Nato
strong, and preparing to expand it, on the other.
Diplomats see only one way in which Washington's stated enthusiasm for
enlargement and Russia's opposition could be finessed. Moscow has said it
would not object to the enlargement of Nato as long as Russia itself is
viewed as a candidate - however hypothetical - for membership.
While Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister, has said Russia can never
join Nato, US officials avoid being so categorical. They speak of
'procedures' and 'criteria' by which members could be admitted to Nato,
without naming countries. Cynics will no doubt say that that these
word-games are a way to 'keep the Russians happy, and the East Europeans
hoping': that is what they said when PFP was launched a year ago.

<TEXT>
Campaigners for Norwegian membership of the European Union in today's
referendum have hammered home the view that to vote against joining would be
to cast Norway into a political and economic limbo on the remote fringes of
the continent.
Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the veteran prime minister, said on Saturday at a
final rally held in an attempt to overturn the country's deep-seated
reluctance to embrace the EU: 'If you follow the advice of the No troops, it
can be costly for your country, for you and for your children. If you feel
the fear (of the EU), if you listen to the pessimism. . . you will place
your country in a difficult situation - isolated and alone.'
The No side has responded with a forceful rebuttal. It says Norway, with its
oil and gas, its fish and its plentiful hydro-power, has the fundamental
economic strength to prosper independently - especially as it already has
the trade benefits of participating in the European Economic Area agreement
with the EU. As a founder member of Nato, the country's security is
underpinned.
But Mrs Brundtland and her government say these arguments amount to
dangerous complacency about Norway's place in a changing world.
One of their greatest concerns lies in security. Norway occupies a strategic
position, sharing a frontier with Russia in the far north (Nato's only
direct frontier with Russia apart from that in Turkey) and guarding the
north Atlantic and Barents Sea approaches to the northern Russian ports and
hinterland where much of the post-Soviet nuclear arsenal is sited.
Already, Nato has lowered its profile in Norway, shifting its northern flank
headquarters from Oslo to England. US forces have begun to run down some of
their pre-positioned stores of military equipment held in Norway. The
government, still deeply concerned by instability in Russia, is afraid that
Nato's commitment to northern Norway will be weakened if Norway votes to
stay out of the EU.
This is because of the shift within Nato towards building a European pillar
based on the Western European Union, set to become the focus of the EU's
strategic and defence policies. Oslo, which at present only has observer
status in the WEU, is anxious to play a full part. The case about strategic
isolation has been strengthened since Sweden and Finland, Norway's Nordic
neighbours, voted to join the EU. The inevitable thrust of their policy is
now to participate in west European strategic developments.
The argument about economic isolation is, perhaps, less persuasive because
of Norway's rich natural resources and the widespread fear of an erosion of
Oslo's ability to control them independently once inside the EU. But the
government - and the vast majority of business and industry - warns that
with Austria, Finland and Sweden joining the EU, the future of the EEA trade
accord is uncertain, given that it would apply after a Norwegian No only to
Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein.
More convincingly, Mrs Brundtland says that electing to stay outside the EU
would risk provoking a negative investment flow at a time when petroleum
revenues are about to peak and Norway badly needs to build up its weak
onshore industrial base. This worry is not just about the inflow of foreign
investment to Norway; it also concerns the flow of investments by Norwegian
companies.
The Yes campaign says Norwegian companies have over the past 10 years made
investments overseas which produced 60,000 workplaces - while 5,000
industrial jobs were lost at home. It says this trend will be reinforced and
may even be accelerated by a shift by companies across the border into
Sweden. The heads of Norsk Hydro, Kvaerner, the engineering group, and the
pharmaceutical company Hafslund Nycomed, the country's three largest listed
companies, and the state-owned Statoil have all said their investment
strategies would be influenced against Norway by a No vote.
Another potent isolation argument concerns the long border with Sweden,
which at present is virtually open. Transformation of the Swedish border
into an external EU border could result in far stricter controls.

FT  28 NOV 94 / High redundancy offer likely for Halifax and Leeds staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Generous voluntary redundancy terms are likely to be offered to the
27,000-plus staff of Halifax and Leeds Permanent, two of the UK's largest
building societies, as part of the plans for combining the organisations.
Mr Mike Blackburn, Halifax chief executive, will today meet the society's
head-office managers to spell out the agreement to merge and become a public
limited company, the UK's third-largest high street bank with Pounds 90bn in
assets.
Later this week he will meet managers at the Leeds, and meetings with unions
are also planned.
Members of the two societies should receive letters setting out the broad
outline of the agreement within the next two weeks, and a helpline for
customers will operate from today.
The overlap of the two societies' branch networks has already brought
warnings from staff organisations that hundreds of jobs are at risk. While
the societies' managements have not ruled out compulsory redundancies, they
would prefer job losses to be voluntary.
If not, they could face opposition not only from employees but also from
customers who do not want to see a threat to staff in the 1,100 branches or
a cut in the service provided.
The deal must have the approval of 10m investors and borrowers who own the
two societies.
Savings from combining the two networks will be an important part of making
the deal a success.
The societies' boards must avoid announcing such a tough approach to job
losses that the merger falters while ensuring they rationalise the branches
fast enough to prevent a rise in costs.
On average, about 5 per cent of the 22,000 Halifax staff are likely to leave
and be replaced during a year through normal staff turnover, but this
proportion would not be spread evenly either among branches or between the
society's operations.
'There will be short-term reductions in employment,' Mr Blackburn said. 'But
we hope they can be achieved by normal turnover, early retirement and
voluntary redundancies.'
He said the societies wanted to give members as much information as they
could, but it was not known whether they could be told how free shares would
be allocated at flotation before they voted on the merger at special general
meetings in March.
If the societies' merger is approved, it will probably take place in early
summer. The second vote, on whether to float the combined society, is
unlikely until 1996.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Major is poised to win Commons vote on EU cash: Rightwing
Tories launch late drive to force challenge to leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major, the prime minister, appeared certain last night of victory in
today's parliamentary vote on the European Union budget as rightwing
opponents on the Tory back benches launched a last-minute drive to force a
challenge to his leadership.
In spite of threats by a hard core of Eurosceptics to risk suspension from
the parliamentary party by abstaining in tonight's vote on the EU finance
bill, senior ministers said the government would secure a comfortable
majority.
Mr Major has warned that defeat would be followed by the government's
resignation and a general election. Mr Major has a Commons majority of 14,
but is assured of the votes of up to 10 unionist MPs from Ulster.
The vote, however, will coincide with signs that the prime minister will
seek to ease the tensions over Europe by conceding a referendum on any
further significant moves towards integration.
Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, publicly disassociated himself from
the attempts by rightwing MPs to force a contest for the Tory leadership
before the deadline for any such move on Wednesday. He said on BBC
television he had 'no intention' of participating in a contest. Leading
rightwing figures behind the attempt to raise the 34 signatures from Tory
MPs necessary to allow a challenge admitted that they were still about 10
short of that number. But they said they were now seeking backing for the
move from dissidents on the left of the party.
Leftwing MPs known to be unhappy with Mr Major's leadership were being told
that a challenge might pave the way for his replacement with Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade secretary, or Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. Mr
Major's opponents voiced confidence that if they secured the signatures and
could demonstrate cross-party support for a contest, then Mr Lamont would
change his mind.
The former chancellor appeared to leave himself some room for manoeuvre when
he said that he could not 'envisage the circumstances' in which he would
stand against Mr Major.
Earlier Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, had warned Mr Lamont that he
would 'cut an absolutely ridiculous figure' if he attempted to topple the
prime minister. Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Treasury secretary, said any contest
would be 'deeply destructive and debilitating'.
Mr Lamont's comments came as senior ministers indicated that Mr Major might
promise a referendum on further transfers of power to Brussels.
The prime minister was said to be acutely aware of the rising tide of
opinion on the back benches in favour of a referendum before Britain
considered joining a single European currency. Mr Aitken, a cabinet sceptic,
reinforced that impression by describing economic and monetary union as 'an
epic constitutional decision'.
The issue is not expected to arise before the next general election, but
rightwing ministers have joined Tory MPs in pressing for the referendum
pledge to form a central plank of the party's election manifesto.
Senior ministers hope that today's Commons vote on legislation to allow
higher British contributions to the EU budget will allow the party to halt
the latest bout of infighting.
A hard core of back bench Eurosceptics was last night still threatening to
abstain in the vote on the Commons legislation. The Fresh Start group of
rebel MPs will meet today to agree voting tactics. The hard-line sceptics
said Mr Major could not carry out the threat to suspend them if, say, 15
rebels abstained.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Dole blames UK and France for Nato Bosnia rift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM, LAURA SILBER and BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, BELGRADE, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A leading US politician blamed Britain and France yesterday for a 'complete
breakdown' of the Atlantic alliance and called on the United Nations to
withdraw from Bosnia, where up to 400 peacekeepers were being detained by
the Bosnian Serbs.
Senator Robert Dole, who will lead the Republican majority when the new
Congress meets in January, also called for the lifting of the embargo on
arms supplies to the Bosnian government.
'Get the (UN) soldiers out of the way. Pull 'em out,' Mr Dole said in an
outburst of frustration at European nations which cite the safety of their
troops in Bosnia as an argument against tougher military intervention.
'I think we have a complete breakdown of Nato,' he added, saying that he
held the 'British and French, and primarily the British' responsible.
The senator's remarks reflected indignation over last week's refusal by
European members of Nato to back a US plan to strengthen Bihac, a stronghold
of the Bosnian government, using Nato air power.
In Sarajevo, the UN said Bosnian authorities had accepted its latest
proposal for a ceasefire in Bihac, where the Serbs have almost encircled
government positions and encroached on a 'safe area' notionally protected by
UN resolutions.
UN officials said fighting continued over the weekend on the southern and
south-western outskirts of Bihac. They also reported a large explosion at
the Bosnian army's Bihac headquarters, apparently triggered by the
government forces before they withdrew.
The vulnerability of the UN's 24,000-member force in Bosnia was underlined
yesterday when it emerged that up to 400 peacekeepers were being detained in
Serb-controlled territory.
UN officials said last night they were trying to ascertain the whereabouts
of more than 100 Dutch and 62 British soldiers who appeared to have been
stopped at Serb checkpoints. About 250 peacekeepers were detained last week
after Nato launched air strikes on Serb positions in Croatia and Bosnia.
Mr Jovan Zametica, a senior Bosnian Serb official, described the incidents
as an 'unfortunate misunderstanding' and hinted that the peacekeeping troops
might be handed back their freedom of movement.
Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, yesterday conceded that the
Serbs had, in effect, won the war in Bosnia. In remarks that reflected
European concerns and differed sharply from Senator Dole, he said lifting
the arms embargo could stoke the war, and expressed doubt over a military
solution in Bosnia.
Amid growing signs of disarray over Bosnian policy in the main western
capitals, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, said he had
'successful and very useful' talks in Belgrade with Serbian president
Slobodan Milosevic. He said Mr Milosevic was working for a ceasefire in
Bihac and throughout Bosnia.
Mr Perry said he was not prepared to recommend the deployment of the
hundreds of thousands of US troops necessary to reverse the tide of the war.
He said he sent 2,000 US Marines to the Adriatic on Friday 'for contingency
purposes'. Heargued that Nato had done whatever it had been asked to do, and
blamed the UN for the absence of more vigorous action.

FT  28 NOV 94 / Budget expected to deliver sharp cuts in spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was making the final adjustments
yesterday to tomorrow's Budget that is expected to cut government spending
plans sharply and make tax and benefit changes to help the long-term
unemployed back to work.
Although the government is suffering from lack of a 'feel-good factor' among
the electorate, Mr Clarke is expected to stick by his judgment, made in
September, that tax cuts would be 'hopelessly premature'.
An indication that the chancellor will seek to strengthen his budding
reputation for prudence in financial markets came yesterday from Mr Jonathan
Aitken, the Treasury secretary.
In an interview with BBC radio's The World this Weekend, Mr Aitken intimated
that Mr Clarke would resist pressure to withdraw next April's planned
increase in value added tax on domestic fuel and power to 17.5 per cent from
8 per cent.
Although some ministers fear a backbench revolt against the tax plans if the
Labour party succeeds in forcing a parliamentary vote on the issue, Mr
Aitken pointed out that the Commons had already voted four times for VAT on
fuel and power. If the chancellor were to make an announcement, he would be
'doing something very radical indeed', Mr Aitken said.
Instead, Mr Clarke will build on Britain's better-than-expected economic
performance since his first Budget last November to cut public spending. He
may bring forward the date when the government finances may move from
deficit to broad balance.
The City expects the chancellor will cut the 1995-96 'control total' of
departmental expenditures by Pounds 5bn or Pounds 6bn from Pounds 263bn. He
may announce bigger cuts of up to Pounds 8bn or Pounds 9bn in overall
government spending planned at Pounds 313bn.
Although consensus predictions suggest that the government will lower its
forecast of the public-sector borrowing requirement to Pounds 25bn in
1995-96 from Pounds 28bn, there is speculation that Mr Clarke will announced
a sharper drop.
A PSBR closer to Pounds 20bn next year might enable the Treasury to project
a budget in 'broad balance' by 1997-98, keeping alive hopes of income tax
cuts nearer to the general election that must be fought by the spring of
1997.
The Treasury has put heavy pressure on government departments to cut
spending this year.
Mr Clarke has also long supported changes to the tax and benefits system to
help the jobless obtain work. That has encouraged speculation that the
Budget will include improved family credit and housing benefit rules and
possibly a 'holiday' from National Insurance contributions for employers
offering work to the long-term jobless.

FT  26 NOV 94 / As They Say in Europe: Mafia sets example on crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reading the British press one would hardly have known that the UN Conference
on crime was taking place in Naples for most of last week. Only the speech
by Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, which came just as it was
announced that he was being investigated for corruption, aroused a vicarious
flicker of interest.
In Brussels the conference was front page news. La Libre Belgique shouted:
'Organised crime finds who it is talking to.' That was followed by a story
about the Belgian justice minister, Melchior Wachelet, who made what the
paper saw as a hard-hitting speech on the 'complementarity of global and
regional approaches' to crime busting.
The story alongside gave the game away: 'Drugs and Holland pinpointed in
CTIF report.' The CTIF is a Belgian government unit for cracking down on
money laundering. The report said BFr21bn had been identified as part of
such operations. But only three per cent of that sum had been traced and
frozen.
The other big Brussels daily, Le Soir, was equally excited: 'Belgium arms
itself against organised crime.' Again it gave pride of place to the concept
of a regional strategy.
It would, unfortunately, be misleading to say that all Belgium is girding
its loins in the everlasting struggle against delinquency and the Dutch. In
Flanders, priorities were different. Het Gazet van Antwerpen led on 'The
warmest November of all time'.
As always with this paper, its stories are hard to check, like another front
page item, lifted from London's The Times. This concerned an impending
invasion of plastic ducks threatening England because a container ship had
shed its cargo in the North Pacific two years ago.
Het Gazet lives in some curious make-believe world, half-way between Tolkien
and Breughel, but without the crime. That may account for the curious
news-from-nowhere quality of whatever emerges from Flanders.
Back at the UN conference in Naples, Pierre Mehaignerie, the French justice
minister, added his voice to the call for 'the greatest international
co-operation' in fighting crime.
He also focused on what he called 'fiscal paradises', arguing that offshore
banking centres should be tackled with as much vigour as the international
community had applied to the supporters of international terrorism.
The French do not like unregulated business activity and the threat should
be taken seriously. After all, in 1985, New Zealand got the rough end of the
French stick when government assassins arrived from Paris to blow up the
Rainbow Warrior. Then it was Iraq that was clobbered and now, apparently, it
will be Guernsey. In highlighting crime blackspots of the world, the Italian
paper La Stampa also singled out the Channel Islands, rather than Naples.
Everybody finds someone else to blame for crime. The Belgians have to
protect themselves against the Dutch. The Russians pointed out that their
supposed crime wave was merely the creation of a 'cold war style' propaganda
campaign designed to hold up their country's development.
The choice of Naples as the site of a conference on crime was intriguing.
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung dealt with the puzzle - at considerable
length, inevitably. It stressed the 'high expectations of the population'.
The Neapolitans had greatly enjoyed the G7 Summit there in July, for during
that period there had been no litter on the streets until eight in the
evening. It has become a kind of golden age in the Neapolitan popular
imagination.
There are many reasons to believe that a city like Naples was the right
choice for any such conference. So long as the camorra is squared
beforehand, it can guarantee security far more reliably than the police.
After all, a car can be parked in perfect safety with the key in the
ignition by a guest at a mafia wedding.
And anybody who attended the G7 Summit in Naples knows how the highest moral
standards were assured. A large number of young women of outstanding
physical attributes were in attendance. But even the rougher end of the
journalistic corps kept its distance once officials announced that these
were the daughters of the leading local godfathers.
But unfortunately the crime wave was spreading to the most unlikely places
even as the crime fighters met. As someone who has lived at different times
in Vienna, I had thought that traffic rules there were inviolable: one was
physically restrained from crossing an empty street by other pedestrians
when the lights were green.
But research, according to Der Standard, has now shown that drivers jump one
red light in 10. That means two million cars cross on yellow every day.
Almost like a Mediterranean city, said the paper.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Blair draws up radical change to Clause IV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's ruling National Executive Committee will meet on Wednesday to
consider detailed proposals produced by Mr Tony Blair for radical redrafting
of Clause IV of the party's commitment to widespread nationalisation.
In a 17-page consultation paper being posted to NEC members over the
weekend, the Labour leader calls for a new statement of values committing
the party firmly to a competitive market economy.
The consultation paper, which is subject to amendment by the NEC, will be
sent to party members and affiliated unions next week in the first stage of
a three-month consultation programme.
A final version, intended to set out an updated statement of the party's
aims and values for the 1990s, will be presented to the NEC in February or
March and will probably then have to be approved by a special conference of
party delegates.
The consultation document makes a strong case for radical changes in Clause
IV, which commits the party to common ownership of the means of production,
distribution and exchange.
It points out forcefully that Labour is the only socialist party in Europe
not to have changed its constitution in the last 80 years, during which time
social and political conditions have been transformed.
Most of Mr Blair's proposals focus on placing Labour's traditional values in
a more modern setting, in line with his pledge to modernise the party, which
he made in his first big speech as leader at the party's conference in
October.
In a passage that will ease leftwing suspicion of Mr Blair's motives, the
consultation document says that public services must treat all citizens
equally on the basis of their 'common humanity' rather than their purchasing
power.
A long section on economic policy promises to deal with 'concentrations of
wealth and power' by adapting socialist values to modern conditions.
However, the paper says it does not follow that common ownership is the only
means of ensuring an equitable delivery of services and distribution of
wealth.
The consultation paper closes with a long list of priority values for the
party, including social justice, democracy and equality. Officials said the
paper was intended to provide a focus for discussion in the NEC and the
wider party. 'It is not a draft. There is a lot of work to do yet,' a senior
official said.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Sainsbury in rethink after 'error' over Tesco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD PULLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The J. Sainsbury supermarket chain is to review its policy on the sale of
magazines containing advertising coupons for competitors after it was
disclosed that store managers were mistakenly asked to remove a Tesco
supplement from the Radio Times.
The 20-page supplement contained cut-out coupons offering savings on a range
of Christmas items.
Sainsbury said that its head office had electronically messaged its 353
stores yesterday with an instruction to take out the supplement, but a
second message had been sent an hour later cancelling the order.
It added: 'The instruction to remove the advertising insert from the Radio
Times was an error of judgment. It was speedily rectified.'
Sainsbury did not know how many stores had acted on the instruction or how
many copies of the magazine were affected.
Tesco said it was 'very surprised' at hearing about its rival's action, but
it would not take the matter any further.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Nato jets in action as Serbs give Bihac ultimatum

Bosnian Serb forces closing in on the town of Bihac last night gave its
defenders a 24-hour-ultimatum to surrender as Nato aircraft were ordered
into action but apparently failed to make any strikes.
Within hours of the Nato action, it was disclosed in Washington that 2,000
US marines had been ordered to the Adriatic as a possible support for United
Nations forces.
The ultimatum to the mainly Moslem government forces holed up in Bihac came
from General Manojlo Milovanovic, the Bosnian Serbs' chief of staff, who
said the defenders must put down their arms by this evening. 'If they do no
not surrender, I cannot guarantee that their lives will be spared, because
they have committed crimes against the Serbs,' he said in a grim-voiced
message.
The United Nations said it called on Nato aircraft to over-fly the area
because of a danger to civilians and UN personnel. But the bombers, which
were fired on by SAM-6 missiles, did not make any strikes because they
failed to locate any targets, a UN official said.
The Bosnian Serbs claimed two Nato bombs had landed and said Bosnian
government positions would suffer 'the least peaceful of nights' as a
result. Serb-controlled media said the Serb forces and their allies in a
renegade Moslem force led by Mr Fikret Abdic were advancing on the town
centre. A radio station controlled by Mr Abdic said 400 of his men had
entered the town.
UN officials said the Serbs were about a mile from Bosnian army headquarters
but could not confirm that there had been any change of position yesterday.
In Washington, Pentagon officials described the despatch of the marines as
'strictly precautionary', adding that the amphibious group would be
available if needed to support UN forces in Bosnia. The marines, on an
amphibious flotilla headed by the USS Nassau, were ordered to cut short
their visit to the French port of Toulon and sail to the Adriatic.
Although the Nato allies have begun discussions of a possible US role in
providing cover if Unprofor should have to withdraw from Bosnia, officials
in Washington said no detailed contingency plan for withdrawal had been
agreed.
President Bill Clinton has insisted that there would be no question of
sending US ground troops to Bosnia except within the framework of a peace
deal agreed by all sides.
The Serb threats followed the announcement by the UN of a ceasefire in the
Bihac area, and a day of arguments between the UN and the Bosnian government
as to how badly it was being violated and by whom.

Serb fighters and their allies in a renegade Moslem force said they had
advanced further into the town of Bihac last night, despite intensive
mediation efforts by the United Nations and apparent fresh air action by
Nato.
First accounts conflicted on whether Nato aircraft had struck at targets or
had merely buzzed Serb positions in the area. Officials of the western
alliance in Brussels declined immediately to confirm that any operation had
taken place.
The advance by Bosnian Serb ground forces into the poorly defended town
centre, which is supposedly protected by UN resolutions, was reported by the
Belgrade news agency Tanjug. General Manojlo Milanovic, the Bosnian Serb
chief of staff, demanded that the government army in Bihac surrender by this
evening, warning: 'If you don't listen to me, I can't guarantee your lives.'
Fighters loyal to Mr Fikret Abdic, a maverick local Moslem leader who
opposes the Sarajevo leadership, have been advancing on government positions
in tandem with the Serbs. A radio station controlled by Mr Abdic said 400 of
his men had entered Bihac town.
Before the latest move forward was reported, the Serbs were said to be in
control of about one-fifth of the notionally protected zone consisting of
Bihac town and its environs.
The latest Serb advance followed the announcement by the UN of a ceasefire
in the Bihac area, and a day of bitter arguments between the UN and the
Bosnian government as to how badly and by whom it was being violated.
The Bosnian government, adamant that the UN was failing in its obligation to
protect the town, said it was coming under heavy shellfire despite the
truce.
UN officials claimed that the ceasefire had initially held out fairly well,
and they accused the Bosnian army of firing out of the town with the
intention ofprovoking retaliation by the Serbs. This tactic had eventually
worked, they said.
The UN was also trying yesterday to negotiate a ceasefire throughout Bosnia,
a proposal which was approved in principle by both the Serbs and the
Moslem-led government.
However the two sides' ceasefire terms seemed to be mutually exclusive. The
Serbs wanted an indefinite ceasefire, while the government side - wary of
freezing the existing battle lines - called for a three-month truce only.
Mr Jovan Zametica, an adviser to the Bosnian Serb leadership, set tough
conditions for the 'demilitarisation' of Bihac, saying: 'We Serbs have the
legitimate right to defeat and disarm the . . . government forces.'

FT  26 NOV 94 / Private View: The mathematician in his cave - Christian
Tyler meets a man whose beliefs about human understanding are causing
scientific controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among mathematicians, Sir Roger Penrose is a caveman. I do not mean he is
some snaggle-toothed evolutionary throwback - even if certain high priests
of brain science would call him that.
He is a caveman because he agrees with Plato, who first used the analogy
that human beings are like prisoners in a cave who can see only the shadows
of reality thrown on to the wall by the firelight.
For Penrose, mathematical truths are part of reality: not human inventions,
but pre-existing 'forms' whose existence we have to discover.
He has reworked Plato's parable for the prologue of his second book, Shadows
of the Mind, which restates and develops the controversial claim of The
Emperor's New Mind that human understanding will never be explained in terms
of computer-like calculations.
Human consciousness cannot even be simulated by a machine. Furthermore, the
scientific explanation for consciousness will depend on discovering new laws
of physics.
The cave of the Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at Oxford University is
satisfyingly chaotic. Papers, books and correspondence crammed the room at
the Mathematical Institute, a faded new block on St Giles. Adding to the
jumble were old geometric models made of plaster, metal and wire which had
been retrieved from some forgotten basement. A box of empty coffee jars and
a broken percolator lay on the floor, next to a jigsaw puzzle of special
difficulty based on one of Penrose's own geometric brainteasers. Symbols and
equations ran riot on the blackboard behind his desk.
Mathematics must be wired into the Penrose family. An older brother, Oliver,
has just retired as professor of mathematics at Heriot-Watt University,
Edinburgh. A younger brother, Jonathan, is a chess grandmaster. A nephew
teaches maths at Durham and a son is doing his post-doctorate in the
subject.
Penrose, whose special ability is spatial thinking, began constructing
polyhedra (many-sided shapes) at the age of 10, when he regarded maths as a
kind of game. 'An ability to do maths is not essentially different from
ordinary thinking,' he said. 'One does it for fun, really. So you have to
enjoy it to do it seriously.'
Mathematics was discussed round the family dinner table. Penrose's father, a
specialist in the inheritance of mental defects, would speculate on whether
the brain was some sort of computer. However, he expected his son to become
a doctor. 'I was actually, secretly, going to be a brain surgeon,' Penrose
said.
Another influence was a series of radio broadcasts by Professor Fred Hoyle
(leading proponent of the 'steady state' theory of the universe). Lunching
with his elder brother at Cambridge one day, Penrose impressed Denis Sciama,
a cosmologist, by questioning Hoyle's description of galaxies disappearing
over the horizon of the universe.
'I drew a picture to show it didn't make sense. I think Denis was quite
struck by this and later when I went to Cambridge as a graduate student he
took me under his wing.'
As a student at London and Cambridge, Penrose took up, as sidelines, quantum
theory, particle physics, general relativity and cosmology.
He also studied mathematical logic, where he encountered Kurt Godel's
revolutionary proof that in any logical system, such as that on which
arithmetic is based, there are truths which cannot be derived from the
axioms of the system. An interpretation of Godel's 'incompleteness' theorem
underpins the controversial claims of Shadows.
Penrose wrote these two 'popular' science books partly to convey his own
sense of excitement, he says. To call them popular is misleading, however.
Most of his supporting evidence is indecipherable to non-mathematicians.
Even if the hypothesis is clear, the books are tougher to read than the
best-selling Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, Penrose's opposite
number at Cambridge and former collaborator on Black Holes.
The books were to have been a retirement project. Then Penrose saw a re-run
of a TV programme in which Marvin Minsky and another American pioneer of the
'hard' school of artificial intelligence made 'some very extreme remarks'.
He added: 'From their very particular point of view what they said was
logical. But I just don't believe it. As an undergraduate I had tried to
build up logical systems which would reduce thinking to computation. Even
then, in the middle of doing it, I had a suspicion that something was wrong
and this wouldn't work.'
Most people, I said, had never heard of Godel but would say it was obvious
that consciousness wasn't just computation. Why did you need to demonstrate
it?
'It's very curious. You find people on both sides who regard the other point
of view as ridiculous. People say 'Why bother to write the book?' But what's
not so obvious is that I am saying something stronger: that is, that you
can't even simulate this activity.
'There is a view that a machine can act as though it sees red, feels pain,
etc. My line is different. I'm saying it can't even act as though it has
these qualities. There is something in our understanding which you couldn't
even imitate . . . and, stronger still, you couldn't do it with presently
known physics.
'The argument from obviousness is a good argument, but it doesn't get you
anywhere. It doesn't tell you what to do.' Briefly, what Penrose tells us to
do is look at the 'microtubules' in the neurons, or brain cells, for signs
of quantum brain activity which could, with the missing physics, translate
into non-computable consciousness.
Are you envious of the computer's power?
'People often ask me that one,' Penrose replied. 'There is certainly an
element of pride, I suppose, and not wanting to be outdone by a mere machine
and that sort of thing. If computers get very good at chess I don't like the
idea. But I'm pretty sure it's more than that. I don't think it's correct,
that's all.'
Do mathematicians like you feel left out of the argument?
'Certainly I feel there's an awful lot of very hard work, clever work, very
important work which is almost totally ignored and dismissed, simply because
it's not something that people understand and may not have any immediate
value. Mathematicians tend to be modest. They work away in their corners and
don't go and shout about things.'
So you think computer science is hijacking maths?
'I think to some extent it has hijacked it. There's some interesting stuff,
of course, and I don't want to denigrate it. But I don't think it should
take over in the public's mind.'
The pure mathematician is, of course, a species of philosopher. Whether
Penrose's mathematical brilliance carries over to his philosophical
reasoning is what his critics question.
But in subscribing to a Platonic world of ideas, he is certainly not alone,
even among mathematicians. The concepts, he says, are 'out there' in the
sense of being independent of our perception of them. Does he mean that they
exist like Plato's forms?
'Yes, very much so. But I get into a lot of trouble on that one. People will
often go along with other things I say. But even the most sympathetic I find
sometimes baulk at taking mathematical forms as really existing.
'The trouble is, if you don't take them as existing in some sense then the
other mysteries become even more mysterious. The physical world behaves to
such an extraordinary degree in accordance with highly sophisticated
mathematics. It makes that mystery even more puzzling if the mathematics
somehow isn't there, if it's our creation.
'Einstein's theory of general relativity is a wonderful example why that
can't be the case. Newton's theory of gravity had been around for years and
Einstein didn't need to produce a new theory for which there was anyway not
much evidence at the time.
'But now it's become the most accurate theory known to science. And it was
there all the time] It's not that somehow we've imposed our thinking on the
way that space is constructed. It's out there.'
Then why don't you just say that souls exist, too, and do our thinking?
'Well, I suppose one can say things like that. Certainly if one uses 'soul'
to describe a person's consciousness I have no objection to that. It's just
a word I tend not to like to use because it has unfortunate connotations. I
suppose I don't find it very helpful.'
Are you really a Pythagorean mystic?
'Sometimes people call me that. Labels are things which people put on me.
Pythagorean mystic? I hate to use the word mystic. But I certainly have been
called Pythagorean rather than Platonic as someone who believes in
mathematics underlying everything.'
I asked Penrose whether the controversy excited by his books was drawing him
away from his chief activity, which is mathematical physics  - specifically,
something called twistor theory which he has worked on for 30 years.
'I have other things I really want to get back to,' he said, 'although the
question of the missing physics is something I want to think about more
seriously. In a certain sense I regard all these other things as
distractions from my work. But they're interesting distractions.'

FT  26 NOV 94 / Take a Coke, a glass of Moet, shake well
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a pleasing symmetry about the news that both Coca-Cola and Moet et
Chandon were launching advertising campaigns this month; two world-famous
brands, both under threat from arriviste competitors, giving their
respective bottles a good shake to spray the opposition away in time for
Christmas.
Both drinks stand for fizz, froth and fun, but they manage to appeal to
opposite instincts in us. Coca-Cola, hitting back at the supermarkets with a
Pounds 4m television campaign, taps that youthful, clean-living, democratic
impulse which we should all, in principle, like to share: its message is
shamelessly romantic, all-embracing, hopeful and artfully naive. It is a NOW
product, a multi-national beverage for the modern world.
Moet et Chandon, on the other hand, in devising its first-ever British
advertising campaign, has no hesitation in harking back to the louche air of
fin-de-siecle Paris to promote its appeal, its curvy, Mucha-esque siren
giving us the kind of sultry come-on which the clueless boys and girls in
Coke-land would probably interpret as a touch of flu. Here is wickedness,
expense and exclusivity, and democracy be hanged.
It is, of course, the story of the new world versus the old; brash,
in-your-face Americana meeting creaking, decadent Europa across the
billboards, the latest in an endless series of cultural bouts.
The relationship between America and Europe, and France in particular, is
actually more complex than is commonly supposed. One only has to watch the
opening frames of Jean-Luc Godard's A Bout de Souffle to appreciate the
happy symbiosis that can be achieved between the two cultures: street-styled
existentialism and B-movie beefcake combining effortlessly to provide some
of the most influential images of the 1960s (American pop culture
intriguingly paid back by almost naming the captain of the new USS
Enterprise after the iconoclastic director).
The mutual exchange of jokes went on: America sent Jerry Lewis to France,
where he became a cult hero; the French took revenge by sending a succession
of the most ponderous philosophers of all time to lecture to the
brightest-eyed students in the world. Years later, Allan Bloom would write
The Closing of the American Mind to attack the consequences of continental
thinkers on his country's sensibility, while in Paris, something called
Euro-Disney appeared to add spice to all those interminable cafe
conversations. Semickeyotics or what?
The most magnificent example of Franco-American horseplay is Stanley Donen's
romantic comedy Funny Face, in which an avuncular Fred Astaire wins the
heart of Audrey Hepburn by dancing rings around a group of earnest
philosophers in hooped shirts and berets. Here was American brashness - and
intellectual insecurity - in abundance, but displayed with such good humour
and brio that it was difficult to take seriously. Who could declare cultural
war on Astaire, for goodness sake?
What is remarkable, however, is that, even in the trans-global,
multi-faceted 1990s, the cultural battle between new and old world
continues. Its most obvious manifestation in London in recent weeks has been
in the box office skirmish between Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and
Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colours: Red, a conflict which began at this
year's Cannes Film Festival and at which the American was controversially
rewarded with the Palme d'Or.
Here is a classic choice, between the hard-edged, primary-coloured,
self-referential savagery of Tarantino and Kieslowski's quizzical,
open-ended musings on relationships and destiny, the two directors
possessing in common an immense talent but as divided in their world views
as those bottles of fizzy drink. In London, as at Cannes, it is Tarantino
who is winning, which I have to say depresses me a little. It is nothing to
do with being anti-American, nor feeling censorious about violence; it is
just that I have grave suspicions about a culture which so happily ironises
its most conspicuous flaws. In standing up for little old Europe, I'd like
to teach the world to sing a rather different tune.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Arts: Sea-shore beasts and graffiti - The recent work of
artists David Hepher, John Bellany and Ian Tyson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While it might be argued that we have seen, and heard, more than enough of
one of the painters currently filling the vasty halls of Flowers East, we
have certainly seen far too little of the other two. What is no less certain
is that all three of them, on this evidence, are working through into their
later maturity at the top of their form.
Of the two figurative painters, David Hepher is the more sombre in his
visual material, the more self-effacing and unshowy in his actual working of
paint and surface, and the more obviously thoughtful in his engagement with
subject and ideas. His work is none the less interesting or beautiful for
that.
His subject is the tower block of the council estate, dread image of the
social engineering of the 1960s, high-minded, insensitive and misconceived.
He has been painting these things over many years, taking them as they are
and moving in close to their densely regular fronts of balconies and
window-frames, uninflected but by the vagaries of human use and habitation,
marked by plants and curtains and the washing hung out to dry.
This interest continues here in some small studies, freely and freshly
stated. But for the most part, and in all the larger canvases on show, he
has moved into something that is both visually and conceptually more
complicated.
He now lays upon the canvas a ground the colour and texture of concrete,
complete with the marks and ridges of the defining shuttering by which the
tower-blocks themselves were built. Upon this prepared surface he paints the
image of the tower, but not so as to fill the canvas entirely. This image,
conventionally pictorial in its own terms, is but a formal element against
which others are brought into play - child-like structures, images of cities
taken from the painting of the early renaissance, and, overlaying
everything, the familiar, meaningless calligraphy of sprayed graffiti.
Here, then, are paintings that start as the same blank walls, luring the
painter to them as they lure the graffitist. But oh, how elegant the
painter's own graffiti are, and how ironically light and sensitive his
touch. Would that all graffiti were so beautiful. This is painting of a high
order, full of subtlety and ambiguity.
John Bellany is the other figurative painter and, by contrast, nothing less
than his old ebullient expressionist self. The wonder of it is, given his
publicly-acknowledged medical history, that he can still paint at all, let
alone on such a scale and with such energy and passion. But he was ever an
obsessive in the actual act of painting, as furiously prolific even in the
depths of his most desperate alcoholism.
In his case, both illness and recovery affected the work clearly and
directly and, in a sense, perversely. For through the late 1970s and into
the 80s, as his condition grew ever more dire, so his painting took on a
quality of tragic grandeur, with the paint growing ever richer and more
physical in the working, the imagery seeming to sink into the surface as
into a quicksand, abstracted and ambiguous, not waving but drowning. It was
profound and powerful stuff.
If with recovery the mood lightened and the imagery cleared, so also for a
while did the surface become thin and the statement overstretched and
enfeebled - for Bellany never gave up in his determination to go on working
on the grandest scale. Now the work has again come to itself. Gone is the
self-regarding and sentimental imagery of the period of the immediate
convalescence, and we are back with the full complement of crabs and fish,
birds and beasts, the bearded fisher-artists in their boats and
bare-breasted priest-women in their stocking-tops that people Bellany's own
symbolic sea-shore world.
There they all are, these monumental figures, with their hints at Beckmann,
Picasso and Modigliani. And there too, as it were to set off their
all-pervading air of classical calm, are passages of the old expressionist
fury in the working of the surface, judicious and controlled yet full of
painting, proper painting.
The smallest of the galleries is occupied by Ian Tyson, that most fastidious
of minimalists, who is showing paintings and relief constructions based upon
a simple rectangular, frame-like motif. That I have no space to say more
about them is not to say I do not recommend them. Indeed, they come as the
perfect sorbet after the richer dishes downstairs.
David Hepher: new paintings. John Bellany: recent paintings. Ian Tyson:
recent painting and sculpture. All at Flowers East, 199 &amp; 282 Richmond Road,
Hackney, London E8, until December 4.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Arts: Bell-ringing and madness - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the tendency for the slightest change on BBC Radio to prompt howls of
outrage, the quiet revolution that has transformed Going Places (Radio 4,
Friday) into a pendant of Breakaway has passed comparatively bloodlessly.
Perhaps others felt as I did that the old format, with its emphasis on
adenoidal hearties of both sexes devoted to four wheels, reeked of
rusticised suburbia and saloon-bar squire-speak. They never seemed
interested in places, merely the mechanics of getting there.
The programme is now an idiosyncratic travel piece, not a holiday mag like
Breakaway but a smaller-scale exploration of the off-beat - Scotland's
secret nuclear bunker, for instance, recently opened as a tourist attraction
near Anstruther in Fife. Though it was equipped with a broadcasting studio,
the locals had no idea it was there. Chillingly, if disaster struck no
family, relatives or friends surplus to personnel were to be admitted. As
somebody remarked, many of the elite would have preferred to stay outside.
The same programme took composer Gavin Bryars to Whitby with its ruined
abbey, kipper-houses and Dracula connection. And memories of a west-country
childhood stirred within me at the news that a recalcitrant RSPCA official
had hijacked the bell-ringing swan of Wells, releasing it where there are no
bell-pulls to tug at teatime and where it presumably has to find its own
food. The swan-keeper was strangely dry-eyed. 'My wife was more affected
than I was,' he confessed, adding that she was 'a cantankerous old thing but
wonderful.' (I assume he meant the swan.)
The Madness of Kings (Radio 4) was disappointingly lightweight. It was
introduced by Christopher Cooke whose exquisite sensibilities, he once
confided to The Heritage Quiz, are jarred by such oafishness as the Last
Night of the Proms and Gilbert and Sullivan (notably, I imagine, at the Lord
High Executioner's strictures against 'the idiot who praises with
enthusiastic tone/All centuries but this and every country but his own').
The mini-series on the addling of crowned heads was inconclusive. Caligula
perhaps had encephalitis, Hitler Parkinson's. Nero was not so bad, possibly
schizophrenic. The Plantagenets had terrible tempers. Ludwig of Bavaria
probably didn't do anything with his young men, though his scheme to rob the
Rothschild bank in Frankfurt seems a trifle extreme even by today's free and
easy royal standards. The programme acknowledged the danger of describing
any boo-worthy behaviour by the all-purpose 'mad'; and then proceeded to do
so. Its brief necessarily ignored the hysterical repression that led to
middle and lower-class 'madness', breakdowns and suicide in Victorian times.
There are records of the mass demise in Bristol of an entire below-stairs
staff on the death of their mistress. Those were the days.
The nostalgia factor still operates in favour of middle-aged DJs. On Radio
John Peel drones on after a quarter-century, his vocal dreariness the aural
equivalent of fallen arches. The self-consciously quirky choice of music
recalls the modishness that had John Mortimer, no less, singing his praises.
But then the distinguished QC once referred to Boy George's 'sweet Irish
tenor'. He should be on the new matey Radio 3, along with John Peel,
Caligula and bell-ringing swans. They will be, reader, they will be.

for the eyes, television, it becomes increasingly clear, is a remarkably
good purveyor of history. We know from the work of Norma Percy, who has made
memorable programmes about the Reykjavik arms talks and the collapse of
Soviet communism, and from David Ash's programmes Fall Of The Wall on BBC2
earlier this month, that it is particularly effective with very recent
history.
We know from Steve Humphries' startling 1991 series A Secret World Of Sex
and from his current Thursday night series on BBC2, Forbidden Britain, both
dealing with the early decades of this century, that, even when there is
awfully little archive film available (as with any social subject around
1900) impressive programmes can still be made. Following the classic example
of The World At War, Humphries marries together what picture material he can
find with latterday interviews with those who can remember the period. The
results can be enthrallingly evocative.
But among the most fascinating periods for any of us, surely, is the one
that coincides with our birth, so those in their late 40s or early 50s may
be particularly drawn to What Has Become Of Us? which covers the middle of
the 20th century and begins on Channel 4 tomorrow evening. Presenter Peter
Hennessy and producer Rob Shepherd have made a four-part series
investigating the attitudes and politics and, most important of all, the
feelings which, in the 1940s and 1950s, led to the creation of a British
society which was then methodically dismantled in the 1980s and 90s.
This opening programme shows that however talented the presenter (and
Hennessy has proved himself an excellent television performer, especially in
studio discussions) nothing conveys the spirit of a time so vividly as a
combination of personal witness and contemporary archive. When Hennessy
encapsulates the swing to Labour in 1945 by saying that the bombs had not
discriminated between the classes so why should politics, it seems trite.
But when those who lived through the war talk about the sense of levelling
which arose from such matters as the shared experience of rationing it seems
all too credible.
The sense of how it felt to be living through that war comes across most
strongly from some of Hennessy's older neighbours in Walthamstow. Charmingly
 -and sensibly, given that he was born in 1947 - Hennessy goes back to them
repeatedly to check on their memories. Like my father who, one night in
1941, ran to the top of Parliament Hill to gaze, mesmerised, at what
appeared to be the entire London docks on fire, Marie Creighton describes
going up to a high point to watch the blitz: 'There was ships in there and
our grub was in 'em'.
The idealism fired by the national experience of the war strikes you like a
flash of lightning when Jill Craigie shows the opening caption on a film
about new towns such as Stevenage made in the late 1940s saying 'This film
is made for the peoples of the blitz in the hope that their newly built
cities will be worthy of their fortitude'. It is an indication of the degree
of cynicism today that such a high moral tone now seems almost comical.
Yet such sentiments seemed unremarkable in 1948 because, as Lord Hailsham
points out in next week's programme, 'We had ended the war at the top of the
world'. The dismantling of the empire had scarcely begun and it seemed only
right that the top nation should set about creating a brave new world with a
national health service, nationalised industries, universal education, and
millions of new homes in new towns to replace those bombed or torn down as
slums. If, having evoked the atmosphere of the 1940s and 50s so powerfully,
this series really can sling a bridge across the intervening years to bring
us into the latter part of the century and show us how and why we have
become what we are, it will have done a remarkable job.

THE MORTMERE STORIES by Christopher Isherwood and Edward Upward Enitharmon
Pounds 7.99, 206 pages
AN UNMENTIONABLE MAN by Edward Upward Enitharmon Pounds 5.99, 102 pages
JOURNEY TO THE BORDER by Edward Upward Enitharmon Pounds 5.99, 135 pages
Edward Upward, alert and active at the age of 91, was in London recently. He
and his wife attended a reception at the British Library given to honour the
publication of these three books. The library has an Upward archive from
which a selection of manuscripts was on show. These included the Mortmere
stories begun by Upward and his friend Christopher Isherwood when they were
Cambridge undergraduates in the 1920s.
In his autobiographical Lions and Shadows, Isherwood described how they
invented the sleepy English village of Mortmere, peopled with eccentric
local characters whose activities were chronicled in a style that was a
cross between Conan Doyle and surrealist fantasy. Mortmere summed up the
charming, well-bred complacency and eccentricity of pre-war England. Up to
now the tales were considered too private to be published, but at last
curiosity has been satisfied and we have the texts of the surviving
manuscripts, edited by Katherine Bucknall. The bulk of them are by
Isherwood. The humour is often lavatorial, but the writing is brilliantly
readable in the hilarious manner of the young pre-Buddhist, pre-Californian
I-Am-a-Camera Christopher.
After Cambridge, Upward became a schoolmaster and a member of the British
Communist Party, from which he resigned in 1948. He was housemaster and head
of English at Alleyn's School, Dulwich, from 1931 to 1961. After retirement
he went to live on the Isle of Wight where he resumed his earlier career of
novelist.
His first book, Journey to the Border, was published by the Woolfs in 1938.
It now appears in a revised edition. A tutor goes with his pupil and
employer to a race meeting at a Mortmere-ish country town. While entering a
crowded marquee he has a vision of the future. More than half a century has
done nothing to diminish the work's sense of foreboding. Gentlemanly
tweed-suited English racegoers become a gathering of militant fascists. A
long speech by an apologist for obeying natural instinct parodies Auden's
early guru, Homer Lane. Much of it seems as relevant now as then.
Upward's major work, The Spiral Ascent, a trilogy written over two decades
and published in one-volume in 1977, describes the fortunes of a poet and
schoolmaster who is a committed Marxist. It is a view of intellectual life
from Upward's left-wing stance that is both calmly detached and highly
personal; so too is the sequence of stories now published for the first time
in An Unmentionable Man.
The man is an elderly English writer whose name is never mentioned because
he believes we are witnessing the death-throes of capitalist society. He has
been mugged, and while his wife awaits his return to consciousness he has
nightmares described with marvellous clarity in which his credo comes under
attack. As a writer of English prose Upward belongs to the school of Swift
and Orwell. Now that I have read again these remarkable books I feel that
Upward's work is going to be mentioned more and more frequently by
discerning judges of 20th century literature in the years to come.

misunderstood philosopher

<TEXT>
THE MYTH OF THE FRAMEWORK by Karl R. Popper Routledge Pounds 25, 229 pages
KNOWLEDGE AND THE MIND-BODY PROBLEM by Karl R. Popper Routledge Pounds 20,
158 pages
It was characteristic of Karl Popper that when he died two months ago he had
just finished another two books. With his death the last of this century's
great British philosophical triumvirate - Russell, Wittgenstein and Popper
himself - passed away. Comparison-drawers like to say that he was, by quite
a margin, less clever than Russell and less imaginative than Wittgenstein.
Yet of the three he is easily the most influential outside academic circles.
That influence extends in two important directions: science and politics.
Surprisingly, many scientists claim that Popper's views benefited their
work. An outstanding example is Sir John Eccles, the Nobel-winning
physiologist who later collaborated with Popper on a book about the
mind-brain link. Like other scientists, he points to Popper's account of
scientific method, the famous doctrine of 'falsificationism', as his
inspiration.
Popper was an intellectually robust and confident thinker. The reasons lie
partly in his origins. He was born into a wealthy and cultured Viennese
family. He was a distant relative of Freud and in early adult life friendly
with, although not a member of, the famous Vienna Circle of philosophers. He
left Austria because of Nazism and lived, first in New Zealand and then, for
the rest of his long life, in England, where he taught at the London School
of Economics. He died aged 92.
Success came late, in his forties; but once it had arrived he was feted
everywhere. Popper was indefatigable. In his last months he was busy
preparing these two books for the press. One of them continues his lifelong
dedication to defending science and rational criticism as 'a way of thinking
and living'. In it he gives a statement of his 'confession of faith  .. in
peace, in humanity, in tolerance, in modesty, in trying to learn from one's
own mistakes; and in the possibilities of critical discussion.' The second
book consists of lectures defending the highly unfashionable 'dualist' view
that mind and body are separate but interacting entities. Both books are
characteristically Popperian: argumentative, opinionated, conciliatory,
emphatic, outdated, up-to-date, interesting, and full both of holes and very
bright ideas. One might not agree with everything in Popper, but he always
makes stimulating reading.
The judgments about Popper of both scientists and right-wingers - many of
whom lay claim to him because of his attack on Marxism and his defence of
'the open society' - are mistaken. Popper did not succeed in formulating a
watertight account of scientific method, and he did not hold or promote
right-wing views. But it is easy to see why people thought he had done both:
he was tireless in explaining his ideas to a wide public, rightly refusing
to confine himself to the academic world.
But his wider audience has not heard the careful response of academia to his
views, and therefore knows only one side of the story.
Popper's theories about science are based on a strikingly simple insight.
Scientific investigation, he noted, was thought to go as follows: an
hypothesis is formulated, and predictions are made about what, if the
hypothesis is true, should happen when experiments are conducted.
The hypothesis is confirmed if the results are as predicted: the greater the
number of positive results, the more securely is it confirmed. But Popper
saw that a single negative result can overthrow an hypothesis. Any number of
positive results might accumulate in its support while it yet remains
vulnerable to a counter-instance. A hypothesis therefore cannot be proved,
he argued; the best we can ever say is that it is 'acceptable so far', but
that someone may sometime come up with a single piece of evidence that
disproves it.
Science accordingly progresses by 'conjecture and refutation'. Popper
believed his falsificationist theory achieved two things at the same time.
First, it provided a test of what counts as a genuinely scientific
hypothesis. Second, it solved the thorny old 'problem of induction'. An
example of inductive reasoning is: 'Every swan I have seen is white, so all
swans must be white.' The problem is: how can one be sure?
On the first question, Popper said that if an hypothesis cannot be proved
wrong, it is not only unscientific, but worthless: 'a theory which explains
everything explains nothing'. Astrology, psychoanalysis and religion all
fall into this category, because none of them states what evidence would
prove its claims to be false. If astrology, for example, can accommodate any
proffered counter-example it is untestable and therefore vacuous. Thus
Popper's falsification criterion distinguishes between genuine enquiry and
nonsense.
Marxism is a different matter. It claims to be scientific, and it makes
specific and therefore testable predictions. The problem with Marxism is
that it has failed those tests: history has shown it to be false. Yet
despite this, Popper points out, its adherents continue to believe it.
Popper argued that science does not, as philosophers used to believe,
consist in the process of supporting a general proposition by accumulating
instances. Such inferences are notoriously upsettable, and there are no
watertight means of justifying them. The old view of scientific procedure,
confirming hypotheses by positive tests, portrays science as inductive.
Popper's claim, by contrast, is that science is deductive. Inductive
inference would be all right if we could rely on the 'principle of the
uniformity of nature', which states that the world works in regular and
patterned ways. Such a principle would allow us to predict that the future
will resemble the past. But the principle can itself only be justified
inductively ('past futures resembled past pasts'). We cannot be sure that
this will always be the case.
Popper therefore wished to reject induction. Unfortunately, his view
covertly appeals to the principle of nature's uniformity also, for
counter-instances can be taken to refute hypotheses only if we can be sure
that the world will not change tomorrow in a way that makes the hypotheses
suddenly true, thus falsifying the counter-instances themselves.
It might seem obvious that a piece of evidence which disproves an hypothesis
may be used in exactly the same way to support the opposite hypothesis,
namely the original proposition was false; but in the latter case the
evidence is obviously being employed in the way Popper contests, that is,
inductively.
There are many other difficulties with Popper's views. He did not manage to
state convincing theses about truth and the nature of reality; he refused to
investigate how scientific hypotheses come to be formulated in the first
place; and he did not provide an account of scientific reasoning which makes
use of models and analogies, investigative tools much discussed by other
philosophers of science.
Popper's politics have fared better at the hands of his critics. It is clear
that those who claim him for the Right have not read his work. He used to
say that he would call himself a socialist if socialism would seriously
commit itself to individual liberty.
For Popper, the 'open society' is one in which rational discussion leads to
fair, decent, open and consensual political arrangements and in which quiet
assessment of the facts informs every decision. His Open Society and Its
Enemies not only attacked Marx, it also attacked Plato. The authoritarian
state of Plato's Republic, ruled by an oligarchy, relying on slavery,
practising eugenics, disenfranchising women and most classes, has had its
closest expression in recent Fascist dictatorships. Popper attacked excesses
on both the left and right.

EE CUMMINGS: COMPLETE POEMS edited by George J. Firmage Norton Pounds 35,
1102 pages
He is the famous poet who never used capital letters. In England, we know a
few sexy verses by 'e e cummings' ('May I feel, said he/ I'll squeal, said
she,') because they stand out as eccentric in anthologies of love poems. In
America, by contrast, Cummings is a literary giant. When he died in 1962, he
was the most widely-read poet after Robert Frost; today he is seen with
Eliot and Pound as the father of modernism.
Was Cummings a genius, the inventor of a new form of expression which spoke
for our disordered, fragmented times? Or was he merely a gimmick-maker who
tinkered with typography? This beautifully produced volume, published to
mark the centenary of his birth last month, collects together all his poems
for the first time, and offers a new insight into the man and his work.
Few poets are at once so modest - Cummings always hid behind that lower case
anonymous i - and so exuberant and charismatic in their egoism: 'Cheri' he
says in a 1918 love poem which was not discovered until the 1980s 'the, very
picturesque, last Day/(when all the clocks have lost their jobs and god/sits
up quickly to judge the Big Sinners)/ he will have something large and
fluffy to say/to me)'.
Throughout his life, Cummings pitted himself against god and the devil, US
presidents - he called Roosvelt that great pink super mediocrity - big
business and the upper class East Coast society into which he was born. His
father was a Harvard professor and a close friend of William James; Cummings
wrote about the Boston Brahmin Circle as 'the Cambridge ladies who live in
furnished souls.' But he adored his parents and an idyllically happy
upbringing gave him both his passionate belief in the individual and the
confidence to ignore traditional American expectation of patriotism and
conformity. A large body of poems about his childhood when 'The world is
puddled wonderful,' is one of the revelations here.
As a pacifist, Cummings went to France as an ambulance driver in 1917 and
was promptly jailed for ignoring censorship rules in his letters home. After
the war he stayed on in Paris, discovered Picasso and Stravinsky, and
returned to America a modernist, convinced that the 'day of the spoken lyric
is past.' He began to apply the Cubist methods of break-up and restructuring
to poetry.
The pleasure of this fat complete edition is that in making us quickly
familiar which such surface pyrotechnics, it gives us the chance to notice
the deeper, less showy side of the poet. Despite his protests, Cummings was
a bred-in-the-bone lyricist and, in displaying the full range of his love
poetry, this volume establishes him as the most erotic English poet since
John Donne.
During his Paris days, he became the friend - though not the client - of
some prostitutes. He enjoyed using the high sonnet form to describe bawdy
low life, 'the dirty colours of her kiss.' Then in the 1920s and 30s,
Cummings, according to his biographer Richard Kennedy, married in quick
succession 'three of the most beautiful women in America,' including actress
and model Marian Moorhouse.
Like Donne, Cummings makes sensuality work on the page by a mix of dazzling
explicitness and absolute rigour of form. He sees that sex is half in the
head, and he is metaphysical ('one not half too. It's two are halves of
one') and agonisingly restrained ('O Distinct/lady of my unkempt
adoration'). He is also, like Donne, witty and obscene. In the poem 'she
being Brand/New; and you/know consequently A/little stiff' he describes sex
as a run in a new car: 'Just as we turn the corner of Divinity/Avenue i
touch the accelerator and give/her the juice, good.'
Offbeat and experimental, Cummings had the outsider's uncanny feel for the
mood of the nation and an appealingly American idiom - upbeat and zany -
with which to convey it. The girl/car piece laughed at the American male's
obsession with the automobile as early as the 1920s. The lines 'what if a
much of a which of a wind,' with the warning 'what if a dawn of a doom of a
dream/bites this universe in two,' were written in 1944 the first poem of
the Cold War.
Almost every Cummings poem is enormous fun. With his jokes and word games he
reflects everyday fears, hopes and madnesses back at us through a
distracting cheerful mirror. His gimmicks are part of his genius: this
magnificent volume is a tribute to both.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Books: Strange worlds and wise outlaws - Fiction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIBOR FISCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nubia played Professor Longhair and Big Mama Thornton to Egypt's Elvis: who
else but Tom Robbins could see the mingling of ancient civilisations in such
terms? With his second novel, Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, Robbins perfected
his technique of audacious prose and cosmic themes, earning himself a place
as one of the wildest and most entertaining novelists in the world.
His new work, Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas (Bantam Pounds 6.99, 386 pages),
starts suspiciously like a yuppie novel: Gwendolyn, a 29-nine year-old
stockbroker, weeps into her martini on a Friday evening after a day of
crash, dreading the opening of the markets on Monday morning.
Her weekend turns out not to be occupied with thoughts of bulls and bears,
however, but with frogs, an escaped monkey with a taste for burglary, magic
mushrooms from outer space, a cure for cancer and the future of the human
race as well as romance with the staple Robbins figure, the wise-cracking
outlaw, bearer of both fun and enlightenment.
'Mist from the sea covers the hill where a small army lies surrounded by a
large.' The Ettrick clan is about to be massacred by the Northumbrians. This
is the splendid opening of Alasdair Gray's A History Maker (Canongate Pounds
13.99, 222 pages), set not in a border war of the past, but in the 23rd
century where warfare has become a spectator sport and a league table. There
are pre-slaughter interviews with the generals and running commentary as the
Ettrick clan is almost wiped out, all according to the Geneva Conventions.
The first chapter is the strongest; the rest lacks narrative thrust, (though
not pelvic thrusts), being a semi-satirical essay on how life should be
lived. As with all Gray's work, layout and illustrations are as important as
the writing. A worthy successor to Poor Things, and ample evidence that
Scotsmen can write without obsessive use of four letter expletives.
A fan of Alasdair Gray and, like him, someone who builds his work around
quirky conceits is Will Self. His new collection of short stories, Grey Area
(Bloomsbury Pounds 9.99, 287 pages), explores strange worlds which have
mutated out of our own.
'There are only eight people in London and fortunately I am one of them,' is
the start of the first story, concerned with the gruelling life of the
puppet-masters of the metropolis: 'only 210,542 invitations to meals of any
sort last year - and of those a good 40,000 were children's parties.' A
demon lover, a model village, and office paraphernalia are other
springboards for Self's bizarre flights of fancy, but the best piece has to
be about Inclusion, a drug that makes watching television fascinating.
Finally, the past. Didier Daeninckx's A Very Profitable War (Serpent's Tail
Pounds 7.99, 192 pages) features Rene Griffon, a demobbed sleuth in Paris
after the first world war who is hired by a distinguished Colonel to track
down someone trying to blackmail him. Daeninckx is one of France's leading
thriller writers, but A Very Profitable War is one for serie noire
aficionados. The most satisfying sections of the book are the historical
curiosities: the Colonel, for instance, has to put down a mutiny of Russian
soldiers in France.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Books: Victorian who designed himself - A new biography of
William Morris, artist and socialist extraordinaire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ASA BRIGGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLIAM MORRIS: A LIFE FOR OUR TIME by Fiona MacCarthy Faber &amp; Faber Pounds
25, 780 pages
No Victorian, eminent or otherwise, was more critical of his own age than
William Morris, who was born three years before Victoria came to the throne
and died five years before her. 'Apart from the desire to produce beautiful
things,' he wrote in a memorable passage in 1894, 'the leading passion of my
life has been and is hatred of modern civilization.'
Yet for all his discontent and for all his protest, he belongs unmistakably
to the 19th century - even when he compares it unfavourably with the 13th,
or strides into the future. He proves that the Victorians were their own
best critics - both when they examined Victorian achievements and when they
probed Victorian values. In his energy, which faltered only at the last, and
in his amazingly wide range of achievement Morris was characteristically
Victorian. The manifold things that he made belong to that century also.
The first biography of him, by JW Mackail, appeared before the century and
the reign was over. Since then there have been many other biographies and
many detailed and scholarly studies of Morris's contributions to the making
of embroidery, tapestry, stained glass, wallpaper textile dyeing, printing
and weaving, illumination, calligraphy and book production. And there has
been a devoted, sometimes uncritical, interest, frequently on the part of
two separate groups of admirers, in his political views and actions, and in
his conceptions of design.
Morris himself, unlike them, saw his life as one piece. It was to a fellow
socialist that he wrote in 1883, the year when he declared his new political
commitment, that almost all the designs used in his business 'I design
myself. I have had to learn the theory and to some extent the practice of
weaving, dyeing and textile printing: all of which I must admit has given me
and is still giving me a great deal of enjoyment'. In the same spirit he
approached the theory and practice of socialism. Those of his admirers who
failed to take his socialism seriously did not understand him.
Fiona MacCarthy does. Her biography is a work of synthesis, drawing on a
wide range of sources, and it concentrates on presenting Morris as a whole
man rather than on cataloguing a formidable list of his activities. Mackail
tried to do the same, but MacCarthy chooses to examine aspects of Morris's
personality that Mackail, writing near to his death, could or would not do.
At the same time, her book is an original interpretation in that it draws on
the author's own experience and interests, very different from those of
Mackail and another outstanding biographer, EP Thompson. Her chapter
headings reflect this. They are the names of places, not a sequence of
events: Walthamstow, Marlborough, Oxford and, of course, Red Lion Square and
Red House, Kelmscott Manor and Kelmscott House, and two countries, Iceland
and Norway, the former a country, both on the map and of the mind, which
influenced him profoundly.
Given Morris's own sense of place, Fiona MacCarthy's mode of arrangement is
entirely appropriate. And the different places she lists do not so much
figure in a chronological sequence as in an intricate pattern of desire and
of memory. When Morris came to write News from Nowhere in 1890 the different
strands in the pattern were woven together, and significantly there is as
much in it about the place as there is about time.
Happily Fiona MacCarthy does not offer us a label for Morris to set
alongside other biographers' Marxist Morris, Freudian Morris, Jungian
Morris, the entrepreneurial Morris or the Morris 'who has now been
appropriated by the Greens'. She does rely on her intuitions, however, as
well as research, and as a result deals particularly sensitively with
Morris's relationships with Janey and Rossetti, and their own relationships
with each other. A sense of place necessarily involves a sense of
relationships, and what Morris made of 'fellowship', which he believed was
at the very heart of socialism, was derived not from books or pamphlets but
from private relationships.
The priest from a neighbouring parish who officiated at Morris's funeral
service at Kelmscott had been with him both at Marlborough and at Exeter
College, Oxford. He did not refer to Morris's work for the socialist cause,
much of it humdrum and hard, but chose as his text a passage from
Corinthians, 'unknown, and yet well-known'.
In the 20th century Morris, remains 'eminent' (he would have hated the
adjective), both unknown and well-known, topical, not canonical. In his own
century he was a pilgrim of hope, putting his trust, a 19th-century trust,
in 'how he might live', in society not as it was but in what it might be.
He conceived of fear and hope as the great moving forces in history, and in
the style of Corinthians believed that the greater of these was hope. In his
poems 'Pilgrims of Hope', printed in instalments in 1885, he wrote of 'the
day that yet shall be'. This was the same series in which 'The Message of
the March Wind' was written. Morris felt that he was no longer 'the riddle
singer of an empty day'. He was an activist proclaiming a message that he
believed would change history just as much as it had changed himself.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Books: Passion with artifice - Ovid's challenge to modern
poets

AFTER OVID: NEW METAMORPHOSES edited by Michael Hofmann and James Lasdun
Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 14.99, 320 pages
Few books amount to a 'myth kitty' (Larkin's famous abhorrence) as
convincingly as Ovid's Metamorphoses. Stories like those of Venus and
Adonis, Pyramus and Thisbe, Baucis and Philemon, and Orpheus and Eurydice -
paired off like names on ancient windscreens - are close to the heart of
European culture. Painting, sculpture, opera, drama, poetry - what would
they have done without Ovid's telling of these tales?
Improved no end, Larkin might have said. Can you imagine him, or Amis,
getting stuck in to Ovid? It shows how poetry has changed. No one today, I
think, would claim that Ovidian meaning and mastery are as important to us
as they were to Shakespeare, or Ovid's great Elizabethan translator,
Golding. The affection, belief, technique, and sheer energy responsible for
a work like Golding's can be found singly but not all together. The
you-do-this-bit I'll-do-that procedure of After Ovid seems predictably of
our time, as does AD Melville's worthy but regressive blank verse effort in
translating the whole poem a few years ago. This is some of the whole poem
gone over by many hands, some of them short on latinity.
Ovid is an amazingly resourceful and tireless poet. In showing how these 42
poets rise to the challenge the book offers a fascinating sampler of
contemporary styles and local solutions. Ted Hughes, for example, who
contributes more to the book than anyone else, uses a choric free verse in
his version of Ovid's account of Creation. In 'Venus and Adonis' he employs
unrhymed stanzas, mainly of three and five lines. Readers of Hughes's book
on Shakespeare will know how important this story is to his interpretation
of the plays and poems. It is apt that the most Shakespearean of
contemporary poets should translate a story told by Shakespeare. It is also
pleasant to report that this is Hughes's best work for some time.
Surprisingly, Seamus Heaney chooses pentameter couplets in writing about
Orpheus. However, the lines run on through approximate rhymes so that the
effect is far closer to what readers expect of Heaney than John Dryden.
Still, it is not quite sparky enough for Ovid. Quicker tetrameter couplets
from Derek Mahon ('Pygmalion and Galatea') seem a touch more Ovidian, as do
Paul Muldoon's lines of different lengths, also rhyming in couplets. The New
York poet, Kenneth Koch, goes for broke: Look at this lovely river maid, who
bears the name of Io/ Her youthful beauty caused in Jove such ache that 'Me,
oh] my, oh?'/ He cried, 'She must be mine]' . . .
Peter Reading and some others are more classically astute, in Reading's case
with the sound of dactyls - an echo of Ovid himself. Some of the poets seize
a lyrical moment or passage rather than a longer haul of narrative. In 'Mrs
Midas', Carol Ann Duffy is as inventive as Ovid in whose Metamorphoses
Midas's queen does not appear. But Ovid, the poet of transformations, of one
form changing into another, sanctions just about any poetic liberty you care
to name. His great poem is a wonder-book of passion as well as a goldmine of
artifice. Engaging with the Metamorphoses has led some of the best poets now
writing to sprightly and delightful responses.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Books: Final drop for the scaffold - The history behind the
abolition of public execution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY BLACK

<TEXT>
THE HANGING TREE: EXECUTION AND THE ENGLISH PEOPLE 1770-1868 by VAC Gatrell
Oxford University Press Pounds 20, 654 pages
This is a powerful, committed and well-written book with a problematic
theme. Gatrell drives home the horrors of hanging and then seeks to explain
the process by which hanging from the 1830s was confined to murderers and
from 1868 was no longer carried out in public.
This is not seen as a triumph for humane sensibility or reform, both of
which are presented as having serious limits, but rather as a shift in the
balance of terror by which control was imposed. For Gatrell, 'the abolition
of public execution spoke for anxiety, not complacency'.
The poor, still voteless after the 1867 reform act, excited the concern,
even fear, of the elite, and hidden executions were seen as a more effective
form of control. The elite was also concerned both about the responses of
scaffold crowds, and about the extent to which public executions allowed
both criminal and crowd to deride or criticise the nature of justice.
Gatrell claims that the abolition of public punishment undercut those who
pressed for total abolition and greatly delayed their cause. For Gatrell
'the state's retributive power continued to override imaginative compassion,
and the horror continued behind prison walls for a century yet'.
There is no doubt of where Gatrell's sympathies lie: of the judges, 'one or
two like Dudley Ryder (Chief Justice of King's Bench) wept fashionably' as
they sent young women to the gallows and subsequent dissection. After
nudging a reluctant jury in 1754 to convict a possibly insane young woman of
infanticide and then, 'very well satisfied', condemning her to the noose and
the anatomist, Ryder made a speech which 'so affected' him, he told his
diary, 'that the tears were gushing out'.
Sir John Silvester, Recorder of London 1803-22, propositioned women who
sought mercy for their relatives. There is an excellent discussion of the
handling of appeals by the Home Secretary: Peel emerges as a determined
hanger, who eased and encouraged prosecutions. He believed that society
could survive in turbulent times only if secular authority was resolutely
defended.
The case is strongly argued. This is not the law as a consensual system for
eliciting support for the norms of authority, but a cruel, callous,
calculating and vicious denial of justice.
Many will find this a convincing analysis, but doubts can be expressed.
Without making any reference to the modern debate on capital punishment, it
can be argued that Gatrell displays all too little sympathy both for the
victims of murder and for the problems created by social change. There was
major change in the 19th century, necessarily as both cause and consequence
of a society with a mass electorate, universal education, and widespread
urbanisation and industrialisation. These brought social dislocation,
instability and fears.
Deference and traditional social patterns, never as fixed as some thought,
ebbed, and the new and newly expanded cities and towns created new living
environments in which the role and rule of the old world were far less
significant.
These problems clearly do not excite Gatrell's sympathetic attention; indeed
his essential outsider's approach, which provides much of the passion of the
book, is also one of his limitations. The views of the scaffold crowd are
analysed, but there is insufficient attention to legal and governmental
policies and strategies.
Cruelty again is a complex issue. A society that was willing to send its men
to kill and be killed across the face of the globe, that in 1878 applauded
the 'Great Macdermott' as his music-hall song launched jingoism, may have
had a different emphasis than Gatrell suggests.
He is understandably repelled by the practice and details of 19th-century
executions, but to this reviewer much of his fascinating book was more
redolent of the 1960s than of the Victorian era. The discussion of the
manner in which many sought to disguise the reality of what was going on is
compelling as is the brutality of many of the case studies, but it is far
from clear that most of the population had any real sympathy with murderers
or regretted their fate. Yet, this is a continually interesting book, by the
standards of modern scholarly publishing excellent value for money, and a
study that ably bridges modern and historical concerns.

<TEXT>
THE RISE AND FALL OF THE BRITISHEMPIRE by Lawrence James Little, Brown
Pounds 25, 704 pages
According to the ABC For Baby Patriots of 1899, 'C is for Colonies/ Rightly
we boast,/ That of all the great nations/ Great Britain has the most'; the
infant who absorbed this in his nursery would soon graduate to the toy lead
soldiers which became a craze after 1890.
But Lawrence James understands that there was another point to colonialism
beyond and behind military conquest: in Charles Dickens' words, 'The earth
was made for Dombey and Son to trade in . . .'
The British Empire was one of the fundamentals of the modern age and we, in
our post-imperial decline, may still not be in the mood to acknowledge or
understand its significance to our own society, let alone to the wider
world. James here tackles a colossal - impossible - task with an ambition
betrayed in his Gibbon-esque title, The Rise and Fall of the British Empire.
He has bitten off more than he (or you and I) can chew.
We are conducted, briskly, from the Elizabethan sea-dogs to Rhodesia's UDI
and our imminent evacuation of Hong Kong. Out of these 400 years, it is true
that the latter half of the book is given to this present century, but again
and again the reader implores James - who has the style of the fluent and
excellent history master which I suspect he used to be - to slow down, take
his time and develop just a few of his points. Or perhaps to ditch early
Virginia, the Caribbean acquisitions and India and a host of other, no doubt
fascinating topics, and focus on the decline of the Empire, which is the
more interesting bit. Or, best of all, to write two - three? - books.
Everything is here, and that is the problem - the imperial drive of the
Cromwellian years; the gunboat diplomacy of Palmerston's 'unofficial
empire'; the New Imperialism of the European powers just a century ago;
Gladstone's campaign against 'Beaconsfieldism'; the 1890s scramble for
China; the constant and supreme importance of India, both economically and
militarily; the Empire's vital contribution to the first world war; the
stagnation, snobbery and racism of the years between the wars; the emergence
of America to take over the defence of the British Empire; the optimism of
the handover to Commonwealth.
It must be evident that the canvas is impossibly wide. Too often James makes
a stimulating point (for instance, that by 1942 the US had become Europe's
banker and armourer just like Britain in the Napoleonic wars; that victory
in the pre-1914 naval race between England and Germany would go to the
economically-stronger, as in the recent US-Soviet Star Wars) and cannot
allow himself to develop it. Sometimes he misfires: the Cold War is not
helpfully compared with the Great Game over India, for example; and
Mountbatten's promotion was not the result of Churchill's search for another
TE Lawrence. The more important criticism is that Britain's imperial decline
demands a more sustained analysis than the fleeting references we get here
to the difficulties of becoming a 'second fiddle'.
The Rise and Fall of the British Empire justifies a (thick) space on your
shelves not for any revelatory brilliance or literary elegance so much as
for its value as a quick aide memoire: if you have temporarily forgotten the
essence of the Corn Laws debate, or the occasion for the Crimean War, or the
role of aerial bombing of the Sudan in the 1920s, then here is a valuable
reference point. Beyond that, the reasonably well-informed reader will feel
rather as you do after dipping into an American news magazine: it is all
perfectly convincing until you come to a subject which you know about - and
then it, and therefore the rest, really will not do.

LENIN: LIFE AND LEGACY by Dmitri Volkogonov HarperCollins Pounds 25, 558
pages
Embalmed and canonised, Lenin was removed from the vulgar gaze for half a
century following his premature death and rapid apotheosis. His mummified
body lay in a sarcophagus in Red Square tended by a laboratory which grew to
employ 60 experts, among them three soviet academicians, a corresponding
member of the academy of sciences, three doctors of science and 12 PhDs.
His brain was sliced into 30,963 sections and lodged in a special institute
where it was compared with the lobes of lesser geniuses. Although horribly
withered by the cerebral disease which killed him at the age of 53, this
organ was periodically reported to have quite exceptional features - until,
that is, Dr Oleg Adrianov pronounced in January: 'In the anatomical
structure of Lenin's brain there is nothing sensational.'
Lenin was sensational in one way, however, says Dmitri Volkogonov. He was
the greatest revolutionary of the century. For the rest, he was as fallible
as any man - though much more callous. Unable to govern once he had grabbed
power, he sought refuge in violence. He was the true father of The Terror.
For 25 years after Nikita Kruschchev had denounced Stalin's 'mistakes', says
Volkogonov, the Russian people asked themselves where Stalin had acquired
his cruelty. 'None of us - the present author included - could begin to
imagine that the father of domestic Russian terrorism, merciless and
totalitarian, was Lenin.'
This biography comes with two attributes which recommend it over other,
perhaps more literary, portraits. One is the elegance of Harold Shukman's
English translation. The other is the remarkable personal history of the
author.
Dmitri Volkogonov, a military historian, was once a loyal slave of the
system whose roots he now seeks to dig up. His father was executed on
Stalin's orders and he grew up with his mother in a political exiles' labour
camp in Krasnoyarsk, western Siberia. He was a young tank commander, a
high-ranking commissar and propaganda expert. As he told this reviewer when
his biography of Stalin appeared in English: 'I accept that I was one of
those who did a lot to strengthen the totalitarian system.'
A former general in the Red Army and subsequently President Yeltsin's
military adviser, he commanded the forces that shelled the recalcitrants in
the Moscow parliament building last October. Above all, he was chairman of
the commission responsible for declassifying the Soviet state, Communist
Party and KGB archives.
In the painful process of his own recantation, says Volkogonov, Leninism was
the last mental bastion to fall. In the book he presents Vladimir Ulyanov as
a gently-reared professional revolutionary with a compelling mind and
wolfish eyes, neither vain nor personally cruel but driven by promiscuous
and ruthless rage against his real or imagined enemies.
He stripped the liberal and democratic content out of Marxism and swore
allegiance to the fanatic principle that everything is justified - treason,
civil war, terror - in pursuit of the goal.
Lenin was an intellectual who read Aristotle and Spinoza and who described
intellectuals as the 'shit' of the nation. He seethed with hatred for the
kulaks but, says his biographer, would have been among the first to be
purged if he had not sold the family estate.
Among the facts that lay hidden in the archive were details of his ancestry
(Jewish, Asiatic and European as well as Russian), of the German financial
support for his Bolshevik party, of his nervous disorder and final mental
illness, of his direct responsibility for the murder of the Tsar and his
family.
Nor, argues Volkogonov, did Lenin ever espouse a more liberal economic
system. 'War communism' was his chosen method and the so-called New Economic
Policy merely a temporary stratagem forced on him by circumstances. 'It is
the biggest mistake to think that NEP will put an end to the terror,' he
wrote to Kamenev in 1922. 'We shall return to the terror and to economic
terror'.
Volkogonov makes lavish use of the files to sustain his thesis that Lenin's
ideas - his habits of mind, rather - characterised Soviet 'partocracy' until
the very end. By way of illustration he quotes from a 1987 politburo meeting
where we hear Gorbachev speaking of Lenin's genius, Ligachev worrying about
Trotskyism and Shevardnadze unhappy with the phrase 'liquidating the
kulaks'.
The October Revolution of 1917 was in fact a counter-revolutionary coup,
according to Volkogonov. It created a political culture that still permeates
the Russian citizenry. 'In worshipping the 'genius of abuse' we cultivated a
slavish psychology in ourselves.'
The icon may have been smashed, but worship is more powerful than knowledge.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Arts: Help lines for the beleaguered
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears that next week's Budget will be bad news for the arts have been
tempered by anticipation over the National Lottery jackpot. Potential
applicants can now apply for the cash - expected to be about Pounds 250m
annually.
The Heritage Fund published its guidelines for applicants last week; the
Arts Council announced details to clients yesterday. Telephone 0171 649 1345
to obtain a simple guide for potential heritage projects. The Lottery Line
at the Arts Council can be reached on 0171 312 0123. Both will accept
applications after January 4, 1995.
There are few surprises in the guidelines. The Arts Council does not expect
to make grants of less than Pounds 5,000. Commercial operations can apply,
provided the project will benefit the public. But in the main it will be
charities, local authorities, schools and colleges and amateur groups that
will receive the promised millions.
The money will be spent constructing new, and improving old, buildings in
which the arts and crafts can flourish. The determination not to allow
lottery money seep away in day-to-day running costs remains, but grants can
be used to buy equipment and to commission works of art. This should enable
arts companies currently receiving subsidy to devote more money to
programming.
The range of potential applicants covers circus, mime, film, video and
crafts, as well as drama and music companies. If more than Pounds 100,000 is
needed for the scheme the organisation should be able to contribute 25 per
cent of the total cost; for smaller projects at least 10 per cent is
expected.
The key aim remains 'to give the maximum benefit to the public by supporting
projects which make an important and lasting difference to the quality of
life of people throughout England.'
In contrast the Heritage Lottery Fund can offer endowment money in special
circumstances and will take a flexible attitude towards partnership funding.
Next week the Millennium Commissioners will reveal their eagerly awaited
guidelines and applicants can then decide which body to go for.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Arts: Arts face Budget blues - Antony Thorncroft argues the
case for cash-strapped companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Can the beleaguered wagon train hold out until the cavalry arrives. 'No',
says Mary Allen, secretary general of the Arts Council. 'Yes', says Stephen
Dorrell, the heritage minister.
The nation's arts companies are grappling with unprecedented debts of at
least Pounds 12m. The National Lottery is coming to their rescue, with the
first grants in April. By then it could be too late for some.
The lights are going out in January at the Salisbury Playhouse and the
Redgrave at Farnham. The Yvonne Arnaud in Guildford is under threat. The
Everyman in Cheltenham has been forced to embark on co-productions with the
nearby Bristol Old Vic. The Northcote at Exeter has become a receiving
house, not daring to risk its own productions. Regional theatres have
collective debts of Pounds 4m. Regional orchestras have deficits totalling
Pounds 1.8m.
Of the flagship companies, the RSC, the National Theatre, the ENO, and the
Royal Opera House Covent Garden have combined debts of over Pounds 5m and
the South Bank Centre is Pounds 370,000 in the red.
The trouble is that the arts have cried wolf so many times before that the
Treasury , not their most stalwart supporter, is likely to be indifferent to
their fate in Tuesday's Budget.
But even if there is nothing but an inflation increase in Stephen Dorrell's
paltry budget of around Pounds 1b, he still has the power to divide it up,
giving more to the arts at the expense of sport, heritage or the British
Library. He can, at the very least, restore the Pounds 3.2m axed from the
Arts Council of England a year ago. This, plus an inflation increase of
around Pounds 4m, should be enough to keep the shows on the road.
Dennis Marks, director of the ENO, sums up the problem. The ENO is having a
good season, playing to 78 per cent of capacity, way above the 60 per cent
of a year ago. 'If we get a grant that reflects inflation, in three years
time we will have reduced our current deficit of Pounds 3.1m to just Pounds
1m. If we get the standstill grant we are promised our deficit will stay the
same: we will be throwing money into a black pit'.
The return of the Pounds 3.2m, which is what Arts Council chairman Lord
Gowrie has modestly put in for, could be enough. It would tide the arts over
a real, but temporary, crisis. For, if London is any indicator, the
recession is over. The Big Four, which absorb over Pounds 50m of the English
Arts Council's Pounds 186m budget, are doing rather well. The Royal Opera
House is currently hitting 90 per cent of its financial capacity and hopes
to knock another Pounds 600,000 off its Pounds 1.3m deficit while the RSC is
matching the 83 per cent houses it achieved last season.
The National Theatre had a bad summer, partly because one production, Johnny
on the Spot, proved a box office disaster, but bringing back the money
spinning The Wind in the Willows should keep any deficit on the year to
under Pounds 500,000. The South Bank is reporting a sudden uplift in
support, with the LPO, its house orchestra, attracting audiences of 83 per
cent.
In the regions, however, audiences are staying at home. The enervating
financial struggle forces artistic directors to walk a tight rope between
imaginative work and commercial fare that might guarantee good box office
receipts. But as Covent Garden and the ENO discovered a year or so ago,
there is a limited market even for traditional favourites.
Such a safe approach is anathema to the committed modernists, like the 87
playwrights who this week bemoaned, in a newspaper letter, the lack of new
plays being produced and sought a nationally ordained quota of new works. In
fact the proportion of new plays put on in 1993-94 - just over 3,000 out of
14,613 productions in the 70 theatres aided by subsidy - is roughly the same
as a decade ago, but theatre managements dare not risk presenting plays
which are likely to lose money.
This is the leap of imagination demanded of Stephen Dorrell. His first
comments suggest he judges artistic success by the size of the audience.
This bottom-line approach makes sense if the audiences are attracted by
dynamic new productions, but is artistic suicide if companies go for
short-term box office salvation. Risk is what the arts are all about. A diet
of safe productions - theatres putting on Ayckbourn and Willie Russell,
opera houses reaching for their Puccini and Mozart - soon becomes stale, the
bedrock audience withers and the young are not attracted.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Arts: Creamy notes from Vienna
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Vienna Philharmonic's visit on Wednesday invited comparison with the
splendid Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra at the Barbican two days earlier.
But comparison would have been easier if both orchestras has played in the
small hall. Whereas the Bavarians' resounding, vastly spacious account of
Bruckner's Eighth Symphony under Lorin Maazel had room to breath, the
analytical dryness of the South Bank did little to flatter those famous
Viennese strings.
Still, they came out of it pretty well, and gave us a real helping of
whipped cream in the Brahms Hungarian Dance which they played as their
second encore.
Originally, Giulini had been billed to conduct, but he had cancelled some
time ago, and James Levine made something very different of Schubert's
Unfinished Symphony and Brahms's Fourth from the kind of performances we
might have expected to hear from Giulini. Levine kept the Schubert on the
move - quite rightly so, for the Symphony is often taken too slowly, with
both movements too close in tempo and too much alike in character.
Levine himself stayed unusually still, his baton travelled merely a few
inches except when he wanted to rouse the orchestra. His overall view was
serene, and though the playing was lovely, it was well on the way to being
bland. You got the feeling the orchestra could have played as well on
automatic pilot, for they certainly play as an ensemble.
Brahms's Fourth Symphony was given a lot more impulse - as well it should.
The first movement took on such momentum, it seemed likely to run away with
itself. But it did not, and the closing moments were thrilling: rather too
thrilling for the impact of the work as a whole, for the great cumulative
structure of the variations in the finale lacked a certain tension, despite
many beautiful moments, including a gorgeously rounded flute solo.
One of the individual features of the Vienna Philharmonic is the elegantly
burnished sound of their horns: they played like a dream in the trio section
of the scherzo, whose rumbustious outer sections were much more refined than
usual. As a whole, the performances seemed too suave to be heroic.
Sometimes the best of a concert comes once the official programme is over,
and so it was here. For the first encore, the orchestra teased and pampered
the final ballet of Schubert's music for Rosamunde as if it were their
favourite child. The tiny gradations of pianissimo on the strings, the
mellow blend of the woodwind, the gently pointed phrasing - this is why we
have come to hear the Vienna Philharmonic.

Might this be the year that the Tony Awards will be finally forced to
change? Though it has been true for years that the centre of the American
theatre has shifted off-Broadway and to the regions, the Tonys, the annual
awards that are the most visible manifestation of American theatre, have
maintained their policy of honouring only Broadway shows. But recent events
have sounded Broadway's death knell louder than ever before.
First was playwright Neil Simon's announcement that he is bringing his next
play, London Suite, to an off-Broadway theatre when it reaches New York
after its current Seattle engagement. 'It's just not economically viable for
us to go to Broadway any more,' said Simon of his decision; bringing a
straight play to Broadway costs a minimum of Dollars 1.5m, as opposed to
Dollars 0.5m off-Broadway. This is a scathing indictment indeed from the
only American playwright whose name still guarantees a certain level of
financial success on Broadway.
A further blow was struck with this week's announcement that Tony Kushner's
Angels in America, the most lauded and hyped Broadway play of the past
decade, is to close on December 4, felled by dwindling audiences and high
overhead costs, having recouped less than 70 per cent of its backers'
investment. Meanwhile, the best-received American play since Angels, Edward
Albee's Three Tall Women, continues its healthy run at the Promenade Theatre
 -off-Broadway. Only one new American play is set to open this year on
Broadway, while off and off-off Broadway is buzzing during the busiest
theatrical autumn in recent memory.
The first big hit of the season is Terrence McNally's warm and very funny
serio-comedy Love] Valour] Compassion], which is playing at the non-profit
making Manhattan Theatre Club through January 15, with plans for a
commercial transfer.
Unabashedly gay in its milieu and viewpoint, and addressing as it does the
search for love and the ever-presence of death in the age of Aids, the play
inevitably begs comparison to Angels in America, but Love] Valour]
Compassion] neither aspires to nor achieves Angels' scope nor its level of
socio-political commentary. McNally's gift is his ability to create
believable characters and evocative situations in which exhibit their
foibles and strengths; he also writes some of the best laughs lines.
This play finds McNally straying further from the traditional domestic
comedy form than he has in recent years - characters break from the action
to speak directly to the audience, and time flows freely between flashback
and forward action.
The play follows the events in the lives of eight gay men over three holiday
weekends in an upstate New York country house. As the house's owner, famous
choreographer Gregory Mitchell, endures and overcomes creative block, his
angelic, blind boyfriend fends off the advances of a sexy Puerto Rican
dancer and tries to find sense in his sister's tragic death. The 14-year
perfect-couple relationship of Perry and Arthur endures quiet crisis ('we're
role models,' explains Perry, 'it's very stressful'), while Buzz, a musical
theatre-obsessed, HIV-positive costume designer falls in love with James, an
Aids-infected Brit who comes to America to mend bridges with his
mean-spirited twin brother (both twins are played, in a bravura turn, by
John Glover) and to die.
But to dwell on plot is to miss the point. The play is at its weakest when
it gets hung up on storytelling and at its best at evoking that languid
holiday atmosphere in which nothing much seems to be happening, except
moments that the characters will remember for the rest of their lives:
bantering exchanges in hammocks and on lakeside rafts; spontaneous skinny
dips (frontal nudity is rampant in this play as is, for that matter, ribald
language); dinner parties that unexpectedly turn ugly; over-competitive
tennis games; charged late-night encounters.
Joe Mantello's lovely, intelligent production meets the play more than
halfway, playing up its lyrical qualities without stinting on pace. Mantello
and set designer Loy Arcenas have wisely given the production a
unstructured, non-literal design, creating a heightened world in which the
play's breaks from naturalism make perfect sense.
The ensemble is, on the whole, first-rate. Stephen Spinella, in his first
performance since his double Tony-Award winning turn in Angels in America,
is admirably restrained as the uptight businessman Perry. Nathan Lane, one
of America's funniest actors, reveals the breadth of his dramatic talent in
the showman's role of Buzz; his transformation of a third-act speech about
why life should be more like musical theatre from a show-off rant to an
agonised cry beautifully captures the play's funny-tragic spirit. Stephen
Bogardus, sporting an unconvincing stutter and an uncomfortable manner as
Gregory, is the only weak link.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Sport: Gladiators captured by the artist - Cricket / Teresa
McLean visits an exhibition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News of England's exploits at the start of their Australian tour made me so
homesick for international cricket that when I passed a small exhibition of
sporting art the other day, I went in to look at its pictures of cricket.
They are in the right spirit for the Ashes struggles. The poster advertising
the exhibition is taken from a screenprint of a batsman at the wicket, his
bat, front pad and gloves closely aligned as the only hope against the
bowling. When you look at the picture, you are looking down the wicket at
him. The picture is called The Gladiator, and that is how the artist, Andrew
Aarons, sees every modern cricketer - 'a hero, a gladiator, going out and
conquering'.
Trying to conquer, at any rate. Long spells of defeat makes the contest,
such as England cricketers and cricket fans were experiencing until last
summer, grim as well as life-threatening.
In the winter of 1992-93, England lost all four tests against India and Sri
Lanka, before going on to lose their third successive Ashes series the next
summer. When Mike Atherton took over the captaincy from Graham Gooch, and
won the 1993 Oval Test, too late to save the series, it was England's first
Test victory in 19 Tests against Australia.
As any English cricket fan knows, watching a losing team is hard work. And
so is playing in one, with the constant expectation of more failures to come
as well as those already accumulated. In the unlikely event of a triumph,
such as Graham Gooch's courageous 65 and 133 against Australia at Old
Trafford in 1993, it is a solo triumph, bereft of team support. When Gooch
performed those heroics, only one of England's other first six scored as
many as 30.
No wonder Aarons speaks in fighting language of those who watch sport. 'They
are participating in the contest; they are out there for the kill and the
blood.'
Spectators in Aarons' pictures watch their heroes keenly, fiercely,
aggressively. With crowd uniforms differentiated from each other only by
brightly coloured ties, they urge fearful batsmen or battered boxers to keep
fighting.
It is interesting that Aarons sees cricketers, boxers, sumo wrestlers,
tennis players and jockeys as the great champions of modern sport. They give
their followers an individual truth. Aarons paints rugby scrums, with a
corporate muscularity in numbers, but he rarely paints cricket teams, nearly
always individual cricketers. He is an artist, not a coach, and is free to
hold team spirit in artistic contempt.
It was no surprise that he picked Ian Botham as the supreme gladiator of
contemporary cricket. He does not paint Botham, or anyone else, as an
identifiable player, but as an embodiment of cricketing power. He seems not
to have acknowledged Botham's retirement. 'He's got this incredible
personality. You know, when you're at Lords and he's walking to the middle,
this tiny little dot, and he's radiating power.'
Bowlers pile on the pressure, but batsmen are the ones who have to survive.
Aarons told me how he learnt this from experience. He went to Camberwell Art
School when only 13 years old and in his first summer went on a school
outing to the Isle of Wight. The man who ran the youth hostel where they
stayed was a cricket fanatic and challenged the art school to a game.
Camberwell was the home of one of the first fine cricket artists, Nicholas
Wanostrocht, nicknamed Felix. Felix painted many an early 19th century
cricket portrait and invented the awesome Catapulta bowling machine to teach
schoolboys how to bat. The art school had a tradition to uphold.
Aarons saved Camberwell's honour by turning, nicking and snicking the Isle's
fast bowlers for at least 40 runs, far more than anyone else on his losing
side. From that day he was a cricket addict.
His wicketkeeper, guarding the entrance to the exhibition with huge, gloved
hands, is drawn in Conte crayon which suits the wicketkeeper's job.
Everything is black and white with sudden dashes of grey. No colour needed.
Aarons finds wicketkeepers breathtakingly exciting. I could not agree with
him that they stand much closer up to the stumps nowadays. Surely no
contemporary 'keeper would stand up to Alec Bedser's fast medium swingers as
Godfrey Evans did in the 1940s. But I know what he means by the special
flamboyance of today's wicketkeeping, using television replays to emphasise
its spectacular achievements.
Aarons gives us a creative, handmade version of the dramas which cricket
photographers record. He continues cricket artists' custom of making a good
number of etchings and prints, so cricket lovers can afford his art. They
are not cheap, but cheaper than paintings. His Gladiators screenprint costs
Pounds 225 plus VAT.
A small selection of Aarons' work remains on show at The Bodilly Galleries,
71 Lensfield Road, Cambridge. Tel: 0223-566555.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Sport: Denver detour - FT Ski Expedition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are attempting to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world trip. With five weeks to go, they are in North America.
There is another Colorado. Off the beaten track, far away from the glitz of
Aspen, the might of Vail and the great Ski the Summit circus of
Breckenridge, Keystone and Copper Mountain, are the folksy old ski hills of
which few British skiers have ever heard.
'Most skiers leaving Denver have tunnel vision,' says Rob Linde at Eldora,
the nearest of the 'front range' resorts to the mile-high city.
'They put their foot down on Interstate 70 and head for the Eisenhower
Tunnel and the famous resorts on the other side,' he explained.
It takes a little imagination, perhaps, to turn off and explore resorts such
as Eldora, Loveland and Winter Park which do not have the international
clout of Aspen, Vail or Summit County but attract local skiers from Denver.
The road to Eldora takes you into another world - through Pickle Gulch and
Gold Dust Village into the old gold-mining territory of Black Hawk and
Central City.
They still pan for gold here - Vic's Panning shack is one of many still
operating. And if anyone hits pay-dirt, the casinos - Rich Man, Gold Mine
and Bronco Billy's - or Prospectors Poker Parlor and the Silver Hawk Saloon
are handily placed to ensure the spoils are quickly ploughed back into the
local community.
Apart from some good, steep skiing in Moose Glades and Jolly Jug Glades, and
some tough runs such as Ambush and Psychopath, Eldora is most famous for
being kind to snails.
It has won friends by helping in a study of the rare Rocky Mountain capshell
variety, claimed to be among the oldest living creatures on earth. After
sending in teams of divers to investigate, the resort started limiting the
amount of water taken from Peterson Lake for snow-making in case its demands
were reducing the snail population.
Winter Park is kind to local pond-life too: the trout population has been
protected by building a culvert over a stream which crosses the slopes.
Owned by Denver, Winter Park supplies much of the city's recreational needs
in winter and summer. With 113 trails and a vertical drop of more than
3,000ft it is one of the largest ski areas in the US but has little
international traffic.
It is also just about the only significant ski area left in the west still
served by a ski train. The Rio Grande train leaves Denver's Union Station
each Saturday and Sunday at 1.30am for the spectacular 70-mile journey
meandering through rocky gorges and almost 40 tunnels to the ski area,
leaving again at 4pm sharp.
Loveland claims more terrain than Aspen Mountain, a higher base than
Steamboat's summit and more snow than almost any other Colorado resort, yet
most skiers roar past it on their way to Summit County and Vail.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Sport: Bloodletting and beer - Rugby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Rugby Football Union has embarked on a crusade to win hearts and minds
or, as the RFU puts it characteristically, to 'transmit the rugby union
message'. This campaign has already achieved one extraordinary feat: that of
having a slogan which surpasses in staleness and fatuity anything the
political parties managed to dream up for their autumn conferences.
The rallying cry is - hold your breath - 'Rugby Union Rules OK'. Catchy, eh?
In a publication called 'Working With The Media', it is presented in the
form of a mnemonic. Thus, 'R is Rugby' the greatest game in the world. 'U is
for Unconverted', not tries, but people who do not realise that rugby is the
greatest game in the world. 'G is for Grassroots rugby' the greatest game in
the world at its lowest level. And so on.
Fort's aide de memoir would have proceeded rather differently. 'R is for
Roughhouse' if legalised mayhem is to your taste, this is your game. 'U is
for Ugly' no prejudice here. 'G is for GRRRR' the battle cry of front rows
preparing to engage. When we come to B in this publication, the extent of
the cop-out becomes clear: 'B is Blast Out The Message' that rugby union is
the greatest et cetera et cetera. But to 99 per cent of those who play the
greatest blah blah, B stands for nothing of the sort. 'B is for Beer' the
fuel on which rugby runs.
Nowhere does the pamphlet mention the stuff. There are pages of worthy
advice on getting youngsters off street corners, blending healthy athletic
exercise with the unique bonds of friendship which a team game bestows, and
so on. But there is not a squeak about the activity which in any rugby club
comes second only to the business on the field - and in a good many takes
precedence even over that - namely, tipping your head back and pouring ale
down your throat.
The heart of a rugby club is its bar, and its purpose is to slake the mighty
thirst of players and supporters.
But the collective mind of the powers at Twickenham has turned to higher
ideals. The ethos of white wine and soda appears to prevail, and the air is
thick with exciting concepts of marketing, image-enhancement, community
links. Muddy boots, jugs of bitter, carthorse props with vast paunches, all
this belongs to the dark ages. Rugby union is becoming clean-living,
diet-conscious, media-oriented, self-aware.
The central message in this document is that the game must be 'bolstered and
promoted'. To be fair, much of the advice it contains on how to secure
decent media coverage is sound, if rather obvious. But while it is full of
tips such as this: 'Newspapers, radio and television love children. They
make good copy', it is conspicuously silent about the other species of story
beloved of inquiring hacks.
These are the tales of pillage and destruction, of hotels and bars drunk dry
and wrecked, of air hostesses leered at and pinched, of bottoms bared; of
loutish pranks, dirty ditties, rampant rowdyism and oafishness. The
recurrent theme is that immense quantities of beer have been consumed.
Nor does the RFU have anything helpful to say to its press officers about
another murky aspect of the greatest game: foul deeds on the pitch. They are
urged to titillate sports editors with jolly items about long-serving tea
ladies, monoglot Japanese recruits, and photogenic women players.
But are they to be equally forthcoming about the skullduggery and criminal
nastiness which reduced last Saturday's local derby to a tribal
bloodletting?
The RFU may prefer to pretend that rugby is a game for anyone, of whatever
size, sex, colour, creed, age, temperament and taste, who happens to enjoy
chasing an oval ball around a playing field.
It is, in fact, a tough, rough, messy, muscular form of wargame,
forbiddingly complex in its rules, immensely difficult to play well, with an
ineradicably dark side to it. It is for people who have a tough, rough side
to them, who enjoy doling out a little punishment and do not mind taking it,
who relish getting hot, dirty, bruised and exhausted and who, generally
speaking, fancy a pint at the end of it all.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Sport: Clough: a top boss but no saint - Soccer / A
controversial autobiography
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a common mistake to assume that sporting heroes are all-round lovable
individuals.
Even though Paul Gascoigne can dribble round defenders and find a colleague
with a 40-yard pass, he would not be most parents' choice as the ideal
son-in-law.
It is thus with a heavy heart that one approaches Brian Clough's
autobiography. Much as one admires the man's managerial record, his strident
television appearances conjure up fears of a 200-page long taxi driver-style
rant.
The book is not that bad, although the first chapter might have come from a
Monty Python style script conference. The opening sentence - 'If ever I'm
feeling a bit uppity, whenever I get on my high horse, I go and take another
look at my dear Mam's mangle that has pride of place in the dining-room' -
is ripe for delivery by Michael Palin.
Later on, we get Clough the philosopher: 'It's not the fashion to say this
nowadays, but a woman's job is to be there (in the home).' Thanks, Brian,
but Bertrand Russell can rest easy in his grave.
One unexpected emotion that leaps out of the footballing section of the book
is sadness. His playing career was cut short by a knee injury, without the
international recognition that he clearly felt he deserved, and his record
appears to justify (204 goals in 222 games for Middlesbrough but only two
caps for England).
His outspokenness ensured that he never became manager of his country but
now, ironically after his retirement, the Football Association has finally
appointed a coach with a controversial record and a Clough-like devotion to
the passing game.
He lingered on as manager of Nottingham Forest too long, as he readily
admits, so his distinguished career ended, not with an FA Cup final
appearance in 1991, but with relegation in 1993. By that stage, his youthful
good looks had gone and his face revealed the ravages of a problem confessed
in the epilogue - he drinks too much.
Then there are the breakdowns in personal relationships which litter the
book. His appointment as skipper split the Middlesbrough team into two
camps. He describes his first chairman as 'one of the most evil men I have
ever met'. He encountered sullen hostility from the players at Leeds and
lasted only 44 days in the job.
Saddest of all is the break-up with Peter Taylor. It is easy to forget but
the greatest successes of Clough's career - the League championships, the
European Cups - were achieved as part of a double act. Taylor spotted the
players, Clough motivated them.
What kept the duo going was the 'cheeky chappy' element of Taylor's
personality. Clough's fondness for Taylor, which excused the latter's habit
of 'slipping off' home at the earliest opportunity, was perhaps due to his
assistant being the only person at the club who was not intimidated by him.
While the odd player gets an honourable mention, such as John Robertson and
John McGovern, the book is dedicated to Taylor.
Yet in the seven years that preceded Taylor's death, Clough admits that he
spoke only a few words on the telephone with his old colleague. They had
fallen out when Taylor, then manager at Derby, had poached Robertson from
Nottingham Forest.
One revealing passage in the book says it all: 'It was an astonishing and
bitter end to our relationship, but my conscience was untroubled. I didn't
instigate it.' That fierce pride kept Clough apart from his old friend.
And pride also lies behind the most controversial part of the book - the
section dealing with the Hillsborough disaster. Yorkshiremen are often proud
of their plain speaking, of their willingness to call a spade a bloody
shovel.
When it applies to criticism of chairmen, football commentators or FA
bureaucrats, plain speaking can be amusing. But when the subject is a
tragedy, when the only result of your words is anger and anguish among the
relatives and friends of the dead, then the wise man keeps his silence,
however sincerely held his views.
Therein lies the paradox of sporting achievement. The same pride that causes
Clough to give needless offence is the quality that kept him going through
the disappointments of a wrecked playing career, the departure at Derby and
the short stay at Leeds.
And Clough was undoubtedly in the top drawer of managers. Not only did he
win the Championship with two different clubs, but Forest retained the
European Cup - both extremely rare achievements. Not only was this done with
a slick passing and entertaining style and an excellent disciplinary record,
but it was done at clubs with modest resources. Alex Ferguson, with all his
Manchester United internationals, is struggling to qualify for the last
stages the European Cup.
How did Clough do it? Readers hoping for the magic tips to managerial
success will be disappointed. Clough insists he kept it simple - defenders
had to tackle, and centre forwards had to score.
Apart from that, his main secret was to keep the players relaxed and to
insist on training with the ball, rather than mindless round-the-field runs.
By the end of his career, that admirable precept had become a weakness, as
Forest players failed to match the fitness of their opponents.
But maybe simplicity was the secret. Sport is too often
over-intellectualised. An iron will, allied to a few basic principles took
Clough to the top. It did not, as his autobiography reveals, make him a
saint.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Motoring: A BMW to tempt Golf and Escort drivers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BMW stresses that its new 3-door Compact is not a hot hatchback but a
smaller, more affordable version of the 3-Series saloon. Although 9ins
(22.5cm) shorter, it has the same wheelbase and interior. What you lose in
luggage room - and it is not very much - you gain in accessibility by having
a tailgate instead of a boot lid, plus split folding rear seats.
Prices of the eight-model range start at a remarkably low Pounds 13,350 for
the 316i and go up to Pounds 18,020 for a 318ti Lux automatic. A 318 tds
turbo-diesel, priced around Pounds 14,500, is due early next year.
The two Compacts I sampled were the cheapest 316i and 318ti (Pounds 15,290).
They were typical BMWs in every way: rear-wheel driven, solidly built, well
mannered and refined, with a suppressed eagerness. Of the two, I preferred
the 316i (pictured). Its 1.6-litre, 8-valve, 102 horsepower engine sounded
sweeter than the more vigorous (140 horsepower) 16-valve 1.8-litre.
I felt I could live with its less urgent - though still more than adequate -
acceleration and lower theoretical maximum speed because it was a car with
which one struck an instant rapport.
Sensible drivers could expect average fuel consumptions of 38.2mpg (7.4
l/100km) for the 1.6-litre and 34mpg (8.3 l/100km) for the 1.8-litre. The
turbo-diesel should return 47.9mpg (5.9 l/100km).
Standard equipment includes ABS brakes, driver's side airbag, power steering
and central locking with immobiliser - but you must buy your own radio.
BMW GB says the Compact is designed to attract former owners of the lapsed,
old-shape two-door 3-Series. No doubt it will. But I can see it making
plenty of VW Golf, Ford Escort and Vauxhall Astra owners contemplate buying
their first BMW.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Gardening: Blankets for the beds in winter - How to deal
with semi-hardy plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This month has proved remarkably mild in the south of England and a hard
winter still seems a distant possibility. The ceanothusis are back in bud;
evergreen choisysas are having a second flowering; and, out of doors, the
fuchsias have still stopped. It is strange to be picking small bunches of
roses when the larch trees have finally turned into the countryside's last
burst of yellow.
But take no chances and believe no signs of kindness: mother nature can be
cruel and I do not trust her to behave herself from this weekend onwards.
Any misbehaviour is hurtful to gardeners because we are all growing more
semi-hardy plants than we used to 20 years ago. They multiply easily for the
many small nurseries which have arisen since 1985. They look clean and fresh
in late spring - exactly what supermarket shoppers now expect from plants.
And they transform gardening in pots and small urban spaces.
Since 1981-1982, we have not had the sort of winter which makes us all
swear, briefly, never again. In normal winters salvation can come in
different forms. Here are the options (doing nothing is not one of them  -
and doing everything is pointless).
Perhaps the geraniums are still flowering, but you are very lucky because
they ought to have died weeks ago. Most of next season's half-hardy plants
for pots will be much better if they are grown afresh as newly-rooted
cuttings in 1995. All of my personal favourites are better thrown away,
except for one or two parent plants from which cutting should be taken early
next year of young growth which is being brought on under slight heat.
Plants such as verbena, heliotrope, pelargoniums and penstemons will flower
less freely from their second year onwards. All you need to keep is a
parent, or perhaps two, to cover yourself against disaster. The others might
as well be thrown away.
The only exceptions are plants grown for their leaves. Here, the lovely
forms of scented geraniums are admirable companions during winter inside the
house. Trim them slightly at the tips of their stems to stop them becoming
straggly, but save as many as you like because they improve with age. So
does the widely-grown Helichrysum petiolatum with its felted grey leaves. It
is worth training one or two plants in a large pot where they can be clipped
and trained into mounds of grey leaves on a framework of arched wire from
one season to the next.
Otherwise, the plants which you lift can be clipped hard - very hard if they
are tender geraniums which will otherwise become too leggy.
For safe storage, they do not only need a place where the temperature will
not fall below freezing. They also need light and air. In this mild spell,
the dangers have been mould and mildew, especially on anything which was
lifted with flowers and leaves waiting to turn brown.
Many of my soft plants begin the winter in a frost-proof shed, which is only
frost-proof if the door is kept firmly shut. Closure encourages mildew,
especially if you overwater. Remember to open the door on mild days and try
not to water too often when your plants are only ticking over. Once every 10
days is usually quite enough.
Perhaps this lifting sounds too energetic and you are short of storage. On
the margins of hardiness, you have another option - leave the plants outside
and wrap them in a suitable blanket.
A mound of bracken used to be the best answer but the business has changed -
even though though most of the gardening books do not acknowledge it.
Instead of bracken and rotted leaves, we can all use artificial blankets.
The best of them allow water to seep through, avoiding the dryness which
bracken usually causes. They take the edge off cold wind and mitigate the
sharpness of an average frost. After three year's experimenting, I now swear
by them and reckon that we all have more to learn about their possibilities.
To the trade, they are known as crop covers and are most familiar when
protecting early vegetables and seedlings. Garden centres now sell the
lighter grades of blanket in small pieces for gardeners with a plant or two
to be protected.
These fibres and fleeces are helpful, but they are not as heavy as I would
like for serious defence of big shrubs and soft summer-flowering plants.
This year I am following up my researches at the summer flower shows and
opting for the Envirofleece made by Agralan. Their blankets are heavyweights
on wide rolls and trade discounts should apply to those of you who need 100m
lengths at a time.
Two new weights in this brand are the Agralan Envirofleece 30 which is a
medium grade for small shrubs, half-hardy border plants and things such as
salvias throughout the winter, and the Envirofleece 60, a heavier grade for
large shrubs and climbers.
Both these fleeces are made from polypropylene and are easily pinned round
and in front of the plants whose hardiness causes you most worry.
But why bother, when a really heavy frost will have its way regardless? From
my experiments in recent winters, I have found that it is worth the modest
expense and effort. In generally mild winters there have been a few short
sharp shocks sufficient to knock out unprotected marginals such as Hebe
hulkeana, the taller daisy-flowered osteospermums and the tender forms of
salvia and diascia.
Those which I wrapped in lightweight fibre-blankets had survived when I
unwrapped them in April. Their unsheltered neighbours were stone dead, as
usual. No doubt a really ferocious winter will go through your Envirofleece
and be as lethal as ever, but these gentler seasons have certainly been
abated by these new protections.
The trouble is that most of them come in an intrusive shade of fleecy white
which then turns dirty grey like a sheep in a wet November. Agralan have
introduced a pale green medium fleece which takes the edge off the eyesore
and is adequate for smaller shrubs.
By lifting a few parents and blanketing the best of the rest, it should be
possible to avoid the casualties which disfigured gardens in the 1970s and
1980s.
Every pest is quick to outwit the latest predator and no doubt, mother
nature will hit us with a really hard one just when I think that I have
blanketed her out.
Until she does, fleece the plants at risk during the next few weekends; peg
the blankets down or weight them into place with stones before the winter
fleeces the plants from you instead.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Motoring: Range Rover is no stick-in-the-mud - This mobile
drawing room can be taken for a rough ride
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The woodland ride was like a switchback - glutinously muddy on the peaks,
deeply waterlogged in the troughs. Bushes scraped the sides of my Range
Rover 4.6 HSE automatic as it dealt effortlessly with terrain on which few
people would risk a valuable horse.
So what was I up to, treating Pounds 44,362 worth of air conditioned, wood
and leather trimmed mobile drawing room as cruelly as a farmer might a
battered old Land Rover?
It was all the manufacturer's doing. 'Come to Eastnor Castle,' an executive
had said. 'I know you liked driving our new Range Rovers on the road; now
spend a day trying them over the rough stuff.' (He could have added: 'Where
only one buyer in 100 ever drives them.')
Eastnor Castle estate provides the best (by which I mean the worst) terrain
in Britain on which to play with a 4x4. Barring snowy wastes, rocky screes
or desert sands, you can find any kind of surface that an on-off road
four-wheel drive could be expected to cope with or climb up. With one
exception; the proverbial high kerb outside Harrods, which is the toughest
obstacle most Range Rover owners reckon to surmount.
No doubt the resourceful Major Ben Hervey-Bathurst, who for years has
allowed Land Rover use of the Eastnor Castle estate to test its products to
destruction, could provide one if asked. This archetypal English country
gentleman has managed, with the aid of bulldozers and, it is rumoured,
occasional explosions by army personnel in training, to provide absolutely
everything else.
Coincidentally, I had a Range Rover LSD - the model with a BMW 2.5-litre
turbo-diesel engine and manual gearbox - on test. On the 400-mile return
trip from my home to Eastnor it motorway-cruised in near silence at business
motorist's speeds, rode and handled almost like a luxury car on A and B
roads and returned a more than satisfactory 24.7mpg (11.44 l/100km). This
bluff fronted, two-tonne, on-off road vehicle is no heavy drinker.
But back to serious off-roading. There used to be a golden rule for driving
off-road. Never touch the brakes. On steep, slippery hills, rely entirely on
the drag of the engine in low range first gear to control the rate of
descent.
This meant automatics were inclined to run away. But the Range Rover has ABS
brakes. I was allowed a dab on the pedal to keep the 4.6 HSE nicely under
control on muddy slopes as steep as the roof of a house. Nothing fazed this
most luxurious of all Range Rovers.
An air suspension that can be set to five different heights is also standard
equipment. The lowest setting is to make it easier for women in tight skirts
to enter and leave with dignity. And the highest gives enough extra
clearance to let it be driven over humps on which lesser machines might
perch helplessly, all four wheels off the ground.
On the road, the Range Rover's heavy beam axles prevent ride comfort - good
though it is - from being equal to that of independently suspended luxury
saloons such as BMW's 7-Series, the Mercedes S-Class and Jaguar's XJs.
But off road, the Range Rover has no rival. Extreme axle articulation keeps
all the wheels on the ground while the soft air suspension takes the sting
out of what would otherwise be horrifying bumps.
A slightly less expensive (Pounds 36,512) 4.0-litre V8 petrol engined Range
Rover with automatic transmission went just as well as the flagship 4.6 HSE
but my favourite, on as well as off road, was the 2.5-litre turbo-diesel. It
costs the same as the 4.0-litre V8. On road, I prefer automatics (a two
pedal diesel is coming next year) but I still think there is nothing like
manual transmission for serious off-roading.
On hills on which ABS brakes were needed to curb the automatic V8's urge to
run away, the turbo-diesel wound itself down slowly with the sure-footedness
of a mountain goat. With bucketfuls of torque (pulling power) at low
revolutions, it climbed steep slopes in third gear without excessive wheel
spin.
Most of the people who drive Range Rovers - or for that matter Shoguns, Land
Cruisers, Troopers and the rest - have not the slightest idea of the
off-road capability that has been built into them. Many are not interested.
But any who are should take advantage of the off-road driving courses
offered by the manufacturers and independent specialists.
Beware of the operators who buy a couple of clapped-out old Land Rovers and
rent a disused quarry.
Vince Cobley, who runs off-road events in Northamptonshire, says an
inexperienced driver of a 4x4 on rough terrain can be a disaster. His firm,
Pro-Trax, can provide vehicles and tuition. But if you have a 4x4 of your
own, you can have tuition and then try serious off-roading on a course that
will leave your vehicle dirty but undamaged. Call him on 0536-770096.
After a day's driving through mud and water, I promise you will never look
upon your on-off road 4x4 as just a high-slung car substitute again.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Property: Autumn and fall - Cadogan's Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor is unlikely to bring pre-Christmas cheer to the property
market on Tuesday. But he probably will not do anything to make matters
worse.
For the second year running the autumn trading season has dribbled away. Net
sales in October, as measured by the Corporate Estate Agents Property Index
(based on more than 4,000 offices), are 7.4 per cent down from September and
5.3 per cent down from October 1993.
Two leading indices diverge on prices: the Nationwide calculates a rise of
0.7 per cent over the year to October, the Halifax a fall of 0.9 per cent.
Not all the market is in the doldrums. Winkworth, which has 31 offices
across London, has had higher sales month by month from January to October
than in 1993. At the top end of the market, Jackson-Stops has sold
Thornhaugh Hall estate in Cambridgeshire for above its guide price of Pounds
1.6m and, in Cornwall, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley sold Bar on the Helford Passage
for 'significantly' above its guide of Pounds 1m.
Farms have also done well, with the average value of land free of buildings
rising 11.7 per cent in the first half of 1994 and 21.1 per cent in the year
to June 1994, according to Savills.
If a farm does not have an attractive house, says Richard Gayner of Carter
Jonas, neighbouring farmers looking for economies of scale will be the
buyers. That is not true for Bluey's Farm in the Chilterns near Marlow,
however, which has a brick and timber 16th century farmhouse. It once
belonged to Bluey Mavroleon of the Greek ship-owning family. It goes to
auction in Henley-on-Thames with a guide price for six lots of more than
Pounds 1.125m. Inquiries to Cole Flatt (0442-870444) or Lane Fox (071-499
4785).
In the middle range of houses, Carter Jonas had a notable success in the
auction of the former rectory at Swinbrook in Oxfordshire. At a guide of
Pounds 400,000, it went for Pounds 592,000. The local family that bought it
will have to spend a considerable sum doing it up.
For regular sales, however, the price must be competitive. Pullen's End, a
splendid large Victorian house in Oxford, was on the market for a week at
Pounds 1m. Then realism prevailed. It is now on offer from John D Wood
(0865-311522) at Pounds 700,000.
Even romantics who want to live in castles are insisting on realistic
prices. An illustration of how the market has changed is Broncroft Castle in
the Corve valley, which Andrew Grant in Worcester sold recently. The asking
price was Pounds 975,000. Four years ago it sold for Pounds 1.75m.
In Blackheath, south-east London, a wing of Vanbrugh Castle designed for his
own use by Sir John Vanbrugh, who was also the architect for Blenheim Palace
and Castle Howard, is on offer from Winkworth (081-852 0999) for Pounds
395,000. Listed grade I, it has a big 32ft x 17ft drawing room with views
across Greenwich Park to St Paul's Cathedral (on a clear day) and shares a
two-acre garden with the other parts of the castle.
Most romantic of all is a castellated dairy at Fort Putnam near Penrith in
Cumbria. The 'fort' is one of three late 18th century 'folly farms' that the
then Duke of Norfolk built on his estate at Greystoke Castle. A splendidly
perverse Whig, he put them up to celebrate American victories in the War of
Independence. One of the other follies is called Bunker Hill. Fort Putnam is
listed grade II and is being converted to a two-bedroom cottage. It is at
Pounds 75,000 from Lowther Scott-Harden (0768-64541).

FT  26 NOV 94 / Property: That horrible sinking feeling - Advice on
subsidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Subsidence became a dirty word in 1989 and 1990. Few homeowners had minded
the odd crack in the walls until those successive dry years introduced
serious problems.
The public took fright, especially if they lived on the clay beds of London
and south-east England. Nearby trees were the cause of much subsidence -
sucking the moisture out of the clay. In 1991 subsidence claims against
members of the Association of British Insurers (excluding Lloyd's) reached
Pounds 540m.
They declined in 1992 to Pounds 259m, and last year to Pounds 134m. They
should fall again this year since rainfall is back to normal, the clay is
swelling and wall cracks should be closing.
But homeowners' attitudes have not regained the same equilibrium - and
probably never will now that subsidence has become so scary.
Buildings are not wholly solid, inflexible objects. Many have had cracks for
centuries and survive happily. Timber buildings are always moving.
Cracks are not the automatic danger they are in aircraft wings. But owners
who suffered in the 1989-90 drought had a bad fright, like the James's in
Woodford Green, Essex, who had to appeal to the Insurance Ombudsman's Bureau
before their 1930s house was mended. In 1989 they noticed an irregular tear
in the wallpaper. A crack beneath one window in 1990 became by 1991 'a
complex of cracks throughout the house', said Geoffrey James. The neighbours
also had the problem, so together they asked a local surveyor to
investigate.
That led to an insurance claim. Loss adjusters were appointed who in turn
instructed structural engineers. Early in 1991 they dug inspection pits
beside the foundations. Their report in April diagnosed subsidence and
recommended pollarding the adjacent trees and underpinning. It would be more
efficient, and cheaper for the insurers, to do the work at both houses in
tandem. Their neighbours' adjusters accepted the report and invited tenders.
But the James's adjusters held back, wanting to test their theory that, if
they felled the nearby trees and cleared the shrubs, the subsoil might
recover over the next two years. They proposed waiting that long before
authorising work - although the adjusters for next door had said 'go-ahead'.
This was intolerable. The James's wrote to the ombudsman who advised writing
to the chief executive of their insurer, Sun Alliance. Within a week he
intervened and over-rode the adjusters.
Work began in July 1992 and continued until December. The underpinning was a
massive specialist operation, costing Pounds 14,500. Repairs and
redecoration by a general builder came to Pounds 11,800. The structural
engineers charged Pounds 3,000, a botanical identification service which
examined the tree roots Pounds 120 and the James's surveyor Pounds 1,600.
Except for a Pounds 500 excess in the policy that James paid, Sun Alliance
paid everything and the house stands firm. The sole hitch is that, wanting
to change his house contents insurance policy, Geoffrey James has approached
four insurers who have all turned him down, he thinks because of a question
about subsidence - which he finds hard to connect with contents.
Subsidence does not occur on sandstone or limestone, unless there is clay
nearby. Clay changes volume according to how much moisture it has, shrinking
as it dries out and expanding if it gains water. As the clay contracts,
building foundations may settle (subsidence). If it expands, it may push
them up (heave).
Insurance companies dignify the perils of Subsidence and Heave with capital
letters, but heave is not such a danger. In the 14 years of his professional
career Tony DeFries, of Savills Building Consultancy has 'never seen a
building suffer' from it.
One house can suffer subsidence while its neighbour does not - which makes
the insurers' use of postcodes, combined with geological maps to assess risk
and premiums, an inaccurate tool. The clay may be thicker or more viscous at
a particular point, or the construction different. Cracked drains or water
mains may be eroding the soil. Older houses with lime mortar ride movement
better than new ones with cement mortar.
However, trees are the biggest danger and the worst offenders are deciduous
varieties such as oak, poplar and lime. And the shallow roots of the London
plane look for water near the surface. Like lime, it is often planted close
to a building and causes damage.
The Building Research Establishment advises that trees should be the
distance of their mature height from the building, although less thirsty
trees may be half their mature height. If you think a tree is making your
house crack, seek advice from a surveyor and from an arboriculturist. It may
be wiser to prune the tree, to reduce its leafage, rather than cut it down.
(If you are in a conservation area you may need permission from the local
planning authority.) You can also trim the roots.
If your house develops cracks, assess how bad they are and identify possible
causes. Inform the insurers even if you are not making a claim. They may
instruct loss adjusters, surveyors or engineers to inspect the house, soil
and trees, and will ask how long the cracks have been there - in case you
committed the sin of non-disclosure when you took out your policy.
Experts will have to diagnose if it really is subsidence, or the cracks
come, say, from differential rates of expansion and contraction of materials
in the building. That may easily take a year, to see if the cracks close in
wet weather.
The BRE's table of damage runs from nought (hairline cracking) to five
(structural damage, cracks over 25mm wide requiring major repairs, beams
losing their bearing and the walls leaning badly and needing shoring).
Causes other than foundation movement can produce cracks less than 3mm wide
 -the thickness of a Pounds 1 coin. If the crack is wider, foundation
movement may well be the cause.
Category one cracks can be fixed using a simple filler. Category two cracks,
up to 5mm, may need some internal wall lining and repointing outside to keep
out the wet. Doors and windows may stick slightly and need easing. In
category three, cracks are 5mm to 15mm wide, doors and windows stick and
service pipes may fracture. In category four they are 15mm-25mm, and walls
may need considerable breaking-out and replacing.
Many old houses display some of this damage and are still sound. The
regulations for new houses (with foundations on clay usually 0.9m deep, and
up to 3.5m if there are trees around) are so strict that subsidence is
uncommon.
Those that have suffered have been mostly Victorian and from the first half
of this century, plus some built after the second world war. And cracks can
close, as DeFries has noted in a house in Hampstead, north London, where he
has monitored cracks for two years for the occupier. It has now virtually
recovered, and there is no need to underpin which is 'a horrendous major
structural exercise'.
Geoffrey James recommends retaining a surveyor of one's own as 'he knows the
ropes and can advise on all the ensuing building procedures'.
He says: 'If a neighbour has the same problem, work together - not least for
support on the bleak days when the family home looks set to lose its value.'

Littlejohn and RMC Driscoll is published by the Institution of Civil
Engineers and the Building Research Establishment

FT  26 NOV 94 / Travel: On the Cherokee trail - by llama - Mark Hodson
spends a night haunted by the Indian spirits and ghosts of America's past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK HODSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Hold on to your llamas,' said Laura, 'and whatever happens, don't let them
eat the rhododendron leaves.'
We grabbed the reins and set off on a trail into the heart of the Great
Smoky Mountains. There were 13 of us, including two guides, and six llamas
each carrying 100lb of food and camping equipment.
We would be sleeping out for just one night, but this was America so no one
thought it strange that we had packed tables, chairs, inflatable mattresses,
a few bottles of chardonnay and enough food to feed a small village.
Up close, our porters were surprisingly handsome. They had soft fluffy
coats, large doleful eyes and, contrary to expectations, they neither spat
nor had fearful breath. In fact, llamas like to check humans for bad breath.
Each animal walked up to us in turn and took a quick sniff before deciding
we were friendly and harmless.
For reasons that were never explained to me, llama trekking is taking off
across the US and there are 50 or 60 specialist tour groups from Washington
state down to Georgia. Our hosts on this trip were Laura and Mark Moser, a
young couple who live on a small farm in Swannanoa, North Carolina, where
they breed llamas with the loving devotion of a Doctor Dolittle.
The animals behaved impeccably in every department but one. None could
resist the lure of the overhanging rhododendron blooms which dangled
enticingly from their branches, plump and white like forbidden fruit.
We were not being cruel by denying them the chance to nibble, for
rhododendrons are toxic to llamas and just a few mouthfuls can kill. As we
ambled through the forest, over carpets of moss and through glittering
mountain streams, the animals would make sudden, darting lunges at the
poison leaves and we had to tug hard at their reins.
Our group was a random mix of mid-America. There was a lady from Indiana, a
couple from Michigan, a young family from Charlotte, North Carolina, and a
couple from upstate New York who had brought their teenage daughter for her
graduation present.
The children fell for the llamas immediately. An eight-year-old girl called
Barney took charge of Cherokee, the smallest, and was so indulgent with him
that he managed to grab a big mouthful of rhododendrons. Laura spotted the
lapse and chased him through a brook to yank the leaves out of his mouth. 'I
had to massage his gums to make him let go of it,' she explained. 'They like
that.'
Llamas tend to be docile and calm, even a little aloof, but each of our
animals had a distinct personality. Buckshot was a burly 400-pounder and a
natural leader, Jakarta grumbled constantly with a running commentary of
sighs and grunts. Lancelot, the eldest at nine years, was getting
short-tempered and listless as he edged towards retirement. All were male:
the presence of females can cause the animals to squabble or show off.
We tramped in single file beside high waterfalls and through thick fern.
Mark pointed out honey locust and cherry trees, tulip poplar and doghobble.
If we ran out of food there was always wild yam and Canadian hemlock which
we could flavour with sweet shrub leaves. When our feet grew tired we could
boil down the bark of the dogwood tree, which Confederate troops discovered
during the Civil War had pain-killing properties similar to those of
aspirin.
Every half hour or so we halted for 'potty stops'. When one llama decided to
relieve himself, the one behind would get the same idea starting a chain
reaction.
We set up camp in a clearing on a ridge with views of the dense forest below
and, after pitching our tents, found we were just yards from an Indian
burial ground where some two dozen unmarked graves were arranged in a rough
square.
Once, all this had been Cherokee land. In the 1830s the tribe was driven
west to Oklahoma on what became known as the Trail of Tears. It was a
shameful episode in America's history and people in North Carolina still
hang their heads a little when they speak of it.
Around 500 Cherokee resisted the move and holed out in the mountains until
1840, when the government allotted them a 56,000-acre reservation near the
Tennessee line. Some say Indian spirits still haunt these hills.
I had been on the reservation the previous day and it was a grim sight. The
main settlement was a tatty strip of cheap motels, souvenir shops and
'bar-b-q' shacks. At the Honest Injun Trading Shop, tourists bought plastic
tomahawks and Cherokee toilet-roll holders made in Taiwan.
There was a tattoo parlour, a tumbledown clapboard house with a sign
advertising 'FISHING PERMITS, PIG SKINS,' and half a dozen teepees by the
roadside where for Dollars 5 you could pose for a photograph with a tribal
member in full head-dress and face paint. The Indians call this 'chiefing',
their contempt fuelled by the traditional belief that a camera can steal
your soul.
Along the road, poverty could be seen through every broken shutter pane.
Outside the tourist season, almost half the 7,500 population is registered
unemployed and the only serious money comes from two bingo halls on the
reservation. All forms of gaming are outlawed in North Carolina and most
surrounding states. When a Dollars 100,000 jackpot game is held on the
reservation, coaches pour in from across the south-east as far away as
Florida and Alabama.
Some people come just to stare at the natives. Good ol' boys with farmers'
tans and baseball caps cruise by in 1970s Chevvies and customised Pontiacs,
flicking cigarettes out of their car windows. This is redneck country now.
Billy Graham lives just down the road and bumper stickers declare allegiance
to family values.
Up on the ridge, darkness had fallen. The llamas had settled down for the
night. We built a campfire and Mark and Laura cooked kebabs, wild rice and
squash stuffed with peppers and mozzarella. We talked, as Americans
invariably do at meal times, of food: jambalaya, grits and pig-in-a-blanket,
the southerners' poetic name for sausage rolls.
The conversation stopped dead when a barn owl screeched from a treetop and
maybe one or two minds turned to the Indians buried nearby. If their spirits
still haunted these parts, what would they make of us? What were these white
folk doing here with their zip-up teepees and Andean pack animals? Had they
driven thousands of people from this land to use it only for this?
In the morning I woke early to find my tent flooded. The sleeping bag was
damp and my shoes were soaked through. The rain gods had spoken.
Mark Hodson travelled as a guest of American Airlines (Tel: 0345-789789)
which flies daily direct from Gatwick to Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina.
Laura and Mark Moser are at 450 Old Buckeye Cue Road, Swannanoa, NC 28778
(Tel: 010 704 299 7155).

FT  26 NOV 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Try the rakia, but hang on to your head -
Giles MacDonogh visits Bulgaria. He has a meal to remember with a retired
cavalry officer and sees the problems of the country's wine industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I know now that the only way to deal with the after effects of home-made
rakia is to eat a large bowl of shkembay tchorba, liberally dosed with
pickled garlic and scattered with chilli pepper seeds.
I learned as much in the pretty old town of Veliko Turnovo in Bulgaria after
dinner with a remarkably hospitable retired cavalry colonel and his wife.
As ever, the meal had begun with a plate of salad and a glass of rakia, the
Bulgarian national drink. It is a little like an Austrian Obstler: a
schnapps distilled from whatever fruit there is to hand.
The colonel was proud of his rakia. I recognised that home-made feel as it
burnt its way down my oesophagus stripping away any form of protective
lining it encountered along the way. Tears appeared in the corners of my
eyes. What kind of alcohol level did it have, I asked hoarsely? Not more
than 45 degrees, said the colonel unconvincingly. I would have bet good
money it was 10 more.
The colonel cheerfully refilled my glass and raised his own in a toast.
I was relieved when my salad plate was taken away and the need to swallow
the firewater passed. We ate one of Bulgaria's best little dishes: red
peppers filled with feta and beaten egg, dusted with flour and fried in
batter. Then the colonel's wife served her special schnitzel, flavoured with
marjoram and also dipped in beaten egg.
Later, some little strips of ham made their appearance as we had not
finished the wine (the Bulgarian shuns drink unaccompanied by food).
Finally, a sweet cake appeared laced with something like a Rhenish
Apfelkraut: a reduction of apple juice.
I cannot have drunk more than a couple of tumblers of rakia but the damage
was done. Shkembay was the only hope.
Shkembay is perhaps the one area in which the Bulgarians and the Romanians
make common cause. North of the Danube it is called ciorba di burta, or
sour-stomach soup. The words tchorba and ciorba both derive from the Turkish
word for soup and this was the broth which fuelled the janizaries, or
Christian guards, of the Ottoman army. It presumably gave them the force to
fight.
Classic shkembay should be brimming with whole cloves of garlic and big,
juicy chunks of tripe. If you are suffering as much as I was, you add some
more pickled garlic and more pepper too.
Bulgarian cookery is simplicity itself. A salad, such as the popular shopski
salata (which refers to the people of Sofia), with its tomatoes and grated
feta, is served with a glass of rakia. A soup is often served, and sometimes
a sort of assiette volante in the form of a pancake filled with meat. Next
comes a little plate of kebab or schnitzel; or sometimes a cheese dish such
as the kashkaval or yellow cheese, dipped in batter.
One of the most pleasant meals I ate in Bulgaria was also in Veliko Turnovo,
in the Mehana (or tavern) Hadji Mincho, in the old town. I ate rustic potato
soup and mutton sauteed with onions while a singer called Petya sang me an
apparently lewd song about a woman caught pilfering blackberries.
Meals are not over-generous. Little slivers of meat are frequently served,
in good old Communist Block style, under a covering of cheese. The cheese is
either white (feta or sirene) or yellow (kashkaval). The Party had its own
gastronomic tastes, as a Bulgarian friend remembers on the one occasion he
was invited to the Politburo guest house (now the Hotel Rila) in Sofia for
lunch.
The room was filled with plump little men in shabby brown suits with pools
of sweat under their arms. They were all fetching a treat from a buffet and
licking their lips as they conveyed it back to their seats. The dish turned
out to be whole sheep's heads - eyes and all.
Now that the Politburo is no more, the old members might well be working in
Sofia's central market. I was flabbergasted by the linguistic talents of one
of the stall holders who addressed me first in fluent Italian; then moved
effortlessly into German until, learning that I was English, he spoke to me
in my own language.
The simplicity of Bulgarian food may have something to do with the
comparative youth of the state combined with 40 years of communism.
After the Bulgars (with a little encouragement from Gladstone) ejected the
Turks a century ago, the new nation borrowed many of its culinary ideas from
elsewhere.
From France they imported the verb 'paner' to cook in batter (this appears
on tourist menus as pane, as in 'brain pane'); from Hungary came
palatschinken or pancakes; from Russia, a taste for little smoked fish. More
recently culinary attention has turned to that bulwark of capitalism,
America.
A provincial hamburger, however, turned out to be a fairly crude attempt at
the genre: a roll was filled with what tasted like spam, together with a few
slices of cucumber and some feta cheese with tomato ketchup.
The restaurant business is booming in Bulgaria for the first time since
1947. People are free to open what they wish. Before 1989 there were about
10 restaurants in the capital, Sofia. Now there are hundreds.
But while you are no longer stuck for choice as to where to go, there is
little variety when it comes to the food on the plate. So far, the only
post-communist culinary inventions are the doner kebab and the hamburger. We
must give them a few years yet. In the meantime I counsel anyone going to
Bulgaria to apply their palates to a good bowl of shkembay.

Giles MacDonogh visits Bulgaria. He has a meal to remember with a retired
cavalry officer and sees the problems of the country's wine industry
</HEADLINE>

There is something odd, not to say unsettling, about sitting in a restaurant
in one of the more remote corners of old Europe and having the waitress
bring you a bottle of wine on which the label says that it was bottled for
the exclusive use of J Sainsbury, of Stamford Street, London, SE1.
We Britons are familiar with Bulgarian wine now, but perhaps less aware of
the turn of events which led to Britain becoming one of Bulgaria's prime
markets.
Bulgaria was designated a wine-producing state for the entire communist
block under the Comecon agreement of the late 1940s. Until the arrival of
Gorbachev, the Soviet Union provided its main market. Far from liberalising
the Soviet state, one of Gorbachev's first moves was to ban drinking in the
Communist Party. This resulted in an unexpected blow to Bulgaria's wine
industry.
Fortunately for the Bulgarians, their wines had begun to attract attention
in certain western markets, notably Germany and Britain. From the mid-1980s
onwards the best wines made their way west.
By some curious irony, the kolkhoz system, which had destroyed the old
peasant vineyards on the hillsides and brought the vines down on to the
productive (but not nearly so promising) plains, proved a boon to British
supermarket buyers.
Here was a chance to purchase huge quantities of cheap, decent quality wines
for their branches. The price they paid was shoring up Zhivkov's regime with
a little much-needed foreign capital. But at the time no one cared much
about that. Attention was focused on South Africa.
The success of this change of direction was short-lived. In 1989, Bulgaria
underwent its own version of the Velvet Revolution.
Privatisation plans, voted as early as August 1991, were finally enacted in
the course of the following year. Land was to be given back to those who had
owned it in 1947 (or their heirs).
Many of the wineries had been constructed by the state, but some had not and
in those cases there was a good deal of chicanery about giving them back;
but, at the time of writing, a third are already in private hands.
Confusion reigns. Not least because of the uncertainty engendered by the
probable return of the communists (now disguised as the Bulgarian Socialist
Party) in the December elections.
In the two years following the privatisation decree, more than 5m
Bulgarians, from a population of just 8.5m, have become property owners.
Political commentators say the BSP will not be able to proceed against this
new property-owning class without bloodshed, they will, however, try to slow
down the pace of privatisation. They will also direct business to the
state-owned wineries rather than the new private ones.
In many areas the vines themselves are in a lamentable state. Already in the
1980s declining production meant that whole vineyards were left to die.
Now the need to compensate the state for 'improvements' made to the land
during the 40-odd communist years, has resulted in some people refusing to
take back their land. They prefer to wait until the vines have died. That
way the need to pay money to the state in compensation will be invalidated.
If this process is allowed to continue it could mean that both state and
private wineries will have problems putting their hands on grapes to satisfy
their customers in the west.
In the new private sector there is considerable interest in how the British
buyers will jump. Will they continue to buy from the more efficient
state-run wineries such as Russe on the Danube, or will they turn to the new
private companies such as Lovico in Suhindol?
Konstantin Madjarov, who got his family winery in Stamboliiski back only
months ago, is bitter about both the Bulgarian state and the western buyers.
The new regime has proved itself uninterested in agriculture and his
impression is that the west has no desire to see the development of private
wine production in Bulgaria. Foreign investment has so far been made in
Hungary, Romania and Moldova, but not in Bulgaria.
Madjarov may be right. The British buyers will almost certainly continue to
buy where they may be assured of decent quality in sufficient quantity.
In the meantime, the Bulgarians' old friends in Russia have come to the
rescue. Yeltsin's land is not the sober place it was under Gorbachev and
demand from Russia is high. The trouble is that they only buy cheap wine.
Driving back from Plovdiv to Sofia I could still make out the old
south-facing terraces where the best grapes were grown before 1947. The
thought of replanting these good sites filled me with a mild optimism.
I found something of the same spirit among Sofia's leading political
scientists. They pointed out that Bulgaria was in the throes of a social
revolution comparable to that which took place in France two centuries ago.
A new social class has come into being. One of them asked me if I had
noticed the hordes of horses and donkeys which now clutter up the Bulgarian
roads: 'The old communists hate them; they see them as a return to
pre-modern times. This is not true: the donkey is the first step to
independence.'
The same peasant-farmer who invests in a donkey will look after his newly
acquired vines, and who knows? Maybe one day his son will stop taking the
grapes to the co-operative and make the wine himself?
It was a cheering argument and one which continued in a local Sofia
restaurant over a bottle of Young Vatted Merlot (bottled exclusively for
Safeway).

While the hunt is on for the finest ingredients for the Christmas table, the
search for the ideal venue for the office Christmas party is almost over.
One London restaurant that has opened too recently to avail itself of
Christmas bookings, but would make a most original place for a small office
lunch or dinner party, is The Heights, on the 15th floor of the St Georges
Hotel, Langham Place, London W1 (071-636 1939). The chef is 29-year-old Adam
Newell, formerly of Le Poulbot, Cheapside, London EC2, who shows his
culinary talent and originality in dishes such as: salad of grill guinea
fowl and ratte potatoes; crab and scallop flan; peppered roast monkfish and
gateau of aubergine and tomato vinaigrette. Dinner costs around Pounds 20 to
Pounds 25 per head without wine (the list is sadly disappointing) and there
is a cheaper bar menu next door. Window tables command views across west
London.
My short cri de coeur about the menace posed by mobile phones in restaurants
has struck a chord. Suggestions came in from the UK, Israel and Germany.
They ranged from the creation of special areas for mobile phone users, the
equivalent of smoking and non-smoking zones, to the commissioning of a new
HE Bateman cartoon that shows the fate of 'The man who dared to use a mobile
phone in a restaurant.'
One reader told the story of a man in a railway carriage interrupted by a
fellow traveller using a mobile phone. The man expressed interest in the
phone, was given it to look at, and promptly threw it out of the window.
But all readers agreed that restaurateurs should display a prominent sign
asking mobile phone users to leave their phones with the receptionist during
the meal. If they do not, one-liners to be remembered include: 'I'd rather
not hear about you and your probation officer]', 'I'll ring your neck' or
finally, and most effective if said by a woman to a man: 'Kindly put that
thing away]'
A light lunch prepared by Rowley Leigh, chef-proprietor of London's popular
Kensington Place: scallops with ceps; noisettes of venison with pumpkin
puree and tomato and aubergine gratin followed by baked tamarillos and
vanilla ice. To drink there were choice wines from the cellars of the London
wine merchants Bibendum: a delicious Condrieu; Cabernet from the Waimarama
Estate in New Zealand; Recioto di Soave and Niepoort port.
Did I say a light lunch? Do that five days a week and you will almost
certainly be making an urgent appointment with your doctor. But not
according to Jane Clarke, the dietician who designed the menu. Clarke says
one may eat good food and remain healthy - and the above meal was one
example.
Sounds too good to be true? Let us hope it isn't. Sceptics can make
inquiries to Jane Clarke on 071-823 5323, fax 071-823 5110.
Sotheby's first wine sale in Zurich for many years takes place on Friday,
December 9 at the Hotel Baur au Lac and is expected to fetch Pounds 500,000.
It coincides with Sotheby's 250th anniversary year and the 25th anniversary
of Sotheby's Switzerland.
Chateau Cheval Blanc 1945,'62,'64,'82,'85,'86,'88 and '89, La Fleur Petrus
'79 and '86, vintages of Margaux, Lafite, Latour, Pichon-Lalande, Cos
d'Estournel and Ducru-Beaucaillou are included.
There are some interesting estimates: SFr8,000-SFr10,000 for a dozen bottles
of Petrus 78 and SFr6,000-SFr7000 for a dozen bottles of '67 Yquem.
Sotheby's is hoping a single bottle of the '45 Yquem will fetch
SFr1,000-SFr1,300.
In addition, cigars will be auctioned, including some Cuban specials chosen
for flavour and rarity. A 44cm Havana 'Le jeroboam de Gerard Pere et Fils'
is expected to net SFr400-SFr600. No doubt the buyer will either want to
share it with friends or smoke it over several uninterrupted days.
Seriously, the number of exceptional wines from rare vintages might make a
very acceptable Christmas or anniversary gift, especially since there are a
number of small lots.
Hampton Court Palace still has places available on its Tudor feast lecture
tours, running from now until spring next year. Specialist guide-lecturer
Sue Jenkins will talk about Tudor food, cooking methods, kitchen equipment
and diet. The tour will take place in the palace's royal kitchens, which
were designed to feed several hundred. Cost of the tour (on selected
Thursdays from 11am to 12.30pm) is Pounds 15. Details on 081-781 9540.
A welcome sign that, under energetic chairman Adele Biss, the British
Tourist Authority is taking a more active role in promoting British
restaurants, is the new Guide to Asian Restaurants in London. Financed by
the BTA and Qantas, 70,000 copies of this guide to 39 of London's best
Chinese, Thai, Indian and Japanese restaurants are available free from BTA
Asia offices and are being distributed to Qantas passengers arriving in the
UK.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Kippers that taste of Scotland - A small
smokehouse in the Highlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I am not much of a fisherman. But I thought I was when, one early autumn
evening, the MV Hectoria hove into the little port of Achiltibuie in the far
north-west of Scotland. After just a couple of hours of fishing off the
Summer Isles, I had in my possession 30 large, fat mackerel.
In I strutted to Am Fuaran, the local waterside pub, holding my fishing rod
like a sceptre and feeling like an emperor about to distribute largesse.
Who, I inquired benignly, might be interested in the gift of a sack of fresh
mackerel?
I expected gasps of surprise and admiration. There were none. I expected
people to queue up. They did not. One man, in that stage of inebriation in
which the whole world is one's friend, said he might take a couple for his
cat, but then forgot about it by the next round. I went to bed remorseful,
feeling, even if they were only fish, like a mass murderer.
The next morning, over breakfast, Lottie Ross, my hospitable B and B host,
did her best to console me. 'There is nothing wrong with mackerel,' she
said. 'It's just that here on this coast we can get about anything we like.
For us crabs, prawns, and lobsters are normal, everyday things. My husband
Jimmy will be back from Loch Osgaig in a while; I expect he'll have caught
us a few brown trout for tea.'
I felt a bit better. But I also felt curious. Amid all this ocean wealth, I
asked Lottie, was there any kind of food from the sea - crustacean, mollusc,
or finned fish - that she liked to eat but that was not a normal, everyday
thing?
Lottie thought long and hard. 'Yes,' she finally replied. 'Kippers.'
For Lottie, as for most lovers of the smoked herring, kippers are a treat
and not to be over-indulged in. She reckons that once every fortnight or so
is a good average. 'You wouldn't want them more often than that - they make
a very particular meal,' she insisted.
Particular they are indeed. However rarely they are eaten, kippers seem to
have a curious property - they are just about the most evocative,
memory-stirring and nostalgia-producing food you can eat. Lottie agreed; she
can remember eating kippers as a child growing up near the Clyde. She can
even remember specific meals - the arrival of wooden cases of Loch Fyne
kippers and the feasts that followed.
Perhaps that is because Loch Fyne, a long, deep arm of the Firth of Clyde,
is reputed to provide the best kippers in the world. When I put it to Lottie
that the kipper was not a Scottish invention, but originated last century in
Seahouses in Northumberland - I once spent a holiday there and it is their
proudest claim - she was indignant. The kipper is as Scottish as tartan
plaid, she asserted, and the world's finest.
How could anyone prove that, I wanted to know. 'Just head down the road a
mile and see a man named Keith Dunbar,' Lottie replied, 'he knows everything
there is worth knowing about kippers.' And he did.
Lottie and I were both wrong, it turned out. As a specialist who for more
than a decade has been smoking not just herring but everything else under
the sun - salmon, sea trout, eels, venison, duck, highland beef, wood
pigeon, and Arran cheeses - Keith Dunbar has amassed great quantities of
literature at the Achiltibuie Smokehouse. His enthusiasm for his art has
done him no harm - he may work on the wild outer edges of civilisation, but
last year Dunbar and his small company, Summer Isles Foods, won the BBC's
Best Smokehouse award. I surprised him, hard at work in his smoker's apron,
but he nipped off happily to his files to satisfy my curiosity.
Neither the Scottish nor the English, it seems, can claim the invention of
the kippered herring. The origin of the word kuppen, meaning to spawn, is
Dutch, and was applied originally to the smoking of out-of-season salmon.
Kippering fish is also a very old art, and was practised all over northern
Europe for hundreds of years as a means of preventing spoilage.
As early as the 1400s fishermen in southern England were talking about a
'kipper time' in connection with what now seems an improbable activity - an
annual Thames salmon fishery.
But do not imagine, I was warned, that the medieval kipper enthusiast sat
down to the moist, fragrant, creamy textured and delicately smokey fish that
the best kippers can be. One should not even imagine, in fact, that the
medieval kipper enthusiast existed at all - heavily smoked to make
emaciated, out-of-season fish a bit more palatable, heavily salted to give
them maximum storage life, the dry and leathery kipper was eaten more
through necessity than pleasure.
Keith Dunbar, though, is hardly more complimentary about the modern
mass-produced product. And anyone who has tried it will probably agree -
today's frozen boil-in-the-bag supermarket kipper is a disappointment: not
tender but soggy, not flavoursome but tasteless, not subtly toned but
artificially colour-treated. Worst in this litany of modern sins, Dunbar
asserts, is that some kippers have never seen even a lick of smoke.
All this is partly the consumer's fault, he admits. 'We don't shop with our
noses or our sense of taste, but with our eyes. Commercial companies know
this and, invariably when we buy smoked fish, we fall for that superficial
sales pitch - deep, dyed colours. It is a mistake every time.'
Keith Dunbar's kippers are nothing but herring, salt and smoke. 'The
mass-production companies would laugh at my operation here - they deal in
herring by the truck-load,' he said as he showed me his blackened smoke
kiln, not much bigger than a large wardrobe, that allows him to smoke up to
200 kilos of fish at a time.
'There are three things that are vital in kippering,' Dunbar said as he
showed me brine vats and hanging racks, smoke flues and fire-boxes. 'The
quality of the herring, the smoking process, and the kind of smoking wood
used.'
If Dunbar can get plump, high-fat herring from Loch Fyne he will; sometimes
he finds Faroe Island, Norwegian or Icelandic herring better. Often
commercial smokehouses will smoke their herring for just three or four hours
with a smoke so hot it immediately forms an impervious crust over the
kipper, preventing the absorption of smoke. In Achiltibuie herrings are
smoked for 18 hours using 'cold combustion', a method producing slow, cool
smoke.
The real secret of a good kipper, though, lies in the wood shavings that
generate the smoke. Dunbar uses only shavings from sherry casks: when these
are imported by Scottish distilleries for whisky storage they are dismantled
and rebuilt; the scrolly mature oak shavings that result produce a deep,
fragrant, subtle flavour.
Who eats kippers these days, I asked Keith Dunbar, marvelling at the
invoices for kipper deliveries lying on his desk. What, for heaven's sake,
could the Ramada hotel in Qatar want with more than 300lb of kippers? Who
orders kippers at the Holiday Inn in Katmandu?
All sorts of people will try them, apparently. But strangely enough there is
a fairly well-defined kipper consumer's profile, Dunbar told me. Kippers are
an upper-middle class product, eaten mostly by over-55s. They are favoured
by the professional classes, especially those in the law, finance and the
clergy. Most kipper lovers are conservative - they harken back to the days
when people could sit back and enjoy a leisurely breakfast.
'There's something very emotional about the whole business,' Dunbar told me,
mystified. 'There are large numbers of elegant London ladies who buy kippers
for their fathers and uncles at Christmas. 'Daddy just loves kippers', they
say to me. They have become so popular I have started a Kipper Club. For
Pounds 50 you can have two pairs of freshly-smoked Achiltibuie kippers
delivered to your door every 30 days for six months.'
Elegant London ladies were all very well; I, however, wanted to put Keith
Dunbar's kippers to the real litmus test - an exacting Achiltibuie woman I
happened to know.
'Wonderful,' sighed Lottie Ross the next morning as together we tucked into
a feast of grilled kippers, scrambled eggs, hot toast and strong tea. 'It
has just that fragrant, smoky flavour I remember as a girl.'
I had no distant, kipper-related memories to dwell on. But
kipper-consciousness, more evocative than any Flaubertian madeleine, will
not fail me. Next time I bite into a morsel of that tender, flavoursome
fish, I know I shall find myself on the rocky shore of Achiltibuie.
Inquiries concerning the Kipper Club may be addressed to Keith Dunbar, The
Smokehouse, Achiltibuie, Ullapool, Ross-shire, Scotland IV26 2YG. Tel:

FT  26 NOV 94 / How To Spend It (The Electronic Age): Pocket pagers for
teenagers - A variety of fads are catching on around the world. FT writers
report on what is happening where
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The must-have item for any trend-conscious Californian teenager these days
is the pocket pager - preferably in this season's colours of bikini blue,
hot pink or a see-though 'ice' shade.
These matchbox-sized devices may have begun life as a communications tool
but they are now seen as a fashion item. Teens are also hot on pager
accessories: bungee cords, gold chains and special clip-on cases are all the
rage. The coolest choose a pager in one colour with a holster in another.
Pagers had a bad image until about a year ago, because they were said to be
used by drug dealers and their clients. Attitudes have changed. While many
high schools still have an official ban on pagers, administrators are
turning a blind eye to a trend that is too big to fight.
Teenagers are not the only age group catching on to the pager trend. Pagers
are also becoming the communications tool of choice for 'baby boomers'
looking for affordable ways to stay in touch with their ageing parents and
baby-sitters. But surveys suggest that teens are three times more likely to
carry pagers than others.
The appeal of a pager is clear for a generation of Californian youngsters
which typically spends more leisure hours on the telephone - local calls are
free - than watching television. The pager is, after all, the next best
thing to a mobile phone, which few of them could afford.
In California, a simple pager that accepts numeric messages costs about
Dollars 70, with a service charge of Dollars 10 a month. A cellular
telephone typically sells for Dollars 160, and monthly call charges can
mount quickly to Dollars 100 or more.
It is, however, parents who buy most of the pagers that are touted around by
teenagers - and they have self-interest in mind. The pager is a high-tech
way to lengthen the parental apron strings while still keeping tabs on young
Jenny or John. The new house rule for the Californian teenager is: 'When I
page, you call home.'
In a society where parents double as taxi drivers for their youngsters
because there is little public transport, pagers are an asset when plans go
astray.
Low-cost paging services, of the sort used by most teenagers, are designed
to transmit only numeric messages, normally a telephone number. But
youngsters have worked out codes to make the most of the system.
Mother's code number is always 303 which, turned on its side, looks like
mom. The girl/boyfriend code is 143 - the number of letters in the words 'I
love you'.
For the lovelorn, the code 1 1717155 00 means 'I miss you' because, when
those numbers are squeezed together, they look a bit like the words.

Technology has moved so far and so fast in recent years that you can now
take your pick from large quantities of techno-toys that, a decade ago,
would have existed only in the darkest corners of Q's laboratory on a James
Bond film set.
If money was no object, and you were free to choose from the very best of
the techno-toys around, regardless of price, which products could, or
should, you buy?
Night vision a problem? It does not need to be - not with a hand-held,
thermal imaging device. Pysis makes a one-eyed version with a hefty Fuji
zoom lens for Pounds 900 or thereabouts. You see things in a fetching shade
of luminous pea-green: handy, if you happen to like that colour. The bonus
is that its ergonomic shape means you can hold it with one hand. A pleasure
to use.
The pleasure principle is to be found everywhere in the design of
technology. Arguably, there is no product area apart from car design that
has benefited more from advances in the understanding of product semantics
than the computer.
If you feel the need for an electronic organiser to put a little order into
your life, the Psion Series 3a is well worth a look for its chunky feel and
robust usability.
A snip at Pounds 329.95, it comes complete with lots of smart cards and the
necessary leads. For tougher tasks, you will need a bigger, beefier computer
which is also enjoyable to use. The top-of-the-range Apple Macintosh
Powerbook 540c4/320 costs a shade over Pounds 4,000 and plays a nifty game
of computer golf as well as dealing with all the organisational material you
would want it to handle.
One of the nicest things about the most expensive Powerbooks is that you get
a trackpad, rather than a ball, as the control for the computer. Your
fingertips simply trace a direction over a silkily-textured piece of
plastic. How it works is a mystery: but that is half the pleasure of owning
such an expensive machine.
Another exercise in unadulterated extravagance would be an Ericsson EH237
portable telephone. It is a nicely compact piece of design with all the
fully-featured functions that you would expect from a miniaturised
communications centre. The hitch is that the EH237 rockets in price if you
buy it without a connection. With air-time, it costs less than Pounds 100.
Without air-time, it is Pounds 381.99.
Another terrific little toy is the Sony Pixis IPS 760 (Pounds 1,299). It is
a hand-held global positioning system that tells you more or less exactly
where you are at any time - within 30 to 100 metres. Take a map, use it to
tell the Pixis the latitude and longitude of your friend's country house -
and the device will tell you exactly how far away you are and what direction
you should take.
The Pixis is a pleasure to hold and to play with. But it is about twice the
price of some rival makes, which will give you just as accurate a position.
Let us assume that the position your Pixis has given you is 'on the sofa in
the living room watching television'. Technology has brought us to a stage
where the choice of sets available is bewildering.
If you want to see the pictures as the cameraman and the production team see
them when they are working, you could do worse than invest in a professional
broadcast monitor. The Sony PVM 1444 QM (Pounds 1,499) is the one to look
for.
A video recorder to go with it? Try the Sony S-VHS SVO 9620 Pro-Recorder
(Pounds 2,750). It has the same chunky aesthetic as the television set and,
with its no-nonsense functional quality, is built to last.
Camera? The Canon EX-2 Digital Hi-8 (Pounds 6,999) has more buttons than a
deep-sea exploration vehicle and looks suspiciously like one. The Sony Hi-8
Pro editor Twin-deck Video Player (also Pounds 6,999) should complete the
set.
For those who prefer something a little slicker, Bang &amp; Olufsen, of Denmark,
has been making the sound and vision equivalent to the De Lorean car for
years. A completely expandable, modular Beosystem - including a television
with motorised stand and interior screen 'curtains', built-in video and
several speakers delivering spooky, surround-type sound - would set you back
nearly Pounds 10,000.
If you wanted to add a huge, compact disc player, Sony's Unilinear Quadruple
D/A Converter System D/A Master Clock Twin Optical Linkage CD Player is
Pounds 5,000.
All this is available off the shelf for the modern technologist with money
to burn. Then there are the custom-built techno-toys where the price of a
simple stereo and speakers can begin at Pounds 100,000. But who wants to
wait for delivery when technology is moving so fast and dragging design
along with it?

Sales clerks in Japan's vast electronics stores have a lot of learning to do
these days.
Just a few years ago, they could persuade their customers to buy the latest
stereo or television set on the merits of better sound quality or clearer
pictures. Now, consumers want to know much more about complicated functions
such as memory storage and software compatibility.
A short-list of the best-selling electronic products in Japan reflects a
definite trend away from conventional audio-visual equipment, although there
are some exceptions.
Sharp's Viewcam - a video camera with a liquid crystal display view-finder
that allows the user to watch what is being filmed on the spot - is one rare
example of continuing success in a tried-and-tested product sector.
Another is wide-screen television sets. These have been on the market for
only two years but have claimed a large slice of the market already.
Sony says they will represent 30 per cent of overall television sales this
year.
Yet, while wide-screens have been enormously successful, some companies
wonder if they will ever become a block-buster hit on the same scale as the
Walkman or video recorders, rather than simply being replacements for old
sets.
Most of the present hits in the Japanese electronics market reflect the
blurring of the old boundaries between consumer electronics and information
technology.
One of the most popular new products is the car navigation system - a global
positioner that is installed in the car boot with a screen containing a
digital map on the dash-board.
These do not fall easily into the conventional definition of consumer
electronic products; indeed, they can more accurately be described as
information tools.
Other successful examples of these are the new wave of personal digital
assistants, such as Sharp's pen-based Zaurus system, and increasingly
popular cellular telephones.
This trend has led many Japanese companies to concentrate more of their
resources on information technologies that will let consumers receive
entertainment software or information through communications networks, or
keep large amounts of information in digital storage media.
Pioneer plans to link with two other companies to provide karaoke services
down the telephone line, while Sony is focusing its energy on products
merging information with entertainment.
These include Telnavi, which allows the user to access a car navigation
system through a CD-ROM drive incorporated into a television unit that also
plays regular music discs.

Small is beautiful, it seems, to French consumers of gadgets and gizmos.
From mobile phones to cars, miniaturisation is the buzzword for plugged-in
Parisians.
Nowhere is this more evident than in the case of the Bi-Bop portable phone.
Weighing less than 200 grammes, the hand-set is small enough to slip into
the owner's pocket.
The Bi-Bop was launched last year and is available only in Paris and
Strasbourg. Yet France Telecom, the company behind it, has more than 70,000
subscribers already.
The system has its limits, one being that callers need to be within range of
a transmission sub-station. But unlike Rabbit, Bi-Bop's failed British
counterpart, there is an adequate number of such stations in the launch
cities. And Bi-Bop is expanding: from next month, it will be available in
Lille.
Another hit is the mini-car - the vehicle sans permit. Unknown to many
foreigners, France is home to a handful of companies that produce small cars
which can be driven by motorists who have not passed the rigorous driving
test.
The appeal of these is not just for the young, who may fancy a roof over
their heads rather than braving the elements on a moped. The VSP is also
aimed at motorists frustrated at failing to find parking spaces. One
manufacturer, Microcar, has sold more than 40,000.
VSPs are unlikely to set the pulse racing. With engines of about 50cc, or
electric motors, they struggle to go faster than 30mph. But they can be
driven by 14-year-olds, and they are easy to park, which gives them appeal.
Yet the French remain attached to some tried and trusted gadgets, albeit in
updated form. One is the Minitel, the teletext system which is to be found
in 6.5m offices and households.
It has been given a new lease of life since the introduction this summer of
a faster model. The Minitel a Grande Vitesse, as it is known, operates at
9,600 bytes a second (eight times faster than its predecessor), allowing the
transmission of images through the network.

For people crammed into the second most densely populated corner of the
world, those in Hong Kong have a strange fear of losing touch. The colony
has one of the world's highest penetrations of mobile communications, from
cordless telephones to pagers. One person in every three - effectively,
every household - has one such piece of apparatus.
The fascination with mobile phones starts young. Plastic models are
displayed alongside traditional rattles and building blocks. It is a fair
bet that the first word uttered by the Hong Kong baby is not 'Mummy' but
'Wei]', the telephone greeting.
None of this has been lost on telecommunications companies, both locally and
overseas. As Hong Kong also has one of the most technologically
sophisticated audiences, the range of telephones and pagers is as big as it
is diverse. Top criteria are size - slim versions are best - and
long-distance capabilities, a must for those whose working day can be spent
on either side of the Chinese border.
Yet, the rave among white-socked schoolgirls and be-suited businessmen alike
is a relatively simple product with a uniquely Hong Kong twist: the
multi-lingual pager.
These svelte models - slimmer than a packet of cigarettes and infinitely
more hip - continue to provide all the information which is de rigueur for
Hong Kong students, taxi drivers and tycoons.
Hutchison and Motorola advertise their joint multi-lingual pager with a
slogan designed to win the hearts and minds of today's bi-cultural youth in
an apt semantic hybrid: 'Gam man fong kung hoi happy hour ma?' ('Are you on
for happy hour after work tonight?').
The Motorola Advisor, a pager that can be used only in Hong Kong and Macau
but is loaded with functions guaranteed to appeal to the button-happy, plus
a memory storing up to 40 messages, also has an astute marketing strategy.
The television commercials depict a youth with pop star looks and a bouquet
of flowers who always arrives at places where his friends are not.
The message is clear: if only he had a multi-faceted, multi-lingual Motorola
pager then he, too, could take part in the happy-hour karaoke.

New Yorkers are no techno-freaks. This is a city, after all, where the
latest in retro-fashion dictates that owning a rotary telephone is hip.
This low-tech approach to life might explain why the humble pager is so
popular among Wall Street's top traders and investment bankers. Admittedly,
today's pagers, with their liquid crystal dials that transmit detailed
messages and information are no longer quite so humble.
Yet, Wall Streeters seem to prefer the pager over the mobile phone because
of its lack of inter-activity. A quiet buzz and short message seem less
intrusive than a shrill tone and long conversation.
The sight of millionaire bankers using pagers still surprises some people,
however. As one bemused executive at a top bank said recently: 'You see guys
walking in here wearing a Dollars 2,000 suit and a pager clipped to their
belt.'
You can, of course, still spot the occasional Armani-suited executive with a
notebook computer, but the more tuned-in techno-freaks will probably be
armed with the new line of personal communicators such as Sony's Magic Link
or BellSouth's Simon.
These hand-held contraptions are a phone, fax, pager, E-mailer, scheduler,
address book, calculator and note-pad all rolled into one small, if slightly
bulky, box. The Simon costs around Dollars 600 and the Magic Link Dollars
900, and both are becoming popular in the media and fashion businesses.
Gothamites, however, are not immune to the lure of the high-tech gizmo if it
allows them to enjoy a little 'down-time' now and then. The SoHo art crowd
probably gets a kick out of Brooklyn artist Todd Robbins' Sound Toy, a
software program which allows art-lovers to inter-act with his work via
their computer screens, creating their own mix of music and images from an
electronic canvas.
Then there is personal projection television, the latest fad among those who
cannot bear to leave the box. PPTV consists of a pair of glasses with
built-in headphones. A signal from a TV-tuner belt pack projects an image on
to the inside of the glasses.
The technology most eagerly awaited in New York is the in-car navigation
system, on test in California. It is intended to ensure that drivers never
get lost. Once it is in place, all that will be required is a product that
translates the cabbie's words into English - and provides automatic change
for a Dollars 20 bill.

FT  26 NOV 94 / How To Spend It (The Electronic Age): Techno-toys - not just
for the boys - Alice Rawsthorn keeps an eye on the electronics products that
will be hitting the high streets within the next year or two
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
We may be at the dawn of the digital age but to most of us the electronics
world is as chaotic and confusing as ever.
After all, who wants to risk becoming one of those apocryphal
'friends-of-friends' who spent thousands of pounds on an early fax machine
or who bought a Betamax video.
That said, there has never been a better time to treat yourself to a new set
of techno-toys.
The combination of economic recession, fierce competition and pressure from
newly-wired consumers has forced the big Japanese electronics and US
computer companies to sharpen their acts.
Prices have fallen; styling is slicker and the latest electronic devices are
also easier to use.
After a lean period for innovation in the industry, a stream of electronic
products will be arriving on the market in the next year or so.
Televisions
The humble TV set is one of the main subjects for innovation. For years the
industry assumed that high definition TV, or HDTV which offers superior
sound and image quality when compared with conventional television, would be
its hope for the future.
However, HDTV is years away from being launched in the US and Europe, where
the industry is still deciding on standards and specifications.
It is available only in Japan and has not caught on there because of high
prices - a Sony system costs Y600,000 to Y800,000 (about Pounds 4,000-Pounds
5,000) - and a shortage of programming.
Instead, the big hit in Japan is the wide screen. When they were launched
three years ago the industry saw them as a cult product that might appeal to
movie buffs, as the screens have the same shape as a cinema screen. But
wide-screen has become a surprise success.
It accounts for one in five of all the televisions sold in Japan. Now, it is
coming to Europe in the guise of the new generation of PALplus standard
televisions.
Nokia is in the lead, having launched a 28in PALplus set for Pounds 1,500.
Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, has already bought one.
Sony, Philips and Grundig are now finalising their PALplus launch plans for
early next year.
Games
After racing ahead in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the video and computer
game market has reached a hiatus over the past year or so, as games fans
have awaited the launch of the next wave of 32-bit and 64-bit compact
disc-based games.
The new games are more powerful than the old 16-bit cartridge consoles. They
also offer digital sound, three dimensional graphics and cinematic visuals.
'They're streets ahead of their predecessors,' said one expert. 'Playing a
32-bit football game will be like staging your own Match of the Day with the
crowd chanting in the background.'
Two of the first 32-bit games machines, the Sony PlayStation and the Sega
Saturn, are going on sale in Japan this month and in Europe next spring.
The most eagerly-awaited innovation is Nintendo's super-powerful Ultra 64,
which is twice as powerful as the 32-bit games machine and will cost Dollars
200 when it goes on sale in the autumn of next year.
New Music Media
After the success of compact disc, the electronics industry is eager to move
to the next new medium. The hitch is that no one seems able to agree exactly
what the new medium will be.
Philips and Panasonic have joined forces to develop the Digital Compact
Cassette, which they see as a logical successor to the analogue cassette as
it is smaller and more durable with digital sound quality.
Sony and Sharp are pinning their hopes on the MiniDisc, a miniaturised
version of the compact disc that offers the same advantages of random access
and durability in a smaller, recordable format.
All four companies claim publicly that sales are on target. Privately, they
admit that the progess of their new products is scarcely scintillating. One
of their smartest competitors, Pioneer, is playing safe.
It sees DCC and MD as 'intermediate technology' and is concentrating on
developing a miniaturised blue laser disc system which, it hopes, will be
the new medium for the 21st century.
Compact Discs
Yet another battle is brewing over the format for the next generation of
compact discs.
There are now three competing formats on the market. So far CD-ROM - the
interactive disc that combines text, graphics and sound - looks like the
winner particularly in the US where Microsoft has been playing on parental
consciences by selling CD-ROMs as educational aids, notably encyclopaedias.
The competing formats are CD-i, the interactive compact discs developed by
Philips for use on dedicated consoles that cost from Pounds 299 and plug
into television sets, and 3DO, a top-of-the-range games system.
Confused? Just wait until video CD comes on stream. This is the new genre of
disc that plays films, just like a video tape, as well as music.
Video CDs are already trickling on to the Japanese market. But most
manufacturers are loathe to mount full-scale launches elsewhere until the
industry has resolved the timing problem of whether to stick with the
current crop of 74-minute discs - which are long enough for albums, but not
for feature films - or to develop an expensive new digitally-compressed
format.
Computers
Main themes in the computer market over the next few years will be
integration and miniaturisation. Compaq has led the field in integration
with multimedia machines that operate as CD players, PCs, fax machines,
CD-ROM drives and even telephones selling for Dollars 1,000 in the US, or
for around Pounds 1,100 in the UK.
Sony is making waves on the miniaturisation front with the Personal
Intelligent Communicator developed in conjunction with AT &amp; T.
The PIC, which sells for Dollars 995 in the US, is a portable gadget, the
same size as a Filofax, that functions as a fax, database and an E-mail
machine. It is available in the US only, although Sony hopes soon to launch
a similar format in Japan.
Global positioning systems
If anything can claim to be the techno-treat of the early 1990s it is the
global positioning system, the hand-held devices that enable the user to
plot where they are and where they want to go.
Philippe Starck, the superstar French designer, uses his in his private
aircraft.
The GPS is still seen as something of an indulgence in Europe, but in Japan
it is rapidly becoming commonplace. The must-have accessory is a digital
map, or in-car global positioning system; a CD-ROM drive is tucked away in
the boot and a map of the route flashes on a dashboard screen.
Sony sold 90,000 Digital Maps last year and expects sales at least to double
in 1994. Its latest ruse is a Y400,000 digital map with a real-time traffic
information system that uses a cellular phone link to warn drivers of jams
ahead. Sony hopes to start with the digital map in Germany, in April.
Meanwhile, Pioneer is working on the next generation of in-car hardware
which, it hopes, will offer an on-line digital map, a CD player,
radio-cassette and cellular phone - all in one machine.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Fashion: Inspirational evenings - Some advice to men on how
to be cosmopolitan and flamboyant without being flashy or vulgar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HEATH BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Obliged to wear dark suits by day, and the uniform of black tie and dinner
jacket for formal evening functions, men are not always practised in the art
of ringing the changes where dress is concerned.
The modern man has been able to shelter behind the protection of regulation
'kit' for too long, and has excused himself from using his clothes as a
means of self-expression. He may fear the freedom that comes when the rule
book is thrown away.
If a gold-edged invitation arrives for an evening's revelry, but black tie
is not obligatory, what is a chap to do?
He is going to have to think for himself. If he cannot take refuge in his
dinner jacket, wants a change from his office suit and feels jeans and a
leather jacket are not quite right, what should he wear?
This has long been a problem in country circles, where black tie can look
ridiculous in more relaxed settings, but has been overcome in the shires by
a touch of the flamboyant and eccentric. A gaudy mix of plaids with rich
velvets and silks brings a cosmopolitan male flamboyance to provincial
parties that is rarely seen in London.
Highland castles stage colourful balls and Gloucestershire manors host
parties at which men are decked in vibrant splendour. This Regency flair for
male sartorial elegance has survived in rural Britain and looks set to
return to the city too.
City men should not take fright. Many of the looks on offer may have a
distinct touch of the romantic about them, with more than a touch of homage
to Byron and Shelley, but the best are thoroughly masculine, using fabrics
and accessories that are richly sensual but boldly Gothic.
Favourbrook, the gentlemen's outfitters, off London's Jermyn Street, says it
is selling more individual evening clothes for men. 'The velvets and brocade
jackets and waistcoats we produce have been selling much more lately and not
just to a few young snappy dressers,' says proprietor Peter Vayner.
From elderly judges to successful young city executives, men in search of a
little colour have been updating their evening wardrobes with velvet jackets
and elaborate silk moiree waistcoats. At Favourbrook, traditional tailoring
is mixed with sumptuous fabrics, both contemporary and period in design, to
create menswear that is highly individual - a personal statement rather than
a run-of-the-mill uniform.
It is this notion of personal statement and a sense of individuality that
should be aimed at when choosing men's evening attire - a display of healthy
flamboyance.
Robin Dutt, Bon Viveur, art critic and style guru, is a great advocate of
the flamboyant. And it is with evening wear that he sees a chance for men to
let loose. 'All stiff sartorial rules can be broken when it comes to men's
eveningwear,' says he, 'but it has to be done with panache, with a certain
soignee elegance.' He mourns the sobriety of black tie and urges men to
invest in at least one sumptuous evening garment in rich velvet or luxurious
silk.
Velvet seems to be the fabric of the moment and it comes in many shapes and
guises from the traditional smoking jacket to the high collared Nehru.
Neck fastenings can be experimental and relaxed with variations on cravat
ties or collarless dress shirts with studs, or velvet and satin shirts left
casually open beneath layers of brocade waistcoats and velvet jackets.
The overall aim is to bring some life and colour to the evening scene, to
revive the traditions of old, to learn again to couple fun with a touch of
the eccentric and to add a dash of romanticism.
However, remember that you must feel comfortable with this new look. So do
not choose something so wild that you will feel ill at ease. It must be you.
After all you do not want to admire it only in the wardrobe. You could, if
you feel your personal style is not too flamboyant, invest in a single
waistcoat. If you are feeling more adventurous you could go for a
jewel-coloured jacket, a romantic cravat or even a complete velvet or
brocade suit.
If you are in doubt as to how to put it together take a look at the
photographs here and think back to the inspirational sources of the current
mood - Byron, Shelley, Beau Brummell, the Duke of Windsor, Indian
Maharajahs, Gothic novels, the films Dracula, Frankenstein (although avoid
the overly sinister) and Les Liaisons Dangereuse.
Places to look:
Favourbrook, Piccadilly Arcade, Jermyn Street, London W1 for off-the-peg and
made-to-measure one-offs and off-beat tailoring.
Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche, New Bond Street, London W1 for fabulous
men's brocade suits and 'le smoking' jackets.
Harvey Nichols, men's contemporary department, Knightsbridge, London SW1 has
a wide modern collection of velvets (look particularly for those by
Moschino).
Simpsons, Piccadilly, London, W1, for traditional smoking jackets.
Paul Smith, (there are nationwide stockists) has modern variations on velvet
and satin shirts and suits.
Good secondhand shops.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Fashion: The up-and-coming get down-to-earth - A reputation
for bags of talent - but an attitude problem. Avril Groom reports on the
growing pains of Britain's young designers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Young British designers have bags of talent and the whole fashion world
acknowledges it. Some also have what is known as 'attitude'. The combination
of creative over-confidence and a cavalier approach to production and
deliveries, in an industry notoriously run on a shoestring, was for years
the despair of backers and store buyers.
One wealthy businessman who invested in British designers during the 1980s
will no longer touch them, preferring to spend his money on established
foreign names who deliver wearer-friendly clothes when they promise them.
Perhaps it is time for him, and others of his ilk, to look again at British
talent. Hard economic realities have created a new attitude of down-to-earth
discipline among the up-and-coming. Some have set out with a rigorous,
professional approach while others have learnt by bitter experience. All
know that the days when a student designer could sell an outrageous graduate
collection straight off the college catwalk and not worry about details such
as production schedules are long gone.
The best deserve an ovation for achieving a near-miracle. They are producing
serious, well-made clothes with enough wit and originality to attract the
sophisticated woman with a deep pocket, even when her eye is jaded by an
overcrowded design market. And despite tight cash-flows, they deliver on
time and up to quality.
None of them finds it easy. Listening to their stories, one wonders what
would possess anyone to start a fashion design business in Britain today.
Presumably the creative drive and the lure of fame or distant fortune are
strong. And there are interim rewards. Sonnentag Mulligan and Paul Frith
have gone, in four seasons, from young unknowns to seeing their names in
lights at top London stores - Liberty, Harvey Nichols and Way In at Harrods
have been particularly supportive.
Liberty sometimes helps designers offset the cost of a first collection by
paying for the fabric. Owen Gaster's first full collection so caught the
imagination of Japanese buyers that its proceeds have financed the next one.
Other young designers, however, suffer from problems and prejudices.
Provincial British shops are still made nervous by comments such as the one
from a New York buyer who recently declared that she had twice ordered from
a talented British designer, but had not received a single piece.
Prejudices rub off on some designers who ill-deserve it. Often they are
expected to be late and ill-organised because some of their contemporaries
still believe that showing in a seedy, inaccessible corner of London in the
middle of the night is a smart way to display their creative power.
The only way designers can show that they are now grown up and have given up
such follies is by cleaning up their acts.
Sonnentag Mulligan and Paul Frith both had their autumn deliveries into
stores by mid-August, well before they were needed. Nicholas Knightly's
spring show of soft, perfectly-executed jersey dresses, fine wool Guernsey
sweaters and pale striped cotton pyjamas was in a sensible central London
location and started well on time - a statement of intent after several
erratic seasons.
Designers are rarely business brains as well, and finding the necessary
adviser is difficult. Getting financial backing is even harder and cash-flow
problems are endemic - the time-lag between investment and payment is often
longer than the stores would countenance.
Some new designers find ways to counteract this. Clinton Silver, chairman of
the British Fashion Council is busy arranging 'marriages' between designers
and companies. This is not, he says, to 'control the designer's business'
but to 'help give them more exposure and also the benefits of experience. In
return, the designer's consultancy input can raise the manufacturer's
fashion profile and thus contribute to improving design standards in the
high street.'
Barbara Sonnentag and Tracey Mulligan's arrangement with the Stirling Group,
a Marks and Spencer supplier, resulted in their recent first solo show,
which, with vibrant colours, innovative fabric mixes and sharply glamorous
shapes was one of the toasts of London Fashion week.
'We now feel confident in developing a bolder, slightly younger direction,'
says Barbara. They are not forsaking the high-quality, wearable tailoring on
which their reputation has been built, however, 'because we have to compete
with a lot of better-known names'.
The quality of their understated, slimly-cut autumn suits in mixes of matt
and slightly shiny neutrals is remarkable considering they are their
company's only full-time employees.
Nicholas Knightly says he keeps the small factories he uses happy 'by trying
to be a good customer' - unexpected for a young man who graduated in 1991
with prodigious talent and an ego to match. His first collection, of white
shirts and denim, was bought by Harvey Nichols. But he had little business
experience and false starts and broken contracts followed.
His talent for feminine, flattering cutting has brought consultancies from
commercial companies, one of which now keeps him and his full-time assistant
'on the straight and narrow'. A small autumn collection of favourite shirts
 -the deceptively-simple one we show was designed three years ago - and
private orders will be followed by full-scale deliveries for spring and he
will also design a range for the Stirling Cooper group.
Paul Frith has as yet to make such a commercial link but hopes his efficient
system will attract an investor. 'My business manager and accountant both
have other jobs so most of any investment would go into the company, not
overheads,' he says.
In a previous life he was a Royal Marine, and the discipline shows. He
worked in bars to fund his first collection, he uses plain, classic fabrics
 -wool crepe, silk satin and, for spring, cashmere and chiffon  - so supply
is not a problem, and he tracks down small factories which can produce the
quality finish he demands for his very simple, body-skimming, tastefully
sexy shapes.
Owen Gaster is a new boy on the block who has only shown two full
collections but his attitude is promisingly serious. He sold his graduation
collection to finance a tiny private-order business and perfected
traditional hand-finished tailoring techniques by studying construction of
vintage jackets.
Earlier this year he held his first, self-financed, show. It resulted in a
Japanese agent who found 15 stockists for his glamorous tailoring which is
precision-cut on a dummy rather than sketched 'because bodies aren't flat'.
He says he designs for 'mature, elegant women' and demands a suitably high
quality from his small factory and out-workers.
The lessons which these designers learn as they progress may prove
instructive in the future. Gaster has leapt boldly into exporting after
finding that 'you cannot survive on British sales because this is such a
small market. Real business is done abroad.' Frith disagrees, having learnt
that 'a well-run business starts small and takes time'.
It will be interesting to review their respective positions in a year.
Barbara Sonnentag has learnt the bitter lesson that 'it is very hard to make
money in this business' but remains optimistic.
Knightly's comments reveal most about the attitude with which young
designers start out: 'I've learnt that designing is a job, not a hobby, and
now I listen to what my customer wants.' He, it seems, has learnt humility,
which in the world of fashion is the most important growing-up lesson.

FT  26 NOV 94 / How to Spend It: Home in on the basics - Conran
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the House Book by the then Terence Conran came out in 1974 I was in the
midst of doing up a terraced house in London. I, and most of my friends,
seized upon it with relish, for here at last was a book that seemed to speak
to us. Here was a book that addressed the everyday problems of making a
house work without the irritating assumptions so prevalent in the glossy
interior magazines of the day that we either aspired to images of ancestral
grandeur or suburban cosiness.
It offered a vision of a contemporary way of living that related to our
lives and incomes. But above all it showed us the virtues of simplicity, of
investing in basics such as the structure of the house, of getting the
lighting right, the heating, the flooring first. Style, or the addition of
the more movable elements such as furniture, curtains, pictures, lamps and
all the rest, ran the subtext, could almost take care of itself provided the
basics were right.
In some ways there seems scarcely any need to update it, so classic, so
fundamentally sensible is the advice.
But Sir Terence has just produced a bigger, equally well-illustrated 1994
version which he calls The Essential House Book*.
The fundamental philosophy has not changed. Here, for instance, are a couple
of paragraphs from the introduction: 'A home is greater than the sum of its
parts and getting the practicalities right is only half of the story. For
most people, the special significance of 'home' lies at a deeper level. Home
is where we feel at ease, where we belong, where we can create surroundings
which reflect our tastes and pleasures. Creating a home has a lot to do with
discovering those elements that convey a sense of place.
'Investigating these basic ideas relegates 'style' to something of a side
issue. Fashions in decorating fluctuate like hemlines, whereas notions of
comfort and intimacy date back hundreds of years. This is not to say that
style isn't fun or even useful. But it is ultimately more important to find
out what you really like, the unique combination of space, light, colour and
materials which will continue to refresh your spirits long after the latest
'look' has had its day.'
This book is a manual which would be invaluable to anybody setting out on
the adventure of creating a home. It is illustrated quite beautifully with
pictures that are imbued with a relaxed and undidactic approach to matters
of taste and style. If they have a common thread it is of light and air and
an unstuffy approach to the business of turning a house into a home.
The pictures show, better than almost any words, that there are no 'right'
and no 'wrong' ways to furnish. Instead what we have in the late 20th
century is as vast a choice as it is almost possible to imagine.
But quite apart from the inspiring pictures, practical issues are tackled -
from how to make a kitchen work for you (and the kitchens featured ranged
from small and minimalist to a large family living-room-cum-kitchen) to how
to deal with the vexed matter of significant spatial change.
Even for those who already have houses they are satisfied with, this book
has much to offer. Its directory covering the practical subjects such as
lighting, flooring, plumbing, paints and plaster is filled with useful
information, and the list of useful addresses for everything from brass door
furniture to architects and security alarms makes the book worth its cover
price alone.

FT  26 NOV 94 / How to Spend It: The conservatory as a year-round asset -
The joys of spending the winter under glass
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The conservatory first became popular with Victorian industrialists who, as
they began to travel, developed a passion for exotic blooms and exuberant
foliage and needed to devise ways of nurturing these delicate plants through
Britain's dreary winters.
Glass-houses were the answer and as glass became less and less of a luxury,
as techniques for casting and building with iron developed, their popularity
spread among the bourgeoisie.
As an essential ingredient in Victorian romance (how many love affairs began
to bloom behind the potted palms?) and a vital part of the social life of
their day, they survived well into Edwardian times.
However, as they became more accessible and attached to smaller and smaller
houses, they became too workaday for the rich and gradually fell out of
favour.
It was not until the mid-1970s that interest in building conservatories
began to revive. Peter Marston, who started a company that is now called
Marston &amp; Langinger in the early 1970s, says that when he first started
purveying the notion of conservatories he often had to explain 'that we did
not build music schools' so very unfamiliar had the idea become.
It remains as true now as it was in the last century that conservatories
come into their own most magically during the long, grey winter months. And
they offer us a means of making indifferent summers bearable, with the
illusion of being in a garden, surrounded by lush greenery.
Conservatories also make entrancing settings for parties - summer or winter
 -and now that they are once again in fashion (after the en-suite bathroom
and the hand-painted kitchen, a conservatory, it seems, is next on the home
improvement list) there is a proliferation of accessories - everything that
the well-dressed conservatory requires.
For those thinking of embarking on building a conservatory or for those who
already have one but are looking for ways of improving it, Peter Marston has
written an authoritative guide: The Book of the Conservatory*. He also has
some excellent ideas for making them an all-year-round household asset.
The most important relate to double-glazing and heating, essential for those
who want a tropical illusion in the midst of a British winter. The
Victorians went in for vast boilers and radiators and seemed to have been
blessed with a happy unconcern for heating costs.
These days double-glazing and insulation are the key, if heating costs are
not to be astronomical. All that should then be required is a simple
extension of the domestic central heating system - ideally with separate
controls so that the conservatory can be heated independently at night.
Under-floor heating is ideal and Marston &amp; Langinger has developed a system
which uses extremely elegant cast-iron floor grills, wonderfully reminiscent
of the intricate ironwork that so characterised those first Victorian
designs.
As the winter nights set in, the sense of summer coolness and light can be
replaced by a cosier feel with rugs on the terracotta or stone flooring,
cushions and throws can be added to sofas and chairs (see the photograph
here) and blinds which in the summer keep out the glare can, in winter, be
used to keep warmth in.
For winter evenings and parties, there is nothing more beautiful than
candlelight but lanterns are probably safer and there are plenty to choose
from. Peter Marston developed a range of furnishing accessories specifically
for conservatories, because so many of his customers found that once they
had the structure there was no single source of appropriate accoutrements.
The Marston &amp; Langinger shop at 192 Ebury Street, London SW1 is one of the
best places to start looking. Here are lanterns of every kind, from the
pumpkin-shaped one photographed here to the hanging star or the
Moorish-inspired version.
The shop also offers the wickerwork furniture that seems appropriate for a
light-filled setting, with the throws and cushions that will transform it in
winter. But for an inspirational glimpse of the extra dimension that a
well-designed and enchantingly furnished conservatory can add to living, I
recommend Peter Marston's book - the colour pictures are inspirational. They
feature every mood from sunny cool and tranquil through to exotic, rich and
intricate.
Particularly useful is the glossary of suitable plants and how to look after
them, the practical advice on the things you really have to get right from
the beginning - such as flooring, heating, double-glazing - and the lists of
designers, builders and suppliers of furniture, jardinieres, hanging baskets
and all the other trappings that the new owner will find himself obliged to
buy.

FT  26 NOV 94 / How to Spend It: Wipe away the tears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CARMEL ALLEN and LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Max Factor took the last solid block mascaras off the shelves, many
women were disappointed. A few, possibly, shed a blackened tear at the loss
of the peculiar 'spit and slick' ritual which allowed them to control
exactly how much mascara they applied to their lashes.
Chanel has come to the rescue with a 1990s version of the traditional cake
mascara. Le Regard (Pounds 29) is what Chanel terms monochromatic make-up;
it contains an eyeshadow, eyeliner and mascara in one sleek compact - and
the right tools to create the smouldering, smoky eyes that the Chanel models
peered through on the catwalk.
To complete the look, false eyelashes with a difference are now available.
These 'One by One Semi-Permanent Eyelashes' (Pounds 3.95) have nothing in
common with the 1960s variety that left women looking heavy lidded and
drowsy. The new eyelashes can last up to three weeks and are light,
waterproof, and can be used happily by contact lens wearers.
The British Designers Sale has become a fixture in the shopping lives of
many a chic lady who lunches.
Here the canny shopper often finds her designer numbers at sharply reduced
prices. Unfortunately, membership of the list for the women's sale is full
but there is a menswear version of the designer sales at which would-be
snappy dressers can search for bargains.
More than 25 top European designers (no, we are not allowed to mention names
but they are English, French, Italian, American and German) will be selling
samples, ends of lines and surplus stock at greatly reduced prices -
anything and everything from suits, jackets, ties, socks, shirts and
overcoats plus (curiously) a selection of silk lingerie to gladden the eye
of women who accompany the men.
The men's sale takes place twice a year and the next is on Saturday December
3 from 10am to 5pm at the Kensington Hilton. There is a Pounds 2 charge at
the door and only cash or cheques (no credit cards) are accepted.

FT  26 NOV 94 / How to Spend It: Make way for Puffas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

First it was the Barbour jacket that made its way from the shoulders of the
hunters and shooters of the world to the city movers and shakers.
Then it was the turn of quilted Husky jacket to make the transition from
stablewear to status symbol. The Italians, in particular, embraced it
wholeheartedly. They wear Huskies over their tailored jackets, keeping the
chill at bay in smart street cafes.
Now is the turn of the super-padded Puffa to leave the stable and rub
shoulders with its catwalk imitators.
Once best-known as part of the Michelin man, the padded jacket has been
taken up and reworked by top flight designers from Donna Karan to Issey
Miyake and is now found in every high street store. The trendiest (and
cheapest) are from Warehouse (Pounds 69.99) and Miss Selfridge (Pounds
34.95) while Next has a good one with detachable sleeves in its catalogue at
Pounds 69.99.
Those who prefer the original Puffa will find it in bright colours, as well
as the traditional dark blue, at around Pounds 90.
But the most exclusive and sought-after by far has to be the silvery,
waisted version by Gucci at Pounds 350. Definitely more at home on the back
of a Harley than a horse.

FT  26 NOV 94 / How to Spend It: A brush with the professionals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Perfect as a present for the would-be sophisticate is a set of make-up
brushes. Anyone who has ever had a professional make-up knows that brushes
are the basic tools.
Maggie Hunt, one of Britain's leading make-up artists, creator of looks for
Naomi Campbell, the Princess of Wales et al, has put together a set of
brushes, each designed to do a specific job.
To the uninitiated, 11 different brushes may seem a trifle excessive, but
Maggie Hunt is convinced that the properly made-up face requires them all -
from eyebrows to complexions, from lips to eye shading, brushes are the way
to get the truly finished look.
Handles are of painted wood, the hair fine quality and a set costs Pounds
95, including a smart leather wallet. A leaflet with a step-by-step guide
shows the professional way to use them. Available from Harrods and by post
(Pounds 2 extra for mail order) from Lion Brush, Planet Place, Killingworth,
Newcastle upon Tyne, NE12 0RZ. Tel: 091-268 2288.

FT  26 NOV 94 / How to Spend It: Direct deals for phone addicts - Judith
Gubbay calling . . . what service do you require?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDITH GUBBAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the telephone breaks loose from the home and the office, the services you
can call on it are expanding.
It is 9pm on Sunday. You have just returned home after two weeks of
sun-baked idleness. What is the first thing you do? If you are anything like
Jane, my friend, the first thing is to open your mail. The second is to ring
your bank.
Jane is a worrier, and one of the envelopes she opened suggested that her
finances were not as well-ordered as she thought. 'I knew I woudn't be able
to sleep until I'd sorted it out, so I picked up the phone.'
Jane's call was to First Direct, the pioneer among telephone banking
services. Had she been feeling frivolous - or more anxious about the
contents of her wardrobe - she might have rung Next Directory or Racing
Green for a copy of their new catalogues.
She could have called Rail-Direct, to order train tickets for her trip to
Leeds at the end of the month, or checked on how her shares were doing, or
booked a seat for the Tuesday night showing of The Browning Version.
Ordering goods by phone is hardly new: UK consumers have been summoning
pizzas and Chinese meals to their homes for years. What is new - and growing
fast - is the number and range of services available that bypass the
shopfront and the middleman, using special free or cheap phone numbers so
that it does not matter (to you) where you are calling from. Many are open
most, if not all, hours. These, coupled with increasingly sophisticated
information and entertainment lines, for which you pay a premium, may
transform UK shopping habits.
The Henley Centre's Teleculture 2000 report shows that more than 50 per cent
of people in the UK are using the phone to organise their financial affairs.
Some 39 per cent use it to buy from catalogues. BT's own research suggests
that travelling, parking and queuing are turning consumers from conventional
shopping.
First Direct customers' experiences bear out the other main attraction. 'I
enjoy being able to pay my bills at odd times of the day or night - whenever
it suits me,' says civil servant Steven Jones. First Direct confirms that
Sunday evenings are a peak business time.
Drawbacks to telephone shopping seem few; best advice, however, is always to
keep a note of your transactions and orders.
No directory of these services exists - so here, for the benefit of the
unconverted is a selection of telephone services: FREE-TO-YOU PHONE CALLS

FT  26 NOV 94 / New conclusions from old studies: The Nature of Things
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You are an ambitious medical researcher working on a controversial issue -
say, the effect of diet on cancer or heart disease. Several clinical trials
have been published, giving contradictory results. How can you make the
biggest impact in the field?
The traditional way would be to raise millions of pounds worth of research
grants to carry out the definitive study, with a better procedure and more
participants than any previous trial.
An alternative approach is to gather all your predecessors' work and
re-analyse their results, using a powerful statistical technique known as
meta-analysis. This could lead to a clear conclusion much more quickly and
at far lower cost than organising a new study.
The foundations of meta-analysis were laid in the 1970s by epidemiologists
such as Richard Peto in the UK and Thomas Chalmers in the US. They were
looking for a path through the confusing thicket of data thrown up by the
proliferation of clinical trials.
Meta-analysis involves combining the results of separate studies carried out
to answer the same question - for example, does eating garlic reduce the
risk of a heart attack? The reason for pooling data is to iron out the
chance fluctuations which can obscure the significance of individual
studies.
The conventional target for achieving 'statistical significance' is a
probability of more than 95 per cent that a result was achieved through the
drug or activity being studied, rather than by chance. If the effect is real
though fairly small, it may not show up in 20 studies with 300 people but it
should give a statistically significant outcome in a combined analysis of
6,000 people.
A systematic review of all clinical data, including meta-analysis, is quite
different to the informal reviews traditionally published in the medical
literature. These often miss important conclusions by looking at the
evidence as a collection of individual studies and dismissing the ones that
do not have a statistically significant outcome.
Meta-analysis made its first big impact in 1985 when Richard Peto and Rory
Collins of the ICRF Clinical Trials Unit in Oxford transformed the treatment
of breast cancer by showing that a drug called tamoxifen improved five-year
survival rates.
In the cardiovascular field, it was not until 1988 that the medical
profession recognised the ability of thrombolytic 'clot-busting' drugs such
as streptokinase to save the lives of heart attack patients. By then, 70
separate clinical trials had been carried out on a total of 47,000 patients.
Yet statisticians now calculate that there had been enough clinical evidence
to prove the effectiveness of streptokinase as early as 1973, when 10 trials
had taken place with 2,500 patients - if only someone had done the
meta-analysis. The introduction of routine thrombolytic therapy then, rather
than 15 years later, would have saved more than half a million lives
worldwide.
It would be wrong, however, to give the impression that meta-analysis is an
easy option. The first essential is to draw up clear objectives for the
review, with criteria for including or excluding studies.
Then you have to track down the data, which may be the hardest job of all.
Despite the spread of computerised databases, conducting a worldwide search
for all published studies is an enormous task; there are an estimated 20,000
medical journals worldwide, many in foreign languages.
But serious reviewers must also search for unpublished studies. Otherwise
the meta-analysis may suffer from 'publication bias' - the tendency for
researchers and journals to publish studies with a positive outcome, in
preference to those that are inconclusive or negative.
Deciding which studies to include or exclude is fairly straightforward when
the meta-analyst is looking at the effect of drugs. Then he or she can
restrict the field to 'randomised controlled trials' in which the subjects
are divided at random into two groups; one takes the drug and the other a
placebo, and ideally neither the patients nor the researchers know which is
which.
For 'observational studies', examining for example the impact of diet,
smoking or environmental factors on health, the eligibility criteria become
harder to define and implement. And when meta-analysis moves away from
health to the social sciences, there is great scope for ambiguity and
confusion.
Social scientists are turning to meta-analysis as a way of settling issues
ranging from the impact of pre-school education on later academic
achievement to the effect of job training on unemployment. But its use here
is still controversial. Some argue that individual studies are too
dissimilar in methodology and quality for the results to be pooled.
Most health researchers, however, have embraced meta-analysis as a powerful
new tool for fishing original conclusions out of old data. At the same time,
they point out that meta-analysis does not remove the need to refresh the
pool with well-designed new studies, such as the big Scandinavian trial of
cholesterol-lowering drugs published last week. Medical progress will
require a co-ordinated combination of the two approaches.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Thinking the unsinkable: The modern parallels exposed by an
exhibition about the Titanic, which sank in 1912
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a grim coincidence that the first comprehensive exhibition of
artefacts recovered from the Titanic opened at the National Maritime Museum
in Greenwich a few days after the sinking of the ferry Estonia.
The fascination surrounding the loss of the supposedly unsinkable Titanic,
on its maiden voyage, was overshadowed by the shock of the sinking of a
modern ferry at a cost of more than 900 lives. The Titanic went down after
it struck an iceberg off Newfoundland on April 14, 1912. Only 705 of the
2,228 passengers and crew survived.
Timing apart, historians and naval experts see other parallels between the
two doomed vessels. Both were designed and built to prevailing standards but
both were found wanting.
The Titanic was launched when the number of lifeboats carried reflected the
cubic footage of the vessel devoted to passenger accommodation rather than
the number of passengers and crew. Its designers added a 12 per cent safety
margin to the minimum required by the Board of Trade but there were still
only enough lifeboats for half those on board.
A more comprehensive sub-division of the Titanic by internal bulkheads - a
design issue which is again being hotly debated after the Estonia sinking in
October - might have saved the liner, some experts think.
For 73 years the Titanic lay undisturbed, up to two miles down on the floor
of the Atlantic Ocean. The prospect of ever finding the vessel and answering
the unsolved mysteries of its sinking appeared remote.
But in 1985 the wreck was discovered by a joint French-US expedition.
RMS Titanic Inc, a New York-based company, was declared 'salvor in
possession', meaning that it had unique rights to explore the vessel and
raise material.
The company has since carried out three expeditions, the most recent in
July, using a submersible provided by the French Oceanographic Research
Institute. It has raised a total of 3,600 artefacts.
RMS Titanic is committed to raising material from the Titanic and putting it
on general display. It is pledged not to sell any of its finds.
Some 150 objects are on display at the maritime museum, include a ship's
porthole, metal deck bench ends and a letter from a manufacturer lamenting
the demise of the feather boa as a fashion accessory.
Video footage taken from the submersible shows the ship's rail, chandeliers
hanging in a long-abandoned state room and racks of plates.
The chance to stage the exhibition was offered to the maritime museum 'out
of the blue' by RMS, says Dr Eric Kentley, a curator.
There are no plans to take the exhibition to any other museums around the
world though the maritime museum and RMS are working on designs to establish
a permanent museum to display the material.
The Japanese meanwhile, have announced plans to build a full-scale replica
of the Titanic to act as a floating hotel and conference centre. All the
details of its interior would be replicated although there would be no
engines or steering gear.
As the Titanic sank into the darkness of the Atlantic it broke its back and
landed in two separate sections. When it hit the ocean floor the bow section
ploughed into the mud, obscuring to this day the details of how large a gash
was caused by the iceberg.
'The technology exists to remove the silt from the bow section but the
problem is to find the capital to get the equipment down there,' says John
Eaton, a historian with an interest in the Titanic going back more than 45
years.
Recovery of material has been limited to the sea around the vessel. A
decision to treat its interior as a grave site has meant that no attempt has
been made to raise artefacts from inside the hull. Although very few
survivors of the sinking are still alive 'people are very sensitive about
anyone going into the hull', comments Dr Kentley. Eaton confesses to finding
this ban 'very frustrating'.
Although the intense cold, the absence of light and low oxygen levels on the
ocean bed have slowed the deterioration of the Titanic, chemical attack and
sea-bed bacteria have eaten into the metal, staining many objects black.
A comparison of the photographs taken in 1986, and those from a descent in
1993, show a marked deterioration of the wreck, says Eaton. Dr Kentley
thinks there may be as little as 10 years left to continue work on the hull
before it disintegrates.
RMS and its backers are keen to raise more material from the wreck. However,
even if a sudden deterioration was to halt work, enough has been raised to
create a powerful reminder of the fate of the Titanic, and any other vessel
and its crew which underestimate the power of the sea. The exhibition, says
Dr Kentley: 'Is a timely reminder that the sea signs no treaties.'
The Wreck of the Titanic. Until April 2, 1995.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Tales from London's rebuilt riverbank: Peter Marsh went for
a walk in Docklands and found a world transformed. But have the changes been
for the better?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This summer I was given an unusual assignment: to design a series of walks
through London's formerly derelict dock sites. The commission came from the
London Docklands Development Corporation which believes tourism can lift the
Docklands economy. 'The trouble is that when visitors get here, they often
don't have a clue as to which bits are worth seeing: you'll change that,' I
was told.
In the past decade, a forest of office and housing blocks has sprung up from
the relics of London's old docks. For 150 years until the 1960s, the area
was one of Britain's industrial hubs. In the 1930s its docks and associated
businesses employed 100,000 people. In the aftermath of the docks' closure
in the 1970s the area became a wasteland, but in recent years it has been
transformed. Not everyone believes this change has been for the better.
I called on Sir Peter Levene, chairman of Canary Wharf, Docklands' Pounds
1.5bn flagship development. It has 5m sq ft of office space. Its 800ft high
tower, the tallest in Britain, contains enough marble to cover a soccer
pitch. Sir Peter looked out of his 30th-storey office and said: 'Fifteen
years ago Docklands was a dump. Now it feels like a district of central
London and it's a wonderful place to work.'
John Fox, a 37-year-old sculptor, is less upbeat. On the balcony of his 19th
floor flat in the unattractive local-authority Barkantine estate, Fox said:
'I've lived here 11 years and watched something new go up virtually every
day. A lot of the architecture has been execrable. The developers tried to
build a new Jerusalem, but they've created a monument to themselves. What
the local people have got out of it is questionable.'
In 1985, the corporation talked airily about its plans: 'Docklands will be
rare among new developments in post-war Britain for having industry and
commerce, housing and leisure facilities, co-existing instead of being kept
apart. In consequence local people will be able to live, work and play in
the same area. The sterility of so many developments elsewhere . . . will
have no place in Docklands.'
The corporation was established as a Thatcherite vehicle two years after the
former Conservative leader took power. It effectively became a monster
estate agent, buying land either from the private sector or from public
authorities and selling it to the highest bidder. It hoped the area would be
transformed by private money and the laws of the market. The inflows of
wealth would trickle down to the existing population, with new and old
interacting harmoniously.
Using a mixture of tax concessions, loose planning controls and unbridled
hype, the corporation has levered Pounds 6bn of private investment into the
area for a public outlay, according to the corporation's figures, of Pounds
1.6bn. But little has trickled down. The harmony has turned out to be
discordant.
The gleaming Canary Wharf is one leitmotiv of Docklands, but another is
Beckton Gasworks, on the eastern fringe of the area. Once the world's
biggest gas plant, Beckton is now half demolished, a surrealist array of
vast concrete blocks leaning at crazy angles and sitting on land grossly
contaminated by industrial chemicals. Although plans exist to turn the land
into a retail and industrial park, the site is effectively abandoned. Market
forces are powerless to bring it into the 21st century.
The brave new Docklands world has turned out to be a mish-mash of ideas and
experiences, a mixture of ambition and alienation, achievement and angst,
City slickers jumbled with Clockwork Orange. The area has been changed
without a lot of thought for the people living there. The changes have been
all the more difficult for those residents of the Isle of Dogs, a wedge of
land trapped in a loop of the Thames, who have lived there since before the
redevelopment.
The people here, mostly former dockers or industrial workers and their
families, and comprising probably about a tenth of Dockland's total 65,000
population, have a peculiar insularity. The Isle is cut off both
geographically and socially. It has been a recruiting ground for the racist
British National Party.
'The Docklands dream was sold to these people on the basis that they would
benefit,' said Nick Holtam, vicar of Christchurch on the Isle of Dogs. 'A
lot of them feel let down.'
Such sentiments are evident on the 1960s Samuda Estate, a group of
local-authority blocks about a mile from Canary Wharf. Housing officers know
of at least three drug dealers on the estate. Muggings and car thefts are
common. Millions of pounds are needed for improvements such as electrical
rewiring and replacing worn-out concrete.
Brian Poole, a Docklands resident for 17 years, sat in his sparsely
furnished maisonette on the estate and said: 'The new developments have
passed the local people by. They've brought in a lot of yuppies, people with
mobile phones and Filofaxes who have nothing in common with the area. As for
jobs, I hardly know of anyone who's benefited.'
Another long-term resident paused while fishing in the Thames, putting down
his can of beer long enough to gesture towards Canary Wharf: 'It's all shit.
I wish the IRA would blow it up.'
Many of the Thames-side views and those of the old docks are magnificent but
a lot of the buildings are a messy jumble, in keeping with the unplanned way
in which the docks have evolved since the first were dug early last century.
In 1879, Joseph Conrad described Docklands as a 'a thing grown up, not
made', whose buildings were 'confused, varied and impenetrable'.
The area buzzes with entrepreneurial activity. More than 2,000 companies
operate work in Docklands, double the number 10 years ago. Recent incomers
include blue chip names such as Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse First Boston
and Texaco. But there is disagreement over how many new jobs have been
created since 1981.
The corporation says this is 28,000, doubling the area's jobs total. Critics
such as the Docklands Forum, an umbrella group of local community
organisations, point out that most of these 'new' jobs - which have been
predominantly white-collar - have been relocations from elsewhere. Allowing
for job imports and those lost as traditional industries closed, the net
number of new work places in Docklands may only be a few thousand.
Also contentious is how many local people have filled the new employment
places: no one knows the exact figure, but it is unlikely to be more than
2,000. Unemployment in Docklands is around 20 per cent, well above the
average for London.
Michael Pickard, since 1992 the corporation's chairman, acknowledged the
frustration of many local people but said it is difficult to tackle this
while many 'have difficulty leaping the educational barrier to white collar
jobs'. The corporation has put Pounds 13m into local training projects over
the past seven years to supplement the efforts of other agencies.
Critics say the corporation's efforts on training have been too little, too
late - and that it has put insufficient resources into attracting light
industrial jobs more directly suited to locals. But there are success
stories. Tammy Read is 17 and has lived on the Isle of Dogs since she was
five. Ever since she saw Canary Wharf go up, she wanted to work there 'but I
never thought I was bright enough'. Helped by a secretarial course, she now
works there as an office clerk for Drake &amp; Scull, a big engineering
contractor. 'It's a dream come true,' she said.
Janice Devereux, another local who is contracts co-ordinator at Encom, a TV
and telecommunications company on the Isle of Dogs, said many residents take
too rosy a view of the past. 'In the 1960s we had the docks and nothing
else. What's happened has been for the better.' Sharon Smith, an 'islander'
who three years ago set up A &amp; B Couriers, a delivery service, said:
'Sitting back and moaning doesn't get you anywhere.'
As for the new wave of Docklands employers, Peter Corfield, a director of
advertising agency Ogilvy and Mather and chairman of the 600-member
Docklands Business Club, said more of them will take on locals as they
become more established in the area. But Genny Sutcliffe, placement officer
at the Docklands information technology centre, a training agency funded by
the corporation and central government, said too few of the new employers
had tried to understand the school leavers who passed through her centre.
'Not enough of them seem to realise we're an East End training agency rather
than an extension of Roedean (the girls' public school),' she said.
Physically and socially, Docklands is a long way from fulfilling some of the
early visions. It may take a decade more for the area to gel. 'We've seen
the start of physical regeneration, but social regeneration will take a lot
longer,' said one corporation official.
Ted Johns, a former Labour councillor, is a critic of the corporation. But
he remains optimistic that the area will come alive: 'We've been hit by a
maelstrom; it's been a bit like the Blitz. But we're dusting ourselves down
and will carry on - we are that kind of people.'
Peter Wade, an ex-docker and, since 1988, community relations manager for
Canary Wharf, said: 'I grew up in the docks but I can't keep the attention
of my grandchildren in ships for more than two minutes. We've got to adapt
to the new industries - that's the future.'

FT  26 NOV 94 / Minding Your Own Business: The worries of organic growth -
Nicholas Lander meets a woman who gave up commuting to sell meat from her
spare bedroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In August 1991, after 10 successful years in sales and marketing, Diane
Glass decided she needed a change. At the end of a working week she went out
and spent Pounds 4,500 on a customer mailing list and a large fridge /
freezer. These, she said, were her passport out of commuting.
These were the assets of Meat Matters a company that had been founded the
year before by two of Glass's neighbours, mothers concerned about the
quality of the British meat they could buy for their children. BES, 'mad cow
disease', was rife. It seemed to them that the most practical and obvious
solution was to establish a link between producers of safe, organic meat and
interested, concerned customers such as their families and friends.
Meat Matters initially did not develop beyond a hobby and when one of the
founders decided to move out of London the business was put up for sale.
Glass, who had worked for Burton Group, as manageress of Top Shop in
London's Oxford Street and as account director with design company Fitch,
heard about the sale on a Friday night, visited the owners and bought it the
next day.
By the week before Christmas 1993, Glass realised that she had built up a
substantial business. That week accounts for 14 per cent of the company's
annual turnover. To meet all of her customers' orders, Glass, four months
pregnant with her third child, seconded Mel, her husband, from his computer
business. They spent three days and two nights without sleep packing and
delivering orders. Glass hopes that, with better planning, she can avoid a
repetition of such 'organised chaos' this year when she will be delivering
at least 250 organic white, bronze and Norfolk black turkeys.
On the Monday after she bought the company, Glass sat down and started
calling round her mailing list. 'My previous experience in sales and
marketing came in useful. Running a shop instilled in me a respect for
customers. Working later in direct sales ensured that I didn't become
despondent even after making 50 calls without making a sale.'
Gradually, the business grew and Glass's week fell into a pattern. Most of
Saturday and Sunday were spent on the phone, pursuing orders: Mondays were
spent assembling the orders, and Tuesdays collating and passing them on to
the five organic farms (all approved by the Soil Association) which are her
suppliers. On Wednesday the meat arrived at her house and was repackaged. On
Thursday night and Friday, Glass delivered the orders around London. On
Friday night, 'I slumped down with a large glass of wine'.
The financial side was straightforward. There were no borrowings and few
overheads. All the meat - organic or free-range beef, pork, lamb, venison
and game - is bought on monthly credit from the farms but Glass is paid on
delivery by her customers.
The difficult task is convincing the customer to buy, particularly for the
first time. 'Putting out price lists simply doesn't work because organic
meat bred without additives is necessarily more expensive than meat bred on
intensive factory farming methods.
'Also most people are used to buying meat over the counter where they can
see it. I have to vary my sales pitch each week, build up a relationship
over the phone with all my customers, which I enjoy enormously.'
In 1992 a competitor, Natural Foods, collapsed and Glass was able to buy its
mailing list for Pounds 500 which immediately doubled her turnover. Over the
past three years turnover has risen steadily from Pounds 58,000 to Pounds
86,000 to its current Pounds 122,000 maintaining an 18 per cent gross profit
margin.
At first, Meat Matters was based in the Glass's bedroom on a spare table
with a separate phone line and answering machine. By the beginning of 1994
it had outgrown the Glass household and Glass struck up a working
relationship with a local butcher. He takes all the deliveries into his shop
and prepares the orders to Meat Matters' specifications. This allows Glass
to buy larger cuts of meat which means some savings. In turn, Glass pays the
butcher Pounds 200 per week if weekly sales are more than Pounds 2,000 or 8
per cent of sales if they are less than Pounds 2,000.
This means large refrigerated lorries no longer arrive in Glass's street.
'My neighbours have been very supportive. Only one complained, quite
understandably, when a delivery arrived at 5.30am just before Christmas,'
she said.
Customers' orders are delivered by four part-time drivers - two actors, a
nanny and a student - which leaves Glass free to make the phone calls and
plan the company's future and her family's weekends.
'We tried to broaden our customer base last year by taking on two agents in
Oxford and Twickenham but this proved a costly mistake.
'I'm against advertising because it isn't effective for what we sell. London
has the right number of well-informed customers but delivering to them all
on time is a major problem.'
The success of Meat Matters has changed the way the family lives. 'Weekends
are a nightmare as I find it difficult to switch off and this is when I must
call my customers. But I do get to spend half terms and holidays with the
children which I didn't before. And I love selling meat that is safe and
good for my customers and, above all, I love being my own boss.'

It was a Jesuit priest who introduced me to the art of frequent flying.
'Wear a dog collar,' he declared one Sunday from the pulpit of the Church of
the Holy Redeemer in Chelsea. 'It can work miracles.'
As one who has flown more than 150,000 miles in the past year, I know what
he means. Wearing the cloth is only one of many ways to persuade the world's
airlines to offer an upgrade to an improved class. A word of warning,
however. Not everyone welcomes a priest in the first-class cabin.
Dom Anthony Sutch, a Benedictine monk from Downside Abbey in Somerset, had
settled comfortably into his first-class seat in full monastic robes,
sipping champagne and tucking into the caviar en route to Hong Kong with
Cathay Pacific Airways.
'You hypocrite,' said a loud Australian next to him.
'No,' he replied. 'I had an economy ticket but was upgraded because my
brother Peter is the chairman of the airline.'
'You are a liar as well as a hypocrite,' snapped the Aussie.
Frequent flyers have all had to develop their own techniques to survive the
rigours of modern air travel. But they are having to sharpen their skills
because air travel is set to become even more confusing as airlines adapt to
huge changes in their market.
Aviation is in a state of revolution as the industry struggles to achieve
profitability and adapt to forces of competition brought on by
liberalisation and the evolution of a once elitist mode of travel into a
mass transport system. Last year, more than 1.25bn people travelled by air.
The industry expects the number to double by 2005.
On the ground, many big airports are already saturated. Since the
construction of a new airport takes up to 30 years (for example, Munich
which opened last year), some of the busiest airports such as Heathrow or
Frankfurt may eventually be forced to turn airlines away.
In the air, the congestion is just as bad. Unless traffic control systems in
Europe and other parts of the world can be modernised fairly soon, many of
the world's busiest air lanes will find it hard to cope with the expected
5-6 per cent a year growth in traffic.
It all adds up to more delays for passengers and heavier costs for airlines,
which have accumulated losses of Dollars 15.6bn during the last four years
on their international scheduled services alone. Although business is
picking up, this year's, profits are expected to be less than 1 per cent of
the industry's turnover.
While traffic is rising again, competition is holding down fares and
passenger yields. As the business traveller has traditionally subsidised the
majority of people who fly economy, airlines have had to offer increasingly
complex inducements to lure them into their aircraft. But they have had to
go further. To fill their aircraft, they have had to extend these offers to
the bulk of their economy passengers. Each carrier wants to fill every last
seat on its craft, almost at any price, but on the other hand to maximise
overall profits. These conflicting pressures yield increasing opportunities
for alert passengers, but plenty of pitfalls as well.
All big airlines, even those which were at first reluctant, have had to
introduce frequent flyer loyalty programmes for business travellers; many
are improving their airport lounge facilities with showers, business centres
and, in some cases, fitness centres and swimming pools; others offer free
limousine services to airports, luggage pick-up or drop-off services, and
valet parking at airports.
These incentives, especially for high fare paying passengers, are likely to
multiply because airlines expect that only a fifth of passengers will be
travelling in premium class cabins by the turn of the century. But you need
to develop the eye of a detective to make the most of these offers. The
inducements vary greatly from airline to airline, and many carriers will
volunteer to tell passengers what benefits they can claim only if asked.
British Airways, for example, offers generous free air miles for passengers
flying across the North Atlantic, where one of the fiercest battles for
market share is being waged between European and US carriers. But on other
routes, the number of free miles is much smaller. A full fare paying economy
passenger flying from London to San Francisco receives 750 free miles. If he
flies to Hong Kong he gets 125.
Such schemes have helped airlines win business but they are now in danger of
becoming a serious embarrassment. Several million seats are now thought to
be covered by frequent flyer schemes. If everyone were to take up their
entitlements, the industry would be in deep trouble.
Airlines, however, calculate that many people who have accumulated free
miles and other bonuses, will never take them up. At present, the redemption
rate is around 30-40 per cent, and airlines believe they are safe provided
they budget for about 20 per cent more. But there is a dangerous precedent.
The troubles of Pan Am in the late 1980s were severely aggravated by the
high proportion of passengers taking up free flight entitlements from its
bonus programme. The famous airline ultimately went bust.
To some extent, the industry has learnt its lesson. Many of the incentives
now offered are designed to encourage people not to take them up. Many
airlines have set a time limit (on average two years) for the redemption of
free miles. Many impose restrictions on when you can fly, to avoid swamping
their system with free seats. They are also increasingly offering passengers
alternative benefits such as sending free bouquets of flowers, reduced car
hire rates, free hotel rooms and other gifts.
The development of big computer reservation systems, providing carriers with
up-to-the-minute information on the booking situation of any flight at any
time on any day, and the growing freedom to set fares is also forcing
consumers to keep a tight watch on prices. Airlines call it yield
management. It means they can adjust prices, especially in the high volume
economy cabin, to match demand. As a result, economy class fares in Europe
can vary by Pounds 100-Pounds 150 on any given route. On long haul flights,
the variations are even more pronounced.
'If you have time, it pays to shop around,' advises an Air France official.
'By making a few telephone calls, you can find very attractive deals with
airlines as well as bucket shops.'
The airline scramble for market share has produced another phenomenon:
over-booking. It was originally a product of the aviation boom of the late
1980s and disappeared as the industry went into recession after the Gulf
War. But with the recovery, it is making a comeback. Although airlines are
now forced to compensate any confirmed passengers who are denied boarding,
some deliberately continue to flaunt the industry's 'good airline practices'
in an effort to pick up market share.
Any passenger with a confirmed ticket who risks being bumped off an
overbooked flight should stand his ground in the check-in line. Airline
staff will try to persuade passengers to step aside to sort out the problem
to avoid delaying the entire check-in process. Those who agree will miss
their flight. Those who make a fuss will get a seat, usually with an
upgrade.
Liberalisation, globalisation and consolidation in the industry have other
implications for passengers. For the past few years, airlines have all been
jostling to form alliances, buy equity stakes in each other, and to form
commercial partnerships to extend their global reach and market penetration.
The prevailing trend has been code sharing agreements. Bob Crandall, the
chairman of American Airlines, the world's biggest carrier, describes these
deals as 'the great deception'. Code sharing enables two airlines to use
their ticket codes on each other's flights. A passenger may think he is
flying BA all the way from London to Cincinatti because his ticket says so,
but he might be changing aircraft in Pittsburg and continue his journey on
USAir, BA's financially troubled American partner. What you expect from BA
is not what you may get from USAir.
Technology is also continuing to change the nature of air travel. Jet legs
are getting longer. New Airbus and Boeing airliners can fly non-stop for 15
hours or more, and the manufacturers are already studying the development of
800-1,000 seat double-deck super jumbo aircraft, which could transform long
distance air travel into an extended city rush-hour crush. How are you going
to make 16-hour non-stop journeys bearable? Airlines are already developing
new high-tech entertainment systems including electronic gambling and
multi-channel videos.
Richard Branson pioneered the idea of bringing back a sense of fun to air
travel when he started his airline 10 years ago. He introduced first class
travel at business class prices, an extensive library of in-flight
entertainment, in-flight massages, the possibility of ordering a suit just
before taking off in London to be ready on arrival in Hong Kong, and,
according to some of his stewardesses, the tradition of giving a resounding
send off to any passengers graduating to the 'mile high club'; those who
succumb to the sexual arousement long flights are said to provoke.
That is Virgin's special style, but its bigger airline rivals are also
adapting to the new demands of long distance travellers. It is no longer
just a question of price and comfort. It is also the introduction of what
British Airways calls a sense of well-being in the skies by becoming more
conscious of the health needs of passengers.
For the future super jumbos, BA has already drawn up plans to include
lounges and gyms, even possibly a swimming pool on board. Airbus has also
been working on designs for its proposed A3XX jumbo with self catering
cafeteria-style facilities on board to avoid the problem for the crew of
feeding up to 1,000 passengers.
Mass air transport is not only becoming a logistical headache for consumers
but a health hazard. This is not because modern jets are dangerous (they are
far safer than road or rail transport), but because hours spent crossing
time zones in a cramped cabin with the same oxygen level as Mexico City is
bad for you.
Just like pilots, passengers are having to monitor much more carefully what
they eat, drink and do on long trips. And airlines are already adapting
their in-flight service to respond to the new health issues raised by modern
jet transport. They are increasingly offering lighter meals and introducing
more long distance non-smoking flights despite the risk of losing business
in some markets.
In adding leisure facilities to their aircraft, airlines are also responding
to research which suggests that it is a waste of time to work on a long
flight. Studies by the Royal Air Force have shown that it is difficult to
concentrate and to assimilate many new facts on a long haul flight. Jet lag
is also known to cause loss of efficiency on arrival, and has led many
businessmen, politicians and diplomats to make serious errors of judgment
straight after a long journey.
John Foster Dulles, the late US Secretary of State, admitted just before he
died to a critical mistake that probably led to the 1956 Suez crisis because
of jet lag. Immediately after returning to Washington from a Middle East
diplomatic shuttle, he learnt of President Nasser's agreement to buy arms
from the Soviet Union. Tired and angry, he decided to cancel a big loan for
the Aswan dam project in Upper Egypt. The Suez conflict followed with the
subsequent nationalisation of the Suez canal and war with Egypt.

FT  26 NOV 94 / All present and correct: Why we abandon restraint in the use
of language at our peril
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To be politically correct may be good for us, in small doses. This
observation is not conventional. What we are supposed to say about the pc
tendency is something like 'cannot stand them' or 'the trouble with lesbians
. . .' or 'beware the new censorship' or 'this is stultifying orthodoxy' or,
mostly, 'yeugh'.
It is too simple. When good liberal folk like you and me consider who is
decidedly against pc, we begin to see some merit in it. Some of the antis
are particularly twitchy. Their knees jerk so far to the Right they look
like one of the bent-metal nudes that won the Turner prize this week. Can we
walk with such individuals? We should think hard before taking any such
step.
Our starting text is the memorandum prepared by John Maples for the
Conservative party and leaked to the FT this week. It cites 'distrust of
politically correct, liberal minded 'do-gooders'' as 'the main reason not to
vote Labour'.
This glowering suspicion was measured by qualitative survey research into
the opinions of 80 subjects of the Queen who voted Conservative in April
1992 but who now say they might or would not. Who are these people?
According to their general range of views they are right-wing Tories, shock
troops for Michael Portillo or Alf Garnett. They say the same sort of thing
as do the natural authoritarians identified in the British Social Attitudes
survey described here last Saturday. They may reflect the opinions of as
much as 40 per cent of the electorate.
These are in no way pc. Respondents to the Maples memorandum expressed 'very
right wing views on crime and immigration, deep disapproval of 'scrounging'
on social security' and 'deep fear of 'loony lefties''. These are mists and
fog patches in which lurk hangers and floggers, xenophobes and homophobes,
putative bullies who tremble in fear at changes they do not understand in a
world they do not like. We broad-minded cosmopolitans must take care. The
party that meets their dreams would probably sweep the country.
Or would it? On Thursday Patrick Nicholls was forced to resign as
vice-chairman of the Conservatives. The MP for Teignmouth had made an error.
In an article in the Western Morning News he described the French as 'a
nation of collaborators', the Germans as 'warmongers' and lesser members of
the European Community as 'beggars'. Mr Nicholls misjudged the level of
bigotry to which it is safe to descend in print. He offended Conservative
political correctness.
Other famous Tories have done the same. Enoch Powell lost his place in the
Conservative party following his 'rivers of blood' speech. The late Nicholas
Ridley had to leave the cabinet after writing an article in The Spectator
magazine in which he expressed views of the Germans with which Mr Nicholls
might well have concurred. This week the same journal carries a letter
accusing its editors of being unable to distinguish between 'racist cant'
and 'thoughtful commentary'.
It is signed by 15 luminaries of the film world, including Kevin Kostner,
Kirk Douglas, Charlton Heston, Frank Mancuso, Steven Spielberg, Barbra
Streisand . . . you name a name, it is there. The 15 object to a recent
article by William Cash in which he asserted that most of the members of
Hollywood's 'New Establishment' were Jews. The editor says that Mr Cash's
use of the word 'cabal' was 'unfortunate', but has otherwise published a
prolonged defence of the original piece. In passing, he observes that two
years ago Mr Ferdinand Mount, editor of the Times Literary Supplement, wrote
that he had found, in The Spectator, articles 'of an astonishing sourness
attacking the Italians, the French (twice), the Swiss, the Greeks, the
Poles, the Russians, the Germans . . .'
I am not surprised. The Spectator is a stimulating current affairs weekly,
not to be missed, if only for its cartoons. I always pick it up first, yet
over the years I have felt the same unease as has Mr Mount. The house
journal of the British right sometimes appears not to comprehend that there
is indeed a potential connection between verbal disparagement and actual
discrimination. Freedom to say what you like, which I would defend with the
best of them, does not absolve any of us of the need to consider the
possible consequences of our remarks.
This is not to say that we should all now become absolutely politically
correct. Never. The phrase embraces most of the manifestations of
contemporary social ferment, including militant feminism, coercive campaigns
against smokers, an illiterate rejection of works by 'dead white European
males', and absurd attempts to tailor the English language. You would have
to be very intellectually challenged to swallow even a tenth of it.
Yet the motivations of moderate purveyors of pc are not always malign. In
Johannesburg in the 1950s there was much debate among white editors about
what to call black South Africans. Your political position was defined by
whether you preferred the derogatory 'kaffir', the condescending 'native',
apartheid's 'bantu' or the civilised 'African'. The history of the spread of
white acceptance of blacks as equals may be traced in the dwindling usage of
the three offensive words. In the course of his lifetime, Nelson Mandela has
been called all four.
The women's movement could doubtless produce a similar analysis of the
etymological history of the feminine gender. Disabled and handicapped
individuals may likewise attest that crude terminology represents the
thinking of an unkinder age. I do not propose excessive virtue here. The
transference of phrases once confined to lavatory walls to the front of
printed T-shirts is an example of what happens when restraint is abandoned.
Such obscenity is tedious. But language that assaults groups can be lethal.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Ivory and Sime plans to reorganise trust: High dividends cut
British Assets' reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ivory and Sime, the Edinburgh-based fund manager, yesterday proposed a
reorganisation of its flagship investment trust, British Assets Trust, whose
income has been insufficient to pay the high dividends promised to
investors.
Under the plan some shareholders will forgo dividends for seven years in
return for the right to buy more shares at a special price. Ivory and Sime
will also reorganise the assets of another investment trust it manages,
Investors Capital Trust.
British Assets, which owns 36 per cent of ICT, will sell its stake. Together
the two trusts have nearly Pounds 1bn in assets, about a quarter of all
Ivory and Sime's investment trust assets under management.
'Ivory and Sime has been the investment manager over the past 10 years and
is not entirely free of blame. Performance has not been up to par,' said Mr
Colin Hook, managing director designate at Ivory and Sime.
Earlier this month, British Assets, which has about 60,000 shareholders,
said its net asset value had fallen 7.6 per cent to 102p per share for the
year to end September. In that time, the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share Index
rose 0.3 per cent.
Mr Hook said the directors of both trusts had considered sacking Ivory and
Sime, but had reconsidered after management changes. It is expected that the
chairman of British Assets, Mr Roger Inglis, will step down.
British Assets's charter promises investors it will pay dividends each year
which outstrip above the rate of inflation. In the event, British Assets has
only been able to keep its dividend promise to shareholders by eating into
reserves.
'We are now down to about 47 per cent cover (reserves over dividend expense)
and it would only be a matter of time before our reserves are depleted,'
said Mr Richard Muckert, newly appointed fund manager.
Under the proposals, 16 per cent of shareholders must agree to receive no
dividends for seven years by converting some of their ordinary shares to a
new class of 'growth share'.
Each growth share will come with five warrants, entitling the investor to
buy new ordinary shares in seven years at a price equal to British Assets'
net asset value at the reorganisation date.
Those who retain ordinary shares can expect dividend growth to continue as
promised.
Institutional shareholders have already indicated their intention to take up
at least 16 per cent of the new shares.
However, the proposals cannot be adopted unless 75 per cent of shareholders
attending an extraordinary general meeting next month vote in favour.
British Assets shares closed yesterday at 94p, up 1.5p on the day, after 22m
shares changed hands in heavy trading. The shares are trading at a discount
of 7 per cent to net asset value.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Goldman Sachs wins key role in Telekom sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER and MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German government yesterday named German and US banks to head the DM15bn
(Pounds 6.2bn) sale of shares in state-owned Deutsche Telekom, setting the
stage for one of the world's biggest equity issues.
Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the postal minister, ended weeks of waiting with the
announcement that Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, would join Deutsche
Bank and Dresdner Bank as joint leaders of the global issuing consortium
after intense speculation over which foreign bank would play the most
prominent role.
With fees of about DM400m involved in the partial privatisation - a quarter
of the group's shares will be sold in the first tranche early in 1996 - the
issue attracted interest from 22 foreign banks.
They were screened at a 'beauty contest' in Bonn where they made
presentations to government and Deutsche Telekom officials in September.
Goldman Sachs was considered the favourite, because of its performance in
the contest, its telecommunications knowledge and its work with Deutsche
Telekom on acquisitions. But other banks, notably Merrill Lynch of the US,
were also in the running. European banks lobbied hard for a British bank to
be a co-leader.
UK investors are expected to take up to DM3bn of the issue and the US market
about the same. SG Warburg, the London-based investment bank, will head the
UK consortium, while the US group leadership will be shared by Goldman
Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Merrill Lynch.
Deutsche Bank was given a more prominent role than many bankers expected,
since it will be spokesman for the global consortium. It will also head the
bookbuilding operation in which investment demand is assessed and the issue
price worked out. 'This takes the investment banking activities of Deutsche
Bank a huge step further,' said Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, a director.
The German bank surprised the financial community a month ago by deciding to
locate its main investment banking activities in London, where it owns
Morgan Grenfell, the UK investment house. It said the Deutsche Telekom share
sale would make a strong contribution to the German financial market and the
development of an equity culture.
Up to DM9bn of the issue by Deutsche Telekom, the largest telecommunications
concern in Europe, will be sold to German investors. The company also
intends to list shares on Wall Street, making the choice of a US bank as
joint global manager almost inevitable.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Lira falls to fresh low over concern on pension reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The lira fell to a record low against the D-Mark yesterday on fears the
Italian government had given way to union demands on pension reform in order
to head off a general strike planned for next Friday.
There was also increased nervousness about the plight of Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the prime minister, who is due to be interrogated - probably
this weekend - by Milan magistrates about alleged corruption while he ran
his Fininvest business empire.
Mr Berlusconi discussed the options open to himself and his embattled
government in a frosty meeting with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro
yesterday. The prime minister's supporters claim the president is seeking to
accelerate Mr Berlusconi's downfall and replace him with a government of
national salvation.
Despite progress during a meeting on Thursday between the government and the
unions, the union leadership yesterday refused to call off the eight-hour
stoppage. The unions were confident the increasingly weak rightwing
coalition would make the concessions necessary to let them call off the
strike.
A negotiating session is scheduled for Wednesday. This would follow a
cabinet meeting called to ensure all partners in the coalition are ready to
back the final parliamentary passage of the 1995 budget. Mr Scalfaro is
understood yesterday to have insisted on the need to pass the budget before
any government crisis comes to a head, and to avoid instability through a
clash with the unions.
The concessions centre on removing pension reform proposals from the budget
and finding alternative sources of revenue. However, financial markets were
concerned that by treating the issue of pension reform separately the budget
would be weakened and the eventual reform could be watered down. The lira
slipped to L1,039 against the D-Mark in late Milan trade compared with
Thursday's L1,035.
The prime minister's position was further weakened yesterday because of his
failure to obtain a public declaration of support for himself and his
government from Mr Scalfaro. Mr Berlusconi had to deny instead that he was
not 'at war' with the president.
Also yesterday, newspapers published leaks from an impending decision of the
constitutional court on the legality of the 1990 law on television
ownership. The court was reported to have concluded that Mr Berlusconi's
ownership of three commercial channels was unconstitutional. If so, the
media magnate turned premier would have to divest at least one channel by
1996.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Deutsche Telekom privatisation will be big in many ways, not least in
the size of the fees the investment banks involved in the deal expect to
collect. But how is one to explain the astonishing DM450m (Pounds 180m) fee
'pot' being talked about? Is it the reward for thousands of hours hard work
by an army of highly-paid bankers, analysts and salesmen? Or is it a
reflection of imperfect competition in the supply of global equity
distribution services?
The answer is probably a mixture of both. Certainly, the work put in by
scores of banks on large deals like Telekom is mammoth. Banks also need to
invest big sums in building a distribution infrastructure that gives them
global reach. On the other hand, the international primary distribution
business is, by all accounts, extremely profitable. If competition were
functioning effectively, one would expect price-cutting to reduce fees.
There are two reasons why this does not happen. First, the industry is an
oligopoly: only a handful of banks can arrange global distribution, with the
rest providing local feeder networks. Second, though banks fight fiercely
for new business, they compete on the quality of their distribution networks
rather than their fees. Surely it is better, they tell clients, to receive
the maximum sales price for their equity through excellent distribution than
skimp on the commission but receive lower overall proceeds. Few clients are
able to resist such sales patter.
Still, the banks may not have it all their way this time round. The German
finance ministry has already indicated that it intends to drive a hard
bargain on fees. Such is the prestige of being involved in the Telekom deal
that few banks would be willing to drop out, however low the commissions.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sentiment has buffeted the London stock market all week. In the first half,
the plunge on Wall Street caused the damage - though it is hard to argue
that British equities are overvalued. The ratio between bond and equity
yields is actually below its average since 1970. Since Thursday, the market
has been dogged by political worries. Again, sentiment rather than logic has
been decisive. Not only is it highly unlikely that Mr John Major will be
defeated in a leadership challenge; even if he were, it is not obvious why
the market should care.
Next week sentiment could move in the other direction. True, political
rumblings will continue, until it is clear that Mr Major is home and dry on
Wednesday. But provided Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, can make himself
heard above the din, he should have good news for the markets when he
presents the Budget on Tuesday. He should be able to cut his forecast for
next year's public-sector borrowing requirement to Pounds 24bn or less. That
should be positive for gilts, with equities benefiting in their wake.
Investors are already giving the government some credit for its responsible
monetary policy; a convincing statement of fiscal policy would reinforce its
standing among international investors, particularly given the parlous state
of many other governments' finances.
The real worry is not next week's but next year's Budget. Mr Major will be
tempted to agree a high-spending, tax-cutting Budget to sweeten voters just
before the next general election. But it is not clear that it would be in Mr
Clarke's interest to compromise his reputation for fiscal responsibility.
The more he can reassure investors on Tuesday about 1995 the better.

FT  26 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Yorkshire pudding
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Leeds Permanent Building Society has proved a misnomer. If its proposed
merger with the Halifax is completed, it will no longer be based in Leeds,
it will cease to be a building society and its name will have proved less
than permanent. The reasons for this extraordinary move, which will
eventually create a bank with assets of Pounds 90bn, are not hard to fathom.
The mortgage market is being forced to rationalise as building societies
struggle with low volumes of new business. Their problems have been
compounded by ever keener competition from the banks.
Halifax and Leeds claim the merger should provide the combined group with
sufficient size to compete successfully. But size for size's sake is
nonsense, and it is disturbing that both institutions play down the scope
for rationalisation. They insist, for example, that both headquarters will
be kept, redundancies will be voluntary and branches will be maintained. The
societies' managements should be mindful of the dangers of failing to cut
costs: when the Nationwide and Anglia merged in 1987, there was little
rationalisation for several years and consequently a poor return on assets.
Members should not become overly concerned about the end of mutual status.
For one thing, they will profit personally from the transformation of the
societies to a public limited company, as they will receive equity in the
new bank. Management, faced with the disciplines of running a quoted group,
could hardly prove less accountable than at present. The business may
benefit too. The switch in status will allow Halifax to raise funds from
wholesale markets more easily to fill the gap created by the deceleration in
the growth of deposit-taking. But more freedom will bring greater risks: the
last time societies were given greater freedom, they charged into estate
agency with disastrous consequences. So the new shareholders will have to
keep management on a tight rein.
Even if members agree to the marriage it may not necessarily be consummated.
The merger must clear some tough regulatory hurdles, not least of which is
the Office of Fair Trading. Last year the combined group would have had
nearly 23 per cent of the UK mortgage market. However, given the few
barriers to entering the mortgage market and the opportunities for new
distribution methods such as direct selling by telephone, the group's market
share should not prove problematic.
Once the group has been floated with an expected market capitalisation of
Pounds 8bn-Pounds 9bn, it should become a formidable competitor. That will
place additional pressure on banks and building societies. A series of
further financial earthquakes can be expected in the UK, emulating either
this latest deal, or Lloyds Bank's takeover of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money: Why Wall Street lost its balance - Perhaps
the only puzzle is that it did not happen sooner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With one foot on firm economic ground and the other on a drifting bond
market, Wall Street finally lost its balance and took a ducking this week.
The only puzzle, perhaps, is that it did not happen two or three months ago.
Regular readers will know that I have been pursuing two or three distinct
but connected capital market themes for most of this year. Wall Street's
correction takes the story into a new chapter.
One regular theme has been the worrying imbalance between the yields on
fixed-interest bonds and equities as bonds worldwide have plunged into a
severe bear market but stock markets have been reluctant to follow. Wall
Street has stood out as a gravity-defying phenomenon: at the beginning of
this week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was still showing a gain of 2
per cent on the year thus far.
A second strand has been the impact of rising US short-term interest rates
on the dollar bond market which, by the beginning of this year, was inflated
dangerously by credit-financed speculation and massive positions in
derivatives.
At the beginning of February, US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan
said he would cease pumping up the financial economy with cheap 3 per cent
credit, and would raise short-term interest rates progressively to a normal
level. So far, he has got to 5 1/2 per cent and, with the US economy still
booming, plainly he has not finished yet. Bonds have been weak all year as
the leveraged positions have been unwound, and the recent drift up in the US
Treasury 30-year bond yield from 8.0 to 8.2 per cent has finally cracked in
the equity market.
Third, international flows of funds have been following a perverse pattern.
Long-term investors around the world have been refusing to finance the
extravagant habits of the Americans, reflected in a balance of payments
deficit likely to be Dollars 150bn for 1994. At the same time, Americans
have been trying to diversify their pension and mutual fund portfolios by
buying foreign equities, notably in the fashionable emerging markets of the
Far East and Latin America. This has added greatly to the overall external
capital needed to balance the US books.
The Japanese - who, obligingly, financed the US deficits in the 1980s and
lost a lot of money by doing so - have sat on their cash at home. So, the
dollar financing gap has been plugged largely through intervention by Far
Eastern central banks anxious that their currencies should not appreciate
too fast: they have been big buyers of US Treasury bonds.
Even so, the apparent one-way bet at the beginning of the year - that the
dollar would climb along with interest rates - has gone seriously wrong. The
further the dollar has fallen, the cleverer the Americans feel they are to
push money overseas, and the more reluctant are the Japanese to throw good
money after bad.
From a low point in the summer, however, some of the stock markets around
the world have tried to rally. The emerging markets, for instance, completed
their shake-out in June and, by September, the IFC index of 24 national
markets was showing a recovery of 22 per cent. Even Wall Street got back to
within about 1 per cent of its all-time high as recently as October 28. But
this second minor bubble in equities has now blown up: Hong Kong lost 4.3
per cent on Wednesday alone and even Tokyo, normally resistant to
international trends, dipped to its lowest levels since January.
Markets are being teased by the surprising strength of the global economy
which, led by the US and the Asian tigers, is heading towards growth of
something like 4 per cent. The implications for profits and dividends are
plainly good, but interest rates and inflation may go up. So, the
relationship between gilts and equities has been stretched, and this week
reached breaking point.
There is, however, something very odd about this recovery: it is not being
stimulated by bank lending. (In most countries, banks are struggling to find
new business; in the UK, for instance, the housing market is remarkably
sluggish as mortgage lending stagnates). Instead, the finance is flowing
through the capital markets. This, especially in Europe, is leading to a
lop-sided expansion, with companies full of cash but consumer spending
relatively subdued.
This absence of credit stimulation is a good reason for believing that
inflation will stay low. But there is an accompanying worry that the
recovery will be short-lived. Exports and capital investment cannot keep the
economy booming healthily on their own without buoyancy in consumer
spending.
The immediate reason for the crack in US equities might thus be that
investors cannot any longer believe that profits' growth in the next few
years will be high enough to justify the enormous income gap between shares
(yielding under 3 per cent) and government bonds (around 8 per cent).
Looking a little further out, moreover, a structural shortage of demand for
US equities seems likely to develop. As interest rates rise, mutual-fund
buyers will drift back to their normal safe haven of savings deposits (this
has already happened with bond funds). The US bond markets will continue to
absorb a disproportionate share of the available capital flows as the
national taste for borrowing collides with a low savings rate.
Eventually, money for equities will appear from somewhere: foreign buyers
will probably move back into Wall Street stocks, which they have shunned for
several years because they have been too expensive. British pension funds,
for instance, have only 4.8 per cent of their portfolios in US equities,
compared with 9.7 per cent in the Far East and 8.1 per cent in continental
Europe. But US equities will have become quite substantially cheaper before
this shift will seem attractive to foreigners.
Wall Street has taken a plunge. Now we shall see if it can swim.

FT  26 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow stages recovery in low
volume
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices reversed the declining course seen earlier in the week to
close yesterday's half-day session solidly higher in extremely light volume,
writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 33.64 at 3,708.27. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 2.36 at 452.29, while the
American Stock Exchange composite gained 2.25 at 434.65. The Nasdaq
composite was up 5.82 at 742.52. Trading volume on the NYSE came to 109m
shares.
Program trading early in the morning helped to push the market to a positive
close for the first time since November 16.
The market closed at 1 pm for the Thanksgiving holiday, after being shut on
Thursday.
US Treasury prices also reversed their previous course, holding steady after
a week of relatively steady gains. Two-year notes were flat, while the
benchmark 30-year Treasuries gained slightly.
Several cyclical stocks rebounded from losses earlier in the week. Aluminum
Company of America rose Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 80 3/8 , Allied Signal
gained Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 32 1/8 , Caterpillar was up Dollars  3/4 at
Dollars 53 3/8 , United Technologies climbed Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 56 1/2
and International Paper increased Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 69 5/8 .
Both Bankers Trust and Gibson Greeting gained on news that the two had
settled a lawsuit filed by Gibson over derivative losses.
Bankers Trust rose Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 57 1/8 and Gibson was up Dollars
1 1/8 at Dollars 13 7/8 after the companies announced an out-of-court
settlement that essentially released Gibson from Dollars 14m that it owed
the bank from two swap agreements.
The settlement put an end to the smaller of two derivatives-related suits
filed against Bankers Trust.
American Depository Re-ceipts of Sony, which are traded on the New York
Stock Exchange, rose Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 51 3/4 after Mr Akio Morita,
the chairman, announced his retirement. Sony was the first Japanese company
to have a listing on the NYSE. News that Archer-Daniels-Midland planned a
Dollars 700m expansion of an Iowa plant did not help the agribusiness giant.
Its shares fell Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 28 1/2 .
Brazil
Stock prices closed 3.8 per cent lower in thin Sao Paulo trading, dragged
down by tight liquidity, concern about small banks, and anxiety about how
President-elect Fernando Henrique Cardoso will form his cabinet.
The Bovespa index of the 55 most-active shares ended off 1,747 at 43,987.
Analysts said that stocks were depressed - the Bovespa index has dropped 8.3
per cent this month - as major domestic and foreign players were mostly out
of the market.
Venezuela
Caracas plunged across the board to a four-month low, led by panic selling
of the benchmark stock, Electricidad de Caracas. The Merinvest composite
index closed 2.85, or 2.4 per cent lower at 117.24, down nearly 20 per cent
this month.
Electricidad de Caracas tumbled 12.00 bolivars to 199.00 bolivars, down 40
per cent since October 28, as investors offloaded existing shares to
participate in a one-for-six rights issue.

FT  26 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Toronto frustrated by worldwide
shudders - But fundamentals are strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Toronto stock exchange should be booming. The mainstays of the Canadian
economy - metals, forest products and the automotive industry - are storming
ahead.
Corporate profits are climbing steeply, with many companies also boosting
dividends. Inflation is non-existent. The US Federal Reserve's latest
interest-rate hike caused only a modest hiccup in credit markets north of
the border. The brunt of the adjustment has fallen on the Canadian dollar,
giving exporters another reason to cheer.
However, the TSE has not been able to escape the shudders which have jolted
equities markets around the world. The TSE-300 index lost 66 points in the
first three days of this week. Although Thursday saw a 37-point rally, the
index, which closed at 4,085, remained 11.4 per cent below last March's
record 4,609.
Professionals are puzzled. 'When things are acting contrary to good and
valued assumptions, it's hard to find concrete reasons,' says Mr David
Mather, senior vice-president at Elliott and Page, a portfolio-management
house. 'The fundamentals for Canadian equities, especially the
resource-based stocks, are as good as they've been in a long time.'
The anomalies are glaring. Abitibi-Price earlier this month announced its
fourth newsprint price rise of the year, and the company should also benefit
from the recent slide in the Canadian dollar. But its share price has
slithered from a 1994 peak of CDollars 20.62 in late September to just over
CDollars 17.
Similarly, shares of most Canadian gold producers are lower than they were
when gold bullion was last trading around USDollars 385 an ounce.
Canadian bonds are an unusually attractive investment now. Although domestic
interest rates have not risen much in recent weeks, yields in real terms are
among the highest anywhere. The yield on 30-year government of Canada bonds,
adjusted for inflation, is at present over 9 per cent, compared with 5.25
per cent on comparable US Treasuries.
Money managers pinpoint the US bond market as the main culprit for Toronto's
equity woes. Many are nervous that the 75-basis point rise in the Fed funds
rate on November 15 will not be the last. Climbing interest rates already
threaten to brake the recovery in both the US and Canada, reverse the boom
in metals markets and choke corporate earnings. Canadian economists have
lowered their growth forecasts. Most expect that real growth will slow to
about 3.5 per cent in 1995 from 4 per cent this year.
In addition, with Canada's biggest companies listed in both Toronto and New
York, the turmoil on Wall Street has sideswiped the TSE. For instance,
Northern Telecom has lost 8 per cent of its value so far this month, closing
last Thursday at CDollars 44.88.
Most analysts remain confident that the recent slide in share prices is a
relatively brief correction. Nesbitt Burns, a Toronto-based securities
dealer, forecasts that the TSE-300 will bounce to a new record of 4,700
within the next 12 months. 'As bond yields tread water and earnings jump,
confidence should rise in both the length of the profit expansion and the
height of the cyclical peak,' says Mr Ben Joyce, Nesbitt's portfolio
strategist.
A downward push of interest rates to keep the recovery on track would
reinforce the bullish case. Mr Frank Hracs, chief economist at RBC Dominion
Securities, told an investment conference this week that 'with the onset of
the New Year, we will not be surprised to see an aggressive investor
response to interest rates that have not made fundamental sense for some
time now'.
Mr Mather favours metal and gold producers, and forest products companies,
especially those geared to pulp and newsprint. On the other hand, he has
shied away from sectors sensitive to volatile interest rates, such as
utilities.
Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion, a Montreal-based firm, says in its latest
market commentary that the outlook is brightest for the oil and gas sector.
'We believe that the market has not fully discounted a return of oil prices
above USDollars 20 a barrel in 1995 as a result of new secular demand from
the emerging countries of southern Asia and Latin America,' the firm says.
But while some analysts may see the correction as a buying opportunity, a
note of caution comes from Mr Murray Taylor, vice-president for marketing at
Great-West Life, one of Canada's biggest insurance companies which also
manages 13 investment funds.
Mr Taylor, an actuary, warns that investors - especially those without
instant access to breaking news - take a big risk by attempting to time
buy-and-sell decisions according to up-and-down bumps in the market. Average
investors have only a one-in-four chance of getting their timing right on a
simultaneous sale and purchase. The odds on being successful twice in a row
drop to about 6 per cent, according to Mr Taylor.
On the other hand, he calculates that anyone who has bought shares on the
Toronto stock exchange at any time since 1924 and has hung on to them for 30
years, would have done substantially better than investing in fixed-income
securities.
On that basis, plunging into the market now should offer far better rewards
than buying just before the big crashes of 1929 and 1987.

FT  26 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses lifted by upbeat Wall
Street return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An upbeat return by Wall Street lifted bourses in the afternoon, writes Our
Markets Staff. Mr Francois Langlade-Demoyen at CS First Boston thought that
US weakness could resume next week, and that European equities offered
better potential returns than their US counterparts.
FRANKFURT seemed short of motivation on the session, the Dax index trading
narrowly between 2057.51 and 2051.12 before closing 4.35 lower at 2,051.62,
2.4 per cent down on the week. In the afternoon, the Ibis indicated Dax
recovered to 2,056.27.
Turnover fell from DM5.1bn to DM4.5bn. There were some biggish falls in blue
chips: Henkel, lacking the charms of more cyclical chemical stocks, shed
another DM12.50 to DM564.50; VW produced its five-year review and dropped
DM9.50 to DM446.50 as analysts said that brokers' forecasts for 1995
earnings had been considerably higher than the DM890m pre-tax expected by
the carmaker.
Retailers saw more weakness, Karstadt losing DM12.50 at DM554.50 on its
bearish 1994 outlook, and Kaufhof DM6.40 at DM451.60. However, there was
brighter news among second liners, noted Mr Eckhard Frahm at Merck Finck in
Dusseldorf: Krones put on DM40 to DM900 after the engineer's UK presentation
this week; and Kampa Haus, the prefabricated housing company which had
suffered from a UK analyst's downgrade, recovered DM66 to DM895 after a
television interview with the chairman put a better view of prospects.
PARIS reversed early losses after Wall Street's opening and the CAC-40 index
eventually closed 11.21 higher at 1,945.89 for a 1 per cent gain on the week
in turnover of FFr2.8bn.
Alcatel Alsthom recovered another FFr5.40 at FFr445.60, professionals noting
that it was still more than 50 per cent below its year's high; Generale des
Eaux staged a technical rebound, FFr24, or nearly 5 per cent higher at
FFr510.
On the losing side, DMC fell FFr13.10 to FFr305 after analysts cut their
estimates for the textiles company; and CCF by FFr6.30 to FFr229.10, on
disappointment after the bank projected second-half profits similar to those
of the first six months.
MILAN remained vulnerable to the fraught political situation and the Comit
index fell 3.48 to 623.17, 3.2 per cent lower over the week.
Politics also spilled directly into business as concern grew that the
country's second cellular telephone licence, awarded to an Olivetti-led
consortium, could be delayed by lingering opposition inside the governing
coalition. Olivetti gave up L34 or 1.8 per cent to L1,868 while Cir, Mr
Carlo de Benedetti's industrial holding company, lost L45 at L1,769.
Credito Italiano lost L51, or 3 per cent, to L1,638 after reports that the
bank appeared to be winning over leading shareholders in Credito Romagnolo
to its L2,000bn takeover offer, but that it might have to pay a higher price
and would take more than the 48 per cent originally proposed. Romagnolo
gained L493, or 3.0 per cent, to L17,096 amid speculation that another bank,
or banks, might enter the fray.
ZURICH edged ahead in quiet trading, supported by the better tone on Wall
Street, and the SMI index finished 3.9 higher at 2,572.5, for a 1.3 per cent
decline over the week.
UBS bearers reversed some of the sharp losses seen after Tuesday's
extraordinary shareholders meeting, picking up SFr17 to SFr1,135 while the
registered were SFr4 ahead at SFr252. SBC continued higher, adding SFr2 to
SFr364 and CS Holding bearers were up SFr4 at SFr550.
Swiss Re registered gained SFr4 to SFr792 after the group forecast markedly
higher net profits for 1994 before accounting for extraordinary gains for
direct insurance sales.
AMSTERDAM was lower in lacklustre trade, the AEX index giving up 0.36 to
406.45 for a 0.8 per cent fall on the week.
Ing rose 80 cents to Fl 80.80 after Thursday's better-than-expected
nine-month results prompted a number of analysts to upgrade earnings
estimates.
CSM dropped Fl 1.60 to Fl 65.80 with Thursday's nine-month figures falling
short of some expectations.
KPN put on 50 cents to Fl 54.20, with investors still said to be encouraged
by the company's cost-cutting plans.

Share prices fell for the fifth consecutive day, with early gains wiped out
by position covering by dealers and profit-taking, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index lost 34.41 to 18,666.93, down 3.3 per cent on the week.
The index moved between 18,847.07 and 18,666.13. Share prices were higher in
the morning on buying by public funds and investment trusts. However, a fall
in the futures market prompted selling in the afternoon by brokers closing
their books on the last day of November delivery.
Volume totalled 270m shares against 308m. The Topix index of all
first-section stocks edged down 0.14 to 1,484.02 while the Nikkei 300 inched
up 0.06 to 272.73. Losers led gainers by 539 to 399 with 236 unchanged and,
in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.09 to 1220.59.
Traders said that public funds were the only buyers of the day.
'Share prices fell once they stopped buying in the afternoon,' said a
Japanese broker.
Sony rebounded Y130 to Y5,160, gaining for the first time in five trading
days as overseas selling eased. Matsu-shita Electronic Industrial rose Y10
to Y1,500 but heavy electricals lost ground, including Fujitsu which fell
Y10 to Y1,000.
Brokers rebounded with Nomura Securities up Y10 to Y1,900 and Yamaichi
Securities up Y10 to Y695. Banks, which reported weak interim earnings on
Thursday, were mixed. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank fell Y10 to Y1,640 and Mitsubishi
Bank rose Y20 to Y2,190.
Steels were hit by profit taking. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the
day, fell Y2 to Y373 and NKK declined Y4 to Y267. Kawasaki Steel, however,
rose Y6 to Y416.
In Osaka the OSE average fell 43.48 to 20,746.33 in volume of 30.7m shares.
Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y130 to Y5,270.
Roundup
Activity was restricted throughout the region by the absence of Wall Street,
closed for the Thanksgiving Day holiday.
TAIPEI, however, picked up 1.3 per cent as textile and steel stocks found
renewed demand. The index rose 81.80 to 6,421.82 in turnover of TDollars
41.96bn, for a 1.1 per cent rise on the week.
The market's mood had improved after the authorities had agreed on Thursday
to lift the ceiling for combined foreign holdings in listed Taiwanese
companies to 25 per cent from 10 per cent.
Among textiles issues, Hualon rose 30 cents to TDollars 23.60, and Shinkong
Synthetic Fibres 50 cents at TDollars 32.30. Chung Shing Textile hit its
daily 7 per cent limit at TDollars 15.60.
SYDNEY capped a week of volatile price swings with a second day of gains as
the market nearly recouped all of this week's early losses.
The All Ordinaries index rose 24.3 to 1,910.0, sharply higher than
Wednesday's 16-month low of 1,857, but 0.6 per cent lower on the week.
Traders, however, noted that most gains were driven by local retail
investors in the absence of the large US institutional investors who had
driven the market lower earlier in the week.
SEOUL continued lower for a seventh straight day as investors remained
cautious, worried that the central bank was about to tighten money supply.
The composite index ended 5.82 down at 1,085.16, for a decline of 3 per cent
on the week.
HONG KONG was unable to make much headway, finishing only slightly higher
after fluctuating for most of the day around Thursday's closing level. The
Hang Seng index closed up 10.97 at 8,658.83, for an 8.2 per cent drop on the
week. Provisional turnover was a thin HKDollars 2.61bn.
BANGKOK saw selling accelerate during the afternoon and the SET index
finished 7.90 lower at 1,349.39 after a volatile day. The market fell 7.4
per cent on the week.
Turnover was thin at Bt4.6bn.
BOMBAY put on 1.4 per cent on the first day of the new account. The BSE 30
shares index rose 56.89 to 4,132.28.

FT  26 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: VSEL bid fever
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Submarine maker VSEL jumped 25 to 1520p as rumours ran round the market that
the expected increased takeover offer from electronics giant GEC was about
to be unveiled early next week, possibly topping the present 1491p all-share
bid from British Aerospace by more than Pounds 1. GEC itself dipped 3 1/2 to
274p while BAe extended its recent strong run, rising 9 to 452p for a
two-day advance of 18.
Insurance sector switching sparked a modest run in Commercial Union, pushing
the shares up 8 to 530p largely at the expense of General Accident which
dipped 4 to 541p after what was thought to be a cautious note from a leading
broking house.
Sun Alliance was the most active shares in the sector shedding 3 to 314p in
3.3m turnover as a large line of stock - 1.7m shares - passed through the
market.
A two-way pull in Storehouse, which reported favourable figures on Thursday,
saw the shares edge forward a half to 214 1/2 p. NatWest Securities urged
investors to buy the shares saying: 'The rating still does not reflect the
potential. The predictability of the numbers is now being complemented by
management stability and aggressive expansion (but not diversification).'
Concern about Christmas trading continued to weaken several retail stocks.
Marks &amp; Spencer gave up 6 to 398p and Body Shop lost 3 to 209p. Dixons shed
a penny to 185p.
Fading bid hopes for Hazelwood Food, and nervous trading ahead of Tuesday's
figures, left the shares 3 off at 106p.
Profits downgradings in Allied Domecq before and after the group reported
interim figures that disappointed the market, continued to overhang the
stock. The shares relinquished 2 1/2 to 553p.
Analysts at NatWest Securities suggested the shares were 'fully valued' at
current levels but added: 'Allied has disappointed the market through
failures of form rather than content. It has produced what will probably
turn out to be the best performance of its peer group in spirits.'
On turnover of 24m shares, freight specialist NFC was yesterday's most
actively traded stock as the second leg of a spate of bed and breakfast, or
tax-related, deals went through the market. The shares gained 2 to 174p
ahead of the company's full-year results, due on December 6.
British Airways added 2 to 375p, shaking off worries about an increase in
airport tax in next week's Budget and concentrating on the next set of
monthly traffic figures. Due December 5, these are expected to show an
increase of 5 per cent for November.
Footwear maker Pentland Group gained 4 to 103p in turnover of 9.7m with a
large line of stock changing hands. There were two deals of more than 4m
shares done at 104p and 105p but suggestions of a strategic move of the
cash-rich company (it has bank balances worth half its Pounds 370m market
capitalisation) were not taken seriously by analysts yesterday.
Tobacco group Rothmans International jumped 17 to 440p, after reporting a
better than anticipated 18 per cent increase in interim profits to Pounds
275.9m. Favourable press comment boosted giftware group Bullers, helping the
shares add 1 1/2 to 20 1/2 p.

FT  26 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: NW Water rises
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in North West Water reversed an early retreat and powered ahead
gaining 9 to 529p, in trade of 2.5m, as the market gave a favourable welcome
to the group's new partnership with US construction services group Bechtel
and favourable interim results.
The deal, designed to boost NWW's international water and waste operations,
also involves the sale of the group's engineering subsidiary and
transferring the management of its five-year capital investment programme to
its new US partner.
NWW also reported an 8 per cent increase in interim profits to Pounds
176.4m, in figures brought forward from next week to tie in with the
partnership announcement. But the 8.9 per cent increase in the dividend to
8.35p was said to have fallen a 'little short' of market expectations.
Mr Richard Alderman at NatWest Securities one of the group's brokers who
remained upbeat, saying: 'There are obvious long-term benefits of a tie-up
with Bechtel. Even if today's dividend is on the low side, the company has
reiterated its long-term stance that dividend growth will be at least 6 per
cent (real) for the next four years.'
Aside from the North West excitement, the mood was dampened by half-year
results from Welsh Water below market expectations. The group reported a
profit of Pounds 49.4m after exceptional restructuring charges of Pounds
28.5m. One observer said: 'Welsh has been forced to write off more than
twice the purchase price of Acer since its acquisition two years ago. That
takes some doing.' Many brokers said they would be downgrading full-year
expectations.

FT  26 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Halifax talk hits banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Merger plans by the Halifax and Leeds Permanent ruffled the banking sector
with the stock market quick to mark down the big mortgage lenders Lloyds
Bank and Abbey National on the news that the new entity would seek to become
a listed, public limited company.
Lloyds, which is absorbing the Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society,
shed 10 to 564p while Abbey National dipped 2 1/2 to 407p, having been as
low as 404p at one stage during the day.
Most banking specialists thought the initial share price responses were
overdone, however, arguing that the merger was aimed as much at removing
mortgage capacity as supplying the stock market with a bigger, more
aggressive lender.
The two societies, numbers one and five respectively in the building society
pecking order, have combined assets of Pounds 88bn and are likely to have a
market capitalisation of around Pounds 5.5bn when they come to the market -
possibly some time in 1996, according to best bets among analysts yesterday.
This would would put any Halifax/Leeds bank roughly on a par with the Abbey
National and is likely to propel the new entity directly in to the Footsie
100 index. With a 23 per cent share of net new mortgage lending, it
dominates the field in this area, with Abbey National holding down 10 per
cent and NatWest some 6 per cent.

FT  26 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures moved narrowly in low trading volume, turning modest
losses into a small improvement after the early upturn on Wall Street,
writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3036 when pit trading came to an end, up
two points for a two-day gain of 11 points. On the week the contract was a
net 104 points lower. The premium to the cash market was two points or five
points under fair value.
Volume was again low with 6,847 contracts traded against 7,015 on Thursday.
Stock option volume was 20,975 lots, down from 26,574.

FT  26 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Ghost of Christmas Past hovers over
UK market - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Share traders in London held their fire for much of yesterday as they
awaited next week's political developments. As a result, the traditional
'Friday feeling' contained more than its usual quota of torpor.
But recovery on Wall Street and some bullish comments from one of the UK's
leading securities houses were enough to raise the ghost of Christmas Past.
From being 22 points down at one stage the FT-SE 100 closed only 3.1 lower
at 3,033.5. However, that still reflected a fall of almost 100 points on the
week. In tandem, the second-line stocks represented by the FT-SE mid 250
Index ended the day down 0.9 at 3,480.3.
With the US markets closed on Thursday and thus offering no direction, the
first part of the day was soggy.
The FT-SE 100 opened more than seven points down as few investors were
prepared to commit themselves ahead of the Tory vote on the European finance
bill scheduled for Monday - a vote of confidence in the government - and the
Budget on Tuesday. What many saw as the 'dead cat' bounce of the previous
day unwound itself.
Much of the early activity reflected so-called bed and breakfast deals.
These large tax-related trades have been evident in the run-up to the
Budget, fuelled by fears that the Chancellor may end a practice many see as
nothing more than a tax loophole.
The market hit a low of 3,014 as economists examined the latest survey of
economic trends published by the Confederation of British Industry.
Although the survey argued that growth would slow because of increased
taxes, it recorded an increase in manufacturers expecting domestic price
increases and revived rate rise worries.
Then, Wall Street opened strongly leading to recovery in the bond markets
and dragging the stock market higher. Footsie futures also moved from a
small discount to the cash market to a small premium. By the time London
closed, Wall Street was showing a 30-point gain.
Business also picked up late in the day with turnover reaching 587.6m shares
against 577.1m on Thursday. Nevertheless, much of it represented
marketmakers tweaking their books and genuine customer or retail business
was not expected to be significant. Retail business on Thursday stood at
Pounds 1.3bn.
Another element nudging equities forward was a bullish economic forecast
from SG Warburg. The securities house raised its estimate for growth in 1995
to 4.5 per cent from 3.8 per cent previously.
The figure is at the top of the range of economic forecasts and, while it
might appear to herald interest rate palpitations, it was combined with an
argument that inflation will remain comparatively low. Coming on the heels
of a change of heart from UBS earlier in the week the review suggested that
pre-Christmas cheer for the London market might be making an appearance.
Mr Ian Harnett, economist with Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, commented:
'Just before the Budget last year the market stood at 3,067 and our forecast
of 3,250 looked demanding. But by the end of Christmas the Footsie had
rallied to 3,418.'
A great deal will depend on the government's Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement which will be revealed during the Budget. If that is
substantially reduced it could prompt an investment rush. And if growth is
the buzz word then equities could benefit at the expense of government
bonds.
Market features were scarce although the acknowledgment by the Halifax
Building Society that it was in talks with Leeds Permanent shook up the
banking sector. And expectation continued that GEC would make an increased
bid for the submarine maker VSEL.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money: A legal way to rig the market - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is the difference between a gumshoe and a greenshoe? And which would
you send to track down the other?
Lovers of classic American detective fiction will have no trouble with
gumshoe - the sleuth for hire. Greenshoe has been slower to cross the
Atlantic, even as a practice. But it is a term new-issue fans would do well
to grapple with - for it is an integral part of what old-fashioned investors
might describe as authorised market-rigging.
When a big international issue - such as BT, TeleWest or BSkyB - comes to
the stock market, everybody connected with it is very keen that the market
price should stay above the issue price for a decent period after the
launch. The professional investors do not want to lose money. The company
does not want to end up with a lot of disgruntled shareholders. And the
banks underwriting the issue want to keep both clients and large investors
sweet.
So, the banks have found a natty little mechanism which allows them
effectively to guarantee that the share price will not fall below the issue
price for a month. The mechanism is simplicity itself.
If the market price gets dangerously close to the issue price - because
there are more sellers than buyers - the underwriters just buy up the excess
shares. And this altruism costs them nothing.
Here is how it works. Underwriters are wholesalers: they buy shares from the
issuer and sell them on to investors. Normally, they aim to match the number
of shares they buy from the issuer with the number of shares they sell to
investors. But if the underwriters are planning a price support operation,
they deliberately sell more shares to investors than they buy from the
issuer and leave themselves short of stock.
Being short of stock is dangerous: if the price goes up, you could have to
pay more to buy in shares than you got when you sold them. So, the
underwriters need an insurance policy which guarantees them against such
losses.
This is where the greenshoe comes in. It is an option granted by the issuer
to the underwriters which allows them to buy additional shares in the
company at the offer price if they need to cover their short sales.
Like any insurance policy, the greenshoe is an enabling tool, not an
objective. The point of the exercise is to enable the underwriters to
support the share price if necessary.
If the price is looking soggy, the underwriters do not exercise their option
to purchase shares from the issuers; instead, they buy the extra shares they
need to cover their short sales through the stock market. And, in squaring
their own books, they coincidentally support the share price of a valued
client at a delicate moment. It is an exercise of great beauty.
Everybody who matters knows exactly what is going on. The prospectus will
have a little clause saying something like: 'The underwriters may over-allot
or effect transactions which stabilise or maintain the market price of the
shares at levels above those which might otherwise prevail in the open
market.'
The over-allotment option is limited to 15 per cent of the shares being sold
and there is a 30-day limit to the support operation. And when the
underwriters have stopped supporting the price, they put out an announcement
saying so. Meanwhile, any professional investor worried about the short-term
outlook has taken the opportunity to sell some shares at the issue price.
Fine, but . . .
The guy left out in the cold is - as so often - the private investor. Say
you have bought shares in TeleWest or BSkyB and notice the share price
hovering close to the issue price for several weeks after the launch; you
could well shrug your shoulders and hope that floor will hold. It might -
but there is no guarantee once the artificial prop has been removed.
It is, normally, illegal for companies to buy their own shares. And illegal,
covert share price-rigging was the nub of the Guinness scandal. Greenshoes
are legal, open and above board. But market-rigging is market-rigging even
when it has its acceptable face on.
The British Assets' reorganisation looks like a fudge. The basic problem is
that, in order to get an above-average yield on their investment portfolio,
the managers have invested in securities unlikely to produce adequate
capital growth.
The honest answer to this might be to cut the dividend. Instead, they are
proposing a pseudo split-capital trust which leaves shareholders with
Hobson's choice. Either they cling on to all their income - and watch their
capital growth being diluted by other investors' warrants - or they accept
an immediate reduction in yield.

BUSINESS
The bitter confrontation between John Major and the Tory party's
Euro-sceptics escalated as leaders of the anti-Brussels rebellion threatened
to turn it into a direct challenge to the prime minister's leadership.
The Tories were embarrassed by a leaked campaign strategy document which
suggested backbench 'yobbos' should, metaphorically, beat up Labour leader
Tony Blair.
It also claimed that excessive executive pay packages caused 'real offence'.
The document came to light on the day it was revealed that Cedric Brown,
chairman of British Gas, was awarded a Pounds 205,000 pay rise.
Major later condemned 'unjustifiable' salary increases as Brown said he was
considering whether to forego part of his increase.
Shareholders may be given powers to curb excessive pay increases for top
company executives, chancellor Kenneth Clarke disclosed in the Commons.
George Soros, the international financier, is pulling out of UK commercial
property only 18 months after announcing plans to make a 'long-term'
investment of up to Pounds 250m.
Underwriting for the biggest bank loan of the year, the Dollars 5bn loan for
the Swedish government, should be complete by the middle of this week.
Sweden is the biggest borrower on the world's bond markets but has turned to

aimed at controlling dividends.
Allied Dunbar, the life insurer owned by BAT Industries, the tobacco and
financial services group, is to replace its range of pension policies with a
single adaptable plan intended to give customers greater flexibility.
The Securities and Investments Board, the chief City watchdog, has agreed to
become closely involved in monitoring complaints against Knight Williams,
one of the UK's largest independent financial advisers.
A 1933 penny, one of only a few struck in that year, was sold at Spink's
coin auction in London to a Hertfordshire dealer for a record Pounds 25,300.
MARKETS
US share prices plummeted amid fears that US interest rates would have to
rise further to head off inflationary pressures. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average closed down 91 at 3,677.99, its lowest level in almost
five months and its largest one-day fall since February 4.
Share prices fell worldwide as the after-shock of Tuesday's drop in the Dow
rippled through international stock markets. The FT-SE 100 fell 51 points on
Wednesday, its fifth largest fall this year. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225
average fell 262 points on Thursday and closed lower than on any day since
January 25.
London Stock Exchange rules which allow the prices of large blocks of shares
to be kept secret for up to five days are anti-competitive, the Office of
Fair Trading said.
Analysts expect a volatile period for Norwegian share prices after Monday's
referendum on membership of the European Union, irrespective of the outcome
of the vote.

fallen to its lowest level for five years, according to a survey by the UK's
Potato Marketing Board.
COMPANIES
Johnson Matthey, the precious metals technology group, reported a record
first-half performance and said there was every chance that this would
continue in the second half. Its merger talks with Cookson, the industrial
materials concern, collapsed on Tuesday, after a failure to reach agreement
on terms.
British Assets Trust announced a structural reorganisation because it is not
producing enough income to pay promised dividends. The reorganisation is
likely to affect some shareholders' dividends for several years.
An increase in selling space helped Storehouse, owner of the BHS and
Mothercare retail chains, to lift interim sales by 7 per cent and operating
profits from retailing by a third.
Welsh Water stunned the market with a reversal into loss and hefty
exceptional charges for a non-regulated business (Acer). North West Water
has struck a deal with Bechtel of the US to pursue international water and
sewage contracts.
Sharelink Investment Services, the Birmingham-based share dealing company,
continues to lose money on its trading. For the half-year to September 30,
it announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 468,000, compared with profits of
Pounds 3.68m. The share price dipped on Wednesday.

off its Pounds 914m bid after finding coal stocks are below expectations.
Vodafone, the UK market leader in cellular phones, returned better-than-
expected interim profits despite the impact of fraud and international
losses.
A strong performance from US cereal sweeteners and starches helped Tate &amp;
Lyle overcome weaker US sugar markets and modest growth in Europe to report
a 23 per cent rise in pre-tax profits.
The National Grid, the England and Wales power transmission company, is to
increase its interim dividend to the regional electricity companies which
own it by 17 per cent, to Pounds 54m.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Lira weakens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The lira yesterday fell to a record low on the the foreign exchanges amid
continuing uncertainty about the survival of the prime minister, Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, and his government, writes Philip Gawith.
The lira finished in London at L1,038 against the D-Mark, from L1,034.
Analysts are now predicting that the lira could fall to L1,050, or even
L1,100.
Market activity was quiet, as the Thanksgiving holiday in the US on Thursday
spilled over into a long weekend.
The dollar traded in a very narrow range to close at DM1.5589, from
DM1.5582, and Y98.765 from Y98.435.
Sterling had a stable day, despite lingering political uncertainty. It
finished at DM2.4339, from DM2.4366, and at Dollars 1.5631 from Dollars
1.5621.
A magazine opinion poll showed 53 per cent of Italians felt Mr Berlusconi
should not resign over the corruption probe, but currency markets proved
less sentimental.
While there were no fresh developments to push the lira lower, sentiment
clearly remains nervous. Investors appear to be troubled not so much by the
prospect of another Italian government falling, as by what this would mean
for managing the budget deficit, and pensions reform.
Although some analysts believe the lira could fall as low as L1,100 against
the D-Mark, others believe the downside is more limited. Mr Neil MacKinnon,
chief economist at Citibank in London, said he was 'disinclined to raise his
L1,050 forecast.'
He said the bank's volume analysis suggested its customers already had long
D-Mark positions against the lira. The scope for further selling was thus
fairly limited.
'I would not want to overdo the gloom, but it is very difficult to see the
lira making significant headway, even in favourable political
circumstances,' said Mr MacKinnon.
The Belgian franc weakened slightly after a newspaper article, attributed to
Swiss Bank Corporation, predicted a 10 per cent depreciation of the Belgian
franc over the next year. The franc weakened to BFr20.6 against the D-Mark,
from BFr20.58, before recovering to close at BFr20.57.
SBC distanced itself from the article, describing it as a 'hypothetical
interpretation of scenarios'. The house view is a largely unchanged exchange
rate over the next year for the franc against the D-Mark.
A suggestion in the article that the Belgian and Luxembourg francs -
currently at parity under a monetary agreement - would decouple on January
1, was denied by the Belgian and Luxembourg finance ministers, as well as
the Luxembourg treasury director.
Mr MacKinnon at Citibank said talk of the franc devaluing was 'baloney. The
Belgian central bank will go through hell and high water to maintain the
link with the D-Mark.' He said that the currency markets were also fairly
immune to capital flows, with market uncertainty more likely to show up in
bond prices, rather than the currency.
Short sterling futures lost ground after the release of the CBI monthly
trends survey showed the proportion of manufacturers planning to raise
prices rose again this month.
This prompted speculation that interest rates may rise again after the next
monthly monetary meeting on December 7. The March 1995 contract settled at
92.99, from 93.07, and three month LIBOR rose to 6 1/8 per cent from 6 per
cent.
In its daily operations, the Bank of England cleared a Pounds 500m shortage
at established rates.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Metals and coffee in
retreat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London commodity markets languished yesterday as New York traders took a
second day off to digest their Thanksgiving turkeys. And none was more
languid than aluminium.
After pushing to a fresh four-year high of Dollars 2,015 a tonne for the
three months delivery position on Tuesday the London Metal Exchange
aluminium contract succumbed to the downward 'correction' that most market
analysts thought inevitable following the 15 per cent run-up of the past
month.
The price quickly back-tracked below the Dollars 2,000 mark and continued
downwards as relatively modest selling met little buying resistance. The
fall accelerated yesterday morning as speculative liquidation breached
successive chart support points and by the close three months metal was
trading at Dollars 1,887.50 a tonne, Dollars 12.50 off the low but Dollars
61 down on the day. Traders noted that the nearby supply tightness that had
narrowed the cash discount against three months delivery to just Dollars 1 a
tonne at Monday's close had eased somewhat. Yesterday the discount ended at
Dollars 15.
Supply tightness was still very evident in the copper market, where the cash
price remained at a substantial premium to the three months position. And
with stocks of copper in LME warehouses continuing to fall prices bounced
quite strongly after a mid-week shake-out. The three months quotation, which
dipped to Dollars 2,753 a tonne at one stage on Wednesday, closed yesterday
at Dollars 2,827.50 a tonne, unchanged on the week.
Nickel was the only market to resist yesterday's early weakness, with
commission house buying enabling it to ignore news of a sizeable rise in LME
stocks. An advance to Dollars 7,810 a tonne for three months delivery proved
unsupportable, however, and the price ended at Dollars 7,745.50, Dollars 3
on the day and Dollars 23 on the week.
At the London Commodity Exchange the robusta coffee market added
substantially to last week's heavy fall.
Continued liquidation of long positions and an absence of roaster buying
combined to push the January futures position down by over Dollars 200 a
tonne on Monday. Tuesday saw a tentative rally but this was snuffed out the
following day after Brazil revealed that is coffee stocks stood at about 15m
bags (60kg each), substantially higher than traders had thought. The ensuing
fall took the price to Dollars 2,870 a tonne, Dollars 1,260 below the 8 1/2
 year peak reached on September 21, when a prolonged drought in Brazilian
growing areas was adding to crop worries caused by damaging frosts in June
and July. The price bounced to Dollars 2,987 a tonne but that was still
Dollars 296 down on the week.
'There is a significant battle between producers and consumers over which
way prices go,' commented Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at GNI, the London
trade house. 'The market is awash with coffee now, but it will be tight
again next year.'
In the meantime technical analysts are concentrating on the market's
downside potential. 'It does have a bit of a yawning chasm below it now,'
said Susan Rigg, of Chart Analysts, after Wednesday's plunge. And Elli
Gifford, of Investment Research of Cambridge, warned that, given the pace of
the decline in recent days, it seemed 'unlikely' that the coffee market
would rally to reverse the downtrend.
Chart patterns suggest that unless the January futures price can clamber
back above Dollars 3,300 pretty quickly a fall to Dollars 2,600 could be on
the cards.

FT  26 NOV 94 / International Company News: Few surprises from Deutsche
Telekom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON, ANDREW FISHER and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The distribution of mandates for Deutsche Telekom's privatisation has been
so heavily, and accurately, trailed that the actual announcement yesterday
contained few surprises.
That Deutsche Bank - whose chief executive is Hilmar Kopper - and Dresdner
Bank would be in the key international consortium was never seriously in
doubt. 'This is a great day for a German bank to have such a prominent role
in such a significant issue,' said Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, director of Deutsche
Bank's investment banking operations.
The focus of international interest was on the choice of international
investment bank to give a geographical balance to the global consortium.
But nor was there any astonishment that the German government chose Goldman
Sachs as the third member of the global consortium. Ever since Germany
decided to go for SEC registration for Deutsche Telekom and a full US
listing the participation of a US investment bank was well-nigh inevitable.
Goldman is the pre-eminent US investment bank in Europe and has established
close links with Deutsche Telekom over the past four years. It was always
regarded as the investment bank to beat.
Goldman's expression of the ritual investment bank 'delight' and 'honour'
carried more conviction than that of many competitors who came in but with
more humble roles.
'Winning this mandate is an important strategic development not only for our
telecommunications effort and for our German operation,' said Mr Robert
Morris, managing director of international telecommunications equity
research at Goldman Sachs and one of a team of core executives for whom the
deal has been a top priority for nearly four years. 'It goes to the roots of
Goldman Sachs, which is built upon equity. We are proud to be involved in
the world's largest equity offering.'
This year Goldman tops a premier league of investment banks competing for
growing volumes of international equity business. It has been 'book-runner'
in eight separate deals, ranging from Den norske Bank to Tele Danmark, to
huge Asian deals, such as Indosat, the Indonesian long-distance
telecommunications concern. Sales from 11 separate tranches of shares in
these deals amount to Dollars 3.27bn.
Competitors conceded that Goldman's achievement was a testament to the US
firm's long effort in positioning itself for the deal. But one London-based
executive said: 'Goldman have got a great headline position but from their
position the devil is in the detail.'
A global co-ordinator generally takes a lead role in most regional markets.
Goldman has such a position in the Americas, but as joint rather than sole
lead. The firm has not won inclusion in the other areas: UK, the rest of
Europe and Asia. 'Goldman is a global co-ordinator with a difference,' said
one rival.
The regional consortia matter because, as one investment banker said, 'sales
are the guts of it'. Fees for investment bankers are expected to amount to
2.5-3 per cent of a total transaction that will at DM15bn (Dollars 9.6bn) be
larger than all German IPOs of the past eight years combined. Of this
commission pool of about DM450m, only about 20 per cent goes to the managers
of the transaction, 20 per cent to the underwriters and a full 60 per cent
to the sellers.
Warburg had hoped for four banks in the global group and was disappointed
only three were chosen. Mr Maurice Thompson, head of equity capital markets
at S. G. Warburg of the UK, said: 'We had obviously hoped for a more crowded
top line and a position in it.'
So Warburg can regard its position as sole lead of the UK tranche as a
generous consolation for its failure to win a place in the global group.
Warburg was the only bank to gain a sole lead role in any region.
The bank was buoyed too by indications from Deutsche Telekom, whose chief
executive is Mr Helmut Ricke, that about 20 per cent of the total issue
would be allotted to the UK, about the same as that earmarked for US
investors.
It is expected that 50-60 per cent of the issue will be sold in Germany by a
consortium led by Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank. As for other banks that
pitched for work in the exhaustive and exhausting tender process, there is
something for everyone, almost. One source close to the German government
said over 100 banks would be involved.
CS First Boston's tactic of concentrating its efforts on the role of
government adviser has paid off. A CSFB executive said: 'The excitement of
investment banking is all to do with moments like this.' He attributed the
bank's success to the European character imparted by the link with Credit
Suisse and a 'polyglot structure and mix of nationalities'. Other winners
included NM Rothschild, which is to advise Deutsche Telekom itself.
The losers are less easy to identify. Merrill Lynch had been tipped as a
global co-ordinator and the government's, as opposed to the company's,
favourite. It has had to make do with a place in the American consortium, a
bitter pill sweetened by the fact that Merrill is joint lead with Goldman
Sachs and Deutsche Bank.
Kleinwort Benson had lobbied hard for a lead role. The investment bank,
which only three years ago was reeling after a series of defections and
embarrassments, said it was disappointed not to have won a lead role but
privately delighted to have an important role as co-lead of the UK tranche.
NatWest is also co-lead but a surprising absence is Barclays de Zoete Wedd,
which had competed strongly for the deal. 'The big prizes can't be given to
everybody,' said Mr Andre Teeuw, head of BZW in Germany.
The competition for Deutsche Telekom may have been fierce and the fees the
largest on any privatisation issue. But some bankers said the work would not
be particularly lucrative, after the work of pitching for a deal and
executing it was accounted for.
'Privatisations when everything is considered are attractive but not very
profitable,' said a CSFB executive. 'You hope it positions you for more
private-sector business with the company and within the industry.'

FT  26 NOV 94 / International Company News: Australis Media confirms it is
in talks with News Corporation
</HEADLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australis Media, Australia's would-be pay TV operator, said yesterday that
it was holding talks with Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, but declined
to be drawn on the nature of these discussions.
Australis holds one of the two commercially-available satellite licences for
the Australian market and has pledged to deliver the nation's first pay-TV
service early next year. But it has come under increasing pressure from the
big existing media operators - notably Mr Kerry Packer and Mr Rupert Murdoch
 -who have formed consortia with local telecommunications groups and are
holding out the promise of rival cable-based subscription services in the
not-too-distant future.
There has been speculation that this pressure will lead Australis to team up
eventually with the joint venture set up by News and Telecom, the large
government-owned telecommunications group, currently installing a national
cable infrastructure. The three companies could then pool their programming,
subscriber management and delivery resources. News, through its ownership of
Fox film studios, could contribute programming, and also subscriber
management.
Confirmation of the talks with News was given by Mr Rodney Price, Australis'
chairman, at the company's annual meeting in Sydney yesterday.
However, he also disclosed that the company had just secured a partnership
agreement with Sony Pictures, MCA/Universal, and Paramount for the provision
of general entertainment programming.
Mr Price repeated the group's determination to launch a pay-TV service in
the new year.

Sony

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Akio Morita, one of Japan's most unconventional yet highly regarded
businessmen, yesterday resigned his post as chairman of Sony for health
reasons.
Mr Morita, aged 73, who is recovering from a brain haemorrhage he suffered a
year ago, becomes honorary chairman and Mr Masaru Ibuka, with whom he
co-founded Sony, will become chief adviser. Mr Norio Ohga remains president
and chief executive officer.
The post of chairman has not been filled.
While Mr Morita's resignation was generally expected after his absence from
the company's day-to-day business since last November, the news 'was a shock
to everyone' at the consumer electronics company, a company official said.
'Employees who are in their middle years have great trust in Mr Morita, who
is regarded as a kind of god - although it is rather odd to describe him in
those terms,' a Sony official commented.
But it is not just Sony that is losing a leader. Mr Morita is one of Japan's
last remaining symbols of its spectacular rise from a war-devastated country
to the world's second largest economy. He ranks with the likes of Mr
Konnosuke Matsushita, founder of the world's largest consumer electronics
company, and Mr Shoichiro Honda, who started the motor company carrying his
name, for his contribution to the country's post-war success.
The company he co-founded grew from a small appliance repair shop in the
wreckage of post-war Japan to a global enterprise with annual sales of
almost Y4,000bn (Dollars 40.63bn). It also acquired two symbols of US
cultural heritage - the former CBS records and the Columbia movie studios.
While Mr Ibuka was the engineering genius behind Sony and established the
company's reputation as the standard-bearer for high quality consumer
electronics, Mr Morita is credited with building Sony into an international
operation, earning it a reputation for bringing out one hit product after
another, from Trinitron colour TVs to the Walkman portable cassette and CD
players.
His international outlook took Sony into overseas markets and led to the
company setting up production outside Japan years before globalisation
became a trend among Japanese manufacturers. He spent three years living in
the US at a time when few Japanese corporate executives ventured to live
outside the country.
He has also been behind the early appointment of foreign nationals to
executive posts at Sony's overseas companies and in his later years spent
much of his time representing the Japanese business establishment at home
and abroad.
The personable Mr Morita, who is said to have related comfortably to Sony
employees regardless of rank, has also been seen as the inspirational force
with the ability to pull the ranks together in a common cause.
Unlike the Sony which Mr Morita, together with Mr Ibuka and later with Mr
Ohga, was able to guide by virtue of his forceful yet charismatic character,
the company is now an unwieldy organisation suffering the pitfalls of
over-extension.
Last week, the company said that as a result of poor performance at Sony
Pictures, formerly Columbia, it would write Y265bn off the value of its
films arm. The write-off, which came after substantial investments in the
Hollywood studio under its former head and a dismal year at the box office,
resulted in a Y309.5bn interim net loss.
'The era in which the company can be led by two people is over,' says one
Sony official. To cope with its enlarged operations, Sony earlier this year
restructured the group's activities into eight group and division units,
each headed by a company president. The aim is to give greater autonomy and
enable them to be more market responsive.
Mr Morita's departure also comes at a time when Japan's consumer electronics
industry is under great pressure. The yen's sharp appreciation against
leading currencies, the saturation of the domestic consumer electronics
market and the changes in consumer electronics, computing and
communications, are threatening the status, if not the survival, of some of
Japan's most successful companies.
Mr Morita, an active business ambassador for Japan in his role as chairman
of the Japan-US Business Council, will be missed for the role he played in
promoting understanding with the west and in representing the Japanese point
of view to western business leaders who often misunderstood Japanese
reticence.
His outspokenness and unorthodox views have won him some critics in Japan,
but many more supporters overseas and among Japan's more progressive-minded
businessmen and public officials.
Mr Morita, for example, has advocated shorter working hours and better pay
for Japanese workers, much to the annoyance of many employers, and called
for greater liberalisation of Japanese markets. Such views, and his
cosmopolitan manner, have won him admiration as the antithesis of the dull,
blue-suited, conservative Japanese business executive.
Although his forthright manner was at times used against him, he was always
widely respected and admired for his ability to say what many thought but
were afraid to express.
As he steps out of the limelight of corporate Japan, the country has
embarked on a path towards greater deregulation and become more outspoken in
defending its views. Many would agree that the change owes much to the
efforts of Mr Morita.

months

<TEXT>
Skanska, Scandinavia's largest construction and property group, increased
pre-tax profits by 83 per cent to SKr2.72bn (Dollars 365m) in the first nine
months.
Expanded international operations, reduced interest costs and higher
dividend income offset the slump in the Swedish building market and lower
rental revenues.
The figures included a SKr879m dividend from the winding up of the
investment group, Protorp.
There was a 4 per cent drop in nine-month operating income to SKr1.87bn from
SKr1.95bn, reflecting a worse performance from the Swedish construction unit
and lower rental revenues after property divestments late last year.
But the downturn was offset by SKr857m in financial income. In the same 1993
period, the group incurred SKr466m in expenses.
The Swedish construction side saw operating profits fall to SKr363m from
SKr412m as revenues fell 7 per cent to SKr10.3bn. Low demand and depressed
prices characterised the domestic market, now in its fourth year of
recession.
Residential construction is being held back by high interest rates with
housing starts falling to 5,800 from 7,400. The company says the market
should have touched bottom, with higher road and civil engineering activity
helping to offset low housing construction business in the next year.
International operations accounted for 46 per cent of total order bookings
of SKr27.4bn against 27 per cent of SKr17.6bn in 1993 . International
construction revenues jumped to SKr6.9bn from SKr4.4bn and operating income
climbed to SKr47m from SKr16m.
Skanska says its full-year profit, excluding the dividend from Protorp, will
be considerably better than last year's SKr1.1bn.

FT  26 NOV 94 / International Company News: Study starts into privatisation
of French tobacco monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais, the French state-owned bank, has been appointed to study
the privatisation of Seita, the state tobacco monopoly which manufactures
Gauloises and Gitanes cigarettes.
The economy ministry said that no decree had yet been issued for Seita's
privatisation and that Credit Lyonnais would study the mechanisms and
technicalities of a possible privatisation. Seita is one of 21 public sector
companies slated for sale, or already sold, by the centre-right government
of Mr Edouard Balladur.
Industry observers played down the prospect of a rapid sale. The French
government has already netted more than FFr60bn (Dollars 11.2bn) this year
from its privatisation programme, compared with a target of FFr55bn. Mr
Nicolas Sarkozy, the budget minister, indicated last week that no further
privatisations would take place in 1994.
The government is, however, in the midst of the privatisation process for
Groupe Bull, the computer manufacturer. Last week, it invited offers from
potential investors seeking to take stakes in the company. The government is
also eager to launch the privatisation of Assurances Generales de France,
but is awaiting improved stock market conditions.
Seita, which makes matches as well as cigarettes, reported a first-half net
profit of FFr254m and predicted a rise in full-year profits, compared with
the FFr585m achieved in 1993.

FT  26 NOV 94 / International Company News: Bock sells stake in German
hotels group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, MICHAEL LINDEMANN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Dieter Bock, chief executive of Lonrho, yesterday began to fulfil his
promise to dispose of his outside interests when he announced the sale of a
controlling stake in Kempinski, the German hotel group, to a leading Thai
hotel company.
Advanta Management, Mr Bock's German property company, said it was selling
its stake of just over 50 per cent in Kempinski to Dusit Sindhorn, a Thai
joint venture between Dusit Thani, the hotel company, and Siam Sindhorn, a
Thai property investor.
The purchase price was not disclosed, but Advanta is believed to have sold
its stake at a premium to the price of Kempinski shares on the Frankfurt
stock exchange. Kempinski shares rose DM10 yesterday to close at DM850. The
deal will be completed on December 5.
Mr Bock's pledge to sell his outside interests came this month when he won
his battle to persuade Mr Tiny Rowland, his fellow joint chief executive, to
quit the Lonrho board.
There had been speculation that Kempinski would be merged with Lonrho's
Metropole hotel chain. Any such merger would have been complicated, however,
by the Libyan government's 33 per cent holding in Metropole.
For Kempinski, which is just about to open its seventeenth hotel, in
Dresden, the sale comes at the end of a long struggle to find a partner. In
1992, Kempinski, then 42.6 per cent owned by Lufthansa, the German airline,
was forced to abandon plans to merge with Meridien, the luxury hotel chain
controlled by Air France.
Instead, Lufthansa sold part of its stake to Advanta. Today, Lufthansa owns
20.2 per cent of Kempinski, with the remainder held by other investors. Air
France sold its 57 per cent stake in Meridien to Forte, the UK hotel group,
earlier this year.
Kempinski yesterday paid tribute to Advanta's role in developing the chain.
Kempinski said: 'Thanks to Advanta, the company achieved a much stronger
position in Germany. Advanta assisted in the merger of the company's German
and international activities which were previously separated.' Kempinski
said Advanta had also assisted it in obtaining hotel management contracts.
The German chain said its link with the Thai joint venture would give it a
stronger position in the Asian region, the world's fastest-growing travel
market. It said the Kempinski name would be maintained.
Dusit Thani said earlier this year that it was keen to expand outside
Thailand. Khunying Chanut Piyaoui, the group's founder and managing
director, said: 'I would like to invest overseas, not to make a lot of
money, but because I want to present Thai customs, tradition, art and
culture, food and hospitality.'
Berliner Handels- and Frankfurter Bank said it sold its 10 per cent stake in
Advanta Management to a US investor at the end of October, reports Reuter.
A spokesman said the bank had long intended to sell the stake. He said the
sale had nothing to do with bourse speculation in mid-October that Advanta
had run into financial difficulties.

FT  26 NOV 94 / International Company News: VW plan to cut investment
prompts slip in share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Volkswagen share price suffered yesterday as the company announced plans
to slash capital investment and reports circulated of internal profit
forecasts which fell far short of analysts' expectations.
After trading up during the day, the automotive group's shares shed more
than DM6 towards the close, ending DM3.70 down at DM451.80.
The company last night refused to confirm or comment on the existence of a
document reportedly presented at a meeting of the supervisory board
yesterday which showed the management expected pre-tax profits in 1995 of
DM890m (Dollars 571.17m).
The document was also reported to say the outcome could be up to DM200m
higher or lower, and added that sales would rise only modestly next year and
it would be difficult to increase prices.
According to the Reuters news agency which said it had copies of the paper,
the management forecasts were far more gloomy than those of stock market
expectations, which were mostly based on earnings well above DM1bn.
The agency quoted one analyst describing such a result as 'depressing',
although others found it hard to believe the figures were correct,
suggesting the management could have massaged the data to present as poor a
picture as possible to the supervisory board.
Under German accounting rules, companies commonly add to or draw down hidden
reserves at any time without publicising such moves.
While investors are convinced that VW is set to rebound strongly from its
net DM1.94bn losses last year, management may want to play down the extent
of the recovery while it is still trying to cuts costs and increase
productivity.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, group chairman, recently angered his competitors with a
down-beat assessment of the car market's prospects which hit all automotive
groups' shares.
VW may also want to paint as black a picture as possible to enhance its
chances of success with its current lobbying exercise in Bonn for government
subsidies.
The company wants funds for a 'scrapping premium' scheme similar to those
used earlier to liven up the Spanish and French car markets. Ordinary car
owners were paid substantial sums to trade in cars over 10 years old for new
models.
VW says more than 20 per cent of the German car market would stand to gain
most, while other groups such as Mercedes and BMW are believed to be
strongly against subsidies which would appeal mainly to owners of
lower-priced cars.
The non-executive supervisory board, which is dominated by worker
representatives and Social Democrat politicians, yesterday approved a sharp
cut in medium-term investment plans, which reduces the five-year budget for
1995 to 1999 to DM58.5bn compared with DM69bn for the current budget to the
end of 1998.
The total will be divided virtually equally between the factories and the
group's financial services business.

FT  26 NOV 94 / UK Company News: North West links with Bechtel - Two water
companies report different non-regulated experiences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in North West Water rose 2 per cent to 529p yesterday as the biggest
of the 10 UK water and sewerage companies announced plans to link up with
US-based Bechtel Corporation, which is one of the world's top engineering
and construction companies.
The two companies plan to establish a wide-ranging business partnership to
pursue international opportunities.
Bechtel, which led the restoration of Kuwait after the Gulf War, will also
take on the management of North West's Pounds 2.3bn capital investment
programme.
Mr Brian Staples, North West's chief executive, said the alliance would
bring substantial benefits to both partners.
North West, which has been one of the most active UK water and sewerage
companies abroad, would benefit from Bechtel's procurement practices. The UK
company now expected to achieve savings on its investment programme above
the 10 per cent indicated just two weeks ago.
North West would also be able to step up its international expansion, while
sharing the costs of marketing and development. Currently it is spending
about Pounds 10m a year.
For Bechtel, the link brings in-depth expertise in the rapidly-growing
international water and sewerage market. Bechtel is buying North West's
engineering division, which designs and builds treatment plants, for Pounds
15m.
The companies will form a joint venture in the US, where interest in the
privatisation of water services has grown dramatically over the last two
years. It is estimated that US municipalities need investment of about
Dollars 127bn (Pounds 77bn) to meet current Clean Water Act requirements.
North West's announcement almost overshadowed its interim results, which
showed a marginal decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 138.2m to Pounds
136.8m for the six months to September 30. Sales were 7 per cent ahead at
Pounds 488.4m (Pounds 455.3).
Profits were depressed by a Pounds 13.5m goodwill write-off on disposals.
The dividend was increased by 8.9 per cent to 8.35p (7.67p) from earnings
down 13 per cent to 34.3p (39.3p).
COMMENT
North West appears to have staged a coup. None of the other water and
sewerage companies forging links abroad have found such an internationally
influential partner. Bechtel is renowned for its tough procurement practices
and the link-up will do much to ease anxieties over thin margins on
international contracts, which have plagued North West's strategy for some
time. The alliance is also bound to reduce the risk substantially. On the
downside, privatisation in the US is slower in coming than expected, and
international contracts still carry a certain degree of risk. Forecasts are
for pre-tax profits of Pounds 290m before exceptionals and a prospective
yield of 6 per cent. Its prospects are more encouraging than for many of its
peers.

</HEADLINE>

   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sale of a shopping centre helped lift interim pre-tax profits at the
Bristol Evening Post by 54 per cent, from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 4.78m.
Excluding the Pounds 1.24m profit from the sale of the New Broadmead site in
Bristol, the pre-tax figure rose 14 per cent to Pounds 3.54m in the 26 weeks
to September 30.
Turnover rose only 1 per cent to Pounds 30.4m (Pounds 30.1m), in part
because of a reduction in the number of Kiosk retail stores from 78 to 62.
Retail activities recorded an increase in operating profit of Pounds 398,000
(Pounds 215,000), up 85 per cent.
Operating profits from newspaper publishing and printing rose 26 per cent
from Pounds 1.31m to Pounds 1.66m, on turnover of Pounds 17.3m (Pounds
16.1m). Mr Keith Sadler, finance director, said advertising revenues for the
half were up from Pounds 10m to Pounds 12m, after a good first quarter but
poor second quarter.
Earnings per share increased from 8.47p to 12.28p, with the underlying
figure up 9 per cent at 9.3p. The interim dividend is 4.5p (4.25p).

FT  26 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Cornwell Parker chief makes boardroom
changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Martin Jourdan, chairman of Cornwell Parker, has followed his downbeat
trading statement at the end of October with boardroom changes at the
furniture and fabrics group. 'When trading is poor, people expect something
to be done,' he said.
As well as remaining group chairman Mr Jourdan is taking over as chief
executive of the fabrics division and managing director of the furniture
side.
These moves are displacing Mr Tony Thomas in fabrics and Mr Jourdan's
brother Tom in furniture. While Mr Tom Jourdan will remain responsible for
manufacturing operations, Mr Thomas will leave at the end of January. Mr
Martin Jourdan said Mr Thomas was on a rolling two-year contract and no
payment above any contracted entitlement had been discussed.
The senior board was reorganised three and a half years ago to cope with
expansion, but 'now we need to manage the business we've got, and we've got
international management talent we don't need', Mr Jourdan said.
There was also a need to 'de-layer' the organisation between the top of the
business and the shop floor. At subsidiary board level, one director was
taking early retirement and three had left already.
As these events had happened early in the financial year, costs would
probably cancel out savings, and benefits would show in the following 12
months, Mr Jourdan said.

FT  26 NOV 94 / UK Company News: McLeod Russel chairman dies suddenly aged
50
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nigel Openshaw, chairman of McLeod Russel Holdings, died suddenly on
Thursday aged 50.
An accountant, he joined the board in September 1981. By 1987 he was group
managing director and by 1988 chairman. He engineered McLeod's metamorphosis
from a plantations group to its current position as a holding company with
interests in surface coatings, air filtration, environmental engineering and
property investment.
This was initially achieved in 1987 when the group sold 80 per cent of its
Indian tea interests and when Kennedy Smale, a glove manufacturer and
machinery distributor, took over McLeod in an agreed Pounds 51.5m merger.
At a board meeting yesterday Mr James Leek was appointed chairman. He has
been a non-executive director since May 1992. Mr Paul Humphreys, finance
director, said Mr Leek would be spending an increasing amount of time with
McLeod, and that the move had been made so quickly to ensure continuity for
the group.
Mr Leek is already chairman of Amberley Group, the USM-traded building
preservation company, and a director of Caparo Industries, the steel
products and engineering group.
On Tuesday, McLeod announced a 23 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds
6.36m (Pounds 5.16m) in the year to September 30.

FT  26 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BSkyB to raise about Pounds 810m in global
offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, launched its UK
retail offer yesterday without setting a firm price for the shares.
It is offering UK investors 36.4m shares out of a global offer total of 343m
shares. The offer closes on December 6, and the price will be set - in a
range between 233p and 268p - on the morning of December 8, when dealings
begin.
The lower price would value the group at Pounds 4bn, while the upper price
would give a valuation of Pounds 4.6bn. A price in the middle of the range
would raise about Pounds 810m, which would be used with a new bank facility
to pay off debts.
Investors can set a limit on how much they are prepared to pay per share,
but applications will be based on the amount of money to be invested. The
minimum investment is Pounds 500.
The prospectus shows the group had 3.6m subscribers at end-September, up
from 3.45m last June. Group revenues in the year to June 30 were Pounds
550m, mainly from subscriptions. Operating profits were Pounds 170m, pre-tax
profits Pounds 93m and earnings per share 6.8p.
The group promises 'to maintain a dividend policy that reflects the
presently high cash generative nature' of the business. For the year to June
the directors would have recommended a net dividend of 3.3p per share.
The main shareholders are Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation; Pearson, the
media group that owns the Financial Times; Granada, the television and
leisure group; and Chargeurs, the French industrial company.
The group will be run by a board of 19, with Mr Frank Barlow remaining as
chairman and Mr Sam Chisholm, who has played an important role in turning
BSkyB round, as chief executive and managing director. Among 11 new
directors will be Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada chief executive, and Mr Jerome
Seydoux, Chargeurs chairman.
The group 10 days ago submitted an affidavit to the High Court which
estimated that total losses to the company in the first five months of this
year through pirate card devices were Pounds 2.25m.
The prospectus says there has been some piracy, but 'the directors believe
that there has been no material loss of revenue over the past fiscal year as
a consequence.' The group said it had been advised that a loss should only
be considered material if it was 5 per cent instead of the 0.5 per cent loss
over the period.

FT  26 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Malcolm Barr steps down to end feud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Malcolm Barr agreed to step down as chairman of Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold
Trust yesterday in a boardroom shake-up, which spells an end to the family
feud at the motor and leisure group.
Mr Barr, who is also the outgoing chairman of the Leeds Permanent Building
Society, gave way to pressure from rebel shareholders led by his nephews,
Nicholas and Robert Barr. The brothers, who speak for almost 30 per cent of
ordinary voting shares, are joining the board along with their fellow rebel
shareholder, Mr Kerry Firth.
The boardroom deal came after an EGM had dissolved into chaos as the warring
parties held a series of frantic talks in front of shareholders. The EGM
failed to start and was eventually adjourned until Monday while financial
advisers attempted to negotiate a deal to end the feud.
The board had wanted to enfranchise the non-voting A shares, which represent
80 per cent of the equity and are owned almost entirely by institutions.
However, the rebels won support from shareholders representing more than 50
per cent of voting ordinary shares.
Enfranchisement now seems likely to be voted through at the reconvened EGM
next week. A second meeting had been requisitioned by the rebels to remove
Mr John Parker, chief executive, and Mr Brian Small, finance director.
However, both Mr Parker and Mr Small will stay on the board as part of the
latest deal.
The agreement follows six weeks of acrimonious dispute between the Barr
generations over the future of the family business. The brothers wanted to
demerge the two divisions to unlock shareholder value. The board countered
with warnings from motor manufacturers that the new company could lose its
lucrative car dealership franchises.
Before details of the deal emerged, Mr Nicholas Barr denied that his uncle's
departure would resolve the dispute.
'That would make it sound extremely personal, which it is not,' he said.
'Much has been said about family feuding and clearly there are differences
of opinion. But this is not a personal issue, it is a commercial one.'
Malcolm Barr will become life president.

FT  26 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Welsh falls 36% on Acer losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The controversy over the diversification policies of utilities resurfaced
yesterday as Welsh Water announced disappointing interim results due to
losses and charges in its largest non-regulated business.
Pre-tax profits fell 36 per cent to Pounds 49.4m (Pounds 77.3m) for the six
months to September 30, after exceptional charges of Pounds 28.5m. Turnover
was 0.73 per cent lower at Pounds 259.9m. Excluding discontinued businesses,
sales rose by 1.8 per cent.
The exceptional charges included Pounds 11.5m to cover rationalising the
Acer motorway design business. The balance arose from a previously announced
rationalisation in the core utility business.
Mr Iain Evans, chairman, said a significant number of UK motorway orders had
been cancelled by the Department of Transport, leaving Acer with losses of
Pounds 2.8m.
Management had decided to cut 13 per cent of the 3,000-strong workforce,
with most of the jobs going from the UK division.
Welsh paid Pounds 50m for Acer, including Pounds 27m in debt, 21 months ago.
It wrote off Pounds 40m against goodwill soon after the purchase.
The company yesterday faced renewed criticism over its diversification
record, which includes unhappy forays into electricity and hotels under
previous management.
'We are hearing the same story time and time again,' said one analyst.
Mr Evans denied that these were bad results. On the positive side, Welsh had
cut underlying operating costs by about 1.5 per cent. Further benefit was
expected from rationalising the utility, where more than 400 jobs would be
cut.
Welsh had also achieved savings of roughly Pounds 4m on its capital spending
programme.
Mr Evans said the non-regulated businesses, with the exception of Acer, had
improved 'dramatically'. Profits excluding Acer had risen from Pounds
300,000 to Pounds 3.4m.
The dividend was increased by 10 per cent to 9.3p (8.45p) from earnings down
37 per cent at 31.1p (49.2p) or 49.4p (49.2p) before exceptionals.
COMMENT
It appears that Welsh has written off more than it paid for its Acer
subsidiary, and the division is still making losses. Not surprisingly the
shares underperformed yesterday, falling 4 per cent against the sector's 2
per cent decline. Forecasts were pulled back from about Pounds 163m to
Pounds 155m, before the Pounds 28.5m charge. On the plus side, Welsh Water
has one of the strongest balance sheets and highest dividend covers among
its peers. At some stage, this should feed through to shareholders. For the
moment, however, the shares look about right.

FT  26 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Rothmans ahead of City forecasts with 18%
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A recovery in French cigarette prices and fast growth in Asia helped
Rothmans International beat City forecasts with an 18 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 233.4m to Pounds 275.9m for the six months to
September 30.
Its European market share was down marginally, continuing a long-term
decline because of dependence on local brands and Virginia blend cigarettes
rather than international brands and American blends.
Lord Swaythling, chairman, said market share was beginning to stabilise
thanks in part to the success of Golden America, an American blend cigarette
launched in several countries over the past two years.
European operating profits rose by 44 per cent to Pounds 70m (Pounds 48.7m)
on sales up 6 per cent at Pounds 539.9m. After a price war in France last
year, prices and demand improved in the latest period. UK sales rose from
the previous year which had been distorted by two Budgets.
The first costs savings from a European rationalisation programme announced
in June were only just beginning to flow through by the close of the period,
analysts estimated.
Profits from the Americas, predominantly Canada, fell from Pounds 50.1m to
Pounds 49.8m although they had grown in local currency terms.
Asian profits rose to Pounds 59.6m (Pounds 46.1m) while Pacific profits fell
to Pounds 28.3m (Pounds 29.3m) because of a price war in Australian and New
Zealand and increased marketing costs.
Rothmans' worldwide cigarette volumes rose slightly. The main gains were in
Japan and the UK. Sales revenue rose by 4.3 per cent to Pounds 1.27bn.
The interim dividend of 7.5p per unit will reduce net cash generated to
Pounds 86.1m (Pounds 184.5m). Last time it paid no dividend because of
payments associated with the capital restructuring of Rothmans and Dunhill,
its sister company. Earnings per unit were 19.7p (17.2p).
Lord Swaythling reiterated the board's commitment to invest only cash
generated in tobacco and in due course to give any surplus to shareholders.
The largest is the Rupert family with a 61 per cent stake.
The units rose 17p to 440p.
COMMENT
Rothmans' caution on buying brands in emerging markets such as eastern
Europe have made it look conservative compared with Philip Morris and BAT
Industries. Its willingness to invest, preferably in greenfield projects and
Asia, is not in doubt but will take years to pay off. Meanwhile, the bottom
line will benefit from the fruits of European cost cutting. Full-year
profits of about Pounds 555m are possible for earnings of 39p and a
prospective p/e of 11. This rates the shares slightly above BAT and Morris
but there is the attraction long term of a big pay-out to shareholders.

FT  26 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Asprey loses some of its sparkle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the unseasonably warm weather, a chill wind has been blowing through
the elegant showrooms of Asprey, the exclusive jewellery retailer whose
various businesses are scattered along the streets of London's West End.
Indeed, Mr Naim Attallah, chief executive of the group he refers to as 'the
most luxurious gift shop in the world', suggested last week that the
super-rich had not only been absent from the group's London stores, but that
'it's the same in the United States, Switzerland and even on Avenue
Montaigne in Paris'.
However, as Asprey revealed a fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.01m
(Pounds 12.2m) for the six months to September 30, he suggested that there
had been a small improvement in the weeks since the profits warning of
September 9.
He will be hoping that this improvement continues or watchers of the group
will question the wisdom of his expansionist moves of the past few years. To
a group containing the core Asprey business with three outlets, he added
Garrard and Mappin &amp; Webb in 1990, Watches of Switzerland in 1992 and Les
Ambassadeurs, a watch and jewellery retail chain, in 1993. The 1993 launch
of Zeus, 'an experiment' aimed at younger shoppers, took the group yet
further from its known territory.
Garrard is the kind of shop where most items have no price ticket,
presumably on the assumption that if you need to ask, you can't afford it.
Its most expensive item retails at Pounds 2.8m, while M&amp;W's costliest bauble
is a snip at Pounds 95,000.
Asprey's stock ranges from a Burma ruby and diamond suite at more than
Pounds 4m to a heron dish at Pounds 23.50 which, strangely, is the same
price as a Swatch watch, the cheapest item at Watches of Switzerland.
The acquisition drive has broadened the customer base away from the rarefied
world of Arab princes, heads of states and governments on which the group
used to depend. This was Mr Attallah's intention. He maintains that
otherwise the group would be at the financial mercy of the whims of 'certain
overseas customers'. In this, he has the broad agreement of Mr Arnaud
Bumberger, managing director of Cartier in the UK, who says: 'We are not
having these problems at the moment, but we might tomorrow.'
In Asprey's interim results, the sharpest turnover fall - to Pounds 29.6m
(Pounds 39.3m) - was at the core Asprey business. Garrard's turnover was
flat at Pounds 11.7m and Mappin &amp; Webb's slipped by Pounds 1m to Pounds
16.2m. Profits at Watches of Switzerland were lower as a result of the
growth of overheads as the company expanded from 26 to 33 outlets, but its
turnover grew to Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 13.7m).
Asprey's expanded customer base contains many who were relatively rich in
the 1980s but have since tightened their belts. And Mr Attallah fumed at the
government's lack of understanding of psychology, railing at the bad timing
of the upcoming Budget: 'We have had a quiet November, because people are
deterred from Christmas buying when they don't know what their position will
be after next week.'

Despite a 44 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 25.4m (Pounds 17.6m)
pre-tax profits for the half year to October 31 fell from Pounds 1.13m to
Pounds 745,000.
Mr Arthur Morton, chairman, said the year had started well but that during
the second quarter trading profits had declined. He cited three reasons: the
ending at Sphinx Level V of the supply agreement by Informix; the
performance of recently acquired ISO Communications and Data Logic
Communication Services; and margin reductions in desktop computer markets
because of competition.
Earnings per share slipped to 0.41p (0.62p) but the interim dividend is held
at 0.125p.

FT  26 NOV 94 / UK Company News: McKechnie chief gets 62% rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Ost, chief exec-utive of McKechnie, the plastics and metals
components group, received a pay rise of 62 per cent for the year to July
31, taking his earnings to Pounds 275,748.
Mr Ost's basic salary rose from Pounds 145,000 to Pounds 185,067, while his
performance-related bonus climbed to Pounds 65,519 (Pounds 13,431). Among
other benefits, he also received pension contributions of Pounds 13,116.
Mr Ost's pay is decided by a committee of non-executive directors. The bonus
is set by a formula covering the percentage increase in earnings per share
over four years and the achievement of the cashflow budget for that year.
McKechnie's earnings in 1993-94 were 27.1p (22p in 1990-91). In 1993-94 its
net cash inflow before financing was Pounds 2.05m.

FT  26 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Continuing problems at DRS will hit second
half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRS Data warned yesterday that continuing trading problems would result in
disappointing second half profits. The shares were unchanged at 30p,
compared with the 110p offer price in May.
The flotation of the scanning equipment manufacturer has been followed by a
catalogue of disasters, including a change in ownership of its main
distributor and a collapse in demand from schools, its largest market.
The statement yesterday said there was no signs of a recovery on educational
sales. Schools accounted for about 70 per cent of sales last year, but
shortly after its share offer demand dried up.
The group said some schools were reconsidering the need for DRS's main
product the Optical Mark Reader, following recent relaxation in National
Curriculum requirements.
There has also been a trend for schools to build up cash reserves, with a
corresponding decline in expenditure.
Nottingham Group, the educational products supplier, also revealed declining
sales to schools in the first half of 1994, shortly after its March
flotation.
DRS said the collapse in sales was unforeseeable at the time of its share
offer. Mr Malcolm Brighton, founder and managing director, made about Pounds
3.5m from the offer. The company's shares fell 58 per cent last September,
after its interim results revealed declining profits and collapsing sales.
In a year littered with the corpses of disastrous flotations, only
Aerostructures Hamble has performed worse, closing yesterday at 25p,
compared with its offer price of 120p.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Inequality in society wedding: The merger plans of the
Halifax and the Leeds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The announcement yesterday of merger plans between Halifax, the UK's largest
building society, and Leeds Permanent, the fifth largest, surprised many
observers with its timing. But the likelihood of mergers in the sector - and
the desire of both societies to find partners - is not new.
However, yesterday's plans have gone further than many expected in the
intention that the combined organisation should become a public limited
company and seek a Stock Exchange flotation. The benefits of conversion for
Abbey National, the first building society to have chosen plc status, have
not been so self-evident that any others have since followed that path.
Mr Jon Foulds, the Halifax chairman, who will chair the new organisation,
was upbeat about the consequences, however: 'We propose to create a new
force in personal financial services,' he said.
The wooing of Leeds by Halifax began with talks in the spring, after the
announcement of an agreed Pounds 1.8bn cash bid by Lloyds Bank for
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society, the sixth largest.
Leeds had already been to the altar once recently, in merger talks with
National &amp; Provincial Building Society - a move that would have created the
UK's third-largest society. When those broke down up in October last year,
Leeds was left looking forlorn.
At its annual general meeting in May, Halifax made clear it was seeking a
merger in pursuit of its mission to be the UK's biggest and best provider of
personal financial services. The problem was whether any society would want
to be the junior partner.
Halifax and Leeds will have to persuade several audiences that they have
ended up with the right match:
The members of the two societies - investors and borrowers - who must
approve by substantial majorities both the merger and the later conversion
to plc status.
The money markets on which the new organisation will borrow wholesale funds
 -at rates that will depend on the judgment of the viability of the merger
made by the US ratings agencies.
The capital markets will also have to be convinced that the plans for the
future make sense if the flotation is to be successful.
Some points in the merger plan have a wide appeal. Members, staff and
financial monitors are likely to be pleased with the prospects for growth
for the new organisation which will be able to provide a wider range of
products to both societies' customers.
Leeds, for example, does not offer a current account with a cheque book;
Halifax does, and will want to sell the service to Leeds customers. Within
five years, Halifax is likely to want to use the greater freedoms that
accompany its new status to produce as well as sell personal lines of
general insurance, such as motor and travel.
No cash sum is on offer for members, as a result of the merger, to compare
with the share of the Pounds 1.8bn on offer from Lloyds Bank to Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester members. But any dismay among members that they will not receive
such a bonus is likely to be outweighed by the prospect of free shares when
the merged building society is floated.
The advantages to Halifax of acquiring around 4 per cent of the current UK
mortgage market and access to a further 2.5m customers without having to
make a cash bid are clear. The benefits to the Leeds of this deal are much
less obvious.
The society will have the advantage of being reunited with Mr Mike
Blackburn, the chief executive who left the Leeds in February last year to
run Halifax. And being part of the larger organisation - likely to be the
third largest UK high-street bank by asset size - will ensure that it is not
squeezed out in the increasingly competitive financial services sector.
The Halifax's contribution to the new group is much the larger - and not
merely in terms of the Pounds 69.9bn it provides of the Pounds 90bn assets
of the combined operation. It will also contribute its name and its head
office, as well as its chairman and chief executive. Leeds is bringing the
brand names of some of its products.
But rather than giving up its identity to join Halifax, the Leeds could have
chosen another, less powerful partner that would have allowed for a more
equal relationship within an organisation large enough to survive. Its
motivation in choosing Halifax is mystifying competitors.
'I can't see what's in it for the Leeds,' one chief executive commented. 'I
was surprised,' said another, 'I thought they would reject it because of the
likely branch closures.'
What the future of the branch network might be is an issue requiring diverse
messages about the benefits to different audiences.
The two organisations have more than 1,100 branches, with considerable
overlap. The temptation to rationalise the combined branch network and cut
expenses will be strong.
Mr Roger Boyes, Leeds's acting chief executive, insists that there would be
no need for large numbers of branches to be closed and staff to be made
redundant. He argues that the planned expansion of business in financial
services will provide a use for the extra branches. The new organisation is
planned to employ about 27,000 staff and re-training, redeployment and
natural wastage, should mean no need for compulsory redundancies, he hopes.
That stance, expressed also by Halifax, is intended to reassure members that
they will not suffer a loss in the availability of services, and to give
confidence to staff that there will not be massive job cuts.
There is some merit in expressing this view: the outspoken way in which
1,600 job losses among 9,800 staff were envisaged in the announcement of the
merger between Leeds and National &amp; Provincial last August was one of the
factors in its downfall.
But retaining most of the existing branch network would be far from
reassuring to the credit ratings agencies. It could also undermine the two
societies' current cost to income ratios of around 40 per cent - below the
sector average.
The shadow over societies is the merger of Nationwide and Anglia building
societies in 1987. The two businesses were not properly combined, and it is
only relatively recently that Nationwide has shown signs of tackling the
high cost to income ratio and regaining competitiveness.
Halifax competitors believe that whatever is said to ensure approval of the
merger, the society's management will be prepared to take tough decisions on
rationalising the combined organisation.
Only if it does - and can make the most of its added size and wider powers
to provide a wide range of financial products efficiently - will yesterday's
announcement of merger and conversion set the pattern for tomorrow's moves
among other societies. They will be watching closely.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Coal enterprise in UK's best
interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WILLIAM F MORRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, May I ask whose interests are being served by the seemingly endless
campaign to rubbish RJB Mining? This company's efforts to secure intact a
significant part of the UK coalmining industry serve the nation's best
interests ('Putting Pounds 1bn down the mines', November 23).
We each have a duty to see our considerable natural resources and expertise
fully exploited. Surely we should applaud, support and be thankful for such
a display of confidence, enthusiasm and enterprise.
A weak and fragmented coal industry brings more than misery to the already
hard-pressed mining communities. It creates more than a little financial
pressure on the mining equipment manufacturers which belong to the
association I represent.
The army of public relations men and lobbyists who represent the new leading
players in the energy industry sees this breakdown as its goal. Ultimately,
it will precede the loss of a vast natural resource that can serve us all.
Even in a worst case scenario, supplying 27m tons per year, RJB projects
huge success providing the industry remains intact.
The UK sits on more than 1bn tons of coal reserves. These figures speak for
themselves. Will no one else?

FT  26 NOV 94 / More gripping than the winter Olympics: The passions stirred
in Norway by Monday's EU referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From the barren arctic northlands, through the spectacular mountain valleys
and fjords, down to Oslo's humdrum inner suburbs, the word Nei] has been
inescapable in Norway this year.
It has been carved into hillsides, daubed on cows, flown from flagstaffs and
hung on banners across streets. One farmer won himself a front-page picture
in a national newspaper, grinning beside a sign he had erected barring
European Union visitors from his campsite. A few weeks ago, a group of women
formed 'Blondes against the EU'.
The passions stirred by Monday's referendum on joining the EU have been
exceeded recently only by the Lillehammar winter Olympics last February  -
when Norway skied off with a horde of gold medals - and the football World
Cup finals in July, for which Norway qualified for the first time in more
than 50 years.
As the vote draws near, the confidence of the No camp has been dented. Its
commanding lead in the opinion polls has been eroded since Sweden voted in
favour of membership earlier this month. But even if, as the latest polls
suggest is possible, the Yes campaign achieves an against-the-odds victory,
Norway will have lived up to its billing as the most Euro-sceptical of the
four nations due to join the EU next year. (Austria and Finland, like
Sweden, have voted Yes.)
Last weekend, the No camp organised the largest rally in any of the four
prospective member countries: 25,000 people streamed into Oslo in driving
rain and snow to boo Brussels. It was the biggest political demonstration in
Norway since the second world war - even bigger than any rally during the
campaign in 1972, when Norway rejected membership of the European Community
in an earlier referendum.
In the Oslo crowd was Mr Skjalg Jensen, 27, who had travelled 1,200km from
Finnmark, Norway's northernmost county, where the country borders Russia and
the arctic Barents sea. Dressed, like many in the crowd, in traditional
knickerbocker trousers and a floppy felt mountain hat, with the Norwegian
flag sticking out of his backpack, Mr Jensen declared: 'The question of
joining the EU is a question of our values, and that is why we are against
joining.
'They say the politicians in Brussels are the voices of the people, but what
do they understand? Their realities are golf and socialising. Theirs is a
different culture from normal people like us in the north.'
Nor was Mr Jensen worried by the arguments of Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the
formidable prime minister who leads the Yes campaign. She has warned that
Norway could be dangerously decoupled from its Nordic and European
neighbours. 'I think after a No vote, we will have the same Norway that
exists today,' said Mr Jensen. 'Our economy is strong - it is the strongest
in Europe.'
Norwegians' hostility to the EU is based on a sense of their special place
in European culture, a jealously guarded political independence, and the
economic security gained from North Sea oil.
The very word 'union' provokes a grimace in a country that only gained
independence from Sweden in 1905 and was occupied by Nazi Germany during the
last war.
As for political isolation, many Norwegians believe that by joining the EU
they would increase their separation from the seat of decision making. 'It
is already a long way from here to Oslo,' say people in the regions. 'We
will be even further away from Brussels.' They are happy to confine
themselves to membership of Nato.
The oil bonanza, meanwhile, has allowed Norway to indulge its preference for
a social system heavily weighted towards state welfare and lavish subsidies
for rural communities. And fear of losing control of its petroleum and fish
riches outweighs the mostly intangible economic benefits EU membership might
bring.
Unlike both Sweden and Finland, which have recently suffered deep
recessions, Norway has fared quite well, with relatively low unemployment (a
total of about 8 per cent compared with 13 per cent in Sweden and 18 per
cent in Finland). Warnings from the Yes camp that petroleum revenues will
soon peak, exposing the weak state of Norway's onshore industrial base, make
little impression on many Norwegians, made comfortable by the generous
redistribution of oil wealth.
'A market economy for north Norway will never work,' said Mr Mats Albinson,
a docker from Hammerfest, at the Oslo rally. 'Currently there is protection
of the economy, but joining the Union implies there would be totally free
access for outside competition. We are not fools - we've seen this happen
before in other countries.'
The counter-argument, that Norway could find itself excluded from European
markets, also has little impact on the No camp. It believes that oil and
fish can continue to be the backbone of the economy. 'They don't trade with
us because they are sorry for us,' proclaims Ms Torhild Lamo, a No
campaigner in the north-western town of Bodo. 'They trade because they need
what we've got. We have the natural resources, so I don't think that would
be a problem.'
Mrs Brundtland hopes that enough people in the urban areas, which are more
populous than the regions, will reject these arguments. In the cities, her
appeal for Norway not to vote itself out of the political and economic
development of Europe shows signs of hitting home.
But even if she wins, it will be an uneasy victory over the outlying
regions, which have traditionally embodied Norway's national identity. 'We
are a very different country, we have different values and we are a
different people. We want to protect the value of life in Norwegian
society,' said Ms Anne Enger Lahnstein, the principal leader of the No
campaign, at a meeting in Oslo last week. It won her a standing ovation.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Decision denies chance to pioneer
superhighways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GRAHAM ALLEN MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The government's announcement that it will not lift the ban on BT and
allow it to broadcast entertainment services to homes on a national basis is
an unwelcome and inopportune decision at a time when the UK's European and
international competitors are surging ahead in the telecommunications
revolution ('Government offers telecoms groups wider superhighway role',
November 23).
What this means for the country and economy is that we will fall behind the
world leaders in the development of a superhighway, and our citizens will be
denied the tremendous opportunities which would be the immediate spin-off
from a superhighway. The government has given a clear and concise No to BT's
and Mercury's establishment of an information superhighway before at least
2001.
Whereas BT and Mercury can compete in European markets they are prevented
from doing so in the UK. Not only that, but they are also denied the
certainty of knowing when they will be able to enter the market here. What
was hoped for from the government was a clear indication as to when BT and
Mercury would be able to start their promised Pounds 15bn investment. To
wait until 2001 provides them with no incentive whatsoever to take up the
offer of servicing areas not yet bid for by the cable companies.
All the government has succeeded in doing is to ensure that Britain
essentially leaves the race and comes in only when the rest of the world has
developed fully and is on to the next revolution. We will still be trying to
catch up and be falling behind in new developments and technologies. The
economy suffers and the people suffer.
The government has denied to the UK the opportunity to pioneer new
development for the good of the ordinary citizen.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Restrictions on radio licences
inequitable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HENRY MEAKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Raymond Snoddy reported in one article on November 17 ('Capital may
seek all four regional licences') that Capital Radio 'under the points
system for limiting the concentration of radio station ownership, Capital
(Radio) has the leeway to buy a number of new licences or even a national
commercial station' and that it might bid for all four regional licences
that are due to be advertised. In a separate article in the same edition, he
reported that GWR Group had been prevented from making an acquisition by The
Radio Authority ('GWR acquisition plan is blocked by Radio Authority').
How can it be that Capital Radio, one of the biggest independent radio
contractors in the world and four times the size of GWR, can have this
leeway when GWR is restricted?
Surely the time has come for there to be a level playing field in the radio
industry. The subject is presumably on national heritage secretary Stephen
Dorrell's agenda, but is probably not very high on the list of priorities:
the industry is seen to be a success and not in need of emergency service.
The reality is that the industry is a success despite the legislation and
that the legislation needs urgent revision.
It should be the duty of The Radio Authority and the national heritage
secretary to take urgent steps to eliminate such restrictive ownership
anomalies.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Open sesame, system: Computer hackers are less of a risk
than lax security over passwords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shadowy figures answering only to bizarre pseudonyms; secret meetings in
lonely cellars at dead of the night; electronic black boxes dialling endless
sequences of telephone numbers in the hope of making a connection. This is
the stuff of hacker mythology, the heroes of the computer revolution whose
main aim in life is to break into computer systems.
Their motivation, it seems, is not personal gain but to test their ingenuity
against the best defences computer scientists can build round their systems.
This week, hackers were in the limelight once more with a report from The
Independent newspaper that British Telecommunications' principal computers,
used to store its customer records, had been hacked into. Some of the
country's most sensitive unlisted telephone numbers - including MI5, MI6,
Downing Street and Buckingham Palace - were found and sent to a freelance
journalist, Mr Stephen Fleming, over the Internet, the global information
superhighway.
It was hardly the first time a telecommunications operator had been
compromised. In 1988, a hacker nicknamed 'Prophet' broke into BellSouth's
centralised automation system in Atlanta - Prophet was eventually sent to
prison after being caught with incriminating material.
But the BT case has been unusually public. Not since the Duke of Edinburgh's
el-ectronic mail box was hacked into in the early 1980s has there been so
much of a furore over the security of computer data. And computer abuse has
grown considerably since then.
Earlier this year, the Audit Commission reported a 300 per cent increase in
the past three years in all forms of computer abuse, including fraud, theft,
hacking and the unauthorised disclosure of personal data.
BT accepted that information had been taken from its system, and instituted
an immediate review of its security measures. But it denied that its
computers had been 'hacked'. This position depends to some extent on a
definition of hacking.
Most people take it to mean using clever methods to overcome the system's
defences. But Mr Fleming, who obtained temporary employment at BT, is quoted
as saying: 'To my amazement I found passwords were openly distributed.'
Computer security experts everywhere will have shaken their heads wearily at
these words. The BT affair has confirmed, yet again, their collective view
that poor password discipline is the biggest single cause of computer
security breaches.
People like to believe in the hacker mythology; they like the mystery and
the taste of electronic wizardry. But it serves to distract attention from
the fact that computer security in most commercial organisations is poor or
non-existent.
KPMG Peat Marwick, the business consultancy, surveyed some 138 large
companies this year; the results show that almost 30 per cent of companies
either did not report or investigate breaches of computer security. Many
could not even say with certainty whether their systems had been attacked.
Some 27 per cent were either unsure or stated categorically that their
networks were not secure from unauthorised use.
Mr Gerry Penfold, KPMG partner with responsibility for computer audit, said:
'It seems that companies continue to be oblivious of the commercial risks
they are running, choosing to ignore obvious dangers.'
BT now faces an investigation by the data protection registrar. Under the
principles of the Data Protection Act, any companies with personal
information about customers on their computers have to take reasonable care
to keep that information confidential. Breaking a principle of the act is
not in itself a criminal offence; but if a company ignores the registrar's
advice on future security procedures, it could be liable for prosecution.
Such security is largely a matter of commercial compromise. Companies can
have as much security as they are prepared to pay for. These levels are
spelt out in the US in the Department of Defence Orange Book and in Europe
in the EU's White Book.
A password provides some security. The addition of a call-back mo-dem, so
that users are called back by the computer, provides more. And double,
triple or greater combinations of passwords offer more security still.
The most sensitive government computer systems also have boxes built around
each terminal to stop people using a scanner to read the radio frequencies
that they emit.
But, essentially, systems are at most risk from their users. A virtually
secure system is possible, but the expense and inconvenience of guaranteeing
password discipline is usually impracticable. Most organisations settle for
password combinations.
And in practice, groups of people often share passwords to make
administration easier. Others write them down - not unreasonably, in some
cases. Professor Henry Becker of Zergo, a security consultancy, cites a bank
with 40 passwords and identity codes.
The problem is really a cultural one. There is a lack of awareness of the
need for security. People who would never think of going out for lunch
leaving the cash drawer open, leave a computer terminal on and unattended
without a second thought.
As the Audit Commission has said: 'As information technology becomes a
normal part of the employees' work pattern, there is a risk of almost casual
disregard in protecting data. Managers and users must understand the value
of data and protect it before it gets lost or damaged - deliberately or
accidentally.' If the message gets home, hackers will have to win their
spurs the hard way.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Solution to share option tax relief
for executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL LANDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It would be a pity if the government reacts to recent publicity about
executive options by simply abolishing the income tax relief for approved
'discretionary' schemes. This would unnecessarily penalise participants in
the growing number of 'all-employee' share option schemes, which use the
'discretionary' scheme legislation because of the inflexibility of the
requirements for savings-related (SAYE) share options. It would also further
encourage employees to sell their shares immediately after exercising the
options, instead of holding on to them for a longer period.
If the government feels that tax relief for 'discretionary' schemes needs to
be restricted, may I suggest that it is continued for all schemes where
options are granted to employees generally. Limited tax relief should also
be available for executive options, but only in respect of those shares
which are still held for, say, two years after the option exercise date.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TIM BEECHEY-NEWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your inclusion of an indicator of social deprivation in the league
table of school results ('Schools' league tables', November 22) is one step
to providing more information about the achievement of the schools involved.
However, if the additional educational needs index, from which your
indicator was taken, is also an indicator of the amount of taxpayers' money
spent per pupil, then it is misleading not to include this figure as well.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Safety first, chancellor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK Budget ought, in normal circumstances, to dwarf in significance any
parliamentary event that occurs in the same week. This should be even truer
now that plans for spending and revenue are announced in one burst of
parliamentary fireworks. Yet next week's display will start not with the
Budget, but with the Conservative party's flirtation with collective suicide
on Monday.
If the government were to lose the vote on UK contributions to the European
budget, Mr Kenneth Clarke's day would become a damp squib. People's thoughts
would turn at once to the Labour party's shadow budget for 'investment, jobs
and fairness'. Yet Conservatives believe in self-interest. It seems
implausible that this motivation will desert them altogether on Monday.
Tuesday's Budget will probably still matter.
Mr Clarke has a good story to tell and will tell it with gusto, for in every
important respect economic performance has been better this year than the
Treasury foresaw a year ago. Then gross domestic product was expected to
grow by 2 1/2 per cent in 1994, but it grew 4.2 per cent in the year to the
third quarter; then the retail price index (excluding mortgage interest) was
forecast to rise 3 1/4 per cent in the year to the fourth quarter of 1994,
but it has risen only 2 per cent in the year to October; and then the public
sector borrowing requirement for 1994-95 was forecast to be Pounds 38bn,
while the Institute for Fiscal Studies and Goldman Sachs now forecast it at
a little over Pounds 30bn.
It is a great story. But it also opens a deep trap. The better the economy
is performing and the greater the government's unpopularity, the bigger the
temptation to bribe the electorate with dollops of its own money. Once
again, there would be large tax cuts at the peak of an expansion. Once
again, the necessary tightening of monetary policy would either be postponed
or be too little. Once again, a golden opportunity to sustain stable growth
would be thrown away.
Higher inflation
From the gap between the yield on conventional and index-linked gilts,
investors expect inflation to average 4 1/2 per cent in the medium term. For
them, therefore, this is another post-recession honeymoon, with higher
inflation to follow. Obtaining growth after a devaluation that followed a
deep recession is no miracle. But sustaining growth over many years would be
miraculous.
The currently unsustainable rate of growth, far from justifying postponement
of the tax increases due next financial year, makes them still more
important. There is no reason to suppose that the underlying trend rate of
economic growth is any faster than was thought a year ago. All that has
happened is that the economy is returning to its (unavoidably uncertain)
full-capacity level faster than was then expected. Correspondingly, the
fiscal position is also improving more quickly than then imagined.
Fiscal tightening
There are three reasons why there should be no discretionary reversal of the
planned fiscal tightening. The first is that on plausibly conservative
assumptions about full capacity - the level of output at which inflation
would remain stable - the public sector borrowing requirement would still be
about 3 per cent of gross domestic product at that point. This is the most
that would appear sustainable in the long term. If anything, the UK should
run a tighter cyclically adjusted PSBR than that.
Second, it cannot be sensible to approach full capacity at a growth rate of
more than 4 per cent a year. Should the further fiscal tightening due next
financial year prove too contractionary for the economy, offsetting
reductions in interest rates (or, more probably, slower increases) can
always be made. Such a further rebalancing would, in fact, be desirable.
Finally, if there are to be the usual electioneering bribes in the 1995 and
1996 Budgets, they need to be made from a more than sustainable base. While
there is no good economic reason to raise taxes one year only to lower them
a year later, it may still be necessary to raise them if the subsequent
lowering is politically pre-ordained. This is, admittedly, to treat voters
as idiots, but maybe they deserve that treatment.
So Mr Clarke should blow the government's trumpet, stick to his announced
plans for tax increases and focus attention on imaginative ideas for fiscal
reform. The treatment of savings is a mess. It would be good to wrap
tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas) together with personal equity
plans (Peps). It would be wonderful if the incentives for the unskilled
unemployed to work were to be improved. It would be still more remarkable if
the chancellor were to avoid introducing more of the distorting gimmicks
that all chancellors love.
Such fireworks are optional. What is essential is for the chancellor to
avoid falling into the trap of excessive stimulus that engulfed so many
predecessors. He made the right decisions last time. He should stick to them
this year.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Mr Major's dreadful week: The self-destructive habit of the
UK's Conservative party casts doubt on its will to govern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government finds itself trapped in a political world where a statement
of the obvious becomes an extraordinary cabinet suicide pact; where behind
every cock-up lurks a dark conspiracy.
Rightwing plotters tour the lobbies of Westminster collecting names in
support of a leadership challenge. A Tory deputy chairman finds his private
gloom about the party's electoral prospects splashed across the front pages
of the newspapers. A vice-chairman is obliged to resign after penning a
xenophobic attack on Britain's European partners. Yes, Mr John Major has had
another dreadful week.
So the next few days will provide yet another of those all-too-familiar
tests of the prime minister's authority. On Monday he faces a confidence
vote on legislation to increase Britain's contributions to Brussels. By
Wednesday morning he will know whether one of his enemies - possibly Mr
Norman Lamont, the former chancellor - has mustered the requisite 34
nominations to mount a formal challenge for the party leadership.
The odds are that Mr Major will win Monday's vote with room to spare. The
re-election on Thursday of the loyalist Sir Marcus Fox as chairman of the
backbench 1922 committee applied a brake on the Tories' slide into anarchy.
The broad hint yesterday from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, that
the government would offer a referendum before joining a single European
currency will provide a line of retreat for the softer rebels.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will follow by opening Monday's Commons
debate with a promise of a clampdown on European Union fraud. The
Eurosceptics will be assured that the Treasury's receipts from the
imposition of value-added tax on domestic fuel will not line the pockets of
crooked Italian wine producers. Even if a dozen irreconcilables were to
ignore such overtures and risk expulsion from the parliamentary party, the
votes of Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionists would save the government.
The betting on whether there will be a leadership contest is also on Mr
Major's side, but less certainly. A week ago, the notion seemed far-fetched.
Plenty of his backbenchers would be happy to see Mr Major depart 10 Downing
Street. But not enough were ready to attach their names publicly to a formal
challenge.
Now the mood, if not yet the cold arithmetic, has changed. Mr Major's
cabinet colleagues admit a contest is possible. Mr Lamont is said to be
ready to exact his revenge for his dismissal as chancellor 18 months ago. No
challenger would defeat Mr Major. But he might fatally wound him. Logic
dictates the threat will come to nothing, and the odds are still against.
But logic is a scarce commodity these days on the Tory backbenches.
Amid this hysteria, next Tuesday's Budget has been all but forgotten. It
might well pre-empt a leadership contest. Mr Clarke does not have a bag of
populist tricks to dispense to the panickers on the backbenches. But the
signs are that he will delight the rightwing with deeper spending cuts than
predicted. He will also publish projections for public borrowing that offer
the chance - if not the certainty - of income tax cuts before the general
election. Mr Clarke, described this week by one rightwing Tory as 'dodgy on
Europe but otherwise the best chancellor since the war', is assured of
another jump in his personal rating. Mr Major needs him, but must also envy
his chancellor's natural authority.
When the prime minister said 10 days ago that he would not tolerate a
rebellion by his party's Eurosceptics over Britain's increased contribution
to the Brussels budget, the conventional wisdom backed his judgment. By
making the vote an issue of confidence, he would avoid a repeat of the
trench warfare that nearly destroyed the government over the Maastricht
treaty. He would win quickly and decisively. This time no one could
resurrect the accusation of weakness.
That was the theory. But once again the prime minister and his cabinet
colleagues - the suggestion of an immediate showdown came first from Mr Hurd
and was backed strongly by Mr Clarke - underestimated the party's
malcontents. Mr Major has a House of Commons majority of 14, likely to fall
to 13 after next month's Dudley by-election. There are up to twice that
number of Conservative MPs whose central ambition is to oust him this side
of the next general election. If their efforts lead to defeat at the
election, they are prepared to countenance it.
Not all the putative rebels over Europe are driven by personal animosity.
Sir Teddy Taylor, the MP for Southend, has honourably opposed Brussels for
as long as anyone can remember.
Some are motivated by the conviction that the next few years mark Britain's
last chance to break away from an emerging European superstate. Mr William
Cash is widely regarded as a bore but he is a sincere one. Others represent
the curious relics of postwar chauvinism who tend to prop up their local
saloon bar before tucking into a traditional Sunday lunch. Like Mr Patrick
Nicolls, the Tory vice-chairman forced to resign after an outburst in his
local newspaper, they see Germany as a nation of warmongers and France as a
nation of collaborators.
But for a determined clique of irreconcilables, Europe provides the most
fertile ground on which to prosecute their assault on Mr Major's
premiership. They despise him. Their ambition is to depose him. For them,
plotting in the Commons corridors has become a way of life.
It was their enmity that forced Mr Major into the position of demanding that
everyone around the cabinet table sign up publicly to the threat that the
govern would resign if Monday's vote was lost. There could be no question,
as some of the malcontents were suggesting, of a defeat leading to nothing
more than Mr Major's replacement in 10 Downing Street by Mr Clarke or Mr
Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary.
Mr Clarke made the point first in a typically frank briefing for political
journalists. The full cabinet had backed the financing deal negotiated by
the prime minister in Edinburgh two years ago. If it could not get such an
international accord through the Commons it could not remain in power. No
member of the cabinet honourably could seek to avoid an election by dumping
Mr Major.
Even the rightwing members of the cabinet who grumbled initially about the
strategy admitted that it was a statement of the constitutionally obvious.
But in the present atmosphere, it was inevitable the decision would be
portrayed as a collective suicide pact. The irreconcilables - who are not
noted for their consistency and who have for so long criticised Mr Major as
a weak leader - now accused him of 'bullying' his party.
It may be that the prime minister will never be able to reassert real
authority; that after 15 years in office, the Conservative party has become
ungovernable. As it staggers from one mishap to another, many within the
administration have begun to admit such doubts.
The mood in the country will be the critical determinant. The malcontents
feed off the insecurity of the less committed majority on the Tory
backbenches. They in turn are driven by fear of losing their seats. The
government has been 20 or more points behind in the opinion polls for two
years. No past administration has ever made up so much lost ground. Maybe,
the waverers say to themselves, a new leader (and it would be Mr Clarke or
Mr Heseltine, not Mr Lamont) might just turn it around.
The scale of that task was outlined in the confidential memorandum prepared
by Mr John Maples, the Tory deputy chairman, and first published in the FT
at the start of the week. This included the observation that large pay
awards cause 'real offence' to disillusioned Conservative voters. With
painfully exquisite timing, the leak of the document coincided with the
announcement that Mr Cedric Brown, the chief executive of the privatised
monopoly British Gas, had been awarded a Pounds 205,000 a year annual pay
increase.
Save for his indiscreet language, Mr Maples' broader political assessment
contained few suprises. Voters are fed up with the government and it will
take more than a litany of populist promises from Mr Michael Howard, the
home secretary, to restore the Conservatives' reputation as the party of law
and order. Flooding the hospitals with highly-paid accountants has not
enhanced the party's efforts to appear a faithful guardian of the health
service.
Nor would anyone who has watched the party's clumsy attempts to destabilise
Mr Tony Blair, the newly-elected Labour leader, have been taken aback by Mr
Maples' judgment that he poses a threat to the Conservatives' grip on the
centre ground.
But it was the memorandum's frank admission that the economic recovery is
not delivering a political upturn that struck the most worrying chord with
nervous Tory MPs. They should have realised that virtue does not guarantee
electoral success. The combination of steady growth and low inflation is not
enough for most families to wipe out the costs of the recession and of the
biggest tax increases since the second world war. For the average Tory
voter, living standards, as Mr Maples admits, have been falling not rising.
On Tuesday, Mr Clarke will assure them that the tide is beginning to turn.
Virtue eventually will put money in people's pockets. If the party keeps its
nerve, a fifth election victory is still possible. By this time next week,
the present storm, like so many before it, might well have abated, giving Mr
Major once again the breathing space to begin rebuilding his government's
fortunes.
But as the weeks and months go by, it becomes harder and harder to see how
that will be possible before an election due in, at most, 2 1/2 years. It is
too early to be certain the position is irrecoverable. But one thing is
clear. The Conservative party must decide whether it really wants any longer
to govern Britain.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Man in the News: Italy's ultimate referee - Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The deepening problems of the Berlusconi government have turned the
political atmosphere in Rome venomous and conspiratorial. Wild rumours
circulate at high velocity. Emissaries have begun to test new alliances.
Knives are being sharpened to settle old scores.
In the corridors of parliament and newspaper newsrooms, the talk has ceased
to be whether Mr Silvio Berlusconi can survive as prime minister after being
placed under investigation for corruption this week. It is rather of when
and how he will go, and which government will come after.
Moving to centre stage is President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, the 76-year-old
head of state and one of Italy's most experienced politicians. From the
Quirinale Palace, once the residence of popes, he has been issuing terse
statements indicating obliquely how events should unfold.
The president has made no secret of his distaste for the media magnate
turned politician, and does not share Mr Berlusconi's view that he can
emerge fighting from the current crisis. Although Mr Scalfaro's
constitutional authority is limited, his role will be crucial as events
unfold. He has the power to dissolve parliament and to ask someone to form a
new government.
President Scalfaro is also recognised as the ultimate referee of Italy's
volatile political system. Thus he enjoys considerable powers of moral
suasion through making his own views known. To this must be added his
enormous experience, having entered politics in 1946 in Italy's first
postwar parliament.
During the six months of the Berlusconi administration, President Scalfaro
has frequently felt obliged to call the premier and his coalition to order.
From the outset, he warned Mr Berlusconi of the potential problems arising
from a conflict between his role as premier and his ownership of Fininvest,
Italy's second largest private group.
He intervened, for example, to remind the coalition that the RAI state
broadcasting network could not become a tool of government. He took the side
of the Bank of Italy when government tried to impose an outside candidate as
new director-general. And as head of the higher magistrates' council, the
governing body of the judiciary, he helped deflect government complaints
that the magistrates were victimising Mr Berlusconi.
On each occasion, his views have carried more weight than is strictly due to
the president, undermining the government's position. Indeed Mr Berlusconi
and his supporters see the president as a fifth column working to bring down
the rightwing coalition government.
Relations between the president and the government this week came close to
getting out of control. President Scalfaro was furious over the tone and
content of Tuesday's televised address by Mr Berlusconi, given when he
learnt that he was under investigation for alleged corruption while running
his business empire. Mr Berlusconi attacked the Milan magistrates for
conducting a vendetta against him, and threatened early elections.
Presidential aides promptly leaked to the media their views on Mr Berlusconi
 -'a naturally unpleasant man who believes he is simpatico to everyone'. The
Berlusconi camp countered, labelling Mr Scalfaro as 'the worst of the old
Christian Democrats concentrated in one pill'.
Matters were made worse when Mr Giuseppe Tatarella, the deputy prime
minister, warned President Scalfaro that he was in no position to moralise
when he had his own dirty linen. Mr Tatarella alluded to Mr Scalfaro's links
while interior minister between 1983 and 1987 with the discredited
intelligence services. His name was frequently mentioned during a recent
trial of senior members of the services found guilty of embezzling more than
Dollars 50m, who alleged he was aware of their practices while interior
minister. This is Mr Scalfaro's most sensitive spot - and could yet weaken
his position.
However, the president was reportedly so angry at these insinuations, he
postponed for 24 hours a formal meeting with Mr Berlusconi to discuss the
future of the government. After the meeting, held yesterday, the
presidential office refused to comment and it was left to the prime minister
to say doggedly: 'There is no war with the Quirinale and it was a normal
discussion as on every other occasion.'
However, Mr Berlusconi failed to obtain the message of support from the
president he needs to help him survive. He and President Scalfaro are at
odds on almost every aspect of how to proceed.
The only common ground seems to be a realisation that a financial crisis
cannot be added to the political uncertainty. Both are agreed that priority
must be given to passing the 1995 budget through parliament. This means the
prime minister need not resign immediately just because he is under
investigation by Milan magistrates for as-yet unproven allegations of
corruption.
But Mr Scalfaro has already begun to sound out the prospects for a successor
government. He is against a quick dissolution of parliament, since the last
elections were only in March. He wants to build a broad-based government
that would look to the Popular party (PPI) - the former Christian Democrats
 -in the centre and would embrace the former communist party of the
Democratic Left (PDS). This new coalition would probably not include the
neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, the current mainstay of Mr Berlusconi's
government along with his Forza Italia movement. Its task would be limited
to rewriting the defective electoral laws of August 1993 and introducing
constitutional reforms.
Mr Berlusconi, in contrast, sees his only real chance of survival in staying
close to the MSI/National Alliance and going to the country as quickly as
possible. He would hope to cast himself in the role of a victim of the old
political system. In this scenario, Mr Scalfaro, elected in 1992 by a
subsequently discredited parliament, would be presented as one of the chief
villains.
The stage is now set for a show-down between the president and the prime
minister. With political guile pitted against an inexperienced premier
cornered like a wounded animal, the odds must be on Mr Scalfaro getting his
way.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Top annuity rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER QUINTON, Annuity Bureau
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite Generali increasing its annuity rates by 1.5%, the downward trend
has continued, writes Peter Quinton of the Annuity Bureau. Canada Life moved
its annuity rates down by 0.8% on November 21, and, on November 22, three
other life companies, London Life, Prudential and Abbey Life chose to reduce
their rates by 1.1%, 1% and 0.08%, respectively. The downward trend is in
part due to actuaries responding to a reduction in gilt yields.
An annuity provides a guaranteed income for life in return for a lump sum
investment. The bulk of the fund built up by many types of pension plan must
be used in this way. This week's table shows COMPULSORY PURCHASE ANNUITY
RATES which are used for small company schemes and additional voluntary
contribution plans (AVCs) and freestanding AVCs (FSAVCs) among others. This
week's rates include inflation proofing.
