FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (23): Ambitious rivals for the big prize /
Profile of Mannesmann's Peter Mihatsch and Telekom's Helmut Ricke
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
When Mr Peter Mihatsch looks out of his first floor office in Dusseldorf he
has an inspiring view of the river Rhine. Vast concrete and steel bridges
tower over Europe's mightiest river which flows north as far as the eye can
see.
It is an inspiring view and leaves one feeling spectator in little doubt
that the world is there for the taking.
In Bonn, Mr Helmut Ricke has a far less interesting view - a cityscape of
small office blocks and detached houses.
The different views from their offices reflect their contrasting styles.
Mr Mihatsch heads the telecommunications division at Mannesmann, the first
German company to take on Deutsche Telekom, the State-owned telecoms
operator run by Mr Ricke which is soon to be privatised.
Both men have ambitious plans. Mr Mihatsch's operation is tiny compared with
Telekom, but he is looking to expand it rapidly. Mr Ricke, on the other
hand, has taken Telekom into joint ventures across Europe and the globe, but
knows that as competition from companies such as Mannesmann intensifies,
Telekom, which still largely enjoys a monopoly, will stand to lose.
In 1990, Mr Mihatsch moved from Mannesmann Kienzle, a company which makes
equipment for commercial vehicles and is part of Mannesmann, the engineering
and automotive technology group, one of Germany's top 20 companies in sales
terms.
He was charged with setting up Germany's first private mobile phone network,
a bold new venture for a company which had become almost synonymous with
steel piping.
It has been a startling success and set an example which others are racing
to follow.
The division is expected to report sizeable earnings for 1994, the first
full year in profit. Sales are expected to top DM1.5bn for the year, making
it the fastest growing unit within the Mannesmann group.
What the pipes did for the company's image pales in comparison with its
profile among millions of people reached by its aggressive advertising
campaign for its D2 mobile phone network.
Mr Mihatsch's success has earned him a seat on the seven-strong Mannesmann
management board but he seems far from excited about it.
The Mr Ricke chooses his words more carefully. He has to avoid upsetting the
government ministers who are his masters or provoking the powerful trade
unions. During a discussion about the needs of Germany's rapidly changing
telecommunications industry, he pauses to consider the exact title of the
new law that will be needed.
The contrasting style also reflects the fact that whereas Mr Mihatsch only
has around 2,500 employees, Mr Ricke has to lead 224,000 people, many of
whom realise that they may lose their jobs as Telekom is privatised.
Before moving to Telekom in 1990, Mr Ricke spent 12 years running Loewe
Opta, a leading manufacturer of telecoms equipment. He had, for a while,
been a member of the technical council which advised Telekom and was singled
out by the then post minister to take over as chief executive.
The job has often been described as one of the most difficult in Germany,
requiring the incumbent to dodge and weave among political minefields and
showdowns with the unions while all the time ensuring that Telekom is as
well placed as possible to tap a fast-moving market in which the competition
becomes ever fiercer.
The State's responsibility to run the telephone network used to be enshrined
in the Constitution. So even the Constitution had to be changed earlier this
year. The mentality at Telekom has also had to change. When Mr Ricke took
over, the supervisory board - which oversees the management board -
frequently found itself debating whether Telekom's national and
international plans were constitutional or not.
Such distractions are no longer necessary and Telekom has been transformed
beyond recognition. It will become a joint stock company on January 1, 1995
and is expected to be listed on the stock exchange early in 1996. It used to
be a company focused entirely on Germany and supplied mainly by German
telecoms manufacturers such as Siemens; now around 28 per cent of the
suppliers come from outside Germany.
Customer service should also improve now that most Telekom employees are no
longer civil servants.
Telekom has ambitious plans for international expansion: together with
France Telecom it has a joint venture with Sprint, the US long distance
carrier; it has taken a stake in MATAV, the Hungarian telecoms operator; has
interests in the Ukraine and may become involved in the Czech Republic.
Turnover is forecast to reach DM80bn by 2000, up from the DM69bn planned for
next year.
Yet while others are looking forward to capturing market share, Telekom, the
one-time monopolist, has to give it up. If Mannesmann and other
operatorshave their way, Mr Ricke or his successor will have to surrender
the cable television network to an independent company which would allow
equal access for all competitors.
Even if Telekom keeps the network, the European Commission is at some point
likely to allow competition from the so-called corporate networks,
alternative nets built on the infrastructure which big companies such as
utilities have available.
Following the success of the D2 mobile phone network, Mr Mihatsch is
weighing up what he might do next.
That seems to be is style: when he finished studying electronic engineering
in Munich he rush into industry but preferred to do research work on plasma
physics. 'I wanted to step back a bit and get a better overall picture,' he
says.
Like Mr Ricke, he is looking abroad - to see where he can use the D2
know-how elsewhere in Europe and where Mannesmann and its partners can
supply new networks.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (21): A market is born -
Telecommunications unchained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dynamics of the telecommunications business have once again proved
irresistible, writes Christopher Parkes.
The latest demonstration of the market's momentum occurred in Bonn in
mid-September when the German postal ministry performed an unexpected
about-face.
Mr Wolfgang Botsch, post minister, setting aside objections from Deutsche
Telekom and European Union colleagues, announced he was no longer inclined
to delay liberalisation of Germany's monopoly on telecommunications.
Instead, he favoured opening networks to competition on January 1, 1998, the
date previously set by the EU for liberalising markets for telecoms services
(provided through links rented from the mostly state monopolies).
In a clear signal to Paris that the unwritten go-slow alliance between
Germany and France was at an end, he said Bonn would consider going it alone
in the absence of consensus.
Since the deadline - early 1996 - for the first tranche of the privatisation
of the existing state monopoly had already been fixed, Mr Botsch's
announcement completed the timetable for the opening of the free-market era
in the German telecoms sector.
The U-turn was all the more striking in the light of the German government's
earlier foot-dragging. For example, Bonn initially interpreted and applied
the 1989 EU regulation allowing the transmission of speech within closed
user groups in its most restrictive form.
Although the regulation was intended to allow companies to use their own
networks freely for internal voice telephone services, the German
interpretation said permission would not be granted for groups made up of
legally independent subsidiaries.
Only under pressure from eminent companies such as BASF chemicals and
Colonia insurance, did Bonn finally relent: at the end of 1992. It was not
until mid-1992 that the first licence for a private mobile phone service was
granted to a consortium led by Mannesmann.
However, Mr Botsch's latest statements prompted the leading private
contenders for a share of the market to spring promptly into action. The
energy-based conglomerates, primarily RWE, Veba and Viag, better known for
their protectionist attitudes towards their electricity distribution
'rights' than for their competitive instincts, strove to catch the
investors' eye with the unveiling of grander and grander designs.
Veba, for example, scored something of a coup when it announced an agreement
in principle with the federal railways, allowing it to lay its cables and
optical fibres along the national track and signalling networks. The group,
proclaimed chairman, Mr Ulrich Hartmann, was to invest DM6bn, create 10,000
jobs and take a 10 per cent share of a DM100bn-a-year market by 2003. Days
later, RWE claimed it was to fatten its product portfolio by taking over
Preussag's mobile phone business.
Supported by the influential DIHT federal chamber of trade and industry, the
newcomers have since harassed Mr Botsch increasingly with demands for access
to the market even before the start of 1998.
The pressure from the private sector for 'freedom now' stems partly from the
desire to spread their networks and their wings in the interests of gaining
practical experience, the better to compete at home and elsewhere with
established private operators from the US and the UK.
But the main attraction is the conviction that glittering prizes await the
front runners. In less than 10 years, the prophets say, telecoms in all its
manifestations could be Germany's biggest-selling industry, outstripping
automobiles and engineering.
The scale of the prospective profits defies calculation, but even the most
conservative estimates appear dramatic. For example, a basic comparison
carried out in 1992 showed telecommunications sales per head of population
in the US were DM960 a year compared with DM520 in Germany. Market analysts
have extrapolated that this alone implies a sales 'gap' of DM20bn a year to
be bridged, even before additional services and products are taken into
account.
Veba, for example, forecasts double-digit annual growth in some services in
the period from 1993 to the end of 1997. It envisages a 22 per cent a year
potential expansion in mobile telephones, 32 per cent in added value
services and 15 per cent annually in cable television (excluding pay TV). By
2003, the company says, Germany's main markets will be worth almost DM100bn.
But ambition is one thing and reality is another. Despite considerable
heavyweight public/investor relations work, the energy distributors'
projects have failed to ignite investors' interest. One possible reason is
that the proliferation of contenders and consortium partners has made it
difficult to pick winners. The relatively long-term nature of most of their
projects also suggests there is no need to rush.
Analysts have chosen the energy groups as the most obvious because of their
existing infrastructural advantages: electricity distribution networks
already equipped with copper cable or optical fibres, and experience
operating extensive internal data and telephony services.
Although there will certainly be plenty of niches for service providers
without networks of their own, such a role has already been rejected by the
Preussag steel and engineering group, which recently sold its burgeoning
mobile telephone business to RWE. But even some of those deemed most likely
to succeed are taking a circumspect view.
Viag, which is reputed to have the most extensive optical fibre network  -
some 4,000km courtesy of its Bayernwerk subsidiary - recently excluded
telecoms from a list of future 'core' activities. It was placed instead
among 'supplementary' businesses which might in future become mainstream
operations.

VIAG: Has extensive cable and optical fibre network, but used almost
exclusively for internal voice and data transmission. Has founded TB&amp;D
Telekommunikation subsidiary which has been linked up with the internal
network of Bayerische Hypobank. Believed to be trying to extend network
through deals with regional electricity distributors, but has no stakes in
other telecoms businesses and nil experience of operating in private sector.
Aims to win a 7 per cent share of domestic private telecoms market
(DM600m-700m) by 1998.
RWE: Actively building stakes and interests in promising consortiums and
partnerships, with plans to invest DM1.5bn by the end of the decade and
reach break-even a year earlier. Entire telecoms interests recently bundled
together in RWE Unitel AG. Analysts suggest relatively constipated progress
is due to the conglomerate's bureaucratic, politicised planning mechanisms.
The group is controlled by local governments from the Ruhr region, with
dozens of important posts filled by civil servants or politicians.
VEBA: Would-be telecoms power house among the power companies. Plans to
invest DM6bn by 2003, looking for foreign partner for its newly-formed
Vebacom subsidiary which bundles together its stakes in nine separate
businesses spanning the whole telecoms spectrum from cable TV to satellite
communications. Veba's projects, pushed through against resistance from
traditionalist board by new chairman, Mr Ulrich Hartmann. They are also
being enthusiastically promoted by one of the most effective investor
relations teams in Germany.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (20): A bitter legacy of Communism - Who
owns the land / Judy Dempsey recounts the battle of the title deeds
</HEADLINE>

'The restructuring of land in eastern Germany has proved to be one of the
most difficult processes the Treuhand privatisation agency has had to face,'
said Mr Otto Bammell.
As a senior official at the agriculture ministry, Mr Bammell has seen how
property has pitted east German against west German, revived old family
feuds, and has convinced many experts that the German government's decision
to allow restitution before compensation in 1990 may now have been a
mistake. 'We have the law. We have to make the most of it,' said Mr Bammell.
Under the terms of the unification treaty, former Nazi victims and those
whose land was confiscated by the Nazis have full right to restitution and
compensation. This right also applies to people whose land was confiscated
by the communists between 1949 and 1990.
When, in late 1990, the Treuhand started applying the law to agriculture in
a bid to privatise 1.2m hectares of east German land, it soon ran into
difficulties.
At that time, the agency had two aims. It wanted to restructure the region's
agriculture, which meant breaking up the Landwirtschaftliche
Produktionsgenossenschaften, or LPGS, the large cooperatives, and the
Volkseigene Guter, or VEGs, the state farms; and then it wanted to sell the
property. This entailed the loss of thousands of jobs in the agricultural
sector. Indeed, the unemployment rate in the countryside is in some cases as
high as 70 per cent.
Soon after German unification, the agency began selling agricultural land.
But many of the buyers were coming from west Germany. 'The east Germans felt
aggrieved. They felt there were being colonised,' explained Mr Bammell.
'They had little chance to buy land because they had no capital. There was
terrible tension in the countryside. We decided we had to give the
easterners a chance. So we introduced a new system. We would lease land to
the easterners at preferential prices,' he added. The leases were based on
short-term three-year contracts, or long-term 12-year ones.
But no sooner had the Treuhand embarked on this plan than its officials
discovered that many questions concerning property rights stipulated in the
unification treaty would have to be tackled.
For instance, the Treuhand soon realised that when it wanted to lease land
to east (or west) Germans, it had to make sure that there were no
outstanding claims on the property.
'In some cases, the east Germans complained that they received only
short-term contracts of about three years, compared with some west Germans
who managed to obtain 12-year contracts,' said Mr Bammell. 'The problem
facing the agency was that it was afraid to extend long contracts in case
former property owners had already put in a claim. What could the Treuhand
do with an east German long-term leaseholder if a former owner wanted to
come back?'
The Treuhand was faced with another problem. It was often difficult to
ascertain who originally owned the land. The example of the LPGs explains
why. These state farms were created from land expropriated by the former
Soviet Union which had ruled eastern Germany between 1945 and 1949, and from
small landholders who in 1952 were forced to place their plots in the LPG.
In many cases, the original land register was closed and a new one was
created which stipulated that the owner of the LPG was the east German
state. However, the Treuhand is now finding that former owners have been
able to trace the original land registers. As a result, they are now
claiming their land back.
'This has inevitably slowed down the whole process of leasing land,' said Mr
Bammell. 'If land has been leased, even for a short time, and if the former
owner can prove legal title to it, then the Treuhand can allow the lease to
run its full term. But once the lease has expired, the Treuhand must pass on
to the original owner the rent from the leaseholder'.
This sense of uncertainty about who owns land in eastern Germany has been
compounded by another factor: former land owners, usually belonging to the
Prussian aristocracy, whose land was expropriated by the Soviet
administration.
These owners have no right to restitution but have a right to buy back their
land, rent it, or, following a law passed last September, to limited
compensation.
'After unification, these former large landowners hesitated to buy back
their property. They were waiting to see what kind of compensation law would
be agreed,' said Mr Bammell. But in the process, the privatisation - and
investment in east German agriculture - was delayed.
As a means of speeding up the privatisation of land, the German government
gave investors priority over restitution claims. This law allows individuals
wishing to buy land in eastern Germany to circumvent outstanding property
rights claims if they can prove to the Treuhand that they will invest and
create jobs. In some cases, this has meant that a former landowner can only
get the land back if he or she can match that investment plan.
'The east Germans simply do not have the money to compete with the west
Germans,' said Mr Werner Loranz, an east German who, along with 14 other
colleagues, farms 1,300 hectares in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
Despite the scale of these problems, the Treuhand has drawn up 9,000
contracts which involves leasing 90,000 hectares based on short-term
contracts, and a further 788,000 hectares based on long-term contracts. 'I
think the turmoil in east German agriculture is nearly at an end. But it has
been a high price to pay.'

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (19): Survivors from the flood - Eastern
chemicals are saved from extinction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
East Germany's chemical industry has already found a place in the history
books and in novels.
In April 1936, as part of his re-armament and industrial programme, Hitler
created a giant synthetic rubber manufacturing complex in Buna, now in the
state of Saxony-Anhalt. Production started a mere seven months later. By
1944, the Buna plant was producing 6,000 tonnes a month and meeting half the
Reich's total needs.
After 1945, Buna was placed under the Soviet administration, which soon
re-started production. In 1953, the industry was placed under the east
German communist state. By 1990, more than 83,600 people were working in the
chemical sector.
Until German unification in 1990, the chemical triangle, as it is known,
encompassing the regions of Halle, Merseburg and Bitterfeld in
Saxony-Anhalt, was considered one of the key sectors of the east German
economy. But that sector also spewed out enormous levels of pollution, the
effects of which are documented in a novel by Monika Maron called Flugasche
(fly-ash).
As a young journalist in the 1970s, Ms Maron was sent to the chemical
triangle to write an ideologically glowing report about the industry. What
she found instead was illness, waste and inefficiency. After deviating from
her subject - she chose to write the truth - she was duly sacked. She is now
a successful novelist living in western Germany.
When the Treuhand privatisation agency took over Buna and the entire
chemical industry in 1991, it was faced with a choice: to close down or keep
Buna open. The decision was fundamental. West Germany had built up its own
chemicals industry after the second world war, begging the question on
unification as to whether a chemical industry was also needed in eastern
Germany.
After the Treuhand opted to keep the region's chemical sector alive, it
embarked on a massive restructuring which will cost a total of DM14bn by the
time it is complete. No sooner had the agency made this decision than it was
faced with another question: could the sector become competitive?
Mr Klaus Schucht, the Treuhand's board member responsible for modernising
east Germany's chemical industry, has no doubts. 'From a social and
political point of view, we need this industry. But I have no hesitation in
saying that we will make it competitive,' he said recently.
After reducing the work-force by 60,000, the agency planned the following
shape for the chemicals sector: Bitterfeld, Buna, and Leuna (which has an
oil-refinery complex), would produce basic chemicals; Buna and Leuna would
also produce polymers, a chemical substance; the cracking, a process whereby
inflammable oils are obtained by dry distillation of organic substances,
especially coal and petroleum, would take place at Bohlen and Leuna; the
refining would be carried out at Leuna, Lutzendorf and Zeitz; and the
distribution would be carried out by Minol, the petrol distribution company.
The aim is to secure 12,000 jobs and invest more than DM14bn in modernising
east Germany's chemical industry. But it is the future of Buna, which will
produce PVCs, or plastics, which will determine the success of the entire
project.
The Treuhand has earmarked over DM2.8bn of investments for modernising Buna
and Bohlen, the location of the cracking facility, as part of its plan to
create a fully integrated petrochemical complex.
This year, Buna will have a turnover of DM800m on losses of about DM300m.
But under one of the most ambitious schemes undertaken by the Treuhand, it
hopes Buna will break even within five years, thanks to a partnership
between Dow Chemical, the US-based chemical manufacturers, and Gazprom, the
state-owned Russian gas company and the Treuhand.
Under the terms of the recent letters of intent, Dow Chemical will take a
majority independent stake of Buna, and Gazprom will take a minority stake.
(The Treuhand will retain 49 per cent, with the option of reducing it once
the investment programme has been complete.)
Buna will produce 1m-1.5m tonnes of polyethylene. The crucial issue for
making Buna competitive is the price it will pay for its energy. At present,
electricity produced at the nearby power plant at Schkopau is too expensive.
Mr Schucht believes part of this energy problem can be solved through
Gazprom, which is seeking a 26 per cent stake in Buna, and which will give
one of Russia's largest and most lucrative state-run companies a foothold in
the German chemicals industry.
'We said to Gazprom that we are offering you the possibility of producing
plastics in east Germany. We want its liquid gas - the C2s, C3s and C4
gases. And in any case, Gazprom has to do something with these gases at its
Yamal fields (in Siberia),' said Mr Schucht. To make the entire project
cost-effective, Gazprom's gas, which Buna requires, will have to be shipped
to eastern Germany at competitive prices.
The Treuhand is considering two options on how to ship the 20bn cubic metres
of gas needed annually for Buna. One way is via Tscherepoweck in Russia,
where the C3 gases will be shipped up to the harbour at Vyborg, transported
through Poland to the east German port of Rostock and then transported via a
pipe line to the cracker at Bohlen. The other option is through the Ukraine,
but Russia wants to reduce its dependence on the Ukraine.
'The key factor is that the transport costs cannot be higher than the prices
of the feedstock in Bohlen', explained Mr Schucht. To realise this project,
the Russians would have to build a pipeline at Yamal. Experts estimate the
pipeline would cost between Dollars 30bn-Dollars 40bn.
Yet even if the relationship with Gazprom works according to plan, the
Treuhand may still have to convince the European Commission that the level
of investments it is allocating to Buna will not amount to subsidies. 'The
capacity is there. But we are trying to build new capacity with a lower cost
structure of about 30 per cent,' said Mr Schucht.
Despite the high risks, the Treuhand believes the east German chemical
sector can become competitive and that its location will prove a
considerable advantage once the economies of eastern Europe pick up. That is
one of the reasons Dow Chemical has chosen to invest in Buna. If this
ambitious, heavily-capitalised project is successful, east Germany's
chemical sector will no longer carry the stigma of feeding Hitler's war and
industrial machine, or being remembered by east Germans as one of the
country's worst polluters.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (18): Exit the liquidator / Profile of
Birgit Breuel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MRS BIRGIT BREUEL is particularly fond of three public comments which she
made in her years as head of the Treuhand agency, which has privatised,
liquidated or rationalised the former state properties of the German
Democratic Republic.
Her first was her description of how she started work at the agency in
October 1990. 'We had very few experience people. We had no rules. We did
not even have a list of companies, let alone balance sheets,' she said.
Her second bon mot concerned the Treuhand's philosophy: 'Our aim was not so
much to sell the enterprises, but to buy management for the east German
enterprises.'
But her most famous (or notorious) comment was in reply to journalists'
questions about about her past, her future or about sensitive investment
contracts. 'No Comment. I do not have to answer that question,' she would
say.
Recently, however, she has suddenly become more forthcoming. This is not
surprising. With the Treuhand due to wind up most of its work by the end of
the year, Mrs Breuel is preparing to try her hand at something new, as
Commissioner General of the World Fair Expo 2000 to be held next year in
Hanover.
It will be a relief from the daily grind of the Treuhand where Mrs Breuel, a
former finance minister of Lower Saxony, has put in at least 12 hours a day.
'She comes into the office at about 7.15 and leaves between 8pm and 9pm,' a
colleague says. 'And when she leaves, she carries a big bag with her - full
of work.'
Mrs Breuel, who read politics at Oxford University, does not drink, smokes
moderately, and lives in a small 75 square meter apartment in Mitte, the
heart of east Berlin, with a view of the Brandenburg Gate. 'She goes home to
her family at the weekend, but more often than not, her husband and two sons
visit her,' her colleague added. Her third son died from cancer in December
1990, three months after she joined the Treuhand board.
Her commitment to the Treuhand meant foregoing many official functions.
Indeed, when Queen Elizabeth visited Berlin in 1992, Mrs Breuel, who had
been invited to one of the receptions, politely declined. 'She stayed in the
office because she work to do,' her colleague said.
In the early days of the Treuhand's existence, east Germans loathed the
agency because it closed so many factories and sharply reduced factory
manning levels. Some foreign investors saw the Treuhand as a west German
mafia intend on keeping foreign investors out of east Germany.
Politicians blamed it for the ills of the east German economy. Mrs Breuel
herself admits it was a convenient scapegoat. 'But no politician could have
taken our decisions,' she says.
The end of her stint at the Treuhand means that Mrs Breuel will perhaps have
more time to pursue her hobbies, such as gardening. With a little luck, she
might have more time to do this after December 30 of this year, her last
working day at the Treuhand.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (17): The sale is nearly over - Judy
Dempsey records the Treuhand's high-speed achievements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Four years ago, the Treuhand, the world's largest privatisation agency,
vowed to complete its operations by the end of 1994.
Set up to sell privatise the businesses of former communist eastern Germany,
the Treuhand then had on its books 13,700 state-owned enterprises, together
with 25,000 restaurants, hotels, pharmacies, bookshops and cinemas, and
40,800 pieces of land.
Its forecast seemed hopelessly ambitious. However, despite the enormous
scale of its portfolio, the agency has adhered to its timetable. Come the
new year, the Treuhand, which east Germans, at least in the early days,
hated with a vengeance, will cease to exist.
But this does not mean its task is ended. Although most of its work has been
completed, a new structure, which will begin its operations on January 1 and
will be entrusted with privatising the few remaining companies in its
portfolio. Part of the finance ministry, it will be called the
Beteiligungs-Management-Gesellschaft Berlin. The BMBG, as it is known, will
have an administrative budget of DM5m and will be divided into three
sections.
The first section will look after about 100 companies with more than 20,000
employees. So far 80 of these enterprises have been placed under the
so-called Management KGs, companies which are run by west German managers
who have a free hand to restructure them and prepare them for privatisation.
Separate from the Management KGs is a small group of partly privatised
companies in which the Treuhand holds a stake, or companies about to be
privatised. These include the SKET machine-building and engineering complex
in Magdeburg in the state of Saxony-Anhalt; Eko Stahl, east Germany's
largest steel mill in Brandenburg, of which a part is being sold to
Cockerill-Sambre, the Belgian steel producers; and Kali und Salz, the potash
mines in Thuringia.
Also under the BMBG is a section called the Auslaufaktivitaten, which will
supervise the completion of environmental clean-ups and land reclamation,
particularly in the lignite, or brown-coal fields. A small section within
the BMBG will look after the financing and legal issues, as well as
relations between the European Union and the five east German states.
Then there is the contracts department, which monitors all current
investment commitments and job guarantees. This department will remain under
the privatised Bundesanstalt fur vereinigungsbedingtes Sondervermogen (BVS),
while the Liegenschaftsgesellschaft der Treuhandanstalt (TLG) will continue
to exist for some time until it has completed the privatisation, or renting,
of east Germany's land and forests.
All told, the successor to the Treuhand will employ 45,000 and will have a
budget of DM8bn from 1995 until 1998. The total deficit over this period
will amount to DM45bn-DM55bn, which is already part of the Treuhand's total
debt of DM270bn.
The Treuhand's rapid pace of privatisation is illustrated by the statistics.
By the beginning of October 1994, only 354 of the 13,781 former communist
enterprises remained on its books. The entire retailing sector, including
the small shops, cinemas, bookshops and pharmacies, had been quickly
privatised in 1991 and 1992.
The agency says it has secured investment commitments exceeding DM206bn,
guarantees of more than 1.4m jobs, and proceeds from sales of nearly DM65bn.
But the tax payer will have to carry the Treuhand's DM270bn debt for many
years to come. The debt has arisen because of the Treuhand's philosophy. 'We
actually bought management for these enterprises, rather than sold the
enterprises,' Mrs Birgit Breuel, the outgoing president of the agency,
repeatedly explained.
Essentially this meant that in order to attract investors the Treuhand had
to pick up old debts and loans from east German enterprises which by the end
of 1994 will have totalled DM80bn. The agency had to provide an additional
DM15bn for capital increases, a further DM66bn for guarantees which provided
the enterprises with liquidity, and an additional DM8bn was allocated by the
Treuhand for enterprises that were unable to finance lump-sum severance
payments on their own.
With such a large debt, the question remains whether the Treuhand will have
created the conditions for a thriving privatised sector which will not only
expand but will help absorb some of the unemployment which officially is
running at 15 per cent. Unofficially it is 35 per cent when short-time work,
job creation and retraining schemes are taken into account.
The omens at present do not appear bright. The investment commitments and
job guarantee contracts undertaken by investors have been too ambitious. 'It
is true that their expectations about finding markets were too high,' said
Mr Heinrich Hornef, the Treuhand's financial officer. As a result, Mr Hero
Brahms, a Treuhand board member, said that the agency's contracts department
is at any one time renegotiating 10 per cent of all contracts. 'We do
everything possible to extend the timetable for investment commitments. The
thing we don't want to do is to buy back enterprises,' added Mr Brahms.
Nevertheless, many contracts for job guarantees include an obligation by the
investor to employ short-time staff, even if there is no work available. The
result is that this has delayed an increase in productivity, which is still
extremely low in the steel, machine-tool, and scientific instruments sector.
In these cases, productivity is still 40 per cent of west German levels,
thereby pushing up labour unit costs in the east. Last year, GDP per
employee in eastern Germany was 46 per cent of the level in the west, but
per capita wages and salaries rose to 70 per cent. In short, eastern unit
labour costs are 44 per cent above those in west Germany.
Another problem for east Germany's privatised sector is that it is not yet
competitive enough for the export market. The Bundesbank, Deutsche Bank and
the Berlin-based DIW economics institute have all shown that east Germany
still contributes only two per cent to Germany's total Gross Domestic
Product. 'The export potential of the east German economy still remains low
and this sector has not yet come out of the trough,' said a recent Deutsche
Bank Research report.
The share of exports in aggregate demand, including deliveries to eastern
Germany, is one-fifth, compared with west Germany's one third. And of total
domestic spending, a significant part is spent on imports, which are still
almost as high as GDP.
This implies that east German output only covers slightly more than half of
aggregrate demand.
Finally, the privatised sector remains seriously undercapitalised. A special
fund was recently set up by the finance ministry and the east German states
to extend fresh capital for investments and marketing. But this problem is
expected to remain for some time.
Treuhand officials think there is a bright side, however: the east German
economy is expected to grow by about eight per cent next year, although this
increase is coming from a very low base - the region's GDP fell by 30 per
cent between 1990 and 1992.
But any economic upswing is crucial for the Treuhand whose officials admit
that the real test for the agency is when the investment commitment and job
guarantee contracts end. When they do, managers will be given a free hand to
reassess their labour costs. That will inevitably affect their decisions
about reducing or increasing the work force. If the economic upswing
continues, the Treuhand might be able to say it has created conditions for a
vibrant privatised sector. But no one is placing bets. Just as few believed
the Treuhand would cease to exist after 1994.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (16): Local government targeted -
Privatisation thrust is renewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Hintze, the general secretary of the Christian Democratic Union
(CDU), the largest of the three parties in Germany's centre-right coalition
government, did not take long to come to the point.
Minutes after emerging from the first session of talks between the CDU and
its two coalition partners to shape a new coalition programme he was talking
about the need for more privatisation.
The government, Mr Hintze said, would trim the federal bureaucracy by 1 per
cent a year - about 14,000 jobs - and cut back the excessive amounts of red
tape as part of a drive to modernise Germany.
However, while Chancellor Helmut Kohl's new government has vowed to maintain
the momentum of privatisation, most of what still needs to be done is in the
hands of Germany's 16 Lander (or state) governments and reaches down to
local councils across the country who are under growing pressure to contract
out an array of services from waste disposal to parks management.
Since coming to power in 1982 the CDU-led government has drawn in its
tentacles and pushed many industries and services into the private sector,
raising DM11.6bn in the process. Lufthansa, the national carrier, has been
privatised. The railways have been turned into a joint stock company as a
first step to privatisation and Deutsche Telekom will be listed on the stock
exchange in 1996.
'The privatisation of conventional industry is basically finished,' said a
senior finance ministry official. 'You need a magnifying glass to find any
holdings we still have in larger companies.'
The government has said it will now redouble its efforts to get the state
governments to sell their industrial holdings and examine new models, like
private motorways, which would enable them to function more efficiently.
Leading the way among the states is Bavaria, one of Germany's richest
states, which last year announced an ambitious new initiative to sell off
its holdings in a variety of companies. The state government has already
raised over DM3bn and hopes to bring together another DM2bn, money which
will almost all be invested in new technologies.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister who himself comes from Bavaria, rarely
misses a chance to sing the praises of his party brethren in Munich who have
been setting the example he wants other states to follow.
However, poorer states like the Saarland and the city state of Bremen, where
unemployment is relatively high, feel duty bound to prop up limping
industries with state funds.
The state of Lower Saxony is setting another bad example by holding on to
its 20 per cent in the car maker Volkswagen and much of what could not
immediately be privatised in eastern Germany was taken over by the
respective state governments via Beteiligungsgesellschaften or state-owned
companies created to manage shareholdings in strategic companies such as
Jenoptik, the well-known Thuringian optical instruments manufacturer. 'The
Lander are not overly inclined (to privatise),' said Ms Barbara Eckrich, of
the finance ministry.
There is hope yet. As a senior finance ministry official points out, the
reason most states and councils will make further efforts to privatise is
because they are running out of money. The federal government, for instance,
announced earlier this year that it would only pay unemployment benefit to
people who have lost their jobs for a maximum of two years. Thereafter they
will receive so-called social assistance which will be entirely funded by
local governments.
The smaller budgets, coupled with a realisation that many privatisation
models developed outside Germany do actually work, means that the country's
traditional penchant to have civil servants do everything is beginning to
wane.
The process has been helped considerably by the Treuhandanstalt, the
state-owned agency charged with privatising east Germany which will be wound
up at the end of this year.
Faced with a shortage of funds and confronted with unheard of difficulties
involved in privatising a whole country, the Treuhandanstalt developed a
variety of new models for local government, setting an example which has
made privatisation much more palatable than it would otherwise have been.
Some sewage plants, for instance, are now operated privately, including one
in the east Thuringian town of Altenburg where about 50 companies competed
for the contract, a process which enabled the local council to make
considerable savings.
On a national level, the government in Bonn meanwhile has pushed through
reforms which allow private employment agencies to compete alongside the
state-owned agencies in the hope that competition will offer better services
to people seeking jobs.
However, the government has not made all the progress it has wanted to. In
the past state and local governments were allowed to fulfil their tasks by
means of publicly-owned companies or authorities. Now a new law will require
them to prove that their duties must be carried out by a state-owned entity;
otherwise, the contract must go to a private operator.
But just weeks before the October elections, the Bundesrat, the upper
chamber of parliament which represents the 16 Lander, threw out the new law
shifting the so-called burden of proof. The government has vowed to push the
amendment through early in the next session of parliament but the setback is
an indication of how difficult it may be to force the Lander, many of which
are run by the left-wing Social Democratic party (SPD), to privatise.
Meanwhile the government will press on to privatise as much as it can of
what is left in its care.
The finance ministry is mulling over plans to sell institutions such as the
famous Max Planck Institute and other public research facilities. And the
organisation which runs Germany's 350 motorway service stations is being
restructured and renamed and will be sold off next year.
Work is also continuing on technology to introduce tolls on motorways, a
first step towards wholesale privatisation. Since 1990 the government has
also sold about 9,000 flats and houses which used to belong to foreign armed
forces stationed in Germany and it is trying hard to make the thousands of
hectares it still owns more attractive for developers, including discounts
of up to 50 per cent from the purchase price if the land is used for
approved council housing.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (15): From ugly duckling to swan in three
years - Lufthansa's re-fit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The evolution of Lufthansa from ugly duckling to swan over the past three
years is by common consent the most successful German restructuring story
yet to emerge from the turmoil of the recession.
The international investment community showed its approval in late
September, subscribing with enthusiasm to a rights issue and an offering
from the federal government's shares which shrank Bonn's stake from 52 per
cent to 35 per cent.
To judge from the mood among investors, the government might have disposed
of its entire holding in one swoop, but regulatory requirements - not to
mention the prospect of the government's getting a fatter price in future -
mean they will have to wait.
Expectations of a rising Lufthansa share price are based on confidence that
the airline's management will keep the rationalisation and cost-cutting
process moving at pace, plus the effects on routine operations of the
international economic recovery.
Chairman Mr Jurgen Weber, who has kept all of his promises so far (in fact
the turn-round from the brink of disaster took only around two years instead
of the five he expected), is in no mood to let go of the reins now. He only
recently gave a hint of how serious the company's condition was when he took
over. 'Only a few people knew really how bad it was, and we could not say
anything,' he said. 'There were times when I got up in the morning and knew
that we would lose another DM4m today.'
While the government gets on with preparing for the final stage of
privatisation, promised before the end of next year, the group's management
continues working towards its long-term objective of displacing British
Airways as Europe's premier airline.
The 'passenger-friendly' tone of the German flag-carrier's latest
advertising is the most visible indicator of this ambition. But the most
audible is Mr Weber's constant refrain that the cost-savings and quality
improvements must continue at every level.
Accordingly, the entire DM1.2bn raised in the September rights issue will be
used to pay off bank borrowings run up by the previous management which
spent heavily anticipating the completion of the single European market
while simultaneously failing to anticipate recession. The group plans to
halve its net debt to DM3bn by 1997, saving DM200m a year in interest
charges, while Mr Weber has other cost savings of DM500m in his sights.
The first stage of restructuring programme introduced by Mr Weber shortly
after his appointment in late 1991 was aimed at reducing manning and labour
costs. Old hierarchies were split up, pay was frozen for one year, working
hours were increased. Pilots agreed to a 7 per cent increase in flying
hours, and the end of easy-going times was underlined when one of their
number was fired after refusing to take off because his lunch was not on
board.
Luxuries such as the group's Cologne headquarters were cut in a
sale-and-leaseback deal. Fringe interests such as hotel management were
thrown out as stakes were reduced in the Kempinski and Penta hotel chains.
As a result, in the 24 months to June this year, costs were cut 15 per cent
and productivity was increased more than 30 per cent.
The second stage, introduced this year, is intended to reduce costs by a
further 20 per cent by 1997. A large proportion of these economies is likely
to come not from the direct efforts of Mr Weber and the main board, but from
new, independent management teams assembled to run the new-look Lufthansa
group, plans for which emerged on the eve of privatisation.
Group cargo operations plus the internal service divisions, aircraft
maintenance and information technology will be hived off as separate joint
stock companies on January 1. They will function as independent profit
centres, alongside the main passenger airline business, and LSG Catering and
Condor charter services which are already run as free-standing businesses.
The result will be a wholesale restructuring of the classic German 'pyramid'
management structure - where virtually every decision is made at the apex -
which will leave the main board in charge of group strategy and the
passenger airline, while fostering entrepreneurialism in the other
companies.
They will be expected to seek out new business and customers apart from
Lufthansa in the world market and, as the airline's internal newspaper said,
counter cost pressures with 'greater flexibility' than is available to them
under the existing group structure.
As an indicator of the possibilities open to the offshoots, the IT business,
to be named Lufthansa Systems, is to be launched in concert with the General
Motors subsidiary, EDS, which will hold a 25 per cent stake and share
management control. This suggests similar arrangements with globally-active
partners are desirable for the other fledglings and in the core business
itself, where two candidates are already waiting in the wings - partners and
code-sharers United Airlines and Thai Airways.
Amid all the brouhaha over the way the board mastered the recession and
rebuilt the airline, most excitement has stemmed from the formation this
year of strategic alliances with United and Thai which gave Lufthansa the
global reach necessary if it is to stage a realistic challenge to British
Airways.
All that is lacking, analysts say, is for the deals to be cemented by
cross-shareholdings, an issue which all three sides have said may be
addressed in future.
When that might be appears to depend on Bonn's success in its efforts to
persuade its European Union partners to amend union legislation under which
more than half an airline operator's shares must be owned by European
individuals or institutions. This was one of the reasons for using the
book-building technique in the recent placing - to allow careful selection
of investors - and excluding the US from the offer. According to the
government's own timetable, change will be needed before the end of next
year when it has undertaken to dispose of all its remaining shares, which
are forecast by then to be worth well over DM3bn.
With the first tranche of the privatisation of Deutsche Telekom due almost
immediately afterwards - and expected to raise at least DM10bn - success
will depend on Bonn's ability to spread its offerings as widely as possible
across the global capital market.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (14): Big is no longer beautiful - Fuel
and power monopolies are under scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a consensus in Germany that the country's energy sector needs
sweeping reform to sweep away outdated practices.
But there is no consensus about how the sector can be prised open to outside
competition in a which would lead to de-regulation and liberalisation.
It will be the task of the new coalition government to try and attain that
consensus.
Across Germany's energy sectors - electricity, gas, and coal - decades-old
practices continue to exist. Take electricity. The large utilities, led by
RWE, Bayernwerk and PreussenElektra, function within the demarcation and
concession system whereby they have exclusive rights to supply the
municipalities. The gas industry enjoys a similar monopolistic position.
This has the effect of guaranteeing security of energy supply, but at the
same time, it restricts choice, including price, for the municipalities and
the consumer.
A challenge against this system has now been mounted by Kleve, a small town
on the Dutch border, which wants to end its exclusive contract with RWE in a
bid for cheaper, alternative and independent energy, from across the Dutch
border if necessary. The case has been referred to the European Commission.
The outcome will be watched closely by the industry.
But the structure and price of German electricity - among the highest in
Europe - are also influenced by the practice of allowing electricity
companies are permitted to collect a levy - the so-called Kohlepfennig -
from the consumer to help finance the use of the high cost German coal.
The Kohlepfennig is tied to the Jahrhundert Vertrag, an agreement between
the coal and electricity industries in Germany covering the amount of
domestic coal the utilities undertake to burn for the remainder of this
century.
German coal prices are higher than world coal prices - at current exchange
rates, world coal prices are about DM80 per tonne but the German electricity
companies pay DM280 per tonne for German coal to make up for the cost of
imported coal. More than 40m tonnes of coal are subsidised by the
Kohlepfennig.
Phasing out of the Kohlepfennig would have social political consequences: it
would affect domestic coal production output and eventually drain support
from the opposition Social Democrats, whose constituencies are rooted in the
coal regions. Yet the SPD also realises that it is facing pressure from
industry for lower electricity prices, and is aware that the annual DM8bn
required to subsidise coal continues to put a strain on the budget deficit
which is over DM68bn.
It is not only the coal industry which is under pressure to become
competitive. There is growing pressure on the electricity and gas utilities
to consider how far they are prepared to introduce Third Party Access (TPA)
which would allow outsiders access to their distribution grids.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, has proposed a comprehensive
reform of the energy sector envisaging some form of TPA. In October 1993, he
unveiled a draft energy law intended to replace the 1935
Energiewirtschaftsgesetz, or energy law.
The draft legislation proposed that operators of the electricity or gas
grid, upon whom third parties are dependent for transportation, must not
unreasonably hinder those seeking contracts for TPA. However, refusal to
grant such TPA is not considered unreasonable in several situations:
if the capacity of the line for TPA is insufficient;
if no appropriate compensation for TPA is offered;
if the secure supply to other customers of the operator of the line for
reasonable conditions is rendered impossible through TPA;
and if, in the case of gas, a curtailment of supply on international markets
occurs.
So far, Mr Rexrodt has been unsuccessful in pushing this legislation through
because of opposition from within the government itself, and from the
utilities and other related institutions.
For example, the Federal Association for Gas and Water (BGW), supports in
principle the idea of TPA, but only if it is reciprocal. 'Germany cannot go
it alone,' argues Mr Martin Weyand, an energy expert at the BGW. However, Mr
Weyand and the BGW believe that the consequences of TPA and the abolition of
the principle of exclusive service areas would have the following results:
inequality of opportunity. Foreign gas companies would be able to supply the
German market while foreign markets - particularly France - would remain
inaccessible to German gas companies;
threat to security of supply. The system of long-term supply contracts used
throughout Europe, which consists of long-term supply contracts with high
take-or-pay obligations, could no longer be applied. However, short-term
contracts would not be a suitable alternative and would not guarantee
secure, area-wide supplies to customers;
small consumers and medium-sized businesses and rural areas would be hit;
the obligation to connect and guarantee supply could no longer be met;
expropriation of private investment. Those companies which have undertaken
long-term investments could lose the right to dispose of their own property
and it is unclear if there would be a compensating mechanism.
The Verband der Industriellen Energie-und Kraftwirtschaft, the association
for industrial energy, wants greater competition because it believes it
would lead to lower prices. The VIK, headed by Mr Max Dietrich Kley, a board
member of BASF, the giant chemicals group and one of the largest consumers
of energy, wants third party access. Indeed, BASF, through Wintershall, its
gas subsidiary, is building a network of gas pipe lines across Germany
precisely to break the monopoly held by Ruhrgas, the country's largest gas
supplier, and introduce cheaper gas prices and more competition.
But the VIK does not have the support of the Arbeitgemeinschaft Regionaler
Energieversorgungs-Unternehmen (ARE), the organisation which groups together
the regional utility companies. Sandwiched between the municipalities and
the large utility companies, ARE can live without the strict concession and
demarcation systems, since it would give them greater opportunities to
compete and supply on the local level. Yet they do not want TPA because they
would be smothered by outside competitors.
The German government is under some pressure from the EU to deregulate. For
the moment, however, there is no consensus in Brussels about how far TPA
within the EU should go - while the UK staunchly defends wide
liberalisation, France favours the single-buyer model which would allow one
utility to import, sell, and distribute electricity in the national market.
'This would mean that the national market in France would be blocked by its
own companies,' a BGW official said.
Thus, without consensus either in Brussels or within Germany, it will be up
to the incoming Bonn coalition to force the pace.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (13): Forget about the old up and down
cycles - The recovery may be full of surprises, argues Albrecht Schmidt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALBRECHT SCHMIDT

<TEXT>
Germany is in the process of recovering from the worst recession it has
known. But the economic upswing must not be allowed to conceal the fact that
in the medium and long term our country must learn to deal with problems of
a quite different order from cyclical ups and downs. Germany is confronted
with dramatically sharpened competition in which three overlapping
developments combine to create an historic challenge: the economic future of
our country depends on our ability to master it.
The intensification of global competition through breathtaking advances in
communications technology, the removal of global trade barriers and
competitive pressures emerging from south-east Asia.
The process of deepening and widening the European Union.
The emergence of wholly new competitors on our threshold following the fall
of the Iron Curtain in eastern Europe.
These developments confront us with both opportunities and risks. Germany,
itself rich in human and investment capital, will be able to benefit in
future from improved international distribution of labour. The enlargement
of markets as a result of the fall of the Iron Curtain and the expansion of
the European community will allow greater series-production in manufacturing
which will generate appreciable cost-savings.
Nor should we under-estimate the possibilities presented by the variety of
products we have to offer - thanks to the Mittelstand companies forming the
backbone of the economy. Germany's geographical position in the centre of
Europe should also be especially beneficial. But the greater the
opportunities, the greater the risks of reacting wrongly to them.
Private business must take care to adapt to the new circumstances:
reorganisation is already under way in many sectors. But doubts must be
raised over the government's will and ability to react adequately and the
readiness to be flexible on the part of wage negotiators. With these doubts
in mind, I see the need for thorough-going reforms in five areas of policy.
Less protectionism: Germans have to come to terms with the fact that our
industries in which we are less productive than other countries will shrink.
It is even more important that we accept contraction in those sectors where,
even though we may be more productive than foreigners, our lead is
relatively narrow.
I offer mining, the steel industry, agriculture and textiles as possible
examples, although I admit the latter already have a large part of the
necessary adjustment process behind them. But only if we take Ricardo's
theory of relative cost advantage seriously can we realise the hoped-for
trading profits from improved international distribution of labour.
To date economic policy has tended mostly to hamper structural change
necessary in our labour market, and it is time to call a halt. It is absurd
to subsidise jobs in mining with annual funding sufficient to send each of
our 150,000 mine workers on a year-long holiday to Majorca.
Deregulation: The most important way we can arm ourselves for new
competitive conditions is to reduce and thin out the dense mass of state
regulation. It is not the job of the state to act as aide and agent to
private enterprise which wants to protect itself from unwelcome competition
by means of excessive restrictions on access to markets.
There are more than enough examples of inefficient regulatory measures. Is
it really necessary, for example, to insist that an individual must have a
master craftsman's certificate as a precondition to setting up in a small
business? Is it really not enough for the would-be proprietor to demonstrate
five years' experience as a journeyman carpenter, bricklayer or whatever?
Should a plumber really be forbidden from re-laying the tiles he removed
while fitting a new bath, or rebuilding the wall he pulled down to get at
the pipes behind?
The skilled crafts associations and guilds complain about the increase in
illicit work. But isn't the proliferation of working 'on the black' merely a
natural reaction to excessive regulation of the market?
Cost-benefit analysis instead of book-keeping:
It is not possible to make an exception of the state at a time when
individuals and all other institutions are having to adapt to new
conditions.
Progressive tax rates have led to an insidious increase in the state's share
of gross domestic product, and at the same time the obligation to use tax
revenues economically has been put to one side.
Special interest groups infest the parliamentary environment and have found
ways, out of public view, of gorging themselves on the taxation honeypot.
The jungle of new legislation grows as every generation of parliamentarians
responds to the perceived need to justify its existence. Party political
democracy is stuck fast in a tangled web of interests.
How can the excessive growth of state involvement be contained, and how can
we ensure its internal efficiency? This is not a matter which can be
resolved by better book-keeping: it would be far more effective if every
large state spending project were subjected to a cost-benefit analysis.
The profitability criteria of the market economy can in many instances be
applied effectively to governmental regulatory measures. Consider
environmental protection: in Germany we try to protect the environment by
prescriptions which lay down technical standards and procedures for business
activities which burden the environment.
These standards are inefficient because while they present no problems for
some companies, they impose conditions on others which cannot be fulfilled.
The application of the so-called 'bubble concept' in the US demonstrates
that you can have cheaper and more efficient environmental protection. The
concept is based on limited geographical areas - the bubbles - within which
tradeable pollution licences permit the transfer of pollutant discharges
between the companies operating within the bubbles.
Improving the efficiency of the state also involves letting light into the
legislative jungle. Rather as Bavaria has done in drastically cutting its
building regulations, all legal systems need to be thinned. A secondary goal
here would be to transfer more responsibility to individual citizens.
Responsibility' self or state? Reinforcement of individual responsibility is
also a necessary part of the reforms to the social welfare system. The state
cannot be responsible for every slight mishap or loss of earnings. In order
to avoid any misunderstandings: no-one wants to sacrifice social welfare.
But it has to be acknowledged that the German system is on collision course
with every principle of efficiency in the book, and is no longer affordable
in its present form.
The essence of the 'social state' lies in the insurance cover it offers its
citizens. Accordingly, as with every form of insurance, state protection
reduces the insured person's incentive to make personal efforts to reduce
damage or risk. In the end the benefits of insurance fall not only on those
who have stumbled into difficulties through no fault of their own, but also
those who failed to bother to take any precautionary measures.
The private insurance industry solves the problem generally by offering
partial-cover contracts under which the insured accepts responsibility for
part of the risk. Transferring this technique to the social welfare system
will increase both its efficiency and the popular sense of responsibility.
An obvious example is the case of the much-discussed Karenztage system of
funding sick pay. (The principle is that workers staying at home through
sickness should not be paid for the first day or days, thus ensuring that
people with minor illnesses, or hangovers, think twice before taking time
off.)
Unemployment insurance can also be made more efficient in similar ways: the
interest among employees and employers in reducing joblessness can be
strengthened by transferring some of the financial and management burdens
associated with the problem to the so-called social partners which negotiate
wages pacts. In principle there are two extreme ways of arranging
unemployment insurance: a wholly centralised form as we have now with the
Federal Labour Office in Nuremberg, and a fully decentralised version
comprising a multiplicity of smaller insurance schemes organised on sectoral
basis or according to regional pay scales.
The optimal answer certainly does not lie in the marginal solution chosen in
Germany. But we might consider, for example, a system in which only a
portion of the responsibilities and contributions remain with the federal
labour office. A further portion could be distributed to special funds
established for individual industrial sectors and regions which would then
be responsible for managing their individual affairs with their own budgets.
The effective insurance cover against structural unemployment would be
somewhat reduced in this construction. But I believe the jobless total would
fall because there would inevitably be more moderate pay settlements which
in the end would reflect a better balance between the interests of the
employers, the employees and the unemployed.
Shares instead of pay: Whatever else happens, moderate pay deals will be
forced on the market in future. You do not need to be a prophet to see that
more than 10-fold pay differentials such as we have in the European Union
are not sustainable.
That means German wages must undergo considerable adjustment: at the very
least they cannot continue to rise as quickly as they have until now.
The development of Germany so far has been characterised by the shrinking
labour force's ability to demand steadily increasing scarcity premiums while
economic growth allowed the accumulation of ever more capital. Although the
availability of human labour hardly increased, the sum of earned incomes in
general terms grew just as quickly as gross domestic product and investment
earnings.
This will change in future. According to everything economists know about
competitive processes, future growth in the German economy will be marked by
a far-reaching uncoupling of investment and earned incomes. Any distribution
policy seeking to fulfil its aims via pay increases will provoke mass
unemployment which would be a far greater threat to the social peace than
any change in the way earnings are distributed.
One promising solution might involve changing the distribution of wealth to
the benefit of wage earners. There are many possibilities for increasing
property ownership among employees, and pay policy has an especially
important role to play.
The motto for pay talks for the coming years should be 'Savings not cash'
(Sparlohn statt Barlohn). If pay rises are paid in share certificates rather
than in cash, the advantages are not limited to improved liquidity for the
companies. The employees benefit too: with the right to dividends and
profit-sharing they gain a second income stream in addition to their wage or
salary.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (11): Falling slowly - Unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The turning point in the west German labour market in midsummer this year
coincided happily with the recovery of the ruling coalition's fortunes in
the pre-election opinion polls.
However, as was to be shown by the election results and is becoming
increasingly apparent in the monthly jobless data, neither event was as
decisive as some would have the world believe.
The adjusted total of unemployed in the west fell 46,000 between June and
October, and shows signs of continuing to ease. There will no doubt be
gung-ho headlines when the unadjusted figure for the former GDR drops below
1m this month or next - provided winter does not set in too early and send
the total up again.
But even the most optimistic forecasts indicate that gross domestic product
growth of 3-or-more per cent in 1995 will have little apparent effect on the
jobless rate - least of all in old heavy industry areas such as the Ruhr.
According to the autumn prognosis of Germany's six leading economic
institutes (table on facing page) the rate in the west will average 8.2 per
cent after 8.3 per cent this year. In the east, it will stay around 13 per
cent. Overall, 3.5m people will remain without work.
Even longer-term, as recovery consolidates, economists expect western
employment to expand at only half the rate of growth in GDP because of
industry's need to improve productivity further.
In the east, where economic restructuring is still in full swing, the
situation is complicated by productivity (as measured in GDP per employed
person) which is still only half that in the west while unit labour costs
are 50 per cent higher.
Even so, unemployment is easing and a delicate balance has emerged in which
recovering industrial companies are managing to absorb the large number of
people still being squeezed out of public sector and agricultural jobs. The
situation is also being eased by a growing core group of self-employed
people. According to official estimates, the number of self-employed in the
former GDR has risen by well over 40 per cent since the start of 1991 to
almost 500,000 or 7.5 per cent of the total in work.
As in the west, where 10.5 per cent of the workforce is self-employed, many
have found roles for themselves in the service industries which most
economists see as the main source of hope for a solution to Germany's
peculiar difficulties with structural unemployment.
According to a recent study from the BHF bank, the problem in the west is
due partly to the mismatch between the virtual unavailability of unskilled
jobs in the region and the 50 per cent of the jobless total who have no
vocational or professional training. Apart from existing education and
training schemes which are funded out of the labour office budget, the study
suggests efforts should be concentrated on ways of developing hitherto
unviable service 'industries' in areas such as social work, for example.
It was essential, however, not to follow the US pattern where the
'employment miracle' had been achieved with a combination of low pay and
minimal social welfare cover which generated a new layer of working poor,
living on the fringes of poverty.
One suggestion, much discussed among economists but yet to emerge at the
political level, is that federal employment office funds, currently used for
unemployment pay, re-training and work-creation projects, should be diverted
into income supplements for people in work but earning less than the legal
minimum.
Mr Bernhard Jagoda, president of the labour office, recently proposed that
such a new service sector might spring from the growing demand for home care
for the elderly, and estimated it could create some 300,000 jobs.
Mr Jagoda is also a strong advocate of job-sharing, claiming 25 per cent of
all jobs could be split, and urging federal and local government to take the
lead in public employment, where continuing waves of redundancies are
threatened as a result of budget cuts.
While such ideas are processed in the mill of public and political opinion,
the consensus remains that most can be done in the short-term in annual pay
negotiations and in the day-to-day contacts between employers and their
workers' representatives.
The need to bring Germany's cost of manufacturing labour under control if
not into line with European competitors' is clearly underlined by the latest
data which shows effective hourly pay in west German manufacturing increased
by 25 per cent between 1990 and 1993; productivity rose by 8 per cent.
Following modest pay increases and more job cuts there has been a sharp but
unquantified increase in productivity this year, which seems likely to be
sustained during 1995. Although wage negotiators are expecting slightly more
generous settlements, and the job losses are slowing, improved working
practices and flexible time-keeping are likely to play an important role in
keeping productivity on the rise.
There is also room for savings among the so-called 'voluntary' payments and
benefits often agreed at company or even plant level.
As the BHF bank's study pointed out, this 'tax' on labour lies largely
within the area of influence of wage negotiators on both sides and can
therefore be adjusted by them should the need arise.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (12): Wiser and sharper - Machine tools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few industries in Germany have suffered such a buffeting over the past four
years as the 350-odd makers of machine tools - the world's largest machine
tool industry after Japan and comfortably the biggest in Europe.
Recession at home, naturally, took its toll. But exports account for about
65 per cent of output, and foreign sales have suffered both from the severe
downturn in western markets and the collapse of markets in eastern Europe,
where Germany was the dominant foreign supplier.
Reunification, far from bringing the benefits - however transient - enjoyed
by other industries, failed to generate extra business for machine tool
builders, and decimated all but the technologically brighter stars amid the
hugely overmanned east German industry.
The strength of the D-Mark made it harder to make money in export markets.
At the same time, the industry's customers in German manufacturing were
seeking to cut their own costs and modifying their buy-German stance.
Recent statistics from the VDW, the German Machine Tool Builders'
Association, paint a sorry picture. Employment in the old West German
industry was more than 100,000 in 1990/91, but had fallen to 73,000 by the
end of last year, excluding the remaining 9,500 workers in eastern Germany.
Production fell from DM17.2bn in 1991 to DM10.7bn last year, and domestic
consumption from DM12.3bn to DM6.4bn over the same period.
Things are now looking up - the industry's order intake for the first eight
months of this year was up 22 per cent on the same period of 1993.
But the traumas of the past four years have punctured the arrogance of the
industry, possibly permanently, and some of its famous names, both corporate
and individual, have been humbled.
The intertwining, and eventually starkly contrasting, fortunes of four
companies in particular, Gildemeister and Traub in turning machines and Maho
and Deckel in milling and boring machines, bear witness to the upheaval in
the industry.
All four were separate, independent companies in the late 1980s, but even
then faced strategic disadvantages vis-a-vis their Japanese competitors.
Now, through a succession of sales agreements, a failed merger and a
corporate collapse, Gildemeister has emerged as the owner of Deckel and
Maho, combining its own turning technology with their milling and boring
technology.
The key event was the appointment in April of an administrator at Deckel
Maho, two companies which had been at each other's throats for 20 years.
'Everybody expected that it would happen, but it was a tremendous blow for
our strategy,' says Mr Axel Kemna, Gildemeister's chairman. By that stage,
Deckel and Maho products were accounting for 55-60 per cent of the volume in
Gildemeister's newly-formed Deckel Maho Gildemeister sales joint venture.
The Deckel Maho collapse gave Gildemeister the opportunity to buy only what
it needed to continue its strategy, and in July it paid DM90m to buy a
package of Deckel Maho assets out of bankruptcy.
Gildemeister took on about 1,000 of the 1,700 Deckel Maho employees at the
time of the administration. It left behind the Deckel plant in Munich and
Maho's DM160m plant at Kempten in Bavaria, a lavishly-constructed white
elephant that contributed to the downfall of former Maho chairman Werner
Babel.
Mr Kemna believes that, with a streamlined organisation and shorn of the
debts of the past, Gildemeister has a 'good chance to make something' out of
Deckel Maho, whose cost base has been reduced by DM150m a year.
The new, broader Gildemeister group is a stronger competitor in global
machine tool markets, he says. As a measure of the upheaval, however, its
workforce stands at about 2,200, against 5,000 for the three formerly
independent companies, based on continuing operations.
On the same basis, next year's sales are expected to be about DM550m,
compared with DM1.5bn for the three companies before the recession.
Traub, which was a rival bidder for Deckel Maho, has also been through
considerable upheaval since 1990. Internally, production costs have been
significantly reduced, with 'design for manufacturing' techniques, modular
construction and fewer parts.
Machines are made much more quickly, and with fewer people, than five years
ago. This has raised the competitiveness of Traub's products among UK
subcontractors, says Mr Paul Maynard, managing director of Traub's UK sales
organisation, renamed Traub-Heckert UK in October.
The name change, which is being repeated throughout most of Traub's
worldwide selling organisation, reflects last year's acquisition by the
Reichenbach-based company of Heckert, based at Chemnitz in former East
Germany.
Once again, this brings together turning and milling technology as part of a
long-term global strategy - Heckert makes sophisticated machining centres.
And the upheaval caused by reunification gave Traub the opportunity to buy
only what it wanted from the former Honecker-regime showpiece that was
employing 4,000 people in 1989.
Traub currently employs just over 500 people at Heckert. 'We have bought the
high-technology part of the company, which is one of the most advanced
machine tool factories in Europe,' says Mr Maynard, one of Traub's senior
European executives. Traub did not want Heckert's heavy-duty milling machine
business, which used to make about 2,500 machines a year mainly for eastern
European markets. It has turned what remains of Heckert into a centre of
excellence for computer-numerical controlled (CNC) machining centres.
Manufacture of Klink and Variomatic machines, formerly made in western
Germany at companies acquired by Heckert, has been transferred to Chemnitz,
which is to make machine beds for the Traub turning machines produced at
Reichenbach.
Early this month , Traub also announced it was taking a majority
shareholding in Hermle, the western German milling and boring machine
manufacturer with which it made a sales and distribution pact early last
year.
Overall, Traub's workforce has fallen from 2,500 before the recession to
just over 2,000, even with the Heckert purchase. But the takeover is aimed
at giving the company a better balance and, in the long-term, the Heckert
range will contribute about 40 per cent of turnover, says Mr Maynard. In the
first half of this year, it accounted for DM36.3m out of total turnover of
DM161.1m, which itself was up 50.6 per cent from the first half of 1993.
Gildemeister's Mr Kemna says he believes the industry took the right actions
through the recession, but says it can hardly be blamed for not having moved
quickly enough.
For some German machine tool builders, especially volume producers, the
decline was 60 per cent.
Most machine tool executives will privately admit the recession has,
paradoxically, been a good thing for the industry. It has forced it to shape
a corporate and financial structure that matches the undoubted strength of
its product ranges and research and development, which has been maintained
throughout the downturn.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (10): Frankfurt flaps its wings - Andrew
Fisher studies Germany's bid to be a world financial centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Slow to catch on but quick to catch up' is the verdict of a foreign banker
in Frankfurt on how Germany's financial markets, and those responsible for
their development, have responded to pressures for change.
The Bonn government has pushed through laws to make Finanzplatz Deutschland
(Germany as a financial centre) more attractive and efficient; the equities
and futures markets have been streamlined; and the Bundesbank has taken a
more relaxed stance over financial innovations. More changes are in the
pipeline.
This activity is yielding results: insider trading is being outlawed; a new
body to regulate the securities markets is being formed; tougher disclosure
rules for share stakes are being introduced; and money market funds - common
in countries like France and the US - are becoming part of the financial
landscape.
Thus Frankfurt has the basis to develop into a much more dynamic financial
centre. But this does not mean it is approaching the status of London, a
global centre ranking with Tokyo and New York. That was underlined by the
recent decision of Deutsche Bank to base its investment banking activities
in London, where it bought Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank, five years
ago.
The fact that Germany's biggest bank took that long to choose London as the
centre of its investment banking activities - its German business will stay
in Frankfurt - shows the truth of the above quote. On the other hand,
Deutsche Bank did not want to swamp Morgan Grenfell's identity and was keen
to learn about the more entrepreneurial Anglo-Saxon banking culture.
Although Deutsche Bank's plans shook many people in the German financial
community, there was general understanding for its decision. London is where
much of the expertise lies and where international equities trading, mergers
and acquisitions advice, and derivatives business are far more highly
developed. Other German banks may also move equities and derivatives trading
to the UK.
While this will hardly enhance Frankfurt's reputation, it should not dent it
too much. Many bankers see Frankfurt's main role as a regional financial
centre for continental Europe, handling important deals for both east and
west.
'What we do in London should and will have a positive effect on what we do
in Frankfurt,' said Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank's chairman. 'The success
we may have as a London participant should mean additional business and more
success for Finanzplatz Frankfurt.'
But that will mean more effort by those in Frankfurt itself. As the home of
the Bundesbank and now of the new European Monetary Institute - forerunner
of the planned European central bank - it is one of the world's most
important monetary capitals. It houses several important international
banks, a thriving bond market - the third largest in the world and biggest
in Europe - and a successful futures market, the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB).
It is in equities that Frankfurt, which dominates trading on Germany's eight
stock exchanges, has the most catching up to do. This reflects the relative
lack of interest among private investors in shares, though this is changing,
and companies' traditional reliance on bank loans rather than equity.
Smaller German companies have also been reluctant to dilute control by
raising funds in the market.
'Germany is not so far a stock-market oriented society,' says Mr Bernhard
Walther, head of Dresdner International Research Institute (Diri), part of
Dresdner Bank. 'But this is changing rapidly.' He believes the government's
big privatisation programme will provide a huge impetus.
The partial privatisation of Lufthansa, the German airline, raised some
DM1bn this year. But that of Deutsche Telekom, likely to raise some DM15bn
early in 1996, will have a much greater impact. Foreign banks have vied to
play a key international role in the Telekom flotation, next to Deutsche and
Dresdner. If the issue is handled well, it could promote share ownership
among private investors and raise Frankfurt's status.
'The repercussions of Deutsche Telekom will be quite substantial,' says Mr
Andreas von Buddenbrock, head of investment banking at the German operation
of Merrill Lynch, the US investment house. Foreign interest in the issue
will be substantial, but domestic investors will also be wooed.
There is plenty of scope to lift outside interest in German stocks. Of the
net capital flow of Dollars 68bn by US investors into foreign equities last
year, Germany accounted for only Dollars 2.7bn. 'The German market has
obviously only been of minor interest to American investors,' Mr Buddenbrock
wrote in Borsen-Zeitung, the financial newspaper. With US investors becoming
more globally-minded, 'German corporations should attempt to become more
attractive'.
That means clearer accounts, greater attention to investor relations, and
more understanding of how capital markets work. For an economy the size of
Germany's, the stock market certainly needs more muscle. Only 6 per cent of
households own shares, far below US and British levels. Moreover, the market
capitalisation of German shares is equivalent to some 30 per cent of GNP,
again far lower than elsewhere.
But Germany has a highly successful economy in which companies tend to put
manufacturing and product quality much higher than financial skills. For
private investors, the Bundesbank's solid monetary record has meant that
fixed-interest investments have produced steady gains. Two world wars, the
hyper-inflation of 1923 and the trauma of currency reform in 1948 have
tipped the scales away from the uncertainty of shares to the safety of bonds
and savings.
'In Germany, equities have not always been better than bonds,' notes Diri's
Mr Walther, citing the 1970s. But now that the international trend is
towards more fund-raising through securities issues and less through bank
loans, he sees a new opportunity for Frankfurt. Its regulatory framework is
as good as anywhere. 'Now, we've got to put life into it.'

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (9): Afraid of a flutter - Germans are
timid investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germans are impressive savers but unexciting investors. Not for them the ups
and downs of stocks and shares, even though long-term gains on these outpace
other types of investment. The average German will put safety first almost
every time, choosing reliable fixed interest returns over potential gains
from equities.
However, the real story is rather more complex. First, investors' attitudes
are changing, though not with great speed. Second, the unavoidable pressure
on individuals to make more provision themselves for their future pension
and health needs will accentuate the change. And third, the recollection of
world wars and inflation, and the resulting dislike of risk, will be
replaced in the minds of many younger people by the opportunities opening up
in the rapidly evolving international capital markets.
The present statistics look fairly dismal for proponents of the equity
culture. Only 5 per cent of German households' total financial assets of
DM4,000bn consist of equities. Of the money going into investment funds,
over two-thirds is directed towards those specialising in bonds. The number
of listed stocks is dwarfed by those in other countries; Germany's 665
compare with 1,900 in the UK, 1,300 in Japan and 6,500 in the US.
On the other hand, Germans saved more than 13 per cent of their incomes last
year, well above the level in France, the UK and the US. Why does more of
that money not go into shares? In the view of Mr Gerhard Liener, a director
of the Daimler-Benz vehicle and aerospace group, efforts to win over the
investors of the future will have to be made now if they are to be persuaded
to go more enthusiastically into equities.
If households' property ownership is added in, their total assets amount to
around DM10,000bn. As much as DM2,000bn could be passed on to the next
generation up to 2000, he told an investment conference in Dusseldorf. The
average value of an inheritance would be about DM300,000.
Mr Liener had several answers to the above question. One was the existence
of a financial and accounting system which favoured creditors rather than
shareholders. Savers deposit funds with banks which lend them to companies.
Shareholders' interests are often neglected. Nor is it easy to obtain a
clear financial picture from many corporate accounts, since high levels of
tax-free reserves stand in the way of full profit disclosures.
Daimler-Benz started chipping away at such obstacles when it agreed to
produce a separate, and more open, set of accounts for its US share listing
last year. Other companies are reluctant to follow, but may have to if they
want to tap world markets for cheaper sources of finance.
One reason for the government's efforts to help develop the financial
infrastructure was the sheer size of future capital-raising needs. Not only
is the public sector itself a heavy borrower, but German state and private
companies are also expected to come to the market in increasing volumes.
As Mr Liener pointed out, the partial privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, the
state telephone company, is expected to raise some DM15bn. This will only be
the first tranche. Daimler itself raised DM3bn this year. 'The German
capital market is over-stretched with sums of this type,' he said. 'Thus
large companies will increasingly turn to other capital markets, above all
to the US, the most productive in the world.'
If German companies are to take advantage of this - Deutsche Telekom hopes
eventually to obtain a US listing - they will have to adapt to Anglo-Saxon
methods. US institutions have a huge volume of funds for investment; by next
year, they will have Dollars 100bn invested abroad. To be tempted more
heavily into German stocks, they will need more transparent accounts,
evidence that companies really do care about the price of their shares, and
a wider spread of issues.
If this occurs in the next few years, the outlook for German investors will
also improve. Some progress is already discernible. Investment funds (the
equivalent of UK unit trusts) attract a growing volume of funds. Bundesbank
figures show that every seventh D-Mark invested now ends up in a managed
fund compared with every 13th in the 1980s and only every 30th in the 1970s.
The central bank said unit purchases by private and institutional investors
had undergone 'a powerful upturn' after being overshadowed by other forms of
investment before the mid-1980s. Foreign bankers also pay tribute to the
efforts of investment funds, some owned by the big banks, to win over
investors and provide a wide range of domestic, foreign, and hedging funds.
Although most German investors still prefer bond-based funds, their tastes
are changing, says Mr Christian Strenger, head of DWS, Deutsche Bank's fund
management operation. 'The proportion of money being invested in our equity
funds has been rising strongly. For DWS, it is now 20 per cent. It ought to
go to 35 per cent.' This could happen in two to four years - 'hopefully
before the end of the millennium'.
By putting a Mr Smiley face on some of its brochures, DWS has tried to catch
savers' attention. Mixing fun and finance is fairly un-German, but DWS hopes
to appeal to investors of all temperaments. Also adopting a novel approach,
Berentzen, a drinks company, put details of its recent share issue on the
backs of schnapps bottles.
Another innovation is the DM5 nominal share, now allowed by law and aimed at
making shares more affordable by dividing them into smaller units. The first
such issue, by the Fielmann optical company in September, was an immediate
success.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of the World Nuclear Industry (8): Long association
with the industry / Profile of GEC Alsthom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEC Alsthom's engineering systems group at Whetstone near Leicester has a
long association with the nuclear industry, as the former home of some of
the manufacturers of the UK's old Magnox power stations.
In the modern era, with nuclear power station building in decline or
non-existent in the UK and many other countries, the focus of the
Anglo-French engineering group's nuclear activities is changing. But it is
still achieving considerable success, albeit in ways that might not have
been envisaged 20 or 30 years ago.
Over the past few years, the bulk of GEC Alsthom's nuclear activities have
been brought together within the engineering systems group, whose managing
director is Mr Martin Melling.
The main exception is the production of large steam turbines that form the
conventional 'turbine island' of nuclear stations. These are made by GEC
Alsthom's electromechanical division. GEC itself still retains NNC (National
Nuclear Corporation), which is known mainly for designing and building
nuclear power stations but is moving increasingly into the servicing and
maintenance side of the business.
Mr Melling's group employs some 2,300 people of which 1,450 work in the UK.
He estimates that just over half the group workforce is engaged in nuclear
activities - at Whetstone, at a similar but smaller facility in Grenoble,
and at the recently acquired Schilling Development, a California-based
specialist producer of robotics handling equipment.
With the exception of the reactor pressure vessels themselves, which GEC
Alsthom does not make, its nuclear presence is one of the industry's most
wide-ranging.
It is a world leader in the design and supply of plant, systems and
equipment for the nuclear industry, and undertakes a complete range of
contracts from preliminary design studies to turnkey projects. Worldwide, it
has more than 25 years of experience on PWR installations in Europe and the
Far East.
As for growth prospects, Mr Melling divides his group's nuclear activities
into four. The PWR activity is declining, and as supplier of equipment into
the reactor island, rather than the main elements of the reactor, GEC
Alsthom faces intense competition in markets such as Asia, where local
content is often obligatory.
There is a stable business in refurbishment and modernisation, however, and
in the area of servicing and maintenance. A good future is seen in outage
management, where contractors have to perform maintenance or refurbishment
during a fixed 'outage' of the plant or part of it, although this is also
highly competitive. Inevitably, the leading players in the nuclear industry
have all moved into this arena as markets for new plants have dried up.
Then come two growth areas where Mr Melling believes GEC Alsthom has
something unique to offer. The first is in dry storage of used fuel, as a
way to postpone reprocessing or as an alternative to it. Over the past 15
years GEC Alsthom has developed technology that can handle used fuel from
both PWR and AWR reactors.
As the UK's policy was for reprocessing, the company identified the US in
the late 1980s as good potential market for its modular vault dry store
(MVDS), winning an order in 1989 to build an MVDS at Fort St. Vrain,
Colorado, where the nuclear station was being decommissioned.
'This was a breakthrough in selling to the US and in validating the MVDS
concept internationally,' says Mr Melling. Another important deal was signed
in 1992, to provide a spent nuclear fuel store for the Paks nuclear station
in Hungary. Paks supplies 40 per cent of the country's electricity and was
looking for ways to store its spent fuel, most of which had formerly gone to
the old Soviet Union.
GEC Alsthom is marketing the system worldwide, exploring opportunities from
eastern Europe to South Africa. In the UK, GEC Alsthom has since 1990 been
discussing with Scottish Nuclear an application of the system for AGR fuel.
A Government decision is awaited which would allow the scheme to go ahead,
involving dry stores at Torness and at Hunterston.
The second growth opportunity seen by Mr Melling is the related one of
general waste management. 'There is a big market for technology that can
supply solutions to the problem of the safe handling of nuclear waste,' he
says.
The company aims both to sell systems and individual products in this
sector, where the expertise of Schilling is especially relevant. Again, the
US is marked out as a growth area.
The other side of GEC Alsthom's nuclear-related business is the
'conventional' end. The company, or its antecedents GEC and Alsthom, have
supplied 20 per cent of the steam turbines and generators used in the
world's nuclear stations.
Formerly, GEC depended heavily on the UK market, and GEC Alsthom had to make
big cuts in its manufacturing base in the early 1990s after the UK nuclear
station programme was shelved - a victim of the 'dash for gas' that spawned
a big development of combined cycle stations.
Alsthom, meanwhile, was a big supplier to Electricite de France, and GEC
Alsthom is supplying two 1,500MW steam turbine generators to both the Chooz
and Civaux nuclear stations in France. The company still has about 1,000
people engaged in nuclear-related turbine and generator work, at Rugby in
the UK and Belfort in France.
With the slowdown in the French nuclear programme, GEC Alsthom is looking to
export markets, where both its parents had made considerable inroads. The
two 1,000MW steam turbines supplied by GEC to the Daya Bay nuclear station
in China have put GEC Alsthom in a good position to win further business
there, says Mr Michael Barrett, managing director of the electromechanical
division's steam turbine business.
The key to success in China, and to varying extents in other Asian markets
for nuclear power, will be the development of partnerships to meet local
content requirements. GEC Alsthom is one of the few companies in the world
with the capability to build the large steam turbines used in nuclear
stations, and will hope to use its expertise to help the Chinese build them,
says Mr Barrett. It already has a collaboration agreement in China, and is
hoping to develop this further.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of the World Nuclear Industry (9): Shortage of
options / A look at waste disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Where to store nuclear waste: that is perhaps the most difficult question
the nuclear industry must answer in making a case for itself.
Environmentalists focus on it, seeing it as the weak link in any argument
for nuclear power; they argue that it is immoral to leave a form of
pollution which will persist for tens of thousands of years for future
generations to solve.
The nuclear industry has traditionally countered this stance by pointing out
that nuclear waste can be neatly contained in barrels, unlike atmospheric
pollution from burning fossil fuels, a rival source of energy. But where
should the barrels be stored? That question has not yet been answered
conclusively.
There is some urgency in finding solutions. Even though civil nuclear
programmes are on hold in many western countries which were previously
enthusiastic - notably in Germany, the US and Britain - the operation of
existing reactors continues to generate waste which needs disposal.
Moreover, the eventual dismantling of the reactors will produce large
volumes of waste, from lightly-contaminated concrete hulks to
intensely-radioactive reactor rods. Some countries, such as Britain, also
have nuclear submarines which need to be scrapped.
But pressure from public and environmentalists is narrowing the range of
disposal routes. Under amendments in the past two years to international
conventions on marine pollution, the option of disposing of even low-level
radioactive waste at sea has been suspended for at least a decade. That
leaves a variety of land-based techniques, but despite their investigation
by many different countries, there is no agreement about the best option.
A decade ago, it seemed that reprocessing used or 'spent' nuclear fuel would
be the ideal. Reprocessing extracts reusable uranium and plutonium from fuel
rods, leaving a much smaller volume of waste. The UK and France, with large
civil programmes, began years ago to invest heavily in reprocessing
capacity. However, since then the price of uranium has fallen sharply.
Concern has also grown internationally that the greater the amount of
plutonium created, the more likely that some is diverted to bomb-making.
Other storage options are cheaper, many have argued, but bring their own
political and technical problems. The UK and Germany have investigated
permanent deep storage - depositing the waste hundreds of metres underground
 -at Sellafield in Cumbria and at the Gorleben salt mines. This option is
likely to be cheaper than storage on the surface because it needs little
surveillance and is secure from terrorist attack.
It also has political attractions - it appears to offer a permanent solution
rather than leaving it for future generations. But in Germany, controversy
over the choice of location has widened into an impassioned row about the
future of the nuclear power industry, which has stalled development of the
site.
There are also considerable geological problems: it is hard to find a site
without fissures or water seepage which will contain the waste safely for
the next 10,000 years. Such considerations have already prolonged the
investigations of UK Nirex, the company charged by the UK government with
finding a deep disposal site for low-level and intermediate-level
radioactive waste.
Such concerns lead many environmentalists, such as the pressure group
Greenpeace, to back the option of storing waste on the surface. This route
is more expensive, but does allow the waste to be closely monitored, and
keeps permanent disposal options open.
Others, such as Scottish Nuclear, one of the two UK nuclear generators,
favour a hybrid of the two techniques for accommodating highly radioactive
waste. Scottish Nuclear has vigorously backed 'dry storage' for spent fuel:
keeping used fuel rods on the surface surrounded by inert gas for 50 years
until the radioactive content and heat fall to a point where the rods can be
stored underground.
Those debates, in which political, economic and scientific considerations
are enmeshed together, are far from resolved. Indeed, in several western
countries a stalemate has been reached.
The only route forwards which appears to be acceptable to western publics is
to put nuclear waste on sites already occupied by nuclear installations -
Sellafield is a case in point.
If countries cannot resolve the debate about location domestically, they may
investigate whether other countries will accept their waste, or at least
store it temporarily while processing it into a different form. British
Nuclear Fuels, owner of the UK's Thorp reprocessing plant in Sellafield, has
made no secret of its opinion that the UK should capitalise on its expertise
in handling nuclear waste.
The new factor which could ease such stalemates in the west, however, is the
Asian embrace of civil nuclear power. Asia is beginning to produce large
volumes of waste and the next two decades will see the different techniques
for treatment and disposal vigorously explored and refined. That may allow
western governments and nuclear industries, from a vantage point
uncomplicated by domestic politics, to make a more thorough assessment of
the answer to nuclear power's trickiest problem.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (7): Tough guy at the bank / Profile of
Hilmar Kopper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tall, thick-set and radiating energy, Mr Hilmar Kopper, 59, seems to be
thriving after five years at the head of Deutsche Bank. He talks of rising
profits, greater efforts to fight off domestic competition and improve
efficiency, and a new push abroad in investment banking, writes ANDREW
FISHER.
His period as speaker of the management board at Germany's largest
commercial bank has, he says, 'been a very lively period of tremendous
growth and great challenge'.
But the latest of his years in one of Germany's most demanding corporate
jobs has undoubtedly been one of the toughest.
As the country climbs out of recession, criticism of banks' lending policies
and sometimes high-handed attitudes to customers have grown. Adding to
Deutsche's tribulations was the near-collapse of Metallgesellschaft, the
industrial and trading company with which it was involved as shareholder and
creditor.
A further blow came with the failure of the Schneider property group, to
which the bank was a major lender; it was while commenting on that crisis
that Mr Kopper made his fateful remark about outstanding payments to
contractors being 'peanuts' - the German press picked this up with glee as
evidence of the bank's arrogance.
But these upsets were nothing compared to the circumstances in which Mr
Kopper came to his present post. He was appointed after Mr Alfred Herrhausen
was murdered by terrorists in November, 1989, just three weeks after Germany
had experienced the euphoria of the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Mr Kopper's pragmatic down-to-earth style is very different from that of Mr
Herrhausen who had a high public profile through expounding on a variety of
political and economic topics beyond the world of banking. Mr Herrhausen
spoke in favour of reunification before many in west Germany had accepted
its inevitability. But it was Mr Kopper and his colleagues who had to move
the bank eastwards.
'We had to make some of the fastest and most far-reaching decisions made
since World War Two,' he says. 'Looking back on it (the investment in the
east), there is very little we would change. We are very pleased with how we
were able to grow in that period.' Now, it has a larger market share in east
Germany (nearly 9 per cent) than in the west. Surprisingly to many people,
Germany's big banks have a smaller share of their own market than their
counterparts in other countries.
With total assets of DM570bn, Deutsche Bank is well placed for further
expansion; it has bought retail banking networks in Spain and Italy and is
locating its worldwide investment banking activities in London, where Morgan
Grenfell (its merchant bank subsidiary) is based.
But there is one area where Deutsche Bank does not plan to expand: its
industrial shareholdings, with a market value of some DM25bn. While these
provide a useful earnings cushion, they also attract envy and critical
comment about the Macht der Banken (power of the banks).
Compared with the market capitalisation of listed companies, German banks'
holdings are tiny. But to some politicians, they are a provocation. Calls to
reduce them are voiced often, usually linked with the demand that the
prominent presence of bankers on company's non-executive supervisory boards
be reduced.
Mr Kopper rejects the view that banks make poor shareholders. 'What makes a
bank a worse shareholder than anybody else?' He says Deutsche does not
intend to increase its portfolio, though it would like to diversify it. On
this and other issues where the bank has come under fire, he has a simple
answer: 'We are a member of society and there is nothing wrong in people
discussing what we do.' Even so, he must hope the next few years bring fewer
barbs and controversy than 1994.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (6): Pessimists question euphoria - The
economic recovery may mask structural faults
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES

<TEXT>
Although some of the bounce has gone out of Germany's economic recovery, the
debate over its speed and direction is as lively as ever.
There are two clear schools of thought over the outlook. The most popular -
promulgated vigorously by government and the business establishment during
the latest federal election campaign - is that the recovery will continue
uninterrupted, taking the country into an extended period of stable growth.
Less popular, but equally persistent, are the views of the dissidents who
warn that the recession and its aftermath have distorted the real situation.
They say that despite the apparent rapid recovery, a combination of current
weaknesses and the underlying structural faults in economic, fiscal and
monetary policy indicate a rougher ride than that seen by the optimists.
There is no disputing that the sequence of events so far this decade,
starting with unification in 1990, has been extraordinary. The uniting of
the two Germanies created a unique economic 'micro-cycle' as a result of
which the international recession very nearly passed Germany by. In the
event, pent-up demand for western goods and services in the former GDR
effectively kept the slump at bay until mid-1992. Then, as partner-economies
were starting to show real recovery, Germany slipped into its steepest
cyclical decline since the war.
Executives and economists who at the time admitted to being surprised by the
downturn are now confessing to being equally surprised by the speed, breadth
and momentum of the upswing.
The recovery has been driven from the start by powerful export demand which
has raised pan-German manufacturing industry's output by an estimated 3.5
per cent this year, following the 7 per cent nosedive recorded in 1993.
Although differing over the finer details, most forecasters reckon on a
further 4 per cent increase in industrial production in 1995 which should
feed through into 3 per cent growth in gross domestic product following 2.5
per cent this year.
The main assumptions are that:
private and public demand will remain muted as a consequence of falling real
incomes and political commitments to budgetary restraint;
exports will continue to grow, although less dramatically than this year,
and, crucially,
increasing corporate confidence will lead to a rise in capital spending to
the benefit of the domestic plant and investment goods industries and their
myriad suppliers.
A key factor behind Dresdner Bank's estimate of 3.1 per cent GDP expansion
in 1995, for example, is an expected 8.3 per cent rise in expenditure on
plant and equipment after a cut of 13.8 per cent in 1993 and an increase of
a mere 1.6 per cent this year.
Dresdner is also counting on an upturn in commercial construction to
counteract the slowing pace in house-building.
Which is where the pessimists join the argument. They claim that the housing
boom, which led to an increase of almost 30 per cent in new mortgages in the
first eight months of this year has been choked off by a 2 per cent increase
in long-term interest rates.
These rates, they argue, will act increasingly as a brake on capital
investment within industry.
Last month's traditional autumn assessment of the outlook from Germany's six
leading economic institutes (see page 7 table) dwelt at length on the issue.
A majority opinion (excluding Berlin's Keynesian DIW institute) noted that
the international recovery and increasing demand for investment capital had
pushed up long rates sharply and quickly. As a result, German business found
itself faced with high borrowing costs at an unusually early stage in the
recovery process.
However, the institutes said, industry was undeterred. Investment had
increased clearly from the middle of the current year as profit expectations
improved. Restructuring and rationalisation undertaken during the recession
had lowered break-even thresholds. Low pay deals and greater labour-force
flexibility had reduced unit labour costs to rates prevailing at the start
of 1991, and capacity utilisation was once again back at long-term average
levels. All these indicators pointed to investment in new capacity.
The DIW, on the other hand, believes that high long rates - a result of the
anti-inflation activities of the US Federal Reserve which are unrelated to
European conditions and market needs - will constrain investment plans.
The nub of the conflict lies between the DIW's demands that the Bundesbank
should cut short-term rates and the majority view that far from leading to
lower capital market rates, such a move would raise both inflationary
expectations - and, consequently, long rates.
There is also strife, although less polarised, over the dampening effects of
the D-Mark's relative strength on export opportunities, and the impact on
domestic demand of continuing pressure on disposable incomes.
A recent survey by Munich's Ifo economics institute found around half German
companies were already counting on negative effects from the dollar's fall
in mid-October to its lowest rate against the D-Mark in two years. On
balance, however, the national currency's strength is in present
circumstances seen as a positive factor since it acts as a buffer against
imported inflation.
Falling personal incomes are also playing a role in curbing inflation,
reducing manufacturers' and retailers' room for manoeuvre on prices. But
there is growing evidence that it may soon be time to reassess the broader
effects of shrunken pay cheques.
On recent experience, many economists predict the German public will
continue to draw on their substantial savings to prevent any real erosion of
their living standards. A study from the BVB banking industry association
noted that: 'the stability of private demand is remarkable in the light of
the fact that real incomes have been falling since the middle of 1993.'
Consumer demand was still at the level it reached in the preceding phase of
economic growth, the association said, adding that savings had acted as an
economic stabiliser during the recession, and implying they would continue
to function in similar fashion during the recovery phase.
Latest estimates suggest real private consumption has grown around 0.5 per
cent this year - confounding general forecasts of contraction - with a
similar rise forecast for 1995. However, the introduction in January of an
income tax surcharge to fund unification transfers, higher insurance taxes
and the launch of a contributions scheme for care for the elderly are
expected to slice another DM40bn a year off disposable incomes.
If consumers respond by digging deeper into their reserves or reducing the
amount of cash they salt away each month, it will not be long before the
Bundesbank pays attention and will not hesitate to raise interest rates,
regardless of the effect on growth.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (8): Perturbation in the boardrooms -
Corporate governance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's two-tier board system has been a much admired feature of its
industrial and financial strength in the post-war decades, but recent events
have led to some red faces among bankers and businessmen.
For the more complex and international businesses become, the harder it is
for non-executive supervisory board members - meeting only four times a year
 -to have a firm grasp of what is really going on. The case of
Metallgesellschaft has reopened the debate about the effectiveness of these
boards. The main questions asked are whether they serve any real purpose and
what sort of reforms, if any, should be introduced.
As usual in such cases, it is the banks which feel the impact most severely.
It is they who provide many of the non-executive board members, and
especially chairmen.
Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, a managing board member of Deutsche Bank, took over the
supervisory board chairmanship of Metallgesellschaft in March of last year.
It was at the end of 1993 that the industrial and trading company revealed
spectacular losses on US oil futures trading. Mr Schmitz's response was to
sack key members of the company's board, headed by Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch,
and try and unwind the financial costs of the complex oil contracts.
The argument about whether this was done in the right way - or whether it
made paper losses into real ones - is continuing, with executives of the
bank and the company ranged against academics and former Metallgesellschaft
employees. But the wider and more significant debate, over the real purpose
and relevance of German supervisory boards, is only just beginning.
Nor is it a new one. Previous industrial upsets have also led people to
question not only whether the system of two-tier boards was appropriate in
the first place but also whether the right people were being appointed to
them. Today, however, the debate in Germany also has to be seen in the
context of a wider international discussion over corporate governance - the
relationship between management, shareholders and others closely involved in
a corporation, such as employees.
The main criticisms of the German supervisory board (Aufsichtsrat) system
concern the frequency of meetings, the number of mandates individuals should
hold and the extent to which their work is supported by committees on such
functions as auditing and personnel. None of this would guarantee that
debacles like that of Metallgesellschaft - where Mr Schmitz says Mr
Schimmelbusch did not keep him properly informed - could never happen. But
such improvements would provide an extra level of protection.
The main job of the supervisory board is to choose the management board
(Vorstand). It also advises on major investment and other decisions. Since
1976, under the Mitbestimmung (co-determination) law, large companies must
have an equal number of shareholder members on their supervisory boards.
However, the chairman has a casting vote and one labour member has to come
from the white-collar staff and is thus likely to side more with management.
The workload for supervisory board members can be immense, especially for
the chairmen. Because of their links with corporations and their status in
the financial community, bankers are often chosen as heads or members of
these boards. Top managers of Deutsche Bank (from board members downwards)
sit on around 400 supervisory boards; Mr Hilmar Kopper, the bank's chairman,
heads the supervisory board of Daimler-Benz, the country's biggest
industrial group, and sits on those of Volkswagen, Lufthansa and Bayer,
among others.
One of his Deutsche Bank colleagues, Mr Rolf Breuer, believes it is up to
the banks to make the main proposals for a reform of Germany's non-executive
board system. One suggestion, also put forward by some politicians, is for a
reduction in the number of such board positions one person can hold;
currently, it is 10. 'It would certainly be desirable if people had more
time for a difficult mandate,' he told Finanzen magazine.
He also said supervisory boards would benefit from having more experienced
businessmen at or near retiring age. 'They would be 65 or younger and have a
great deal of experience or contacts.' More committees would help, too. But
he thought the Aufsichtsrat system as a whole was healthy.
In a comprehensive description of changes needed to the system, Mr Florian
Schilling, partner in a Frankfurt-based management consultancy firm (Amrop
Mulder &amp; Partner), agreed with some of these points. He said a study by the
firm had shown that many supervisory board members themselves agreed with
criticisms now being aired.
Of course, if shareholders took greater account of their own interests in
the first place, many of the problems would never occur. This would need a
basic change in shareholder consciousness, he said in an article in
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the daily newspaper. But since this was not
likely in the short term, improvements in the workings of supervisory boards
were necessary.
The lack of a strong equity culture in Germany is often bemoaned by those
wanting to speed up development of the country's financial markets. Carl
Furstenberg, a legendary German banker who died in 1931, once said
shareholders were stupid and cheeky - stupid for buying shares and cheeky
for expecting dividends. However, Mr Schilling noted there were few German
shareholders and they were seldom 'cheeky' enough to call management and
non-executives severely to account.
Among the main proposals arising from the Amrop Mulder study were: a more
open method of choosing supervisory board members; more use of specialised
committees; smaller boards of no more than 12 people instead of the 20 or so
at some companies; fewer bankers, a point with which many bankers themselves
agreed (Mr Schilling reckoned this reflected the harsh criticism many have
come under because of their supervisory board roles); the voluntary
acceptance of fewer mandates; and more frequent meetings.
Few critics of the system actually want to do away with it altogether; it
has played too valuable a role in promoting industrial harmony and solidity.
Nor is the current discussion anything new. Reforms were also mooted after
crises such as those at AEG, the electrical company now owned by
Daimler-Benz, IBH, the now defunct construction equipment maker, and the
Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz engineering concern.
Changes do not happen fast in Germany, so any revamping of the supervisory
board system will take time. But if nothing is done, the next crisis will
raise further doubts about its viability.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of the World Nuclear Industry (6): Serious threat of
bomb-making - Civil and military links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
North Korea's controversial nuclear programme is the most recent
demonstration that civil nuclear power is not as far divorced from military
applications as its supporters like to pretend. And the fact that the US and
South Korea are prepared to supply North Korea with water-cooled reactor
technology worth Dollars 2bn to stop its existing graphite reactor programme
shows just how seriously the threat of the transfer between civil and
military nuclear reactors is being taken.
The reason why is simple enough. For a would-be nuclear weapons state, the
hardest part of making an atomic bomb is getting enough of the right sort of
plutonium or uranium. The easiest place to get hold of the right sort of
plutonium is from the right sort of nuclear reactor.
For a relatively unsophisticated country the right kind of reactor uses
natural uranium, which is reasonably easily available, surrounded by
graphite. If the reactor is operated for several months, two important
nuclear processes occur. The first is the splitting of uranium, which
releases the energy to produce power, and the second is the conversion of
the natural form of uranium which is not explosive into a form of plutonium
which is. North Korea's nuclear reactors are of this graphite type and bear
a strong similarity to those which were originally used in the US for
plutonium production. Once the uranium in the reactor has been used for
several months it is taken out and the bomb-making plutonium can be
chemically separated. Whether the reactor is being used to make electricity
or plutonium is partly a semantic distinction because the reactor is doing
both.
However, if the uranium is left in the reactor for more than a few months
the explosive type of uranium is itself converted by the intense radiation
into a much less explosive form. For efficient bomb material the optimum
period in a reactor is about six months.
More advanced western reactors use water instead of gas to cool them.
Unfortunately, the water coolant slows down the reaction and so natural
uranium, which contains only 1 per cent of the type which will split to
release energy, has to be beefed up to about 4 per cent of the reactive
type.
This 'enrichment' is difficult and expensive, and is one reason why
beginners, such as the UK in the 1950s with the Magnox reactors, tend to
choose graphite reactors cooled by gas.
Because the enriched fuel for water reactors is so much more expensive it
has to be used for much longer in the reactor to make it cost-effective.
Using the fuel in the reactor for two or three years means that it contains
a lot of the unreactive form of plutonium and makes it much harder, although
not impossible, to detonate.
Water reactors also take longer to shut down, refuel, and restart, making
them easier to monitor by arms inspectors.
For these reasons the US negotiators have been trying to wean the North
Koreans off their hard-to-monitor plutonium-producing graphite cores towards
more controllable pressured water reactors. One problem for the US
negotiators is that their offer may be seen as giving in to blackmail.
Indeed, there is one school of thought which suggests that the North Koreans
never intended to make a nuclear weapon, but wanted to squeeze civil power
stations from the west.
Even if there are no further similar incidents, the operation of civil
nuclear reactors around the world does pose a military problem. Large
amounts of plutonium are produced, even in water-cooled reactors. While much
of this would be difficult to detonate, it is not impossible, and as it is
highly toxic it also presents a significant chemical threat in the hands of
terrorists or renegade states.
That genie is already partly out of the bottle because hundreds of tonnes of
plutonium have already been separated or 'reprocessed' from used reactor
fuel. Some of it is explicitly for weapons and other lower-grade stocks for
possible use in fast breeder reactors: a technology which has now been
shelved.
Protecting that plutonium in store is a hard enough task in the west, where
standards of accounting for nuclear stocks have in the past been lax. Even
last year, Mrs Hazel O'Leary, the US energy secretary, had to correct a
figure for US plutonium stocks by 1 1/2 tonnes - enough for 150 nuclear
weapons - because of accounting errors.
A full register of fissile materials does not exist and not even individual
countries know exactly how much plutonium and uranium they have or where it
all is. The problem is even worse in Russia where there are concerns that
fissile materials stores are not secure.
Against that background, preventing the spread of potential bomb materials
is difficult - and is being made more so by the reprocessing of further fuel
from civil reactors, and the dismantling of nuclear weapons. The plutonium
is not needed for civil purposes and even the proposed mixed-oxide fuels to
burn the plutonium are only a temporary palliative which will generate more
plutonium.
In the view of some in the nuclear industry, developed countries must
produce better and more open nuclear accountancy methods. This would
reassure non-nuclear weapons states that stockpiles were under control, and
the system could be passed on to developing countries to help them account
for their civil nuclear programmes.
The further reprocessing of fuel also looks questionable under these
conditions, because it separates more plutonium which needs safe storage.
'What could be better than storing this plutonium in its original fuel rods,
still mixed with the highly radioactive fission products which would kill
anyone who tried to steal it?' said one former nuclear executive.
Another engineer still in the nuclear industry said: 'I prefer to keep the
waste as solids in the fuel pins, rather than separated out with some as
highly radioactive liquids which are difficult to contain.'
Such views about the control of fissile materials to keep the barriers
between civil and military power are particularly important in the run-up to
the conference on extending the nuclear non-proliferation treaty next year.
So far, the objections of non-weapons states are that the weapons states
have not done enough to disarm or control their fissile stockpiles.
Their main anger has, however, been directed at the failure to agree a test
ban treaty, so that weapons states can continue to develop more and more
sophisticated bombs. Sooner or later though, the debate will switch to the
links between civil and military applications, and the control of fissile
materials stocks.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of the World Nuclear Industry (7): Valiant efforts
eradicated - Bronwen Maddox takes a look at the industry's safety record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is widespread public perception across much of the industrialised
world that the nuclear industry is unsafe. Some of this may have derived
originally from the industry's origins in the second world war's race for
the bomb. But the industry's valiant efforts over decades to disassociate
civil uses of nuclear energy from military ones in the public mind was
eradicated in 1986 by another event equally disastrous to its image: the
explosion at the Chernobyl reactor in Ukraine.
The industry internationally - and for these purposes, national companies
are surprisingly adept at acting in concert - argues vigorously that
Chernobyl was a one-off event. The Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development points out that it 'occurred on a
reactor of unique Soviet design and with operating practices that would not
have been tolerated in the west'.
Industry executives add that the Windscale accident in the UK in the 1950s
and the Three Mile Island incident in the US in 1979 did not cause deaths
through radiation emissions.
They have devoted pages of reports and millions of pounds to arguing, in the
words of the Nuclear Energy Agency, that 'it is possible with a sufficiently
high standard of safety to contain a potentially very dangerous process'.
In studying how to contain that process, the nuclear industry in western
countries and Japan has spent much time on improving the reliability of the
pressure vessels and pipework of the main circuits of a reactor,
particularly that for containing the reactor coolant.
In pressurised water reactors, much work has also been devoted to
strengthening the tubes of steam generators. The NEA reports that 'since the
early 1970s, operators of many PWRs around the world have found it necessary
to undertake much more plugging of steam generator tubes than expected'
because of corrosion and cracking.
Regulators' reports also repeatedly refer to the importance of training,
citing human error as the greatest risk in a modern reactor.
But how far should this process of refinement be pursued? What counts as
safe? Difficult political and economic decisions, such as the lifespan of
Britain's ageing Magnox reactors, depend on the answer. The answer to
whether that is 'safe enough' lies not in science or engineering but in
politics: on the degree of risk which the public will tolerate.
That brings the issue back to the question of the public image of the
industry. The UK government's Health and Safety Executive suggests that
safety standards in future nuclear plants should be set so that the risk to
a member of the public is at least 10 times less than that of a traffic
accident. As the HSE points out, though, however much time the nuclear
industry devotes to educating the public that the risk is low compared to
that from some other industries - and compared to that from activities such
as riding a motorcycle - it faces deep, probably immutable, prejudices.
People will tolerate much more risk from something they choose to do, such
as horse-riding, than they will from events beyond their control, the HSE
comments. Moreover, repeated surveys show that many people would rather die
of almost anything than of radiation from a nuclear accident.
In those efforts to persuade the public and politicians of its virtues, the
nuclear industry industry faces two other problems on which it also has
little influence. The first is that much civil nuclear power around the
world is closely associated with military uses - sometimes it occupies the
same site. Despite the industry's emphatic arguments that each reactor does
not represent a bomb, it has few tools to counter public suspicion, given
the secrecy that surrounds military programmes in even the most open
societies.
The second hazard the industry faces is that of an accident at one of the 58
crumbling eastern European and former Soviet reactors. If there is going to
be another Chernobyl, the odds are greatest that it will be here.
That gives nuclear companies operating to high standards a tough problem. In
the west, they are facing a battle to justify their existence, both with
government treasuries and with environmentalists. They have to reassure
those audiences that nuclear power can be safe and cheap. At the same time
they must stir up enough concern - among the same people - about the
perilous state of eastern reactors to persuade them to spend more money
quickly on repairs.
Even industries which have proved skilful at handling their public image
would find that juggling match difficult. Nuclear operators, which
frequently have an unwieldy and suspicious culture deriving from state
ownership, may find that the task of reassuring the outside world is
never-ending.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (4): Democrat of the left / Profile of
Gregor Gysi of the PDS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
He charms the elderly, he listens to the unemployed and he tries to capture
the imagination of the youth. He is witty, twists difficult questions to his
advantage, and convincingly states the case for the east Germans. 'He seems
all things to all people, but what does he really stand for?' asks a
supporter of Mr Gregor Gysi, the 46 year-old parliamentary leader of the
Party of Democratic Socialism, the successor to the east German communist
party.
Mr Gysi, a former civil rights lawyer and son of a former east German
minister of Culture, has few illusions about what he wants to achieve over
the next four years. He wants to make the PDS the main left-wing party in
east Germany and even to get the party rooted in west Germany as well, where
the left wing is dominated by the Social Democratic Party (SPD).
So far, the dapper, small man who alternates his smart suit with black
denims and shirt, seems to be succeeding, at least in the east. The PDS won
nearly 18 per cent of the vote in east Germany during the recent federal
elections, and nation-wide it captured 4.4 per cent. Not bad for a party
whose membership is stigmatised for its communist past and pilloried by the
west German media and established political parties for being 'fascists
painted red'. All this is grist to Mr Gysi's mill. 'It means the
establishment is taking us seriously,' he says.
But the next few months are crucial for Mr Gysi and the PDS. For one thing,
he has to shake off allegations of having had unofficial contacts with the
Stasi, the former east German secret police. If documents can be found to
discredit him, then the PDS will almost certainly lose the one politician
who can make it into a modern social democratic party.
To achieve his goal Mr Gysi will have to isolate the Communist Platform, a
hard-line Leninist wing which believes in the centralised state and economy.
He and Mr Andre Brie, his campaign organiser and 'ideologist' of the party,
want to address this issue at next January's PDS conference.
He also wants to make certain that the PDS moves away from being a 'protest
party', which attracts the unemployed and those disappointed with
unification, to one which can interest the younger generation. 'The PDS
could become a short-lived phenomenon if the economy picks up and if the SPD
really establishes itself in east Germany,' said Mr Brie. Above all, Mr Gysi
wants to give the party respectability. The fact that the PDS now supports
the minority coalition government of the Social Democrats and the Greens in
the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, suggests that it wants to learn what
power with responsibility means.
However, he knows that time is not on his side. He faces elections in Berlin
next year, where the SPD is desperate to dislodge Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
governing Christian Democrats from the Rathaus, or mayor's office. If the
PDS, which won four seats in Berlin at the federal elections, fares badly in
1995, it will be Mr Gysi who will have to carry the can.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (3): We're no pushover, politicians are
told - Why the east voted differently
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was extraordinary relief among German politicians when the election
results started coming through on the night of October 16.
All the parties had cause to celebrate. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing
Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union, its Bavarian
sister party, was returned to power, albeit with a majority of 10 seats.
The Free Democrats, the junior partner in the coalition, managed to jump the
5 per cent hurdle - due to tactical voting - which will allow them to remain
in the coalition. The opposition Social Democrats had their share of the
vote increased by nearly 3 per cent to 36.4 per cent. And the Greens/Bundnis
90 got 7.3 per cent, 1 per cent more than the FDP.
Even the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the successor to east
Germany's former communist party, got 4.4 per cent of the vote on the
federal level, and nearly 18 per cent in eastern Germany itself.
Yet behind the smiles and jubilation lies one fundamental problem which
unites all the west German political parties: the election results clearly
showed that if there is to be genuine political unification, the parties
must work hard to establish themselves in eastern Germany. The elections
results there explain why.
In eastern Germany, the CDU's share of the vote fell by 3.3 per cent to 38.5
per cent; the FDP's fell by 8.9 per cent to 4 per cent; the SPD's vote rose
by 7 per cent to 31.9 per cent; the Greens/Bundnis 90 remained almost the
same at 5.7 per cent; and the PDS's share of the vote rose by 6.6 per cent
to 17.7 per cent.
The lesson of these results is that a political culture is evolving in
eastern Germany which could point towards polarised voting.
At one end of the spectrum is the CDU. At the other is a divided left, with
the east Germans deciding over the next few years whether the region's
legitimate left-wing party will be the PDS, successor of the communists, or
the SPD, the western-based Social Democrats.
The SPD, against all the odds, did better than expected in the five eastern
states. After all, it was the only political party which had no 'block'
party which before German unification had been sanctioned by the ruling
communist, or Socialist Unity Party. As a result, since 1990, the SPD had to
start from scratch in building up a local grass roots organisation.
It made no significant headway over the past four years, for example by
winning over PDS voters. One reason was that the SPD lacked personnel. More
important, as the central party organisation in Bonn moved towards the
centre this had the affect of creating a vacuum in eastern Germany which the
PDS gradually filled.
Moreover, the SPD in Bonn, under Mr Rudolf Scharping, failed to sense the
shifting political alliances in eastern Germany, particularly after the
elections in June in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt when the SPD managed
to dislodge the governing CDU/FDP coalition from power by forming a minority
government with the Greens/Bundnis 90, but with support from the PDS.
Saxony-Anhalt represented a turning point. It showed that the SPD in eastern
Germany needs the support of the PDS if it is to dislodge the CDU from
power, and if it is to make any inroads into the left-wing vote. But the SPD
in Bonn is not prepared to allow another Saxony-Anhalt model to emerge in
the eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. There, Mr Harold Ringstorff,
leader of the SPD, had considered trying to form a minority government with
the backing of the PDS. Mr Scharping staunchly opposed this and insisted
that the SPD instead form a coalition government with the CDU, the largest
party.
This pressure from Bonn is seen by SPD officials in eastern Germany as
counter-productive. 'We will never establish our own roots and identity if
the SPD federal leadership does not recognise that eastern Germany is
different, that our political culture is different, and that we need
support, not instructions from Bonn, to help us establish ourselves as a
genuine left-wing party here,' a Mecklenburg-Vorpommern SPD official said.
Yet as this battle for the left-wing vote will almost certainly intensify
over the next four years, with the PDS determined not to lose the momentum,
or remain a protest, or 'anti-wessi' (anti-west German) party, the FDP and
the Greens will have to reconsider their entire strategy in eastern Germany.
The FDP failed to jump the 5 per cent hurdle in the east, and failed to get
re-elected in the eastern state governments of Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony,
Thuringia and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The Greens came under immense pressure
as well. Although they jumped the 5 per cent hurdle throughout eastern
Germany, they failed to get back into the state parliaments of Saxony,
Thuringia, Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
These voting trends for the the FDP and the Greens indicate two things: the
centre/liberal political culture has failed to become rooted in eastern
Germany; and second, the question of environmental issues and the need for
an alternative voice representing greater accountability in the German
political system carries practically no weight in eastern Germany. The
political liberal/centre and alternative political parties do not yet exist.
The FDP explains its miserable performance in the east by pointing to the
absence of a Mittelstand, the small and medium-sized enterprises which form
the backbone of the FDP in the west. But FDP officials also add that
libertarian values of civil rights, easier access to citizenship, more
rights for foreigners, an immigration law, the protection of civil rights,
and curbs on police powers, have little relevance to the east German voter.
'A section of the east German voters want strong leadership, a government
which will provide security, combat crime, and reduce unemployment,' an FDP
official said. Perhaps, when the economy in the east picks up, the fledgling
Mittelstand might shift to the FDP. But at the moment, the PDS has captured
part of this constituency.
The Greens/Bundnis 90 are even in a more difficult situation. They are
handicapped by a tiny membership. But their policies, which focus on
environmental and ecological issues, touch few east Germans. More
disappointing for the Greens is that the inspiring and energetic spontaneous
movement of 'people power' which emerged in the autumn of 1989, and whose
immense pressure led to the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the communist
system, has disappeared.
The wish - however idealistic - for a political system based on the local
and popular level has either given way to disillusionment, or else some of
those energies have been channeled into the PDS.
Perhaps time, coupled with an economic upswing, will allow the FDP and the
Greens/Bundnis to regroup and reorganise in eastern Germany. But as
officials across the political spectrum in eastern Germany admit, the east
Germans are politically tired, while those with any political energy do not
want interference from Bonn.
'There is a yearning to make our own politics. To find our own way,' an SPD
official in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern explained. 'If we cannot do this, more of
our voters will drift to the PDS. We have much to do over the next four
years,' he added.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of the World Nuclear Industry (4): Suppliers are
flooding in - Frank Gray takes a look at Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Western nuclear equipment suppliers, after years of non-growth in their own
markets, are now flooding into Asia in search of fresh business that might
arise from the region's rapidly expanding electricity supply industry.
The big news coming out of the region centres on Taiwan and the People's
Republic of China - each of which is close to firming up big orders for
large nuclear power complexes as part of their drive to diversify their
electricity policies away from near-exclusive dependence on fossil fuels.
Mainland China is heading for a potential bonanza and has outlined plans to
add 15 new nuclear plants between now and the first decade of the next
century. They would have a combined capacity of at least 12,000MW, and most
of the key components, such as reactors and turbines, would be imported.
In the past two years, China has commissioned its first three reactors,
which have 2,100MW of capacity. They are the 1,800MW, two-unit complex at
Daya Bay, north of Hong Kong, built by Framatome of France and the
Anglo-French GEC-AIsthom. A third 300MW unit, built mainly with Chinese
technology, is operating at Qinshan, south of Shanghai at a site being
developed for a full family of reactors.
In recent weeks, Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd (AECL) signed an agreement to
enter into detailed negotiations for the supply of a two-unit, 1,400MW
complex at Qinshan. The proposal, if firmed up, is worth CDollars 2.6bn. It
follows a recent announcement by Framatome that it had won a FFrl. 4bn
contract to supply equipment for a second 300MW unit at Qinshan.
These units would be in addition to China's outline plan to add a series of
large reactors in south-eastern China, not far from the Daya Bay complex.
The units would provide long-term base-load capacity in one of the country's
most rapidly industrialising regions.
The potential of the China market is tempered by concerns about its ability
to fund such schemes, but no such worries surround the race to win at least
Dollars 2bn in contracts to supply Taiwan with 2,300MW of nuclear capacity,
to be installed at a new complex inside a national park on the northern tip
of the island.
Mr Adrian M. T. Wang, vice-chairman of Taiwan's Atomic Energy Council,
recently said that the contract to build the two-unit complex would be made
before the end of January. Conspicuous bidders were Framatome and Siemens
and a US-UK consortium of Westinghouse and Nuclear Electric. Mr Wang said
that Taiwan had to accelerate its nuclear programme because of its huge, 93
per cent, dependence on imported energy.
Development of the site had been suspended several times since the mid-1980s
because of environmental protest.
The units would add to Taiwan's existing nuclear capacity of 5,144MW; some
26 per cent of all installed power.
The nuclear issue has brought the two Chinas together on the issue of
uranium supplies and storage. Taiwan recently agreed in principle to buy
uranium concentrate from China in exchange for permission to store the
island's nuclear waste at a remote site on the mainland.
Japan and South Korea, the number one and two countries in Asia in terms of
nuclear capacity, both plan rapid expansion, and Indonesia is planning to
begin its own nuclear power programme.
Mr. Djali Ahimsa, director-general of Indonesia's National Atomic Energy
Agency, said recently that first tenders would be called next year for the
supply of Indonesia's first nuclear units, which would be built at Mount
Muria in north-central Java. The target date for completion was 2004, with
more pairs of units being added regularly thereafter.
Indonesia's total capacity now was 10,000MW, but projections called for this
to rise to 31,800MW by 2011. Nuclear plants would ease pressure arising from
Indonesia's diminishing oil reserves and would free gas and coal for export.
After Japan, South Korea has the the world's most ambitious nuclear plant
expansion programme. At present, Korea Electric Power operates nine reactors
with a capacity of 7,616MW, about 36 per cent of total capacity. By 2006, it
plans to have added another 14 units, with a capacity of 12,800MW, boosting
nuclear's share of all electricity to 37.7 per cent of total capacity of
45,533MW. By 2031, plans call for a further 18,900MW of nuclear capacity to
be added, by which time a total of 7,617MW will have been decommissioned.
Most reactors have been supplied by Westinghouse, Atomic Energy of Canada
and Framatome, with Korea Heavy Industries increasingly developing its own
reactor know-how.
Kepco officials are excited by the diplomatic breakthrough with the North,
which will mean the installation of 2,000MW of nuclear capacity under
western supervision in exchange for Pyongyang's decision to scrap its
obsolescent - but potentially lethal - graphite-moderated reactors.
In Japan, there is more than 30,000MW of nuclear capacity in operation, but
the country's private sector power utilities are falling well behind the
government's proposed schedule to add a further 40,000MW by 2010.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) says the time needed
to negotiate site acquisition, obtain government and local approval, and
construct a nuclear plant is now beyond an acceptable level. It hopes
Japan's nine power utilities will build and start operating at least 15 new
reactors by 2010, but it foresees this target as difficult to achieve under
present socio-political conditions.
The leading utilities, led by Tokyo Electric Power Co. (Tepco) are sourcing
the most important nuclear components domestically, under licence from GE
and Westinghouse. GE is also a leading constructor in its own right, and is
in joint venture with Toshiba and Hitachi to install 2,600MW of capacity at
Tepco's Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power stations, which will open in two
phases in 1996-97.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of the World Nuclear Industry (2): Moving forward at
a snail's pace - Technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For several years nuclear technology has been moving forward at a snail's
pace. Progress is painfully slow for those who remember how quickly new
reactors were designed during the growth years in the 1950s, 1960s and early
1970s. It is also glacial when compared with other industries, not only
fast-moving fields such as biotechnology and electronics but also competing
energy technologies such as efficient gas-fired power plants.
Some of the reasons for the slow progress are obvious. After 15 years with
few orders for new nuclear plants the industry has neither the funds to
undertake research and development on a large scale nor the incentive to
design new reactors.
So the main activity is gradual, incremental improvement of the
long-established reactor designs - which is not something to quicken the
heart of an enthusiastic young engineer. There is a morale problem in some
nuclear research establishments, with an ageing workforce soldiering on to
retirement.
The pressurised water reactor, designed originally in the US, dominates the
international nuclear industry. PWRs represent 55 per cent of the world's
operating nuclear reactors and generate 63 per cent of nuclear electricity.
And the PWR features just as prominently in the industry's future plans.
According to the Nuclear Industry Handbook 1994, published by Nuclear
Engineering International, PWRs account for 74 of the 143 units planned or
under construction (equivalent to 67 per cent of generating capacity).
The PWR pumps water under high pressure - to prevent boiling - to the
generator, where steam is raised in a separate circuit.
The next most popular type is the PWR's closest cousin, the boiling water
reactor. The BWR raises steam directly from the cooling water and therefore
does not need a separate heat exchanger. Although the simpler circuitry
reduces construction costs, this advantage is offset by the requirement for
additional shielding since the circuit is susceptible to radioactive
contamination.
Development of advanced BWRs for the late 1990s is continuing, particularly
in Japan where five BWR units are under construction and four are planned.
But development work in Europe and US is concentrated on advanced PWRs.
These designs incorporate a range of 'passive' or 'inherent' safety features
which are intended to reduce the risk of a catastrophic accident by an order
of magnitude or more compared to existing reactors.
For example the power density of the core is reduced and the reactor is
larger than earlier PWRs with the same output. And the new designs are
simpler, more rugged and more forgiving of operator error and mechanical
failure.
Europe's standardised advanced design is the 1,450MW European PWR (EPR) from
Nuclear Power International, a partnership of France's Framatome and
Germany's Siemens. The project timetable calls for sites for the first EPR
units to be selected in 1997 and construction to begin in 1999, with
commercial operation from 2005.
The US is developing two advanced PWRs with joint funding from the
government and industry: the 1,350MW System 80+ from ABB Combustion
Engineering and the 600MW AP600 from Westinghouse. With little immediate
prospect of new orders from the US electricity supply industry, their
commercial prospects probably depend on winning export business in Asia.
Westinghouse, for example, set up an AP600 engineering centre in Indonesia
this year to prepare for the design's introduction there.
The emphasis of advanced reactor research is more on winning public
acceptability through inherent safety than reducing costs, because the
industry remains convinced that in the long term it can win the economic
competition with fossil fuels.
Development of gas-cooled reactors - the technology on which the British
nuclear industry relied until a PWR was ordered for Sizewell B - has
virtually stopped in the UK. But gas-cooled reactor research is continuing
in the US and Russia.
The latest government-funded US project is the Gas Turbine-Modular Helium
Reactor (GT-MHR) in which high-temperature helium coolant from the reactor
drives a gas turbine directly, without the need for a steam generating
circuit. It is claimed to be safe, simple and cheap to build and operate.
The GT-MHR is a candidate for burning surplus plutonium extracted from
former Soviet nuclear warheads in a US-Russian joint venture. The reactor
would generate electricity and produce energy for district heating.
Meanwhile R&amp;D into fast breeder reactors - once seen as the inevitable next
step for the nuclear industry - is running down worldwide. Substantial
programmes still continue in France, Russia and Japan, but there seems to be
little prospect that fast reactors will enter commercial operation within 20
years.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of the World Nuclear Industry (5): Review will reveal
all - Michael Smith examines the UK industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is just conceivable that the UK nuclear power industry could be on the
brink of a glorious era in which the industry will be transferred into the
private sector and than expanded significantly. But few people are betting
on it.
All will become clear when the government announces the conclusions of its
long-awaited review into the industry in the next few months. The review
could provide the framework for the industry for years, possibly decades, to
come.
The two main generators, Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, are pushing
hard both for privatisation and for the ability to build new power stations.
But they are struggling to get their arguments accepted.
It is, after all, just five years since the government was persuaded that
investors would not buy nuclear power stations from the state. Ministers
promptly pulled the sale of the nuclear stations from the privatisation of
the rest of the power industry, imposed a moratorium on the building of new
stations and promised the review which is now under way.
The nuclear industry has used the time well, achieving significant increases
in efficiency.
Since 1989, Nuclear Electric has managed to raise its share of the
electricity market in England and Wales from 16 per cent to almost 25 per
cent. This sharp improvement has been largely due to its success in
overcoming technical difficulties with its five advanced gas-cooled reactor
stations that were built in the 1970s. From having been among the worst
performing nuclear stations in the world, the AGRs are now among the best.
Scottish Nuclear has also made impressive strides, achieving a 40 per cent
increase in output since 1989 and 50 per cent improvement in productivity.
In spite of the improved efficiency, the industry is struggling to shake off
its critics' claims that it is uncompetitive. The main problem is the
existence of nuclear levy, through which Pounds 1bn a year is raised from
domestic power consumers in England and Wales every year for the nuclear
power industry. Nuclear Electric argues that the levy is to pay from
liabilities it inherited from the Central Electricity Generating Board, its
fore-runner, but the government is less precise about its purpose.
The nuclear industry's opponents say it is a subsidy. They feel they are on
even firmer ground over the costs of building Sizewell C, the 2,500MW power
station planned for the Suffolk, England, coast. This is planned by the
nuclear industry as what it hopes will be the first in a series of new
plants.
N. M. Rothschild, the merchant bank advising Nuclear Electric, is working on
the possibility that it may be possible to build a nuclear power station
entirely with private sector finance.
Rothschild has yet to make its findings public but the City of London will
take some convincing. Investors were sceptical enough about Nuclear
Electric's claim in June that it could produce electricity from the 2,500MW
Sizewell C at 3.7p a unit.
This was based on the assumptions that the station could be built for Pounds
3.5bn, its operating efficiency would be 85 per cent and that the private
sector would demand an 11 per cent return on capital invested. Critics say
all of these claims are highly optimistic. But assuming 3.7p is achievable,
it is still considerably higher than the average price of 2.4p this year in
the electricity wholesale trading pool to which the new station would have
to sell its power.
The pool price will rise by the early years of the next century but not
necessarily to 3.7p. The gap could be bridged if the government was prepared
to provide a subsidy, perhaps as much as Pounds 1m. But for Sizewell C to go
ahead, the government would also have to provide guarantees against future
regulatory change or decommissioning problems.
It felt unable to give such undertakings in 1989, but since then the
environmental arguments in favour of nuclear power have increased.
There is more international pressure to cut sulphur and carbon dioxide
emissions.
But nuclear power's opponents in the gas and coal industries could argue
that providing state aid for nuclear power, whether through direct subsidy
or underwriting the industry for regulatory change, would be a clear
distortion in an energy market which ministers want to be fully competitive.
This will prove a telling point in the review.
Even more persuasive is the government's lack of funds and the argument that
the UK does not need any more power stations in an over-supplied market.
The Treasury backs nuclear power privatisation both for financial and
ideological reasons.
The two nuclear companies have suggested an industry structure which could
make privatisation possible. Under this the older Magnox stations, which
have large liabilities, would remain in the public sector, leaving the
advanced gas-cooled reactors and Nuclear Electric's pressurised water
reactor Sizewell B, to be sold off.
Prof Stephen Littlechild, electricity industry regulator, wants more radical
restructuring and has suggested that Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear
swap some of their assets. This is not appealing to the generators, although
they welcome his support for privatisation.
For all this, political considerations make it unlikely that the government
will want to plunge into a privatisation.
Some Conservative politicians will argue that selling the nuclear power
industry would enable the government to keep the privatisation bandwagon
rolling. But most consider nuclear power far too controversial an issue to
bring to the fore in the run-up to a general election.
The review is therefore likely to attempt to prepare the ground for nuclear
privatisation after the next general election which is scheduled for 1997 at
the latest. Privatisation, while winning the general approval of the
government, is probably still some years off, and if the Labour party wins
the next election it may never happen.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of the World Nuclear Industry (3): Some challenges to
be weathered - Developments in France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France's formidable nuclear industry seems so far to be weathering a number
of challenges: the public debate over nuclear waste, the conundrum of the
future of the Superphenix breeder reactor, and pressure from Brussels for
liberalisation of the European energy market.
What had been billed as the big media event of the year turned out a
relative flop. This was the march in April and May against the Balladur
government's decision to re-start Superphenix as a research reactor. The
march began on April 8 south of Lyon at Creys-Malville, the site of
Superphenix, then wound east to take in part of Switzerland and Germany,
then - a month later - ended in Paris with no more than 1,500 demonstrators.
It was a far cry from tens of thousands, some of them from Switzerland and
Germany, who mobilised at Creys-Malville in the late 1970s against the
building of Superphenix, and a disappointment to the Greens whose chief goal
in the nuclear field had been to extend indefinitely the shut-down of
Superphenix ordered in mid-1990.
Superphenix, built as the world's largest breeder reactor to produce
electricity, has this autumn started a new life as a centre of research into
the burning of plutonium and other waste. The plant, which cost about
FFr27bn to build, must be the world's most expensive research reactor, but
mothballing it was not cheap either. Running the plant as a research reactor
will cost FFr100m a year, to be borne by the French Atomic Energy Commission
(CEA) and Electricite de France (EdF), the state-owned utility which owns 51
per cent of the reactor, although they may reap some marginal benefit from
sales of what electricity generates as a by-product.
Cogema, France's nuclear fuels agency, says that Superphenix's net
consumption - or elimination - of 100kg of plutonium a year will be useful,
but rather puny in relation to the 10 tonnes of plutonium that France's 56
reactors generate each year, along with nearly 80 per cent of the country's
electricity supply.
Cogema opened a new reprocessing plant in La Hague in August, specifically
to treat as much as 800 tonnes of EdF's nuclear waste each year.
This unit, named UP2, is akin to UP3 which started in 1990 and which is
designed to serve Cogema's 27 foreign clients.
Mr Jean-Louis Ricaud, Cogema's head of reprocessing, claims that both French
and foreigners have gained, because after having each paid out FFr 20bn for
their own reprocessing unit, they have been able to split the FFr 20bn extra
cost of installations common to the two reprocessing units.
For Cogema, as well as for British Nuclear Fuels, German utilities are an
important customer, accounting for 15 per cent of the French agency's total
business. However, as a result of a compromise earlier this year between the
government and the opposition Social Democrats, German utilities are no
longer required to reprocess their spent fuel, and now have the option of
stocking it.
German utilities are financing the preparation of a disposal site in the
Gorleben salt mines in Lower Saxony, but political objections have put this
well behind schedule. This seems to be why Mr Ricaud says he is 'extremely
confident that La Hague even in 15 years time will have a full load'.
Mr Ricaud, naturally, favours reprocessing rather than stocking spent fuel.
'Stocking would be like leaving old cars lying by the roadside; reprocessing
is like the sensible business of compressing all this spent steel into
something useful'. But even Cogema recognises that there is some waste -
about 200 cubic metres of long-lived and highly radioactive material, enough
to fill the average swimming pool - which cannot be re-used and which is
just piling up in a temporary silo at La Hague.
The general idea is to bury this waste. The government has now chosen four
possible underground sites, whose geology it is studying. In another year or
so, it will select two of these sites in which to sink underground research
laboratories costing costing some FFr1.5bn each.
Eventually, around the year 2006, it may decide on an eventual nuclear waste
storage site.
EdF, as the world's largest nuclear power generator, is closely identified
with the nuclear cause, but this does not tarnish its image, at least not at
home. According to a Louis Harris poll last year, 80 per cent of French had
'A good opinion' of EdF; not as high as France Telecom (84 per cent) but
higher than Gaz de France (77 per cent) or Elf-Aquitaine (58 per cent).
The opening of electricity markets in Europe and around the world,
particularly in fast-growing Asia, presents EdF with an enormous opportunity
which it appears to be seizing with both hands. It now exports 12 per cent
of its French-generated power to the UK, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Spain
and Portugal. And it is also investing abroad, in Argentina, Slovakia and
most recently in Sweden.
At the same time, however, it has every intention of protecting its home
patch, menaced by Brussels. The European Commission has threatened court
action to get France and some others to drop their monopolies on the export
and import of energy.
EdF is not worried about imports, given the competitiveness of its
nuclear-generated electricity. It does not even mind too much about the
introduction of some competitive bidding by suppliers. But EdF draws the
line at 'third party access' which would see an end to EdF's distribution
monopoly.
It is this monopoly, says EdF,that gives it the ability to plan the heavy
long-term investments so characteristic of the nuclear industry.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (2): Chancellor of unification - Mr Kohl
has triumphed again. But for how long?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Helmut Kohl's narrow victory in the German elections, with a majority of
just 10 seats for his conservative-liberal coalition, was a personal triumph
for the German chancellor.
In less than nine months, he transformed a lame-duck administration,
trailing several points behind its opponents in the polls, into a winner.
He did it very largely thanks to his own reputation and his own efforts. Yet
his victory may prove to have been more Pyrrhic than real. Many are already
speculating about how long the current coalition can last.
On the one hand, the very narrowness of the victory has done wonders in
concentrating the minds of the coalition partners. The usually interminable
negotiations between Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its
Bavarian sister-party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and their minority
liberal partners, the Free Democratic Party (FDP), have been completed in
record time.
Trouble might well have been expected from either of the small parties. The
FDP, in particular, in spite of being decimated in the election, with a drop
in support from 11 per cent in 1990 to under 7 per cent, nevertheless holds
the balance of power in the Bundestag. It desperately needs to gain an
independent profile. But Mr Klaus Kinkel, the party leader and foreign
minister, went along with a strategy of papering over the cracks.
The CSU, now the second largest party in the coalition, might have held out
for bigger and better jobs at the expense of the FDP. But Mr Theo Waigel,
the CSU leader and finance minister, also played it cool.
They all agree on the broad outline of government priorities, on the need to
cut back public spending from the present 51 per cent of gross national
product, to reduce the budget deficit within the guidelines of the
Maastricht treaty.
All this must be done while continuing to finance the burden of German
unification, requiring massive public transfers to restructure the east
German economy, to pay for the continuing high unemployment, finance the
local government administration which still lacks any reliable tax base, and
pay for large-scale investment in all forms of infrastructure.
As for foreign policy, it is also broadly agreed, with a strategy of
enlarging the European Union to the east linked with further clear steps to
greater integration in the west.
On the other hand, the difficulties will lie in the detail, in the tactics,
rather than the strategy. Precise details of the promised reforms of
corporate taxation, of social spending cuts, and of measures to combat
rising crime and illegal immigration, could all upset the apple-cart.
Foreign policy, too, may not be as straightforward as it looks, with
differences between the parties on the pace of opening to the east, and on
European integration.
The problems for Mr Kohl certainly look fairly daunting. In the first place,
he heads a tired team, urgently in need of fresh blood, but with little
available to revive it. His new cabinet looks depressingly like the old one.
Mr Kinkel has emerged from the election campaign looking like a loser, and
may indeed be replaced by his party next year, if it can find an
alternative. Mr Waigel has also failed to stamp his authority on his own
party, having failed to become prime minister in Bavaria last year.
Remaining in Bonn is obviously his second choice. Both return to the cabinet
with their former jobs.
The brightest lights in the government are relatively junior.  In the CDU,
Mr Matthias Wissmann, hitherto transport minister and before that briefly
research minister, has shown himself competent and an effective
communicator. In the CSU, Mr Horst Seehofer, as health minister, was also
one of the success stories of the previous administration. The freshest new
face is that of 28-year-old Ms CLaudia Nolte, who has shot straight into the
cabinet as minister for women, youth, families and the elderly, combining
two former ministries. Overall, there will be 17 ministers, two fewer than
before. Chancellor Kohl has compounded his personnel problems by giving
intimations of his own mortality: he let it be known during the election
campaign that he would not stand again in 1998. That seems certain to
unleash a debilitating succession struggle in the not-too-distant future,
unless he goes back on his word.
In his own party, his natural successor, Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the CDU
parliamentary leader, has the severe handicap of being wheelchair-bound
following an assassination attempt in 1990. Mr Volker Ruhe, another
erstwhile crown prince, has not enhanced his reputation as defence minister,
and is thoroughly unpopular in his own party. Mr Kohl's instinct for
political survival has ensured that most potential rivals for his position -
like Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, now state premier in Saxony, or Mr Heiner Geissler,
the former party secretary-general - have been banished from the corridors
of power.
The succession struggle may only begin in a couple of years. But the
chancellor faces a more immediate problem: how to rule not only with a
paper-thin majority in the Bundestag, but against a hostile majority in the
Bundesrat, the second house of parliament, representing the 16 federal
states.
The Bundesrat never operates entirely along party-political lines,
representing a complex mix of state governments which range from grand
coalitions between the CDU and the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD),
through 'rainbow' coalitions of many parties - SPD, Greens and FDP, for
example - to single party rule in a minority of states. The SPD's leading
role in a majority of the governments means that it has the capacity to
block legislation, above all where finance is required. So Mr Kohl faces the
prospect of having to rule in a de facto grand coalition with the SPD in the
Bundesrat, as well as with his FDP and CSU partners in the Bundestag. This
really means that Germany's states will continue to wield considerable power
in Bonn - as when they were able to win substantially increased influence
over European Union decisions in the process of ratifying the Maastricht
treaty. They can trim the ambitions of the federal government, and upset
plans for strict spending control.
Mr Kohl is a past master at the consensus-building required by such a
political stalemate, but it does mean that decision-making becomes
enormously time-consuming and unwieldy.
Perhaps his greatest problem will be the unpredictability of his junior
coalition partner, the FDP. The liberals, members of almost every Bonn
coalition, were punished by voters for their lack of policy profile, and
their lack of personalities.
They only managed to scrape back into the Bundestag thanks to a large number
of second votes - in favour of a party list, rather than individual
candidates - transferred by CDU supporters, who calculated (correctly) that
without the FDP in parliament, the coalition would have no majority at all.
The temptation now will be to seek that profile by distancing themselves
from their coalition partners.
Mr Kinkel is committed to the coalition: he fought the election on that
basis, and fought the doubters in his party. But there are clearly those
within its ranks - including Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the former economics
minister, and possibly Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former leader and
foreign minister, who remains very much the father-figure - who might be
tempted to bring down the coalition in mid-term, with an eye to the next
elections.
One strategy would be to force the CDU and SPD into a grand coalition, as
happened in 1969, leading ultimately to a change in 1972 to an SPD-FDP
coalition under Chancellor Willy Brandt. Another, much less predictable,
would be simply to switch allegiance to the SPD in a rainbow coalition with
the Greens. With the FDP desperate to recover its lost electors, any such
strategy may be possible. Mr Kohl will do his level best to keep them on
board, because he knows that the alternative of a grand coalition with the
SPD has never proved healthy for his party in the past.
It allows the Social Democrats to demonstrate that they can be worthy and
reliable members of a government, to overcome the conservative German
electors' innate mistrust. As for the SPD itself, the party leadership has
adopted a strategy of wait-and-see. The election result was a
disappointment, but in the end, not a disaster. Mr Rudolf Scharping, the
youthful leader, has moved from his provincial base in Mainz, where he was
state premier, to the Bundestag as parliamentary leader, giving himself the
national platform he needs to prepare for a possible change of power. He
knows that the pressure is on Mr Kohl and his coalition rather than on the
opposition.
He has problems on two fronts: he must ensure that his main rival for the
party leadership, the smoother and more articulate Mr Gerhard Schroder,
state premier in Lower Saxony, cannot mount a challenge. As he was closely
involved in the SPD election strategy, he cannot distance himself from blame
for the defeat. The other problem is to oppose the Chancellor, without being
seen to be totally negative: the SPD majority in the Bundesrat must be used
with care. That is the in-built pressure in the German system towards
consensus.
Nothing is entirely predictable about the next four years in German
political life. But the consensus-building system will probablymuddle on,
never producing entirely clear decisions, but still finding acceptable
solutions. It is really more a system of non-government, than strong
government, which may well be one secret of German success.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of the World Nuclear Industry (1): Concern over lull
in plant construction - Fifty years after the first controlled nuclear chain
reaction, the industry is still growing, but at a much slower pace than it
would like
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nuclear industry enthusiasts call it a breathing space. But many executives
are concerned that the present lull in plant construction will be rather
more permanent and that the frenetic building activity of the 1970s and, to
a lesser extent the 1980s, will not be seen again in their lifetimes.
There is little chance of a revival this century and even nuclear power's
more robust supporters would be hard pressed to predict with confidence a
resurgence in the early decades of the next century.
Fifty years after the first controlled nuclear chain reaction, which made
power generation possible, the industry is still growing, but at a much
slower pace than it would like.
Latest estimates from the International Atomic Energy Agency are that the
2,100 Terrawatt hours of electricity produced from nuclear power worldwide
will expand by between 11 and 13 per cent by the end of the century.
But that is against a background of a much faster expansion in demand for
electricity which could see output growing by more than 20 per cent over the
same period.
The 17.5 per cent market share enjoyed by nuclear last year is expected by
the IAEA to be 13 per cent at worst by 2015 and 15 per cent at best.
What has gone wrong for an industry that once promised to provide the lion's
share of the world's electricity?
The Three Mile Island and Chernobyl accidents have had a decisive effect on
the public's thinking. Nor have recent nuclear proliferation scare stories,
however unjustified they may have been, helped nuclear power's cause. But a
large part of the problem is commercial and stems from the transformation of
the electricity supply industries in countries throughout the world.
Monopolies are being dismantled, competition is being increased and, in some
cases, ownership is being transferred from the public to the private
sectors. The more commercially-minded, and in some cases smaller, utilities
are adopting a more risk-averse approach.
They want technologies that have low capital costs and short lead times, and
power stations that can be built with easy planning consent procedures. They
also want plant that can be used flexibly.
None of this is conducive to nuclear power construction. Atomic power plants
cannot be switched on and off with the ease of a gas or coal plant. They
take longer to construct than gas, coal or oil-fired stations and are more
expensive to build.
The problems are demonstrated by recent constructions in the UK. Sizewell B,
the 1,200MW station about to be fully operational on the east coast of
England, cost about Pounds 2bn to build and is coming on stream 13 years
after a public inquiry was started into whether it should be built.
By contrast, PowerGen last year opened a 900MW gas-fired power plant at
Killingholme, Humberside, less than four years after deciding to go ahead
with it. The UK, with its access to North Sea gas, is a special case, but
there are few countries where a new nuclear plant rather than a coal or gas
plant would be built if the decision were based on short-term financial
criteria.
The nuclear industry argues that taking what it sees as a purely market
approach is dangerous. 'It may be easy to leave nuclear energy aside in
short-term policy but in doing so we endanger our planet's atmosphere,
notably because of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect,' says Mr Remy
Carle, deputy general manager of Electricite de France and chairman of the
World Association of Nuclear Operators. Nuclear power stations emit
virtually no carbon dioxide or sulphur.
The industry says the short-term approach also jeopardises the energy
balance of the next century. 'Today's energy resources will have to meet a
massive increase in demand; a two-fold increase at some stage next century,'
says Mr Carle. 'This is not possible without a significant contribution from
nuclear energy.'
Such arguments have most potency in south-east Asia either in countries
where access to alternative sources of power are restricted, as in the case
of Japan, or where the demand for electricity is likely to be high as
economies burgeon, as in the case of China, South Korea and Taiwan. All of
these countries are either building or hope to build nuclear power plants,
and last year Asia had 14 reactors under construction, according to the
IAEA.
Activity is also intense in eastern Europe, where last year there were six
reactors under construction in the Ukraine, four in the Slovak Republic,
four in Russia and five in Romania. In Latin America there were five
reactors under construction last year, including one in Argentina and one in
Brazil. India is building five reactors and Pakistan one.
The dearth areas for nuclear power construction include: the US, where no
power station has been ordered since 1979 and plentiful supplies of gas mean
none are likely in the near future; Australia, where no nuclear stations
have been built and none are likely; Africa, where there are only two
reactors on the whole continent, both in South Africa, and no more are
planned; and western Europe where, with the UK's Sizewell B complete, only
France is building stations and even it is close to the end of its
programme, with four under construction.
All of this could change, in the medium term future at least, if prices of
fossil fuels rise and environmental pressures increase the need to cut
carbon and sulphur emissions.
But to stand a real chance of taking off again, the nuclear industry must
make significant progress in three main areas: designing reactors which
produce cheaper electricity, dealing with waste, and renovating dilapidated
reactors.
Research into producing cheaper nuclear power will inevitably be held back
while there are only limited prospects that the vast sums of money needed to
fund it will be repaid through new orders. While there are still hopes of
developing fast breeder reactors - once thought of as the salvation of the
industry - there seems little likelihood that fast breeders will enter
commercial operation before 2020.
Nevertheless, practically all countries with nuclear power programmes are
developing versions of existing plants which are aimed at cutting costs and
improving safety.
Nuclear waste represents a thorny problem because the industry is often so
dependent on governments for resolutions. This has been highlighted this
year in the US where a coalition of state utilities and regulators have
filed a suit accusing the Department of Energy of defaulting on its promise
to take spent fuel. The search for a permanent nuclear waste dump has
dragged on for years with little discernible progress and the utilities say
the government is backing away from its requirement to take waste by 1998.
But the most pressing problem for the world nuclear industry is to help
renovate the creaking reactors of eastern Europe. Considerable progress is
being made with the help of aid and technological know-how but efforts are
hampered by lack of resources. With most east European utilities still in
the state sector and charging prices well below costs, there is little
incentive for investors to provide funds.
Western scientists believe the most obvious root causes of the Chernobyl
accident have been remedied in plants throughout eastern Europe.
Nonetheless, they would prefer to see some operating reactors, including two
at Chernobyl itself, closed down. Another significant accident may be
unlikely but, if one did occur, a resurgence of the industry would be
delayed for decades and possibly for ever.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (1): In search of a new consensus - United
Germany may be in for a spell of indecisive government. But that could
culminate in a new political consensus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The last votes were barely counted in last month's narrow-squeak federal
elections before the lobbying hordes - including Bundesbankers,
industrialists and economists - lined up to swamp the returning government
with advice on the contents of its agenda for the German Bundestag's 13th
legislative period.
Even though the conservative/liberal coalition was coming back to power in a
considerably weakened state, and promptly subjected to speculative attacks
that it would not hold together through the four-year term, the lobbyists'
demands remained as rigorous as ever.
Mr Klaus Murmann, president of the BDA employers' association called for
nothing less than the restructuring of the DM1,000bn annual social welfare
budget which was threatening to 'crush us all'.
The list presented by Mr Heinrich von Pierer, Siemens chairman, started with
a call for budget consolidation, and closed with demands for political
support for business plus coherent energy and telecommunications policies.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, said the government should not rely
on the cyclical recovery in the economy to make good the nation's structural
deficits.
Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler-Benz, urged Chancellor Helmut Kohl to
pluck up the courage to tell the population that he faced a 'pile of
unpopular tasks,' including the need to cut spending.
Although the choice of items largely reflected the petitioners' peculiar
political or business interests, they were also pointed reminders of crucial
issues, still unresolved, from the previous government's agenda.
An immediate outcry against Mr Murmann, especially from his natural allies
in the ranks of Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats and the Bavarian Christian
Social Union, served as a warning that governing with a majority of 10
instead of 134 required rather more subtlety than Mr Murmann seemed to
appreciate.
Despite Mr Kohl's claims of having a 'perfectly good working majority,' his
hand has been significantly weakened by the shrinking of the coalition's
Bundestag majority, the enfeeblement of the Free Democratic Party (FDP), the
CDU's and CSU's liberal partners, and the consolidated supremacy of the
Social Democrats in the Bundesrat or upper house.
The view across the wider political landscape has also been distorted by the
gains of the Party of Democratic Socialism, successor to the East German
communists, which took nearly 18 per cent of the vote in its home region
despite being dubbed 'fascists painted red' by Mr Kohl.
Against this background, observers believe the government must expect
conflicts with the FDP which has effectively lost its roots in regional
parliaments and has fewer seats than the Greens in the new Bundestag.
Analysts say it must either raise its own liberal profile - at the risk of
friction with its conservative partners - or lose its identity.
They also point to the danger of conflicts within the CDU from prominent
members jockeying for the leadership as Mr Kohl approaches the expected end
of his parliamentary career at the next elections.
Such considerations, they say, may lead to the paralysis of domestic
policy-making. Rather than struggling with a strong opposition and a tiny
majority to implement contentious legislation on welfare spending cuts, for
example, the chancellor may prefer to turn his attention to his 'historic'
responsibilities in the foreign field, including the further development of
the European Union. Mr Kohl intends to play a leading role in the EU
intergovernmental conference in 1996, with the aim of giving new gravitas to
his honorary if rather faded post-unification title of 'Unity Chancellor'.
The possibility of governmental neglect of domestic economic and fiscal
affairs is further aggravated by mounting public confidence that after the
short-sharp shock of recession, everything is coming quickly right again.
Trade unions are already agitating for 'real' wage increases this year
although the Bundesbank has warned that years of restraint are necessary if
Germany's pay-to-productivity ratios are to be restored to internationally
competitive levels.
Certainly, Germany is emerging with unexpected speed from the steepest slump
since the war. Unemployment started falling far faster than is typical at
the end of a cyclical recession.
Company profits are booming in many sectors. Business confidence is high -
misleadingly high, according to the influential DIHT federal chamber of
trade and industry.
A recent check on the mood among 25,000 of its members, in the form of its
annual autumn confidence poll, concluded that while the recovery certainly
reflected the inherent strengths of the economy, it was now tending to
conceal the severity of the structural weaknesses exposed during the slump.
For example, although unemployment is down from its peak early in the year,
a third of those without work have been jobless for more than 12 months and
half have no vocational qualifications. Even the most stoutly conservative
forecasters predict little substantive change in the labour market for at
least 18 months. Only 9 per cent of the DIHT survey sample planned to take
on staff, while 28 per cent said they were still cutting their payroll.
Companies also stress there are no grounds for euphoria over profits. In the
engineering industry, for example, net return on sales this year is expected
to be only 0.8 per cent compared with a negative rate of minus 0.7 per cent
in 1993 and a 'normal' level for the industry of 2.5 per cent, according to
recent surveys by the Ifo economics institute in Munich.
But industry's main concern is that its efforts at restructuring in the past
two years may be rendered fruitless if federal government and regional and
local authorities fail to consolidate budgets and reduce the burden of
taxation and welfare contributions on businesses and consumers.
Business leaders argue that unless the whole economy is subjected to a
rigorous slimming cure - and the government accounts for half of GDP - they
will be obliged to go through the entire restructuring process again when
the next cyclical slump occurs.
At the heart of government's problems, and the single most important source
of concern to the Bundesbank, is the burden placed on the future by
mountainous public debts. The total is expected next year to exceed
DM2,000bn for the first time. At an estimated DM2,150bn it will be more than
twice as high as the national debt in 1990, the fateful year of unification.
Despite misgivings, the government has made progress, and this year launched
a consolidation programme intended to cut some DM90bn from the federal
budget by the end of 1996.
One result was that federal debt was not increased this year and the total
public sector deficit fell slightly from 1993's record DM182bn. A more
substantial decline, to less than DM130bn, is already programmed for next
year.
Bonn has also made an effective start on reducing and simplifying corporate
taxation, but the levy on retained profits is more than double that in the
UK.
It has chipped at statutory payroll costs by reducing the charge for
pensions insurance. But a new levy to cover the costs of care for the
elderly, coming in next January, will cancel this out. More than 20 per cent
of German wage costs are accounted for by statutory insurance and other
'social state' benefit charges which are three times as high as in Britain.
As management has shown in industry there is no shortage of scope for
economies and new ideas.
Most strikingly, it has demonstrated in the past two years, in which radical
and painful changes have been introduced without any trace of industrial
unrest, that in Germany it is still possible to build consensus and
compromise in the most unpromising circumstances. Which gives grounds for
optimism that it may be much to soon to be worrying about the onset of
political paralysis.

UN targets organised crime
Ministers and senior officials from the world's justice and interior
ministries attend the first United Nations World Ministerial Conference on
Organised Transnational Crime in Naples (to Nov 23). They will attempt to
forge a more coherent global strategy to combat the increasing threat.
UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros Ghali, Italian prime minister Silvio
Berlusconi and president Oscar Luigi Scalfaro will be present. See People.
Opec meeting: Saudi Arabia is to ask the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to extend the current production ceiling of 24.52m barrels of oil
a day for the whole of 1995 to underpin soft oil prices.
Ministers from the 12 Opec members are in Bali, Indonesia, to discuss
production levels (until Nov 23). Other Opec ministers want a roll-over, but
some may favour three or six months. Iran says it will consider all options.
European Union transport ministers begin a two-day meeting, and are expected
to agree on a series of measures to tighten up safety at sea. They will also
be looking at the list of big trans-European infrastructure projects in
road, rail and air transport which are on the agenda of EU leaders at next
month's Essen summit.
Reform of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund is the subject
of a conference in Washington which will bring together parliamentarians
from 18 nations.
Speakers will include Larry Summers, Treasury undersecretary, and Stanley
Fischer, first deputy managing director at the IMF. Massachusetts
congressman Barney Frank, who called the conference, hopes influential
parliamentarians will agree to push for an end to secrecy in the
multilateral banks and for linkages between bank loans and environment and
labour practices.
Railtrack sell-off:
Brian Mawhinney, Britain's secretary of state for transport, is scheduled to
announce the multi-billion- pound sell-off of Railtrack, the body that owns
the UK's railway track and stations. New legislation is not required to
privatise Railtrack because the powers are already enshrined in law. But
Labour will launch a fierce attack on the plan, particularly because a
minister promised during the passage of the Railways Bill - which privatised
train services - that Railtrack would stay in the public sector 'for the
foreseeable future'.
FT Surveys: Germany and World Nuclear Industry.
Kuchma meets Clinton
Ukrainian president, Leonid Kuchma, begins a state visit in the US. He meets
President Bill Clinton, other senior US officials, and Michel Camdessus, IMF
director. With new economic reforms on course and the nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty ratified last week, Mr Kuchma expects a warm
welcome from Mr Clinton. He will ask for continued US support to soften the
blow of economic reform, ease nuclear disarmament and promote foreign
investment.
Mr Kuchma will present a new plan to shut down the Chernobyl nuclear power
station. Ukraine will seek western financing of Dollars 6.49bn (Pounds
3.95bn) to fund projects including the decommissioning of Chernobyl and the
building of two western-type units on its site. In turn, Ukraine would cover
up to Dollars 6bn in other costs associated with shutting down Chernobyl.
Finland's president Martti Ahtisaari starts an official visit to Germany (to
Nov 25).
Greek cotton scandal:
European Commission officials hold talks in Athens with Greece's agriculture
ministry on cleaning up cotton farming. Greece is being asked to repay up to
Ecu120m (Dollars 100m) and accept regular EU checks on its cotton gins in
order to prevent a repetition of what local newspapers call the Great Cotton
Scandal of 1991-92. Cotton production figures were allegedly inflated by
about 10 per cent that year so that growers could claim extra subsidies.
Boxing boycott: The Mexico City-based World Boxing Council begins a boycott
of all world title fights in California for four months. The move is in
protest at a recent state initiative that would bar public aid to illegal
immigrants. Mexicans are expected to be hit most by Proposition 187, which
will affect health, education and other social services.
Meanwhile, enforcement of the measure has been temporarily blocked by a
judge in Los Angeles on the ground that it may be unconstitutional.
The Institute of Directors holds its annual dinner at Grosvenor House,
London.
Holidays: Lebanon (Independence Day).
Countdown to WTO
The preparatory committee of the World Trade Organisation meets in Geneva to
take stock two weeks ahead of the implementation conference that is due to
set a January 1 starting date for the WTO and the Uruguay Round global trade
accords. However, nothing will be decided until after next week's crucial
votes in the US Congress on Uruguay Round ratification (Nov 29 and Dec 2).
South Korea and China are due to sign a memorandum of understanding in
Beijing on the possible construction of two South Korean-model light-water
nuclear reactors in China. The two countries also plan to sign a protocol on
co-operation in nuclear safety matters. If the project goes ahead, it will
be the first time South Korea has built nuclear reactors for China, North
Korea's last remaining ally.
German economy: Revised official tax estimates will be published which
German finance minister Theo Waigel hopes will show that he will need up to
DM10bn (Dollars 6.7bn) less than the DM69bn he expected to borrow to round
off this year's budget.
European Union fisheries ministers will try to agree terms for the full
integration of Spain and Portugal into the Common Fisheries Policy. Madrid
and Lisbon made full CFP rights by next year a condition of their approval
of fish-rich Norway joining, along with Austria, Finland and Sweden.
US economy: Durable goods figures for October should show a modest rise.
Although volatile transport orders have caused this indicator to fluctuate
in past months, analysts say a recent survey of purchasing managers
indicates a rise of about 0.5 per cent.
Animal health: The UK parliament's agriculture select committee of MPs
publishes the findings of its inquiry into the effectiveness of health
controls introduced for the traffic of live animals in the European single
market. The report will also consider the UK's anti-rabies quarantine
arrangements for domestic pets.
National Tree Week:
Britain commences a nation-wide festival of trees organised by the Tree
Council (to Dec 4). It aims to highlight the importance of trees in the
environment and to promote tree-planting and good management.
FT Surveys: Mexico.
Holidays: Japan (Labour Thanksgiving Day).
Channel tunnel rail link
Draft legislation for a Pounds 2.7bn (Dollars 4.4bn) rail link between the
Channel tunnel and London is due before the UK parliament. The link should
cut 30 minutes from the three-hour journey between London and Paris. Work is
due to start in early 1997 and end in 2002. The designated route passes
under the river Thames near Gravesend to enter London from the east via
Stratford.
Turkey's foreign minister Mumtaz Soysal travels to Bonn for meetings with
his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel. Germany occupies the rotating
presidency of the European Union and Turkey's fraught negotiations over
customs union with the EU, due to come into force on January 1, 1996, are
likely to feature high on the agenda.
French economy: The recovery should be confirmed in gross domestic product
figures for the third quarter. Economists expect a rise of about 0.8 per
cent, reflecting improved industrial production and consumption and strong
performance by exporters.
Saleroom: A blue teddy bear called Emil, bought two years ago in a German
flea market for the equivalent of Pounds 1.50, is expected to set a record
price for a teddy at an auction of toys and dolls by Sotheby's in London.
The record is Pounds 55,000.
FT Surveys: Italian Banking and Finance.
Holidays: US (Thanksgiving Day).
Last data before Budget
The Confederation of British Industry's monthly survey of UK manfacturing
trends will be about the last piece of UK economic news before Kenneth
Clarke's second Budget on November 29. Although recent CBI surveys have been
bullish in tone, analysts would not be surprised to see signs of some
slowdown in future growth of manufacturing output.
Ro-Ro ferry design: Britain's Royal Institution of Naval Architects sponsors
a one-day symposium in London on recent research into the survivability of
roll-on roll-off ferries, following the Estonia ferry disaster in September
which killed more than 900. The institution believes the open car deck
system of Ro-Ro ships cannot be justified. It has called for changes to
ferry design to allow passengers and crew more time to disembark in the
event of a sinking.
Betty Maxwell, widow of disgraced British tycoon Robert Maxwell, publishes
her book about their marriage, A Mind of My Own.
In September, two Labour MPs failed to persuade Sir Nicholas Lyell, the
attorney-general, to block publication of the book on the grounds that it
could prejudice the forthcoming trials of Robert Maxwell's sons, Ian and
Kevin.
Cricket: The first of five Test matches between Australia and England begins
in Brisbane. England hope to bring back the Ashes when the tour ends in
February.
Uruguay elects a president
On Sunday, Uruguayans indulge in a frenzy of voting, electing a president as
well as both chambers of congress and 19 governors. Of the 21 presidential
candidates there are four front runners: two from the governing Blanco
party, one from the opposition Colorados and another from the Encuentro
Progresista, a broad left-wing coalition. The elections will determine
whether Uruguay pushes ahead with the free-market reforms initiated by
current Blanco president, Luis Alberto Lacalle.
Rugby: Wales play South Africa in Cardiff on Saturday.
Argentina's two main opposition parties, the Radicals and the Frente Grande
coalition, on Sunday nominate who will challenge Carlos Menem in next May's
presidential elections. One of the two Radical pre-candidates is considering
an electoral pact with the Frente Grande, a tactic that might force May's
elections to a second round.
Voting starts in Norway on Sunday in a national referendum on European Union
membership. Norway is the last of the four countries due to join the EU next
year to hold a referendum on its accession treaty. Getting a Yes from
Norway's sceptical voters, who narrowly rejected membership in 1972, is
considered the hardest challenge. Compiled by Patrick Stiles and Ian

Monday: If the City consensus is any guide, Britain's trade deficit with
non-European Union countries in October should be barely changed from
September's Pounds 349m shortfall. However, the Pounds 350m average forecast
reflects estimated deficits ranging from Pounds 200m to Pounds 500m, leaving
room for surprises.
In Italy, provisional November figures are expected to show subdued consumer
price inflation of 3.7 per cent, increasing prospects that the annual rate
will fall below 3.5 per cent early in 1995.
Thursday: The Bundesbank council is expected to leave credit policy
unchanged when it meets in Frankfurt.
During the week: German money supply growth, as measured by annualised and
seasonally adjusted M3 based on last year's fourth quarter, is expected to
slow in October to 7.3 per cent from September's 7.8 per cent.
German federal states will be reporting November cost of living indices.
Preliminary returns for western Germany are expected to show a slight
weakening of the year-on-year inflation rate to 2.7 per cent this month from
2.8 per cent in October.

Even though last week's rise in the discount rate was sharper than expected,
the bond market is by no means sure the Fed has finished yet.
The economy remains rather too strong for comfort, particularly in terms of
consumer spending and retail sales.
In spite of the aggressive nature of its move, the Fed pointedly made no
comment on plans, and long bond yields actually rose slightly.
The next FOMC meeting is not until December 20, so no further action is
expected at least until then.
In the meantime, however, the market has found something else to worry
about: the risk that the Republicans, rampant after their election victory,
will cut taxes ahead of their ability to control spending.
However, this should be a quiet week, with the Thanksgiving holiday on
Thursday.
Tuesday brings the Federal budget figure for October, expected to show a
deficit in the Dollars 33bn-Dollars 35bn range.
On Wednesday come durable goods orders, where continued growth in civilian
spending should be mostly offset by continued cutbacks in defence, resulting
in growth of about 1 per cent or a little above.
October figures for sales of existing homes, due on Friday, will be looked
at for evidence that rising mortgage rates are finally taking effect.

FT  21 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: Confidence returns to the gilts sector -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government bond, or gilt, market is in a confident mood. It swept
aside last week's figures showing accelerating UK economic growth and
rallied in the face of Tuesday's three-quarter point rise in US short-term
interest rates.
It may soon face more serious tests of its new-found confidence, however - a
turn upwards in UK inflation and the next rise in UK base rates.
It is no secret that this has been a difficult year for gilts. Fears that
economic recovery in the US and Europe would be inflationary and lead to
sharply higher interest rates around the world have sent bond prices
tumbling, and gilts have suffered particularly badly.
This was partly because the UK's economic recovery was further advanced than
that of its fellow European countries and partly because of the UK
authorities' poor track record in controlling inflation. The large size of
the UK government budget deficit, and the enormous amount of new gilt
issuance this implied, also weighed heavily on investors' minds.
The price of 10-year gilts fell by more than 19 per cent from their highs in
January and yields climbed by almost 3 percentage points to a peak of around
9 per cent in September.
Since then, however, there have been encouraging signs of a recovery in
gilts, at least in relation to other countries' bond markets.
Yields have dropped back only slightly, to around 8.6 per cent. But the
yield spread between US and UK 10-year government bonds, having widened to
more than 150 basis points in the summer, has now narrowed to about 60 basis
points.
The reason for this is continued good news on inflation. In spite of
economic growth of over 4 per cent, inflation - at 2 per cent - remains at a
27-year low.
The financial markets, suspicious all year of the government's willingness
and ability to keep a tight reign on price rises, are starting to believe,
albeit grudgingly, that maybe it can and will. The fall in yields is
reflecting this.
'Gilts have rallied in recent months as expectations about inflation have
slowly improved,' said Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at investment bank
DKB International. 'Investors are now becoming more willing to commit money
to the gilts market.'
Mr Lyons believes there is now an asymmetrical relationship developing
between the US and UK government bond markets.
'It will be difficult for gilts to put on further gains in isolation from
other markets, particularly the US,' he said.
'If Treasuries rally then gilts will be pulled up with them, but if
Treasuries fall then gilts will be supported by the UK's favourable domestic
conditions.'
Those domestic conditions - the strength of the UK recovery, inflation and
interest rates - remain the key to how the gilt market performs over
remaining weeks of 1994 and into next year.
'The question that has to be answered is whether this recovery is any
different from previous ones, in which renewed growth has triggered
inflation, higher interest rates and balance of payments problems,' said Mr
Lyons.
Although inflation remains subdued, there are signs that inflationary
pressures are building up in the economy.
Mr David Miles, senior UK economist at the US investment bank Merrill Lynch,
calculates that spare capacity in the economy is dwindling rapidly.
'If the economy continues to expand at its current rate, it will start to
overheat and be heading towards inflationary territory by the end of next
year,' he said.
He points to the rise in producer input prices as a sign of future
inflation.
Rising commodity prices have pushed up costs to many manufacturers, yet
producers have not passed these rises on into output prices, thus squeezing
their profits.
'Companies may try to to recoup that squeeze in profits by raising prices
over the coming year,' said Mr Miles.
Wage settlements, currently rising at about 3 3/4 per cent a year, may also
start to accelerate as unemployment continues to fall, putting further
upward pressure on costs and prices.
All this points to a rise in UK interest rates. The consensus among City
analysts seems to be that it will come early next year. However, when it
does it may not be bad for gilts - certainly the last rate rise, in
September, was generally enthusiastically received as a well-timed move to
head off future inflation.
In the meantime, the gilt market has something else to occupy its attention
 -next week's Budget on November 29.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is expected to reaffirm
the improving state of the nation's finances and cut his forecast for next
year's public sector borrowing requirement. This would be yet another lift
to the gilt market's confidence.

Traditional pre-Budget speculation is likely to shape sentiment on the gilts
market, which was strengthened last week by positive UK economic data.
Nevertheless, gilts continue to be buffeted by international trends,
particularly following last week's US interest rate rise.
With next week's Budget likely to reduce substantially the public sector
borrowing requirement, gilts are expected to perform well over the coming
weeks. A survey last week indicated that City economists now expect the PSBR
to fall to Pounds 32bn this financial year, and Pounds 23bn next year.
Speculation is mounting that the Budget might introduce an open repo market
which would make the market more liquid and take the kink out of the yield
curve that has made longer dates yields lower than those at the medium term.
In the meantime, last week's economic data, which suggested that UK
inflationary pressures remained subdued, is expected to strengthen the
market.
Mr Nigel Richardson, of Yamaichi International said: 'We go into the budget
with a relatively favourable tone to the market - the background to gilts is
good on an international basis.'
As Merrill Lynch points out, the spread between UK-US yields has narrowed
recently, and its economists predict that it could narrow further.

FT  21 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weakness in the Tokyo stock market is expected to underpin the bond market
this week. Profit-taking by overseas fund managers before the year-end
settlements is depressing share prices while stock buying has so far been
limited to public funds.
With an increasing number of analysts expecting the Nikkei 225 index to
breach the psychologically important support level of 19,000, long-term
interest rates are expected to see underlying support.
The bond market may see a brief rally as a result of increased trading from
the new securities house subsidiaries of the commercial banks which start
operating on Thursday.
Meanwhile, there has been an increase in straight bond issues with longer
maturities and an easier yield curve at the longer end is prompting
companies to turn to debt with maturities of over five years.
Until recently they preferred to issue bonds with maturities of less than
five years because long-term yields were expected to decline and to attract
retail investors.
Although companies may revert to short-term debt to attract retail investors
ahead of the winter bonus season, a rise in demand for long-term bonds with
higher coupons among institutional investors is likely to support the case
for a continued increase in long-term debt.

After watching to see how far US short-term rates would rise last week, the
German bond market will have its attention more sharply focused on domestic
matters in the next few days.
The rates of money supply growth in October and inflation in November are
expected to show a slight improvement when announced this week.
M3 should ease to an annualised growth rate of just above 7 per cent, with
yearly west German inflation likely to slip to 2.7 per cent.
However, this does not mean Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting is likely
to decide on a small cut in key interest rates before raising them again in
1995.
The Bundesbank, as Mr Hans Tietmeyer, its president, said on Friday, wants
more progress by the government towards solving its fiscal problems and more
moderate wage rises to squash inflation.
The 75 basis point rise in the US federal funds target did not help the case
of those looking for one last German rate cut.
Nor has the criticism by the government's council of economic advisers (five
wise men) of the Bundesbank's pragmatic monetary policy.
Its latest report said there was no scope for more interest rate cuts in
1995; slight increases would probably be necessary.

FT  21 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: Eyes now turning to Latin America -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Latin American debt has been among the worst casualties in this year's bond
market melt-down. However, most observers say the sell-off has been overdone
and recommend buying around current levels.
'We believe these markets are now very cheap,' says Ms Ingrid Iversen,
senior economist at Morgan Grenfell. 'The fall has been overdone by whatever
measures you apply,' she says. A recent study by Morgan Grenfell states that
'current Brady bond prices discount default risk at a rate which verges on
the paranoid'.
Latin bonds have been battered by rising US interest rates, heavy selling
early in the year by leveraged accounts and a variety of domestic problems.
As a result, the average stripped yield spread of the four largest Latin
markets over US Treasuries has more than doubled to some 950 basis points,
from 450 basis points at the beginning of the year.
In Brazil, uncertainty ahead of the October elections overhung the market
most of the year. However, bonds derived support from the implementation in
July of the Real Plan and the election of Fernando Henrique Cardoso,
enabling them to outperform all neighbouring markets. According to JP
Morgan, Brazilian Brady bonds have posted a total return of some 6.5 per
cent in the year to date.
Mexico, too, was dogged by political worries ahead of the August election,
exacerbated by the assassination of President-elect Donaldo Luis Colosio in
March. Mexico was the region's second-best performer, although total returns
there are down 11.5 per cent in the year to date.
Argentina suffered from concern over its fiscal position and jitters ahead
of elections in May. Although President Carlos Saul Menem is expected to be
re-elected, 'people have been rattled by politics this year and are shy of
countries with political uncertainty', says Mr Patrick Beeley, who runs the
emerging markets bond sales desk at JP Morgan in London. Argentine bonds are
down 21.61 per cent so far this year.
Venezuela, meanwhile, has been the worst hit, posting a negative return of
32 per cent amid growing investor scepticism of the populist Caldera
government.
After getting badly burnt in the initial February sell-off, many investors
moved into cash or money market instruments. But although US mutual funds
withdrew billions of dollars from bond markets, few accounts have pulled out
for good, and observers say there are large pools of cash waiting to get
back into bonds.
Moreover, new Latin American investors, such as Argentine and Brazilian
pension funds, are expected to move in next year, says Ms Susan Segal, head
of emerging and capital markets at Chemical Bank in New York.
And even among US investors, many of whom have sought safety in equities
this year, 'we are beginning to see more professional money reweighting back
to the bond side', she says.
'We think people will get off the fence soon, and expect to see a
significant pick-up in activity in December,' agrees Mr Jonathan Prior, head
of emerging market debt trading at ING Bank.
Brazil remains a favourite, especially after last week's state governor
elections which gave President Cardoso the support he needs to implement his
reforms.
Some analysts are also bullish on Mexico in the hope that its credit rating
will be raised to investment grade in 1995. Argentina is seen supported by
solid long-term fundamentals. And Venezuela - given that most people believe
it will continue to service its debt - 'is a screaming buy', says Ms Segal.
In spite of their supportive fundamentals, Latin bonds remain inextricably
linked to US Treasuries, whose erratic trading pattern they track slavishly.
But 'while the opposing forces of weak US Treasuries and strong regional
fundamentals will persist, I feel the latter will prevail sooner rather than
later,' predicts Mr Beeley.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Soft landing back in vogue after rate rise -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Soft landing and hard landing were two of the most common phrases during the
late 1980s as fund managers pondered the impact on the economy of the series
of interest rate rises implemented to cool an overheating UK economy.
In the event there was no soft or hard landing, more a crash landing. Now
the phrase soft landing is making a comeback as the market tries to assess
the likely impact of last week's move by the US Federal Reserve to raise US
interest rates by 75 basis points, the sixth time the Fed has lifted its
rates since February.
US and European markets gave a muted response to the Fed's action but in
London both gilt-edged stocks and equities built on a strong start to the
week and fairly galloped ahead. As they did so another buzz word, which pops
up regularly made a re-appearance. The magic word is decoupling and it was
one of positive arguments still being put forward about the UK equity
market.
The UK is said to be lagging the US in terms of the interest rate cycle and
the next moves in UK rates are perceived as upwards as the Chancellor of the
Exchequer and the governor of the Bank of England demonstrate their
determination to keep an iron grip on inflation.
But there is no talk of a hard landing here. Most of last week's news
confirmed manageable trends in the economy; underlying inflation still at
its lowest level for about 27 years, wage costs under control and no
evidence of an upturn in consumer spending. The economy's ability to shock
came with news that UK gross domestic product expanded rapidly during the
third quarter.
Nevertheless, the UK equity market is still transmitting some bullish
signals. Turnover, stuck in the doldrums over the past couple of months, has
suddenly quickened, helped by a handful of one-off deals such as the Boots
buy-back, and the Guinness stake sale.
According to Derivative Securities' Technical Review, the reaction of the US
bond market to the Fed's action on interest rates 'has shown some
independence of spirit. This has to be good for UK equities'.
In Behind the Balance Sheet, the latest strategy document on funds flow and
debt risk from Credit Lyonnais Laing, the securities house describes UK plc
as 'in fine fettle' and highlights record cash inflows, gearing at long-term
lows and interest cover at a high level.
The broker forecasts trading cash inflows of Dollars 5.5bn and asks the
question 'what will UK plc do with the money?' CLL says some will go on
share buy-backs, special dividends and still higher levels of capital
expenditure and adds: 'The prospect of an acquisition boom remains an
obvious use.'

The removal of one uncertainty on Friday afternoon, when local banks lifted
interest rates by 0.75 per cent, will do little to cheer or inspire
investors this week, writes Louise Lucas.
The banks had been widely expected to raise rates following the US Fed's
move last Tuesday and concern over follow-through in Hong Kong drove the
colony's share prices lower in the latter part of last week.
The hesitant mood is likely to continue into this week on fears of a further
interest rate rise. US trade data tomorrow will be keenly scrutinised in
Hong Kong, as any inflationary signals will once again be sufficient to
spook bond and stock markets. In the absence of corporate news, local issues
this week are likely to be dominated by rumour.

The Bundesbank Council meets on Thursday but, says James Capel, what little
news that has come out since the last meeting is unlikely to prompt any move
in rates.
The German chemicals companies, reporting this week and next, will conclude
the European interim results season. Figures come from BASF on Thursday,
followed by Bayer on November 28 and Hoechst on November 30. Hoare Govett
says that after a strong set of figures from ICI, DSM, Akzo Nobel and
Rhone-Poulenc, it expects a sound improvement in pre-tax profit from the
Germans, although reported figures may be tempered by managements'
reluctance to reveal the extent of the recovery with wage negotiations
pending. The broker adds that BASF and Hoechst will show the strongest
improvement from last year's very depressed profits.
Commerzbank is expected to start the banks' 10-month reporting season on
Wednesday. Merrill Lynch expects operating profits to improve slightly over
the first half of the year, but warns that core income may be weakening. The
investment bank says the banks appear undervalued in the context of the
German market, but fair value in international terms. It also points out
that the banks tend to outperform a falling equity market but underperform a
rising one.
Deutsche Telekom, the state-owned group, is expected today to name the
banking consortium that will handle its privatisation, the largest in
Germany's post-war history, at the start of 1996.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Zurich - Other markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tomorrow brings the long awaited showdown between the directors of Union
Bank of Switzerland, the country's largest bank, and the maverick Zurich
broker-fund manager Martin Ebner, writes Ian Rodger.
A UBS extraordinary general meeting of shareholders starts at 2:30 pm in
Zurich to consider the board's scheme to strip the registered shares, which
have a par value one fifth of that on the bearers, of their extra voting
power. The stated aim is to undermine Mr Ebner's challenge of their
governance of the bank.
BK Vision, an Ebner controlled investment fund which holds 18 per cent of
the registered shares, has been trying to rally a majority of votes to force
substantial changes to the UBS board and business strategy at the next
annual meeting in April.
The board's proposal calls for exchanging all existing shares into a new
class of bearer shares with a par value of SFr10. The existing bearers would
be exchanged at the rate of 10 for one, the registered at the rate of two
for one.
Uncertainty about the outcome, reflected in highly volatile trading of both
classes of shares since the EGM was announced on September 29, is heightened
by the fact that a two-thirds majority of shares represented at the meeting
is needed to carry the motion.
Both UBS chief executive Mr Robert Studer and Mr Ebner say they are
confident of winning. Asked privately if they would admit it if they thought
they would lose, both replied with a straight face, 'yes'.
Wednesday brings 10-month sales figures from Nestle, whose shares have
picked up in recent sessions after a period in the doldrums. Currency
considerations remain paramount. The strength of the Swiss franc depressed
first-half figures by about 6 1/2 per cent, and analysts say that it is
likely to depress the 10-month outcome by about 8 per cent.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: US influence in Europe's new issue business
grows - International offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The German government is poised to announce which bank is to lead worldwide
sales of Deutsche Telekom shares when the company's DM10bn-plus capital
raising exercise goes ahead in 1996.
Deutsche Bank and Dresner Bank seem assured of a role in the sale, but if -
as is widely expected - a US bank is awarded the role of 'global
co-ordinator' it will confirm European fears that the Continent's banks are
losing out to US rivals in business stemming from the wave of new European
equity issues.
Goldman Sachs has this year been 'book-runner' in five separate European
deals and after selling eight tranches of shares worth a total of about
Dollars 2.5bn sits at the top of a league table of European issues, compiled
by IFR Securities. Deals include INA, the Italian insurer and - with UBS -
Tele Danmark, the Danish telecommunications group.
Other US banks are also prominent in the table. Lehman Brothers, for
example, was book-runner in the sale of Banca Commerciale Italiana, the
Italian bank.
Morgan Stanley - with CSFB and Warburg - shared a similar role in the sales
of KPN, the Dutch telecoms company, and (with CSFB, Warburg and Goldman) led
the sale of Endesa, the Spanish energy holding company. Merrill Lynch has
led sizeable equity issues for a number of Scandinavian companies, and is
global co-ordinator for the sale of Enel, the Italian energy company.
European banks continue to be strong in their domestic markets. The French
banks have won chunky deals in France (Paribas heading sales of Elf
Aquitaine and UAP, BNP leading on Renault).
On the Continent as a whole US influence seems to be growing. Goldman's
market share of European deals has doubled since 1993.
Bankers say that in some earlier privatisations UK banks have been asked to
advise the government and a US bank to lead the sales effort. But that, too,
could be changing. Morgan Stanley, for example, will advise the Italian
government on the sale of Stet, the telecommunications concern.
European bankers say governments have been too easily impressed by US
bankers' claims they can more easily access US investors, especially at the
retail level.
They also suggest that Europe has been the important source of demand for
sales of European equities, with London-based fund managers making many of
the important decisions.
Against that, US banks claim their success reflects recent investment in
training, research and sales.
'US banks are covering the sectors on a global basis. if you look at
investment the US banks have put in place in past five years it is is
multiples of what any European bank has done. That is not lost in the eyes
of a government,' says one US bank executive.
US bankers also argue that they are more familiar than their European
counterparts with book-building, a technique for distributing shares which
has long been common in the US but relatively new in Europe and being
eagerly embraced by governments embarked on privatisation.
One European banker says that US banks promise 'the earth' and then 'try to
manage expectations after they have won the mandate'.
Nevertheless, he says US success is principally a product of better research
and a more tightly focused approach.
'They also have a relentless focus on the transactions they want. They have
nailed down every individual in the decision-making process for a long
time,' he said.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Emerging Markets: Looking for a year-end finale - The
Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's emerging markets largely discounted last week's action by the US
Federal Reserve as thoughts remained focused on whether there will be a
final rally to end the year.
The markets have managed to recoup almost all of the losses triggered by the
Fed's first rate rise of 1994 back in February, with the IFC's composite
index having virtually returned to its January starting point.
However, the performance has not been even: Latin America has far
outstripped Asia, while Europe's emerging markets - which include Turkey and
Poland, two of the disappointments of 1994 - remain caught in a downward
trend.
While the prospect of a further tightening by the US Fed remains, and
forecasts vary between the end of the year or early in 1995, fund managers
and strategists take a more measured long-term view. Indeed, with so much
capital now tied up in emerging markets, especially from US pension funds, a
sudden change of strategy is highly improbable.
According to Mr Michael Howell of Baring Securities, in a speech delivered
in Tokyo during the summer, international money managers allocated more new
money throughout 1993 to the emerging stock markets than they did to North
America and Japan combined. While the flow of funds has slowed somewhat
during 1994, the annual inflow of new money is forecast to be between
Dollars 40bn and Dollars 50bn, against some Dollars 63bn the year before.
US monetary policy has been the main factor determining investment attitudes
towards emerging markets throughout this year. Consequently Mr John Legat,
senior emerging markets portfolio manager of GT Unit Managers in London, has
been pursuing a policy of diversifying away from the dollar bloc markets,
which includes most of south east Asia, and concentrating on markets in
India, Africa, eastern Europe, Turkey and Brazil.
However, each time the US Fed had lifted rates he has been buying back the
dollar bloc markets on expectations that long bond yields would start to
fall - good news for financial markets in general.
Mr Jean de Bolle, of Foreign and Colonial Emerging Markets, comments that he
does not believe the US long bond has yet peaked, something that is unlikely
to occur before the second quarter 1995, he thinks.
For this reason he is looking to invest in smaller emerging markets during
1995: countries such as Peru for instance. He is also keen on Turkey, in
spite of its lacklustre showing this year, and Brazil, which, he believes,
has great potential over the next 12 months.
Turkey has aptly demonstrated the volatility that can so often characterise
the short-term performance of emerging markets. Following a gain of some 200
per cent in dollar terms in 1993, the financial markets came under a wave of
selling as its foreign debt rating was downgraded in mid-January and the
Turkish lira collapsed against the dollar. Inflation then rose into triple
digit figures for the first time in 14 years, hitting an annual rate of 117
per cent in May.
The market made a partial recovery during the summer, as the government
introduced an austerity package, but by the end of last week it was still
down nearly 40 per cent in dollar terms on the year to date.
Looking ahead Mr Sushil Wadhwani, a Goldman Sachs strategist based in
London, believes Asian markets in general offer good potential over the long
term, and appear an even more attractive proposition than Latin America,
even if the US Fed acts more decisively next time round.
Mr Mark Mobius of Templeton Worldwide, which has some Dollars 7.2bn invested
in emerging markets funds, believes that prospects for the next six months
remain generally good. 'However, while a number of markets have moved up
substantially and have recovered from the decline in the early part of the
year, many are overpriced,' he says.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Emerging Markets: Investing in eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The surge of financial investment into the former communist bloc is
continuing with the decision by Invesco, the fund manager, to raise an extra
Dollars 75m for its East Europe Development Fund, writes Nicholas Denton.
The new injection will take the money raised by EEDF since its foundation in
1990 to Dollars 115m and will lift the resources of funds focused on the
region close to Dollars 1bn.
EEDF's net asset value will rise to about Dollars 170m, propelling it into
the top two of emerging market funds specialising in eastern Europe, nearly
matching CS First Boston's Central European Growth Fund.
The Baring group, which is issuing and placing the new shares, is marketing
EEDF as the best performing regional institutional investor. Micropol, the
fund measurement company, has named EEDF as the best performer in its group
over one and three years.
An early move into the booming Polish market helped EEDF's net asset value
double between September 1993 and March 1994 and the fund has held on to
most of the gains.
More recently launched funds like Baring Emerging Europe Trust and Central
European Growth Fund invested into markets that were coming off their peaks.
Their short-term performance has inevitably been mixed.
Specialised emerging markets funds have been more active than pension funds
in eastern Europe and especially the former Soviet Union. Stock markets in
the region are immature and the regional funds have been more willing to
make unquoted investments. But even venturesome investors like the regional
funds have been deterred by insecure custody and settlement in Russia.
Fund managers say it is the largest single deterrent to financial investment
in eastern Europe's largest market.

JAKARTA
The Indonesian stock market is forecast to rally in 1995, according to PT
Standard Chartered Indonesia, agencies report.
'The market will continue to strengthen and we expect total upside of 20 per
cent over the next 12 months, on the back of what we expect will be the
strongest earnings growth rate among the Asean markets,' the brokerage said.
Standard Chartered added that it was expecting strong 1994 corporate
earnings growth of about 24 per cent.
TANZANIA
Delegates from donor agencies, Tanzania's government and private business
met earlier this month to discuss regulations for forming a stock exchange
and capital markets.
Participants included officials from the World Bank and the International
Finance Corporation.
The country's parliament enacted a capital markets law early this year which
allowed for the formation of a stock exchange. Since then, the Bank of
Tanzania has been trying to find a framework for setting up a stock
exchange.
CASABLANCA
Morocco's stock market forecasts a record turnover of more than Dollars 1bn
by the end of the year, an official of the country's bourse said. This will
nearly double the 1993 turnover figure.
Foreign investment accounted for more than 70 per cent of bourse activity.
Morocco plans to privatise 112 companies by the end of 1995.
ISTANBUL
The Istanbul stock exchange withdrew from the manual board system, in use
since November 1987, to prepare for full automation of all 174 stocks today.
SEOUL
South Korea approved foreign investment worth Dollars 1.16bn in the first 10
months of the year, a 44.8 per cent rise on the same period of last year,
according to data from the finance ministry.
Japan topped the foreign investment list with Dollars 361m during the
period, followed by Dollars 356m from EU countries. Investment by the US,
however, fell 6.3 per cent to Dollars 282m.
New foreign investment was Dollars 588m, while the remaining Dollars 573m
comprised additional investment by existing foreign companies in South
Korea.
LIMA
Foreign investment on the Lima stock exchange rose by 47.7 per cent to
Dollars 1.67bn in October compared with Dollars 1.13bn in the previous
month.
Most of the investment came from the US, followed by the UK, Chile and
Luxembourg.
According to data from the stock exchange authorities, foreign investors
preferred to buy shares in Compania Peruana de Telefonos, Banco de Credito,
Backus y Johnston and Southern Peru Copper Corp and Buenaventura.
Equity prices on the bolsa rose by an average 8.7 per cent in the same
period.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Thanksgiving is unlikely to halt uncertainty
 -New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many investors this week will spend their Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday
grateful for a day not spent trying to come to terms with a volatile stock
market. However, uncertainty is expected to continue over what is generally
one of the slowest weeks of the year.
Last week saw hour-by-hour and day-by-day see-sawing as the market proved
unable to sustain a rally or succumb entirely to the bears, a trend that
could continue into next week. Over the past two-and-a-half months, the Dow
Jones Industrial Average has rarely broken out of the 3800 range.
Some economists believe the market may stage its traditional year-end rally,
as firms put bonuses and pension-fund contributions into the hands of
employees. But even those bullish for the short-term are generally
pessimistic about the next several months.
'We're in kind of a seasonally strong time of year, which could lead to a
short-term rally phase, but if that happens it will only postpone weakness
down the road,' says Mr Richard McCabe at Merrill Lynch.
Also contributing to last week's market gyrations was the Fed's decision to
increase the fed funds target rate by a larger-than-expected 75 basis points
to 5 1/2 per cent. The move left both the stock and bond markets unsettled
because the door is open to another rate increase later this year or early
in 1995.
Even figures showing inflation to be in check for the moment have done
nothing to calm fears of inflation down the road. At every turn both the
stock and bond markets have seen only the worst in generally positive
numbers. For example, presented last week with news of a decline in the
Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's index of business activity, the markets
drew pessimism from a sub-index that showed an increase in prices paid by
manufacturers.
While a strong economy is generally good for the equity market, stocks have
taken their cues from bonds recently as company profits suffer when interest
rates rise.
What does the Fed's move mean for this week's markets? 'We're one week
closer to the next tightening,' Mr Thomas McManus at Morgan Stanley,
responds dryly. He joins a host of Wall Street economists who are predicting
another interest rate increase in the short-term.
Mr McManus advises avoiding the stock market until there is a significant
decline. He believes some investors have neglected the fact that higher
interest rates may draw some investments away from stocks and into the fixed
income market.
Rising interest rates will hurt equities by deterring corporate borrowing
and put pressure on earnings.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Emerging Markets: Markets offered Thanksgiving breather -
Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchange markets face a fairly quiet week, with the US enjoying only
two full trading days owing to the Thanksgiving break.
This follows a week in which a deluge of data, combined with a monetary
tighting from the Fed, failed to generate any significant movement in the
dollar.
This week the main policy event will be the Bundesbank council meeting on
Thursday. For some time now the German central bank has been scrupulous in
its efforts not to give markets a hint on the likely future direction of
interest rates. That said, few observers are expecting an imminent rise in
rates. A maintenance of the status quo - the discount rate at 4.5 per cent,
and the repo rate at 4.85 per cent - seems the most likely outcome.
The background to the council meeting will be provided by M3 money supply,
and consumer price inflation figures. The lack of data will not stop the
market from pursuing its current pre-occupation; namely, whether the dollar
is now in a bull-phase, or merely seeing a retracement within an ongoing
bear phase.
The dollar's response to the 75 basis point rise in short term rates was
strangely subdued. The dollar finished in London on Friday around DM1.5550
and Y98.60, almost exactly the levels at which it stood half an hour after
the Fed announced higher rates.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, commented:
'The dollar has made useful headway in recent weeks. But the move has simply
broken the downtrend - it is premature to say that a new bull market is in
place.'
A survey conducted on November 17 by IDEA, the financial analysis group,
illustrates that the market remains very unsure about the outlook for the
dollar. Asked to forecast two months ahead, respondents predicted median
values for the dollar of DM1.57 and Y99. Forecasts ranged, however, from
DM1.44 to DM1.6425, and Y92.50 to Y105.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Markets: Options open up at IPE - Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As traders at London's International Petroleum Exchange await news from this
week's ministerial meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries in Bali they will have a more efficient tool available for
responding to market-moving developments.
Today sees the introduction of a market makers' scheme for the Brent crude
option contract, which, according to IPE chief executive Peter Wildblood,
'will increase accessibility' to the contract.
Initially, three market makers - Credit Lyonnais Rouse, Societe Generale
Options UK and City of London Options - have undertaken to staff the options
pit at all times and to provide a bid and ask price on a continuous basis
'within certain parameters laid down by the exchange' for a minimum number
of lots.
The IPE expects other members to join the scheme later.
'This initiative by the exchange is a necessary complement to our successful
futures contract, which is now recognised as the predominant international
benchmark for crude oil,' says Mr Wildblood.
Other events this week include the release today of October production
figures by the International Primary Aluminium Institute. This should give
an indication of whether last week's heavy drawdown from LME warehouse
stocks of the metal - which helped to drive London Metal Exchange prices to
four-year highs - can be expected to continue.
The stocks fall of nearly 50,000 tonnes announced on Friday took the total
for the week to about 64,000 tonnes. At 1.91m tonnes the exchange stock pile
is now down by about 28 per cent from the record level reached in June.
In Washington tonight the US Department of Agriculture will issue its latest
wheat situation and outlook summary.
In London tomorrow Futures and Options World magazine's Investing in
Commodities seminar will be held. Speakers will include representatives of
the World Bank, the London Commodity Exchange and the Securities and Futures
Authority.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Markets: The fight for the dollar - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
It is Thanksgiving Week in both the US and Japan, and currency markets will
have an opportunity, over the turkey and the sake, to review the latest
developments in the struggle for the dollar.
Last week, the ailing currency received assistance from two quarters.
The Federal Reserve's decision to raise short-term interest rates by 75
basis points on Tuesday was backed up by the release of trade figures on
Friday showing a slight fall in the US deficit with Japan. But after a brief
rally on both days, the doubts set in again, and with good reason.
The key to any dollar recovery remains the disequilibrium in the balance of
payments between the US and Japan.
That imbalance creates, in turn, a mismatch between world supply of, and
demand for, dollars.
The US currency's over-supply is caused principally by a growing funding
requirement in the US balance of payments and a lack of demand for the
dollars that are consequently being poured out into the world's financial
markets.
Without either a sharp fall in the supply of dollars or a sharp increase in
demand for them, there will be no respite.
It is worth examining the development of this supply/ demand disequilibrium
in some detail.
The US current account deficit declined at the end of the 1980s, as slower
growth cut imports.
In 1991 the deficit hit bottom - in fact it was almost eliminated - thanks
largely to once-only transfers received during and immediately after
Operation Desert Storm. But since then, the gap has widened again. Last year
it was back in 12 figures, and in the first half of 1994 was Dollars 69bn.
For the full year it is expected to reach Dollars 150bn - its highest since
1987.
The primary cause of the deterioration has been the unsynchronised nature of
the global recovery - the US economy, growing at an annual rate of more than
4 per cent for nearly two years, has sucked in imports, while US exporters
have struggled in weak overseas markets.
This decline in the trade and current accounts has meant dollars have been
flooding the currency markets.
But while in the past those outflows have been funded by long-term capital
inflows, the capital account has now added to the funding gap.
Even at the peak of the deficit in 1987, net inward direct investment and
portfolio investment accounted for almost two thirds of the current account
deficit. But last year, for the first time for more than a decade, both
portfolio investment and direct investment represented net outflows.
The combined effect of deficits on both the current and long-term capital
account left the US with an exter-nal funding requirement, met by inflows of
short-term, 'hot' money, of more than Dollars 150bn, a figure much higher
than at any time in the deficit years of the 1980s.
The counterpart to all those dollars is, of course, a scarcity of Japanese
yen. In Japan the picture is a mirror image of the US problems. The current
account surplus, though falling slightly this year in yen terms, is rising
still in US dollars as a result of the J-curve effect - the higher price of
exports initially outweighing the slight fall in demand for them. And in the
past three years the absence of Japanese investors from world markets has
meant the country has been running an additional surplus on its capital
account.
With no early sign of a significant slowdown in demand growth, US imports
will continue to grow until well into next year. And even though rising
demand abroad will help exports, the high level of capacity utilisation in
the US will make it difficult for exporters to respond to those
opportunities. So the trade deficit seems set to rise further.
More troubling in the longer term is that the rest of the current account is
being weakened by large outflows of investment income. The United States'
change in the 1980s to the status of debtor nation means that for the first
time since 1914 the volume of debts overseas will push the US into deficit
on this account - by about Dollars 5bn this year and more in the years
ahead.
In Japan the trade surplus is set to fall only gradually. Strong growth
overseas, particularly in Asian markets, is helping exports, and will
largely offset higher imports as the economy recovers. Overseas investment
adventures in the 1980s will produce a significant surplus on the investment
income line of the current account - as much as Dollars 60bn a year by the
end of the decade, according to some estimates.
Since the current account is unlikely, therefore, to show any sharp
improvement in the next year or two, the dollar's movement depends on the
capital account. That account is, of course, both the problem and the
solution to it. If foreigners, principally Japanese, can be persuaded to
invest in stocks and bonds in the US, there is a chance that the weight of
excess supply will be diminished. But can they?
Two things will make Japanese investors return to US assets - either a
further fall in the dollar to the point from which they believe it can only
rise, or a higher relative return on US assets. While yields on US bonds and
even equities have been rising as prices have fallen, the relative increase
has been much smaller, as Japanese yields have also risen. The return on the
US long bond has risen by a little under 3 per cent in a year, but in Japan,
the yield on the equivalent bond has gone up by nearly 2 per cent. The
differential yield on equities is similar, since in the past four months,
Japanese share prices have fallen faster than US ones.
But surely higher short-term rates in the US will entice Japanese investors.
In the past, according to Mr Ronald Leven of Morgan Guaranty in New York, a
short-term interest rate differential between the US and Japan of at least
300 basis points has been necessary to prompt a sustained upturn in the
dollar. Last week's move by the Fed put the spread at just above that level.
But the current steep US yield curve acts as a disincentive to Japanese
investors, who need a much flatter yield curve if they are to currency-hedge
any bond purchases
More important, Japanese institutional investors have become much more
risk-averse since their debacles overseas in the late 1980s. Many of them
continue to see the weight of dollar supply as too large a downside risk for
dollar assets. They prefer to wait for a further fall in the US currency
before they are prepared to end their investment strike.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Markets: Managing China's emergence - Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two world wars and the great depression of the first half of the century
were caused by the failure to cope with the arrival of the US, Germany and
Japan. The impact of a re-invigorated China could be as disruptive.
Three considerations are relevant to assessing that impact: the scale and
nature of China's prospective economic interaction with the rest of the
world; the extent to which that interaction might be manipulated by the
Chinese government for political ends; and, finally, the degree to which the
economy will give China the basis for enhanced military power.
By 1992, mainland China had become the most important single developing
country in world merchandise trade, its two-way trade being Dollars 165.6bn
(see chart), which was 2.3 per cent of total world trade. But China's total
trade was behind that of Belgium, let alone the US, Germany or Japan.
Meanwhile, China's share of world trade in commercial services was less than
1 per cent. The combined trade of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong was Dollars
383.4bn, which put the 'Chinese economic area' above Italy. But this
includes trade among the three entities. Furthermore, the Chinese government
does not control Hong Kong's trade, let alone Taiwan's.
Between 1980 and 1992 the volume of China's exports expanded at an average
annual rate of 11.9 per cent, while the volume of US exports expanded at 3.8
per cent. If those rates of growth were maintained, China would become the
world's largest single exporter by 2015. China's exports could conceivably
grow this rapidly. But things would have to go perfectly, which is highly
unlikely.
Meanwhile, despite high rates of national saving, China is unlikely to be a
large exporter of capital for decades. China is, however, a large importer
of capital. By 1993, it had attracted almost Dollars 60bn in over 70,000
enterprises.
How far could the government manipulate China's growing presence in the
world economy for political ends?
China's most successful exports have been light manufactures. By 1992, for
example, it had become the world's largest exporter of clothing, which
accounted for 20 per cent of its exports. Yet China has no monopoly power in
such markets. It is its import market that gives it leverage, as does the
inward foreign investment. The value of these chips was made clear by
China's victory in its conflict with the US over renewal of most-favoured
nation treatment. They would also be effective in any struggle over trade
and the environment, or trade and labour standards.
A country's ability to use access to its import market as a weapon depends
on how significant imports are to its economy. The US derives leverage from
the fact that it is the world's largest trader, but has a fairly low ratio
of trade to GDP. Measured at market prices, China's economy is about as open
as that of France and twice as open as that of the US. Measured at
purchasing power parity, however, it is the least open of the economies
shown in the chart.
How is this to be interpreted? The low productivity services that bulk large
in GNP at PPP depend little on trade. But, without trade, rapid growth would
also be unfeasible. China is not dependent on trade if it is content to stay
poor, but it does need trade for rapid growth.
What about China's military potential? The economic bases of military power
are manpower, industrial output, technology, and the ability to divert
resources from civilian uses. The first China has in abundance. But its
industrial output is about 10 per cent of that of the US. Even if it were to
sustain growth at 10 per cent a year, it would take a generation for China
to match the US. Even then, the country's technological level is almost
certain to lag behind those of the US (and Japan).
Such lags might be still more important in determining relative military
capacity then than they are today. Finally, reform has itself been eroding
the government's capacity to obtain resources.
What are the conclusions? First, it should take at least 20 to 30 years
before China becomes a genuine superpower. Even then the US is likely to
remain more militarily capable and economically influential.
Second, even to achieve this China must sustain its performance of the past
15 years. But, as Susan Shirk points out in her important new book, it would
be wrong to assume the transition from communism to the market economy will
continue to go quite smoothly.* Among other problems, the opportunities for
wealth and influence now afforded to officials are themselves an important
obstacle to further reforms.
Finally, China's emergence needs to be managed intelligently. The most
important requirement is for the industrial countries to engage the Chinese
within international arrangements for whose principles they themselves show
respect. In that way, norms of civilised international living should be
incorporated within China, as a result of changes in its own laws.
Thus, even if last week's summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation
forum does not lead to free trade by 2020, the forum can play a valuable
role in bringing China closer to its neighbours. China should also be
accepted as a member of the World Trade Organisation provided it adopts
rule-based and transparent trade policies.
Finally, China already seems a more obvious candidate for the group of seven
leading industrial countries than Russia.

FT  21 NOV 94 / International Company News: UK paper war hits Hollinger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Daily Telegraph's decision to join the UK newspaper price war last
spring has taken a toll on the third-quarter earnings of Hollinger, the
Canadian holding company controlled by Mr Conrad Black, the Telegraph's
proprietor.
Hollinger's net earnings dipped to CDollars 4.6m (Dollars 3.4bn), or five
cents a share, from CDollars 6.8m, or nine cents, in spite of a 47 per cent
jump in revenues.
The latest figures include a foreign currency loss of CDollars 2.6m, against
a CDollars 7.7m gain last year, due mainly to fluctuations in the value of
cash deposits held in sterling.
The increase in revenues, to CDollars 313.9m from CDollars 213.7m, mainly
reflects the acquisition of the Chicago Sun-Times earlier this year as Mr
Black's North American flagship paper. Hollinger has a 57 per cent stake in
the Telegraph, which earlier reported a fall in third-quarter earnings to
Pounds 2.6m (USDollars 4.26m) from Pounds 8.1m.
Third-quarter income before unusual items, taxes, minority interest and
foreign exchange adjustments, totalled CDollars 30.5m, up from CDollars
21.6m. Equity earnings, mainly from Australia's John Fairfax Holdings, which
is 25 per cent-owned by the Telegraph, rose Dollars 15.3m.

FT  21 NOV 94 / International Company News: Ricoh ahead despite slack
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ricoh's lead in digital copiers and its cost-cutting measures helped it to
raise non-consolidated profits strongly in the first half, in spite of
sluggish capital investment.
The Japanese manufacturer of office automation equipment posted a 63 per
cent rise in recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - to
Y10.1bn (Dollars 103m) from Y6.2bn a year earlier. The increase came on the
back of a 3 per cent rise in sales to Y305.3bn from Y295.2.
Ricoh suffered from slack private capital investment in Japan and the impact
of a high yen on exports. Nevertheless, it was able to increase sales in
most of its leading product lines. Sales of copiers, accounting for 68 per
cent of the company's sales, increased at home and overseas, climbing 8 per
cent in total.
Information equipment enjoyed a rise in demand both in domestic and export
markets, with sales increasing 5 per cent overall.
The company forecasts full-year sales to rise 3 per cent to Y616bn from
Y596.8 and recurring profits to rise 40 per cent to Y20.5bn from Y14.6bn.
Net income is forecast to increase 77 per cent to Y12.7bn, compared with
Y7.2bn

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Orix and Nippon Shinpan, two leading Japanese financial services companies,
reported slightly higher profits for the six months to September in spite of
falls in operating revenues. Both said their improved profitability was a
result of efforts to reduce funding costs.
Orix, the country's largest leasing company, saw recurring profits - before
extraordinary items and tax - rise 6.2 per cent to Y17.9bn (Dollars 102.4m)
from the same period a year earlier.
In spite of the continued weakness of capital expenditure at home, the
company recorded an increase of 2.6 per cent in outstanding operating
assets, to Y4.0trn. Total turnover fell 6.2 per cent to Y157.0bn as interest
rates were lower during the period than a year earlier. Expenses fell 7.6
per cent to Y139.0bn, because of lower borrowing costs and a greater
emphasis on diversifying sources of funding. After-tax profits fell 1.4 per
cent to Y9.3bn.
The company forecast an increase in recurring profits of 5.2 per cent to
Y36bn for the full year to next March on turnover ahead 1.7 per cent at
Y331bn.
Nippon Shinpan, one of the leading credit card operators, reported recurring
profits of Y5.02bn for the half-year, 0.7 per cent higher than a year
earlier. Operating revenues fell 0.3 per cent to Y186.6bn while after-tax
profits rose 7.2 per cent to Y2.2bn.
The company said the improved profits were attributable to reductions in
costs in order to develop new loan services. Nippon Shinpan is diversifying
its activities from shopping credit to housing and consumer loans. For the
full year to March it forecast a rise of 4 per cent in recurring profits to
Y13bn.

FT  21 NOV 94 / International Company News: Deutsche Telekom sell-off
decision expected today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most keenly awaited decisions in the investment banking world is
expected to be taken in Bonn today when Chancellor Helmut Kohl meets with
Deutsche Telekom to decide which banks will handle the DM15bn (Dollars
9.7bn) partial privatisation of the German telecommunications concern.
The main interest centres on which foreign investment bank will be chosen as
global co-ordinator for the sale of Telekom shares to international
investors. Goldman Sachs of the US is the most favoured candidate for this
role, which will involve working with the two big German banks - Deutsche
Bank and Dresdner Bank - expected jointly to head the overall issue.
However, other US and European banks are strongly in the running.
European banks have made clear their feeling that the post of global
co-ordinator should go to one of them and not a US institution.
Altogether, 22 foreign banks from the US, Europe and Japan put their cases
(in a so-called beauty contest) in Bonn to the government and Telekom.
Among those whose chances are also rated highly are Merrill Lynch and Morgan
Stanley of the US and SG Warburg of the UK.
Also to be decided is the role of adviser to the government on the Telekom
issue.
CS First Boston has put itself up for this position only, though other banks
are interested.
The chancellor is scheduled to meet this afternoon with Telekom and the
finance and postal ministries. The decision is expected to be announced
quickly.
Apart from the global co-ordinating role, other banks will be chosen to
manage the regional consortiums for north America, Europe and Asia.
Telekom has said a British bank could well have a senior consortium role
because of the importance of the UK stock market.
Although the sale of 25 per cent of Telekom's shares will not take place
until early in 1996, with another tranche in 1998, the issue will have
important consequences for the development of German financial markets and
domestic investment in equities.
About half the shares are likely to be sold to German institutional and
private buyers.

FT  21 NOV 94 / International Company News: VW revises Skoda production plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen, the German carmaker, has agreed to raise the production capacity
of Skoda, its Czech affiliate, to 340,000 units a year by the late 1990s
from about 230,000 at present.
The deal, initialled by VW and the Czech government on Friday, has won
Prague's backing for a revised development plan for Skoda and includes a
commitment to develop further the Czech car components industry.
It opens the way for Volkswagen to raise its 31 per cent minority holding to
60.3 per cent by the end of December - including the conversion of
preference stock into ordinary voting shares - and to 70 per cent by the end
of 1995.
VW will have paid DM1.4bn in three tranches for the 70 per cent stake -
DM200m (Dollars 129m) to the Czech government for the acquisition of part of
its holding and DM1.2bn in new equity capital for Skoda.
Renegotiation of the contract, which was agreed in 1991 and gave VW
management control, was forced by VW's withdrawal, without warning last
autumn, from a DM1.4bn project finance facility for Skoda.
The move caused consternation in Prague, which has been seeking reassurance
ever since about the level of VW's commitment to Skoda.
In early 1991, VW had said it planned capital investments totalling DM9.5bn
for Skoda by the end of the decade, that it would more than double Skoda's
production capacity to about 390,000 cars a year and would build a new
engine plant.
Under the revised deal VW has won approval for a more modest capacity
expansion, and has dropped the engine plant plan. The current capital
spending plan totals around DM3.7bn from 1991 to 2000, but this could be
reduced if VW can find additional investment cost savings.
Under the new agreement VW's plans include:
Development of a second car range for Skoda due for launch in 1996-97,
code-named A+.
The larger Skoda range will be derived from the VW group's so-called 'A'
platform, which will also form the basis for the next generation VW Golf in
the late 1990s and be used initially for a new range of small Audis - the
group's up-market brand - due for launch in mid-1996.
A new paint plant at Skoda's main production facility at Mlada Boleslav. It

FT  21 NOV 94 / International Company News: Western Mining sees profits rise

<TEXT>
Western Mining Corporation, one of Australia's largest mining companies, has
forecast an 'appreciable' increase in first-half profits for 1994-95.
It said if improved prices for its metal products continued into the second
half, the full-year should also see higher results.
In the financial year to the end of last June, WMC made a profit - after tax
but before abnormal items - of ADollars 119.7m (USDollars 88.6m) down 27.8
per cent on the previous year's figure.
At the annual meeting in Kalgoorlie, Sir Arvi Parbo, WMC's chairman, said
the East Spar gas field off the north-west coast of Western Australia was to
be developed at a cost of ADollars 250m. WMC is operator of the joint
venture, and holds a 30 per cent interest in the field. Sir Arvi said the
field had reserves of about 350bn cubic feet of gas and 25m barrels of
condensate. Development of the project will take place over the next two
years.
The chairman said WMC wanted to become a much larger producer of copper  -
its main operations are at Olympic Dam in South Australia and Nifty in
Western Australia - and was exploring in the Philippines and Chile as well
as its home country.
The company hoped to expand its European talc activities and was considering
the production of high analysis fertilisers for Australia.
State Bank of New South Wales, which the state government is planning to
sell to Colonial Mutual Life for ADollars 576.5m, announced operating
profits of ADollars 70.5m before tax.
After-tax profits rose 87 per cent, to ADollars 40.1m.

FT  21 NOV 94 / International Company News: SCA lifts forecast after strong
nine months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCA, Sweden's second largest forestry group, has raised its 1994 profits
forecast after doubling profits to SKr1.59bn (Dollars 217m) in the first
nine months.
The improvement came in spite of a much weaker performance from Molnlycke,
SCA's hygiene division, which has been hit by competition in the European
nappies market.
The company has had to cut nappy prices and lift marketing costs since the
US group Kimberley Clark entered the market, adding to the competitive
pressures imposed by Procter &amp; Gamble. It has maintained market share but
says competition in France is getting tougher.
Excluding one-off items, SCA's profits after financial items rose to
SKr1.42bn from SKr788m on a 5 per cent rise in underlying sales to
SKr24.7bn. The result was driven by higher volumes and prices in SCA's
traditional forest industry businesses and lower financial costs.
Earnings from the group's graphic paper division tripled to SKr228m from
SKr76m, while the forest and timber unit doubled profits to SKr559m from
SKr267m. Packaging operations improved slightly to SKr531m from SKr526m.
Molnlycke's operating profit fell 19 per cent to SKr663m. The unit, which
did much to sustain SCA during the downturn in the pulp and paper cycle, has
become its main source of concern and a savings programme is planned. The
difficulties are entirely related to the nappies segment.
The full-year profit forecast has been re-estimated at SKr2.1bn to SKr2.3bn
against an earlier SKr1.9bn to SKr2.3bn prediction.
The company says the improving European business climate is helping price
increases feed deeper into the paper product range, spreading from 'raw
material sectors' to 'more refined products'.

FT  21 NOV 94 / UK Company News: HNVA offer for Heron near to winning
approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders, banks and bondholders will have already decided the fate of
Gerald Ronson's collapsed property empire, given tomorrow's deadline for
proxy votes, and Mr Steven Green appears set to emerge as the new proprietor
of Heron.
There have been small voices of dissent - unsurprising, considering
investors have seen the value of their investments fall by about 85 per cent
in the past 18 months - but the consensus is that Mr Green offers the best
escape route.
Bankers to Heron International have not yet formally submitted head office
approvals for acceptance, but it is understood that this is agreed,
following an independent analysis of Heron's value.
Mr Green's investment vehicle, HNVA - he is executive chairman - offered the
highest bid in an auction which attracted only limited interest.
One of the other bidders said last week: 'I think it is a spectacular deal
for bondholders, and if they can get this offer, good luck to them.' He said
HNVA's valuations for Heron's European properties appeared high.
The directors of Heron have also rallied to the HNVA cause, claiming that
the only alternative, receivership, would realise Pounds 4,433 per Pounds
10,000 of debt, versus an HNVA offer worth Pounds 4,664. The
post-receivership funds would also take a long time to resolve.
Finally, those who feel that HNVA is getting a bargain are invited to
participate in the advantages by taking equity in the new investment
vehicle.
Mr Gary Klesch, a specialist in distressed debt, has been one of few
bondholders to stand up and oppose the deal, urging fellow investors that
'there is still value worth fighting for'.
He raised the issue of the precise identity of the HNVA backers and hinted
at the existence of an alternative buyer - which seems unlikely, considering
the limp response to the auction and the close deadline for the HNVA offer.
HNVA has stated that its backers include high profile shareholders such as
Mr Rupert Murdoch and Mr Craig McCaw, chairman of McCaw Cellular
Communications. Mr Green has also proven himself through his turn-around of
the Samsonite business.
A more important issue for prospective takers of the equity should be the
fact that an enforced change in Heron's articles of association will remove
most standard shareholder rights.
Remuneration will be decided by the directors; there will be no requirement
for non-executive directors; and proposals which previously required 75 per
cent shareholder approval will now require only a majority, which Mr Green
will control.
This means that future investors would need to feel extremely confident in
the integrity and ability of the new management.
Merchant bankers connected to the deal suggested that the equity take-up
would fall below 30 per cent, but that the buy-out would succeed.
Even Mr Klesch admitted: 'I think this deal will go through.'

FT  21 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Co-operatives consider merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two Midlands co-operative societies are considering merging to form one of
the largest co-operatives in the UK with an annual turnover of more than
Pounds 600m.
The Central Midlands Co-operative Society and Leicestershire Co-operative
Society have established a working party which is expected to come up with
proposals by the end of next month.
The merged societies would have 8,000 employees and cover Warwickshire,
Leicestershire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire, and
Northamptonshire as well as Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire. Last year the
CMCS achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.8m, while the LCS made Pounds
3.5m.
The CMCS said that both societies were financially strong, and the merger
would be a consolidation of strength that could lead to further expansion.
The new society would have 170 food stores, including 14 superstores, and
would be a leading regional dairy, bottling 1m pints of milk a day. It would
also be the Midlands' largest funeral director, with 42 funeral homes.

FT  21 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Standard Life's surrender bonus - Scheme to
reduce penalties for early redemption of policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The move by Standard Life, the UK's largest mutual life insurer, to offer
higher surrender values to customers who cash in long-term life assurance or
pension policies prematurely has aroused far more interest than expected
among independent financial advisers.
But the policy of giving a better deal to customers whose plans lapse within
a few years - at the expense of a small reduction in maturity value - has
sparked controversy within the life sector.
Some companies believe that improving early surrender values can be unfair
to investors who stay with a policy for its duration. They also fear it
could undermine the very idea of the policy as a form of long-term saving.
Mr John Hylands, Standard's head of marketing, said the programme of
presentations to independent financial advisers - through whom the company
makes most of its sales - had been extended to the end of this week.
The company had originally expected about 2,000 independent advisers to
attend, but now expects as many as 4,000 will have been to the roadshows by
the presentations' finish.
Other life companies, including those which also sell primarily through
independent advisers, are particularly irritated that Standard is improving
its surrender values without cutting the commissions it pays to those
selling its products.
Competition among those life companies is expected to intensify as a result
of regulatory changes.
Under Standard's new system, which comes into effect in January, the company
will finance the initial cost of paying commission - so the adviser will
still get paid - and then deduct the total out of premiums paid over the
whole life of the policy rather than just taking it all from the early
premiums.
To finance this change, Standard will move about Pounds 50m in the first
year from its free assets, which totalled Pounds 5.7bn at the end of last
year, into policy reserves.
Mr Hylands said that total would rise over the following few years and would
stabilise at the transfer of 'a few hundred million pounds of capital'.
Throughout the life assurance industry, companies have been adjusting their
policies and the way they pay sales agents and advisers in preparation for
the new regulatory regime, which begins in January.
Standard also has an additional factor to cope with next year in the loss of
its former relationship with Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest,
under which Halifax sold only Standard Life financial services' products.
The Halifax is setting up its own life assurance subsidiary in January.

FT  21 NOV 94 / International Company News: Battle for Dunnes ends with
brother Ben selling stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MCMANUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A two-year battle for control of the Republic of Ireland's largest retailer,
Dunnes Stores, has ended. Mr Ben Dunne, the former executive chairman and a
19 per cent shareholder in the company is to be bought out by his brother
and two sisters for a reported IPounds 100m (Pounds 98.3m).
In return Mr Dunne is to drop his legal action to have the family trust,
through which the company is owned, broken up. The case was expected to be
heard by the Irish High Court last week but was repeatedly adjourned while a
settlement was hammered out.
If he had been successful in breaking up the trust Mr Dunne planned to bring
a second action to force his family to buy him out or sell their shares to
him.
Mr Dunne brought his action after being removed from the position of
executive chairman in March 1993. He was voted out by a board made up of his
brother Frank and three sisters, Mrs Margaret Hefferman, Miss Therese Dunne
and the now-deceased Mrs Elizabeth McMahon, who supported him.
Mr Dunne was claiming that the trustees' decision to extend the trust after
it was due to expire in 1985, was improper and had no legal effect.
A break-up of the trust would have allowed the shares in the company to be
sold, but could also have exposed the beneficiaries of the trust, including
Mr Dunne, to capital gains tax liabilities.
The details of the settlement have not been released but it is understood
that Mr Dunne could receive up to IPounds 100m in phased payments over a
number of years.
He is expected to agree not to set up in competition with Dunnes Stores for
at least 12 months. Despite this, shares in Dunloe, Mr Dunne's property
concern, jumped by 5p to 35p last week prompting it to issue a statement
denying it was in any commercial negotiations that might explain the rise.
Dunloe has been suggested as the possible vehicle by which Mr Dunne could
set up in competition with Dunnes Stores.

FT  21 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Hanson abandons flotation plans for Ertl
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson has been forced to abandon the flotation of Ertl, its US-based toy
maker, because of difficult stock market conditions.
The conglomerate had been hoping to raise about Dollars 200m (Pounds 130m)
from the partial US flotation as part of its debt reduction programme. It is
thought it will now try for a trade sale, though a deal is unlikely to be
clinched for some months.
When Hanson announced the plan in August it was hoping to sell 63 per cent
of its holding, at Dollars 16 a share, valuing Ertl at about Dollars 216m.
Even at that stage analysts viewed it as a full price for a company which
had pre-tax profits of Dollars 14.1m on sales of Dollars 186m in 1993. The
price represented 21 times historic earnings.
Ertl, a leading US toy maker, is best known for its die-cast tractor models
and Thomas the Tank Engine. It also makes the successful Bumble Ball toy.
Hanson acquired Ertl with Kidde in 1987 after a proposed Dollars 89.5m sale
to Tonka collapsed.
A trade sale is likely to be at a lower rating than the planned flotation.
But it would enable Hanson to sell all of the equity rather than retain a
stake as is customary for such a flotation in the US.
The proposed deal had a similar structure to the Beazer Homes USA flotation,
Hanson's US housebuilding business, which was completed earlier this year as
part of the group's strategy of reducing debt by disposals.
Following last year's Pounds 2.2bn acquisition of Quantum Chemical, Hanson's
debt jumped to Pounds 3.4bn, pushing its gearing to 86 per cent.
But because of disposals and good operating cash flow analysts expect debt
to have been cut to about Pounds 2.5bn by Hanson's September year-end, for
gearing of about 50 per cent.

FT  21 NOV 94 / BZW looks to strengthen presence in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BZW, the investment banking arm of Barclays, has started a strategic review
of its business in the US that could lead to the bank entering a partnership
with, or acquiring, a US investment bank.
BZW executives believe that it needs to strengthen its presence in the US in
order to compete with other global investment banks. At the moment, BZW has
limited US bond operations and it does not sell US equities.
The bank's review is being led by Mr Donald Brydon, the newly-appointed
deputy chief executive of BZW. Barclays may appoint outside advisers to help
in the review, which is expected to be completed by the middle of next year.
The move follows efforts by Barclays to run down its US retail banking
businesses, and refocus its activities for large companies. It has reduced
the number of companies it deals with over the past 18 months from 900 to
200.
Sir Peter Middleton, chairman of BZW, said that BZW 'had a shortage, which
we are determined to rectify, of dollar products'. He said that it was
likely to examine both its presence in US equities and fixed income.
Sir Peter emphasised that BZW was keeping an open mind about strategies for
US expansion. 'We shall do something. Either we shall grow something
organically, or look for a partner, or something of that sort.'
BZW has a range of businesses in the US including treasury and derivatives.
It has a government bond trading licence, and a small mortgage-backed bonds
desk, but its equities presence is limited to selling European and Asian
shares.
BZW executives believe that it could not compete head on with the large US
'bulge bracket' firms such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. However,
they think BZW needs a strong US operation in order to operate globally.
One possibility would be to form a partnership with a small US investment
bank in order for both partners to gain access to each other's markets.
Several smaller US securities firms have faced difficulties penetrating
London markets.
Barclays previously had a small operation researching and selling US
equities, which it acquired from the former Drexel Burnham Lambert. These
operations were closed three years ago because they were seen as too
expensive.
Barclays has been accumulating capital in the past year because of retained
earnings and shrinking assets, which would allow it to expand through
acquisition. Last week it announced a buy-back of Dollars 500m (Pounds 305m)
in preference shares.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Company News (This Week): Market tunes in for showing of LWT
integration - Granada
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Granada Group, the broadcasting, leisure, rental and business services
group, is expected on Wednesday to report pre-tax profits for the year to
end-September of at least Pounds 250m, up from Pounds 176m last time.
Earnings per share are forecast at around 30p, and the dividend is expected
to be 14 per cent ahead at 10p.
The second half will see the first full contribution from London Weekend
Television, of which Granada won control in February for Pounds 760m after
the first successful hostile bid in the UK television industry. The combined
group commands about 30 per cent of UK television advertising revenue.
LWT is expected to contribute about Pounds 27m towards the television
division's total operating profits of around Pounds 80m, up from a previous
Pounds 42.5m. At the interim stage LWT had been with the group for just a
month, and made a contribution of Pounds 4.7m.
Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive, said in June that he had been 'rather
confused' by City rumours that the integration of LWT was going badly. 'In
fact, it is one of the easiest integrations we have been involved with,' he
said.
Since then the group has started integrating the non-programme making
activities of Granada Television and LWT with the loss of between 150 and
200 jobs from a combined staff of
2,000.
Despite an underlying decline in sales at the rental division, operating
profits are seen rising to around Pounds 110m, from a previous Pounds 105m.
Mobile telephones, satellite subscriptions and the sale of second-hand
equipment are expected to make good progress.
The leisure sector is forecast to contribute Pounds 46m (Pounds 37.5m),
while a sharp increase at Sutcliffe Catering is expected to help the
business services division increase operating profits to Pounds 50m (Pounds
17.4m).

FT  21 NOV 94 / Company News (This Week): Germany set for small offerings -
Commerzbank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Commerzbank kicks off the autumn reporting season of the big German banks on
Wednesday with its 10-month results. Like other international banks, those
in Germany have suffered from the downturn in bond markets which was
triggered earlier this year by rises in US interest rates.
Commerzbank suffered a 68 per cent drop in trading profits for its own
account to DM87m (Pounds 36m) in the first six months, but this was partly
cushioned by a 15 per cent fall in bad debt provisions to DM710m. Full
operating profits (including own account trading and normal bank business)
were 11 per cent higher at DM438m.
Deutsche Bank reported a 1 per cent rise in full operating profits, also
suffering a sharp fall in own-account trading results.
Commerzbank has already put out a brief statement of its performance over
the first nine months to accord with the share listing requirements of the
Madrid Stock Exchange.
These showed that the group's partial operating results, excluding
securities, foreign exchange and other trading on its own account, rose by
2.4 per cent to DM1.5bn. With an improvement in the net interest margin, net
interest income was 7 per cent higher at DM3.8bn. Net commission income was
down, while operating costs were 4.8 per cent higher.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Kemper and Conseco drop merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Dollars 2.4bn merger between Kemper and Conseco, the US financial
services groups, has been abandoned by mutual consent. The failure of the
deal appears to open the door to other suitors, from GE Capital to Dean
Witter Discover, who have also expressed interest in Kemper.
It is understood that the chief obstacle was Conseco's difficulty in
securing finance. The merger has been beset with problems since it was
announced in June, with Conseco first delaying it for lack of finance, then
reducing its price from Dollars 2.7bn to Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.5bn).
Kemper's board will be under strong pressure to arrange an alternative deal.
It is thought the share price could fall to Dollars 40 in the absence of a
bidder, thus opening Kemper directors to legal action by their shareholders.
Mr David Mathis, Kemper chairman, said yesterday: 'Our board remains
committed to the goal of maximising value for our stockholders, and we plan
to explore all possible alternatives as expeditiously as practicable.'
Until now, Kemper has been prevented from pursuing an alternative deal by
its undertaking to pay Conseco Dollars 100m if it backed out. However,
Kemper said yesterday that as the termination was mutual, the Dollars 100m
was not now payable.
One of the most likely bidders is GE Capital, whose earlier offer for Kemper
at Dollars 60 a share had been capped by Conseco's initial bid of Dollars
67. However, Conseco's bid had been subsequently scaled down to Dollars 60
as well. It is believed that GE's interest has been reawakened in recent
weeks, along with that of other potential bidders such as Dean Witter and
SunAmerica.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Bull sale puts France on the horns of a dilemma: Foreign
groups interested in a big stake in computer maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The privatisation of Groupe Bull, the loss-making computer manufacturer, is
the French government's most difficult task so far in its programme to sell
21 public-sector groups.
The planned privatisation, which kicked off on Friday with the opening of a
tender for stakes in the company, is the first test of the government's
ability to sell one of the casualties of the public sector.
It may also force the government into tough decisions concerning the extent
to which it will allow foreign electronics and telecommunications groups to
invest in the national computer company and penetrate the French market,
possibly to the detriment of powerful domestic players, such as Alcatel and
France Telecom. As one Paris banker said: 'They need to sell Bull, but this
may involve increased access in strategic markets for foreign companies such
as NEC of Japan or AT&amp;T of the US.'
The complexity of the government's task stems from Bull's financial plight.
Whereas previous privatisation candidates have all been profitable, the
computer maker has been in the red since 1989, racking up total losses of
more than FFr20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) as it has struggled with increasingly
competitive markets, bureaucratic management and an inflated cost base.
Although losses have been curbed as a result of a cost-cutting plan by Mr
Jean-Marie Descarpentries, who took over as chairman last autumn, Bull
remains vulnerable in many business areas. A report this year by an
independent consultancy claimed only the company's large systems and
computer maintenance businesses were secure.
The legacy of losses has required a succession of subsidies. Since the start
of last year, the computer maker has received FFr11.1bn in state aid,
roughly three times analysts' estimates of its value. European Commission
approval of such huge transfers, matched only by capital injections for Air
France and Credit Lyonnais, was granted only on condition of rapid
privatisation.
Because public investors are unlikely to be attracted by such a risky
proposition, the government has been constrained to seek privatisation
through selling stakes to industry partners. 'We are seeking to find a
majority shareholder, or significant minority shareholders to allow the
company to reinforce its industrial strategies,' said Friday's statement
from the French economy and industry ministries.
The good news is that even before the official launch of an invitation for
bids, potential investors had expressed interest. NEC, which holds 4.4 per
cent of Bull and supplies its partner with mainframe computers, said this
month that it wanted to raise its stake. It is thought to be seeking a
holding of about 10 per cent to use Bull to expand its services and supply
network in Europe.
AT&amp;T, the US telecoms company and Quadral, parent of CSEE, the French
electronics concern, are weighing a joint bid for up to 40 per cent of
Bull's shares. IBM, which holds a 2.1 per cent stake in its French
counterpart has yet to make clear its intentions, while Motorola, which
recently concluded a technology partnership with Bull, may also be a
candidate for a stake. 'The company holds a few trumps,' said one
electronics analyst. 'It has a strong European base and some quality
technicians.'
The flurry of interest has drawn a positive response from the French
government. 'It is a good sign that investors are showing themselves,' said
Mr Jose Rossi, French industry minister.
But the potential proposals are likely to leave Mr Rossi and his government
colleagues with some daunting decisions. The proposal from AT&amp;T and CSEE,
for example, could prove controversial.
If the offer is confirmed - so far only a preliminary letter has been sent
to the government - it could solve at a stroke the privatisation conundrum.
In conjunction with a bigger stake for NEC, the state would be able to
obtain its objective of reducing its 76 per cent stake to a minority
holding.
But there are hurdles. AT&amp;T's interest in the privatisation does not lie in
the computing side of Bull's operations. Instead, the US company is seeking
to enter France's telephone services market which is monopolised by France
Telecom, the state operator.
AT&amp;T is thought to be offering to buy a large stake in Bull in return for
the award of a telecoms services licence, although the French market, in
line with EU policy, is not set to be liberalised until 1998.
Such a proposal throws up thorny questions for the government. France
Telecom, which holds 17 per cent of Bull, is likely to resist the arrival of
one of its main international rivals. Alcatel, the French telecoms equipment
giant and another rival of AT&amp;T, would also be expected to oppose such a
solution.
In addition, Mr Descarpentries is thought to favour a series of smaller
investments by industrial partners and a substantial shareholding by
employees, rather than the presence of a powerful shareholder such as AT&amp;T.
Trade unions, wary of foreign shareholders and fearing Bull will be broken
up after the sale, are planning demonstrations against the privatisation
this week.
The French government declines to comment on specific proposals, but has
indicated it will not oppose the presence of foreign companies on the
shareholder register. 'The only thing which interests me is to give the
company the chance to succeed,' said Mr Rossi.
Friday's statement also made clear that the French government is seeking to
maintain Bull as a whole. 'It would be difficult politically to allow the
national computer company to be broken up,' said one analyst.
The sensitivity of the issue could be blunted by the retention of a blocking
stake by the state, in conjunction with France Telecom. Less problematic
solutions may also emerge from proposals by potential investors or by the
creation of a network of significant, but not dominant, shareholders, as
sought by Bull's chairman.
But time is short. Prospective candidates have until December 9 to submit
their offers, after which a selected shortlist will have six weeks to
perform a detailed study of Bull before making binding proposals.
Ultimately, the state-shareholder is faced with the fact that beggars cannot
be choosers. As befits Bull's troubled history, however, the choices may
prove painful.

The chemicals and fibres group, whose shares have been weak in the past few

FT  21 NOV 94 / Saudi Arabia to urge one-year extension on oil output
ceiling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BALI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Saudi Arabia will today ask the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to extend the current production ceiling until the end of 1995 in
order to bolster oil prices.
A one-year rollover of the 24.52m barrel a day ceiling would be a sharp
departure from Opec's policy in recent years of trying to balance world
supply and demand through frequent changes in output.
Analysts say it would also give a signal to world oil markets that Saudi
Arabia, Opec's largest producer and the only one with large spare capacity,
is prepared to forego possible volume increases next year in favour of a
strategy that, if successful, could deliver higher prices.
Other Opec ministers, meeting in the Indonesian resort of Bali, also favour
a rollover, but it is not certain that all accept the need for such a long
extension.
Iran, one of Opec's persistent price hawks, said yesterday that it would
consider all options. Mr Gholamreza Aghazadeh, oil minister, said he would
look at all rollover proposals, whether for '12, six or three months'.
Iran had been thought to favour a three-month extension. But some Gulf Arab
officials yesterday described it as unacceptable because it would have
little market credibility.
Saudi Arabia, however, might accept a six-month rollover if the one-year
proposal meets stiff opposition. Saudi officials had publicly advocated the
six-month option as late as last week.
Some analysts believe current oil prices already discount a six-month
extension. They claim a one-year rollover would send a strong bullish signal
to world oil markets in the short term.
The strategy assumes that non-Opec producers would not be able to increase
output quickly to meet the full 1m b/d increase in world demand expected
next year. Over the past year, a surge in non-Opec production, especially
from Norway and the UK, has been more than adequate to meet rising demand.
The Saudi plan also assumes that quota cheating by Opec states will remain
at relatively modest levels.
One Opec delegate said the Saudi strategy was not intended to produce a
sharp jump in oil prices next year. 'I can't see Brent going above Dollars
23 a barrel,' he said - the benchmark Brent Blend currently stands at about
Dollars 16.50. Instead, the aim is to put pressure on minimum prices, and to
reduce frequent price swings.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Pace of economic growth may trigger rates rise, warns Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interest rates must be raised if the UK economy continues to expand at the
current speed, Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, said
yesterday. His warning follows publication of figures last week that showed
much faster growth than expected.
The figures had fuelled City speculation that Mr George will press for an
interest rate rise soon. But Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who is to
speak on the economy in the House of Commons on Wednesday, is likely to be
reluctant to raise rates before Christmas if, as expected, his November 29
Budget includes tighter fiscal measures. With last week's figures indicating
gross domestic product 4.2 per cent higher in the third quarter than in the
same quarter last year, Bank of England officials believe growth is now
unsustainably high.
In Dubai, where he was attending an international banking conference, Mr
George told Reuters, the news agency: 'We have the economy growing very
strongly . . . unless it begins to slow down of its own accord, there is no
doubt we will have to help it slow down through tighter monetary policy.'
At Mr George's last monetary meeting with the chancellor, the two men
apparently agreed to leave interest rates unchanged at 5.75 per cent.
Mr Clarke's next monthly meeting with Mr George is scheduled for December 7.
City economists are divided about the likelihood of an interest rate rise on
that date. However, Mr Clarke is likely to face protests from within his own
Conservative party against a rates rise before Christmas if he introduces
tighter tax measures in the Budget next week that could further depress
consumer confidence.
Although manufacturing is growing steadily, boosted by a pick-up in exports,
last week's figures suggested that trading conditions will be tough for
retailers in the pre-Christmas period.
Meanwhile, as both the chancellor and governor have stressed in recent
weeks, UK inflationary pressures remain subdued. The underlying rate of
retail price inflation is running at 2 per cent, its lowest for 27 years.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Optimism on new Aids therapy: Glaxo decides against
licensing anti-HIV drug to Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A combination of two Aids drugs, Glaxo's new 3TC and Wellcome's established
AZT, has the strongest and most prolonged clinical effect of any treatment
yet tested.
First results of clinical trials with the 3TC-AZT combination, which were
released at an international congress on Aids therapy in Glasgow yesterday,
show the drugs cut virus levels in blood cells by 99 per cent after a year.
This compares with an 11 per cent reduction over six months using AZT alone.
The results are so encouraging that Glaxo has decided to continue developing
3TC itself rather than licensing it to Wellcome. The two UK pharmaceutical
companies had announced in March a provisional agreement giving Wellcome the
option to develop and market 3TC as a treatment for HIV infection, the virus
that causes Aids. But negotiations to implement the agreement have collapsed
because Glaxo now sees 3TC as a more promising potential product.
'Glaxo is fully committed to the development and eventual marketing of 3TC
and will proceed to bring it through the regulatory process as quickly as
possible,' the company said yesterday. It plans to file for regulatory
approval in the first half of 1995 to sell 3TC in combination with AZT. The
two companies are continuing discussions on commercial co-operation over
3TC/AZT combination therapy.
The Glasgow conference heard results from two trials of 3TC/AZT involving a
total of 352 patients infected with HIV. As well as producing the drastic
reduction in the levels of virus, the combination was far more effective
than AZT in improving patients' CD4 cell counts, which measure the damage
done to the immune system by the infection.
'The results of AZT/3TC in combination are better than any of the
combinations which have been tried to date,' said Dr Schlomo Staszewski of
Goethe University Clinic in Frankfurt, Germany, who led one study.
'These data are extremely significant not only for their effectiveness in
reducing virus and increasing CD4 cell levels but also because the effects
persisted throughout the year-long study,' added Prof Christine Katlama of
the Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital in Paris, the other study leader. 'It is also
important to note that the combination was very well tolerated by patients.'
Longer clinical trials will be necessary to confirm that the 3TC-AZT
combination actually improves the health and extends the life of people with
HIV.
First evidence from test-tube experiments that 3TC plus AZT could be
effective in combating the disease emerged publicly at the World Aids
Conference in Japan in August this year.
Combinations work better than single drugs in fighting HIV, because it is
more difficult for the virus to develop resistance to two or more chemicals
at once.

FT  21 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Metals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Base metals prices enjoyed an extraordinary trading period last week. The
prices of copper and aluminium clambered 5 per cent in frantic trading on
the London Metal Exchange. That was the culmination of a bull run which has
driven base metal prices up more than 60 per cent since January.
The rise in some of the metals may be justified. Reserves of copper on the
LME have fallen nearly 50 per cent since this time last year, leaving less
than five weeks' stocks. Demand, driven by rapid economic growth, is
expanding fast. Meanwhile, new supply is not due to come on-stream until the
second half of next year.
Similarly, aluminium stocks have fallen 20 per cent, with demand strong and
supply controlled until at least the end of 1996 through a voluntary
agreement by manufacturers. But stocks of tin, lead, zinc and nickel, all of
which have posted impressive increases this year, have risen over the last
12 months. Even if demand is strong, supply appears stronger.
The arrival of speculative commodity and hedge funds indiscriminately buying
baskets of metals are the main cause of the explosion in prices. They have
viewed commodities such as metals as a hedge against inflation. But the
scale of the funds has swamped the fundamentals of the metals markets. No
doubt, when the fashionable money flows out again - and it will because
metals pay no interest - prices will suffer a sharp correction. With many
funds anxious to book profits before the year-end, the base metal bubble
could burst before Christmas.

FT  21 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Tokyo markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Aggressive overseas buyers of the Tokyo stock market in the first quarter
have been disappointed by the Nikkei's progress. Foreign investors had hoped
the market would move forward sharply on the back of an expected strong
recovery in corporate earnings. The interim earnings reported by
manufacturers this month have indeed been strong. But the Nikkei has moved
sideways. Admittedly, US investors are sitting on 5 per cent profits since
March, but that is due to the dollar's depreciation against the yen.
Domestic shareholders have enjoyed no improvement whatsoever.
The reason for investors' frustration is that the earnings recovery among
manufacturers has already been discounted. Sectors such as steel and paper
have outperformed the market by about 10 per cent this year. But the Nikkei
has been held back by sectors such as construction and banking which have
fallen 18 per cent and 11 per cent respectively.
Overseas investors have neither the weight nor confidence to create a market
recovery. For the market to move forward decisively, it must be driven by
domestic buyers. But Japanese institutions view equities, which yield less
than 1 per cent, as expensive compared with bonds which yield 4.75 per cent.
Moreover, the banks, troubled by poorly performing loans, still own 20 per
cent of the market. Whenever the Nikkei picks up, they sell into strength.
If the market breaks out from its recent trading range soon, the move is
likely to be down.

FT  21 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Solvency standards
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's actuaries are incensed that the government's proposed solvency
benchmark for occupational pensions will give an unduly optimistic picture
of a fund's financial health. That is because the proposed methodology
allows schemes to count their equity holdings when assessing their ability
to meet liabilities to pensioners expected to live at least 10 years. The
actuaries argue passionately that gilts should be used as they provide more
certainty of providing the necessary income.
However the debate is resolved, it has usefully served to highlight the
trade-off between investments in equities versus gilts. It is exposing
something that may have been obscured during the 1980s when high equity
returns could be taken for granted: that investment in equities is at the
expense of the security of pensioners' entitlements. To guarantee that
security requires a higher proportion of gilts in a pension portfolio. And
yet, because equities outperform gilts over the long-term, it costs a
company more to fund greater security. Those companies whose funds have a
low solvency margin - and therefore run the risk of failing the new
standards - will eventually be obliged to make greater contributions to
their funds.
It is alarmist to suggest that the solvency proposals will ultimately lead
to a massive switch out of equities. Most funds have a high degree of
solvency; and those that do not have until the next century to make the
adjustment. But for some funds, which face the obligation to meet
liabilities sooner rather than later, the shift to gilts has already begun.

FT  21 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: UBS under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle between the board of Union Bank of Switzerland and Mr Martin
Ebner, the maverick fund manager, is nearing its climax. Tomorrow investors
will vote on a board proposal to strip the bank's registered shareholders,
of which Mr Ebner's BK Vision is the largest, of their special voting
rights.
For registered shareholders, it is clear what to do. Their shares enjoy an
effective premium of 17 per cent over the bank's bearer stock, which would
be wiped out if the board's proposal carried the day. Given that registered
shareholders command 51 per cent of the bank's votes, one might think their
self-interest would settle the battle. But things are not so simple. UBS,
through its fund management arm, holds power of attorney over a large slug
of its own shares. By voting them in favour of the board proposal, it may
well be able to neutralise other registered shareholders.
As a result, the bearer shareholders' votes will also be crucial. For them,
the essential question is whether it is in their interests for Mr Ebner to
be stripped of his influence. Probably not. Though Mr Ebner has not spelt
out a complete strategy for UBS, he is pressing the bank to improve its
returns - perhaps by focusing on its lucrative fund management arm and
reducing its less profitable retail banking network. UBS says it too plans
to improve profitability. But it is hard to avoid the conclusion that it has
been spurred to do so by Mr Ebner's prodding. If he is marginalised, UBS
will be under less pressure to perform. So bearer shareholders, too, should
vote against the board.

John Baker and Brian Birkenhead, the architects of National Power's
well-received move to buy back up to 102.5m of its shares from the Treasury,
appeared well pleased with their efforts on Thursday. And with good reason.
Within a day of the announcement, the chief executive and finance director
of National Power exercised a large raft of share options. Birkenhead made a
Pounds 380,000 turn from the transaction, while his boss netted Pounds
713,000. The additional profits to the two from Thursday's price rise,
amounted to a worthwhile Pounds 23,488.
Admittedly, the directors had had to wait until the announcement of their
results, before they could make such transactions. But when they told
analysts on Thursday that the buy-back deal was in everybody's interests,
they clearly meant it.

France's President Mitterrand may be thinking about finding his successor,
but Andreas Papandreou, Greece's ailing socialist prime minister, is making
another stab at immortality. Rather than take well-earned retirement after
serving as premier for nine of the past 13 years, he is preparing to undergo
heart surgery once again.
Papandreou, 75, has been in poor health since having a double bypass in
London in 1988. But this time he is too weak to travel. The operation is
expected to take place early next year in Athens' gleaming new Onassis
Cardiac Centre ' founded under the will of the late shipping magnate
Aristotle Onassis. Conveniently ' from the point of view of medical bills '
the Onassis hospital was incorporated into the Greek national health system
by Papandreou a few years ago.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Good news from British shipbuilders. Only days after the last rites were
performed for Swan Hunter, one of Europe's best-equipped shipbuilders,
Britain has secured an order for . . . a square-rigged sailing ship.
It seems that any navy worth its salt has a square rigger in its fleet these
days. So the Indian government has commissioned Hampshire naval architect
Colin Mudie to design a 177ft three-masted barque to train India's young
sailors before they move up to something more powerful.
Mudie has carved out quite a niche for himself. He has designed the Young
Endeavour (Australia), Tunas Samudera (Malaysia) and Lord Nelson. His latest
vessel will accommodate 45 cadets and have a 2,000 mile range. The bad news
is that the ship will be built in Goa and not Sunderland.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Observer: Tate and smile
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Isn't it lucky that charities are duty bound to have charitable thoughts?
Otherwise some of them might be cursing the Tate gallery come Budget day.
It seems that Customs &amp; Excise is determined that the Tate should cough up
Pounds 12m in value added tax which will be due on the conversion costs of
transforming the old Bankside power station into its new art gallery. The
Tate, however, counts as a charity. And social welfare charities and worthy
bodies - such as nursing homes - are hoping the Budget will include them in
the zero-VAT rate on converting commercial buildings into housing. Current
betting is that the worthies will win and the charities lose - and all
because Customs just can't bear to see that Pounds 12m slipping from its
grasp.
Result: if Eton wanted to convert a warehouse into a boarding house it could
get VAT relief; if a local charity wanted to convert the same building to a
day centre for the elderly it couldn't.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Observer: From little acorns grow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Here is one for Gardener's Question time. How do you ensure that a small
press release from an unknown firm of Shropshire seed merchants -
highlighting the shortage of British acorns - can grow into a healthy
Euro-scare story from which cuttings can happily be taken only a few weeks
after first blossom?
The press release, designed to drum up business for the company, caught
Fleet Street's imagination because it drew attention to a little known UK
Forestry Commission regulation based on an EC directive. Anyone establishing
a plantation of young trees for forestry purposes can only use acorns from
one of 42 registered oak 'stands' in the UK. As a result of this year's poor
crop, demand will have to be met by importing foreign acorns from countries
such as Poland.
The regulation - in force for well over a decade - only applies when UK
government grants for planting oak trees are concerned. There is nothing to
stop any private individual or land-owner from collecting acorns and growing
oak for their own use.
However, let's not spoil a good story. Having started with 'Euro-meddlers
try to fell our oaks' and 'British acorns not good enough says Brussels', by
yesterday the Independent on Sunday and the Sunday Express were both blaming
the UK acorns' problems on Adolf Hitler. The Brussels directive is said to
be based on a German Forest Race law drafted when Hitler was in power.
The Forestry Commission believes the current row is a nonsense - a view
shared by Bryan Cassidy, the Tory MEP who drew Observer's attention to the
affair. British oaks were wiped out in the ice age and most of the oaks in
Britain today have come from the continent. So much for the Daily Express'
view that German or French oak is 'about as tough as Stork margarine'.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Rare species
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is possible that, within years, tigers could become extinct. The
conference to update the Cites convention on endangered species, which
concluded this weekend in Florida, made that clear. Would extinction matter?
On one view, it might not: the loss would pose no immediate threat to human
health or wealth.
But on several counts, it is worth putting effort into saving rare species.
In western eyes, tigers, elephants, whales and the like are romantic beasts,
whose existence is valued even by those who never see a live specimen. For
local communities, the animals can add greatly to tourism revenues. For all
countries, the animals represent a pool of genes which has potential value.
What is the best means of saving these species? The threats they face are
poachers who want to sell tusks, hides and meat for profit, farmers who
resent the damage they do, and the steady encroachment of human societies
into wild habitats.
The essence of the task is to give people an economic incentive to keep the
animals' numbers at sustainable levels. But there are two particular
problems. One is that, as some east and central African countries have
found, the benefits of the live animals, through tourism, generally go to
the government and companies, while the value of dead animals is received by
poachers and farmers. Governments have found it hard to redistribute the
benefits of tourism at a local level.
Second, demand for products such as rhino horn, driven largely by Asian
markets, has not yet been checked by rising prices. Given the disparity
between Asian wealth and African poverty, it is possible that species would
be extinct before prices rose by enough to choke demand.
One solution is simply to improve enforcement of national rules against
killing animals. South Africa, which devotes considerable resources to
protecting its wildlife, has found numbers of elephant and white rhino
growing rapidly, even though it allows limited domestic trade in ivory.
But that requires funds which are beyond the resources of poorer countries.
One of the best arguments for maintaining an international ban against trade
in products of endangered species is that it makes guarding the animals
easier and cheaper even for the poorest states. The Worldwide Fund for
Nature estimates that the budgets for protecting elephants have dropped by
nearly 90 per cent in Zimbabwe, Zambia and Tanzania since the worldwide ban
on ivory trade in 1989
A third device is to reduce demand for the products. Environmental groups
argue that since the start of the ivory ban, the price of ivory has fallen -
where it can be obtained - while the price of rhino horn has increased. That
is, they say, partly because the main markets for ivory were in western
countries which have enforced tough import controls on ivory. Meanwhile,
western public opinion has turned against ivory,
There is no single solution to the problem of supporting rare species. But
the Cites conference was right to uphold the ban on elephant and white rhino
products, as one of several mechanisms. The next useful step would be to
increase pressure on those governments which have so far taken a relaxed
attitude towards import of banned products.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Helping Arafat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was always on the cards that the price of peace between Israelis and
Palestinians might be a civil war among the latter, if not the former. Both
nationalisms lay claim to the same sliver of land. Any territorial
compromise represents, in the eyes of many on both sides, a betrayal of the
cause.
The legitimacy of the leadership which accepts such a compromise is bound to
be questioned. Some fighters will believe they have a right and a duty to
fight on. Generally they will protest that they have no desire to fight
fellow countrymen. Their target remains the national enemy or occupying
power. But this puts the leadership in an impossible position. It has to
choose, as Israel's prime minister invited the Palestine Liberation
Organisation to choose last month, between peace with Israel and peace with
Hamas.
That was the situation of the Irish provisional government in 1922. Having
signed a treaty with Britain, it could not allow Irish dissidents to
continue the war. It had to fight a civil war against them, or lose the
treaty. Today Yassir Arafat has to crack down on Hamas, or lose his
agreement with Israel.
The precedent is not encouraging. The Irish treaty created a Free State
comprising 26 counties out of the 32 in the island of Ireland, and was
endorsed by 72 per cent of the voters. Even so the ensuing civil war was
more terrible and destructive than the war against the British which
preceded it.
Mr Arafat is being asked to fight his civil war in much less favourable
circumstances. He does not have a free state, only a limited 'self-governing
authority',and he controls only two small fragments of the independent state
he hopes for. As for the strength of his support, no one knows because no
elections have been held. Probably he could have mustered a majority a few
months back. Whether he could now is much more doubtful.
The danger that he would lose a civil war in these conditions is such that
there is an almost equal danger he will avoid it by reverting to war with
Israel. Either outcome would be a disaster for Israel and more especially
for Yitzhak Rabin, who has staked everything on the peace process. It is in
Mr Rabin's own interest to give Mr Arafat a chance of success, by quickly
ceding him real authority in the West Bank as a whole. That may bring closer
the moment when Mr Rabin in his turn has to choose, between peace with the
Palestinians and peace with those Israelis who would fight rather than
withdraw. But that choice too is one that has to be faced.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Bank raid or revolution: Martin Ebner's challenge to the UBS
board has unsettled Switzerland's cosy corporate culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Switzerland's cosy business community has never seen anything like the
bitter proxy battle at the Union Bank of Switzerland, where a determined
outsider has taken on a powerful establishment for control of the company.
Six weeks of hectic trading have wiped more than SFr1bn (Pounds 489m) from
the bank's market capitalisation. And it remains unclear whether the UBS
board will attract enough votes at tomorrow's extraordinary general meeting
of shareholders to see off a challenge to their governance from Mr Martin
Ebner, a little-known Zurich broker-fund manager.
But the case is about more than UBS; it also marks the beginning of the end
for continental Europe's discreet and private approach to corporate
governance. Capital market liberalisation and privatisation have created a
new shareholder culture bent on accountability. And Mr Ebner, a former share
analyst, has confronted the bank with it.
In 1984, Mr Ebner left the Zurich private bank J. Vontobel to set up BZ
Bank, specialising in block trades for institutions. Feared by established
rivals, the bank is one of the most pushy players in the Zurich market. Mr
Ebner diversified into fund management in 1991, taking control of an
investment company, Pharma Vision 2000, specialising in pharmaceutical
shares, and starting another, BK Vision, for financial shares. He declared
the Visions would be activist shareholders, and BK Vision began to needle
the mighty UBS.
As one of only three international banks with triple-A status from all the
big credit-rating agencies, UBS would not seem a propitious target for a
dissident shareholders' movement. But Mr Ebner says the bank's real return
to shareholders - averaging 5.9 per cent in the past 15 years - is far too
low. He argues that, as Switzerland's largest and most prestigious bank, UBS
must break lazy habits acquired from dominating formerly cartelised domestic
financial markets.
'The only banks that will survive are those which concentrate on their most
efficient and profitable activities,' he said in a speech to the UBS AGM
last April. At that meeting, BK Vision put a motion to reduce the UBS board
from 23 members to nine. The motion was defeated, but BK Vision, to
everyone's surprise, attracted some 40 per cent of the votes.
Mr Ebner interpreted this support as a wider mandate to challenge the bank's
overall governance, and foresaw a unique opportunity next spring when the
terms of 10 UBS directors expire.
A couple of months ago, he informed UBS directors that he was trying to
attract a majority of shareholders' votes with a view to making substantial
board and strategy changes at the next AGM.
As UBS has a market capitalisation of over SFr30bn, it would normally be
prohibitively expensive to accumulate enough votes for such a cause. But,
like many European companies, the bank has two classes of shares, bearer and
registered. They are issued in roughly equal numbers and each carries one
vote per share. But the registered shares have a par value only one-fifth of
that of the bearer shares, making them a cheap way to buy votes.
Theoretically, at today's market prices, an investor could buy all of the
22.25m registered shares, carrying 51 per cent of the votes, for some
SFr6bn. By contrast, the 21.3m bearer shares, which carry the other 49 per
cent of the votes, would cost more than SFr25bn.
Until recently, registered shares traded at an effective discount, in that
it cost less to buy five registered shares than it did to buy one bearer
share. This was because of rules prohibiting foreigners from voting with
them and preventing anyone from voting with more than 5 per cent of them.
These restrictions were intended to prevent UBS from a foreign takeover.
But this year the registered shares have traded at a growing premium,
trading at a price 40 per cent above one-fifth of the price of a bearer
share by late September. UBS directors suddenly realised they faced a
serious threat.
They called tomorrow's extraordinary general meeting to propose converting
all the registered shares into bearers on terms that would slash their
voting power to a level in line with the 17.3 per cent of capital they
contribute to the company. They offered no compensation for the collapse in
the premium on registered shares that would follow conversion. And they
declared that a two-thirds majority of all shares present at the meeting,
provided they represented more than 50 per cent of the capital, would be
sufficient to approve the motion.
Mr Ebner and other registered shareholders cried foul, arguing they should
be compensated for the loss of voting power and be able to vote separately
on a proposal to remove their rights.
UBS said that compensation could only come from money that belongs to all
shareholders, and so would invite legal action from aggrieved bearer
shareholders.
UBS would appear to have the more virtuous position to defend. Mr Robert
Studer, the chief executive, points out that the single share structure
would improve market liquidity and remove the danger that Mr Ebner and his
allies could take over control through a relatively small investment. 'He is
a raider. He wants to walk away with money. He is not interested in what
will happen to UBS in 10 years,' Mr Studer charged last week.
Mr Ebner says registered shares provide the only effective way for
shareholders to press the bank's board and management to perform better.
This is because a very large proportion of the shares can only be voted in
favour of the board.
A large proportion of UBS shares - over 40 per cent of those voted at the
last AGM - are held by Swiss banks for their clients. Swiss law provides
that, if the banks have a general power of attorney from their clients, as
most do, and receive no specific instructions to the contrary, they can only
vote these shares in favour of the board's resolutions.
Both sides have been clumsy and amateurish in their campaigns. Mr Studer
declared at one point that Mr Ebner's demand that the bank achieve a return
on equity of 15 per cent was 'ridiculous', only to be reminded that two
years ago he had given it as a target for the longer term. For his part, Mr
Ebner claimed UBS could fall into the hands of international drug dealers if
the protection against foreign takeovers provided by the registered shares
were lost.
Only later did he explain why he would not set out an alternative strategy
for UBS: strategy was a board decision; shareholders' responsibilities were
only to set the target return on equity, set incentives for top management,
and appoint directors to get on with it.
Most Swiss bankers and institutional shareholders are expected to support
UBS tomorrow because they do not want to offend the country's most powerful
bank or because they dislike Mr Ebner.
But the extraordinarily high volume of registered share trading - 11.6m last
month - reflects how many fund managers would rather sell than decide what
voting stance to take.
Both UBS and Mr Ebner accuse each other of buying big volumes of registered
shares, and both deny it. The truth is made more difficult to discern by the
potential for buying votes through futures contracts or borrowing shares
from custodians.
Mr Ebner says that, if he loses, he will immediately seek a court injunction
preventing conversion of the registered shares. Registered shareholders
would then retain their extra power for votes at the AGM in April, and the
UBS's decision to precipitate the current fight would have been in vain.
Mr Studer shrugs. 'Maybe we will have mobilised a few minds, sensitised a
few shareholders.'
Whatever the immediate outcome, shareholders in UBS and many big continental
companies are likely to be the ultimate winners. UBS directors have
belatedly realised Mr Ebner's demands for more rigorous management have a
lot of support among their widening shareholder base. Directors of other big
quoted Swiss and European companies would be unwise to ignore the message.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Personal View: Balanced ticket for business and greens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM YEO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The delicate balance of power between UK industry and its adversaries in the
green lobby may be on the point of being upset. A draft Bill establishing
the Environment Agency, which absorbs Her Majesty's Inspectorate of
Pollution (HMIP), the National Rivers Authority (NRA) and the waste
regulation functions of local authorities, contains a loosely worded clause
requiring the agency to take account of the costs and benefits of its
actions.
While the business community welcomes this as a recognition of reality,
others fear it opens the way for polluters to block moves to protect the
environment.
But even if the new agency's statutory role is weaker than many
environmentalists hoped, environment secretary John Gummer's claim that
there will be no place for busybodies may prove premature. Most of the
problems business faces in meeting environmental standards are not caused by
too tight a statutory definition of the duties of HMIP or the NRA. They
arise more often from ill-considered, or illogical, directives proposed by
the European Commission - and from the tendency of regulators to measure
their success mainly in terms of prosecutions.
The cost of waste disposal, for example, which industry and households alike
must bear, may rise substantially in the next few years. This will not be
because of the actions of any British regulator but because the European
landfill directive threatens the cheapest method of waste disposal in the
UK. The directive, which may be forced through despite British objections,
ignores the geological and other characteristics which make landfill more
acceptable in the UK than elsewhere in Europe.
Equally unnecessary is the burden imposed on British farmers by immediate
implementation of the nitrates directive. This enforces standards for
drinking water which have been arbitrarily chosen by Brussels in defiance of
World Health Organisation recommendations. No scientific or medical evidence
exists to support them and they are now belatedly being questioned by other
bureaucrats within the European Commission.
Since the Environment Agency's role will be to enforce standards but not to
set them, the deregulators should concentrate on persuading Britain's
European partners to measure environmental quality in the broadest sense. A
draft directive on integrated pollution controls is now under negotiation.
From the point of view of British industry it is crucial that the principle
of BATNEEC - best available technology not entailing excessive cost - should
be built into this directive.
This principle, already widely used by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of
Pollution, achieves a compromise between the needs of industry and the
demands of the greens. It provides a valuable safeguard for business against
the continental preference for rigid emission standards.
An agency strong enough to command the confidence of the more realistic
environmentalists could use the experience gained by HMIP for the benefit of
the environment while also protecting UK employers against meddlesome
bureaucracy and the ravages of Brussels. A constructive dialogue between the
agency and those whom it regulates should prevent the imposition by
over-zealous officials of burdens on business never intended by government
or legislators.
In any event, it is doubtful how far industry itself wants to water down the
aims of the environmental lobby. Unlike the extra costs to employers of the
Social Chapter, which simply destroys jobs by undermining the competitive
position of those companies which have to carry them, investment in higher
environmental standards can bring commercial advantages.
Customers, especially younger ones, may prefer products and services
supplied in an environmentally responsible way. Employees, particularly
those with scarce skills, are easier to retain when offered a good working
and living environment. From a national viewpoint, countries with high
environmental standards will attract investment in the high value-added
industries which we want our children and grandchildren to work in.
The challenge for both the agency and the pressure groups is to harness the
resurgence of interest in the environment and build on initiatives such as
the chemical industry's responsible care programme. Business must show
commitment to continuous environmental improvement, using systems capable of
being externally verified and promote more environmental reporting and
audit. In the long term, dilution of the agency's statutory role does little
for either business or the environment.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Leading Article: No bad thing for Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The outside world in general, and Britain and Northern Ireland in
particular, have been watching with some confusion and alarm as the Irish
government pulled itself apart over the past week. Just as the peace process
in Ireland offers a real chance of relief for the bombed and battered
population of the north, the coalition in Dublin appears to have collapsed
over what outsiders might regard as a domestic squabble.
It would be wrong, however, to dismiss the issues involved in the
disintegration of the Irish government, and the resignation of Mr Albert
Reynolds as prime minister and leader of Fianna Fail, the largest party, as
irrelevant to the peace process and the future of Ireland. Far from it. The
confrontation between Mr Dick Spring and his Labour party, on the one hand,
and Mr Reynolds' party on the other, has exposed some vital questions about
the democratic process in the Irish republic.
The first is whether the country can claim to be a genuinely secular state
while the Roman Catholic church continues to wield a pervasive influence in
political life, a subject of enormous concern to the northern Irish
protestant population. The second is the tradition of making blatantly
political appointments to the Irish judiciary. The third is the question of
accountability of politicians for their words and actions, an important
component in an open and flourishing democracy. On all of these concerns,
the Irish republic would appear to have emerged strengthened as a democratic
state from the events of the past week.
The confrontation in the coalition blew up over the insistence of Mr
Reynolds on nominating his friend and attorney-general, Mr Harry Whelehan,
as the next president of the High Court, the second highest judicial office
in the land. Mr Whelehan was already a highly controversial figure for his
role in seeking to prevent a 14-year-old rape victim from travelling to
Britain for an abortion. His obvious reluctance to extradite a
self-confessed paedophile priest to face charges in Northern Ireland
compounded the impression that he was unduly influenced by the most
conservative elements in the Catholic church.
The fact that both have now been forced to resign - and that their
resignation has been welcomed by the Irish population - suggests that the
trend towards a more secular state is growing, as is the pressure for clean
government. Both misled their cabinet colleagues and parliament, and both
have been held accountable.
Mr Spring now faces a tough decision whether to reform the coalition with
Fianna Fail under its new leader, Mr Bertie Ahern. On balance, he would
appear wise to do so, at least to bring minimum disruption to the peace
process. Mr Ahern has a good record as a successful negotiator and broker of
tough compromises as a trade union leader, and labour minister. Mr Spring
has proved some important points. Now the most crucial thing is to keep the
peace process on track.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Cacophony of calls on state burden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz's analysis of European competitiveness is
typically penetrating (Personal View, November 17), his assertion that 'with
the notable exception of Unice, nobody is talking about the size, cost and
burden of the state in Europe's economies' is astonishingly blinkered.
Many other business representative organisations, including chambers of
commerce, have been lobbying for years for deregulation, reduction in public
spending and withdrawal of the state.
National governments, similarly, have been pressing for deregulation,
following a trail blazed by the UK. Indeed in May, Kenneth Clarke, UK
chancellor, supported a call by Gunther Rexrodt, Germany's economic
minister, for deregulation.
Furthermore, at a European level, the Corfu summit established, under
Bernard Molitor, a group charged with putting forward proposals for lifting
the burden of legislation, while the Commission is establishing a standing
committee for administrative simplification.
Unice is no lone voice. There is a cacophony of calls for less burdensome
state that the Commission should not ignore.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Long distance lines: Move to expand the mobile phone market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Imagine a fleet of dirigibles - steerable airships - in the upper atmosphere
collecting and redirecting telephone calls around the world.
Implausible as it may sound, it was one option considered by Motorola, the
world's largest portable phone maker, in its search for ways to develop a
mobile phone service to extend from the wilds of Antarctica to the Kalahari
desert.
Motorola opted, instead, for satellites, and Iridium - the consortium it
leads - is now the front-runner in an expensive and technically complex race
that has been joined by seven consortia. What they envisage is a
high-quality service over low-cost pocket telephones offering calls at a
cost of Dollars 3 or less a minute and serving both cellular phone users and
those without access to cellular systems.
Cellular mobile phone services are well established in the developed world,
with 100m-200m cellular phones expected to be in use by 2000. But cellular
systems can only cover localised areas. Calls beyond their network must be
routed via earth-stations through geostationary satellites that hover some
22,000m above the Earth's surface, where, from the ground, they appear
stationary.
There are large areas of the world without access to the telephone
exchanges, lines, switching capacity and administrative capability to run
cellular phone services. Mobile phone users can still gain access to
geostationary satellites in these areas, using their own portable equipment
 -and the battlefield reports during the Gulf war bear witness to the
quality of such services. But the calls are expensive, at between Dollars 5
and Dollars 10 a minute, and the equipment needed to make and receive them
weighs more than a lap-top computer, fills a suitcase and costs Dollars
25,000.
The key to the new satellite services is advances in microelectronics which
have made it possible to cram an entire earth station, capable of
transmitting and receiving signals from up to 6,000 miles above the Earth's
surface, into a package no larger than a conventional pocket phone.
Iridium and its competitors, will launch low-earth orbit satellites (Leo)
that will circle the globe at a height of about 2,000km, and medium-earth
orbit satellites (Meo) at about 10,000km to handle the traffic.
Iridium has already built six of its planned 73 satellites and expects to
launch the first in 1997. Last week, Odyssey, a joint venture between TRW,
the US aerospace manufacturer, and Teleglobe, a Canadian telecommunications
operator, announced that they were joining the race. In addition,
Globalstar, developed by Loral and Qualcomm, Ellipsat, Constellation
Communications and American Mobile Satellite Corporation, are contenders
from North America.
These US contenders were last week submitting applications for the necessary
licences to the US Federal Communications Commission.
Between them, they will have to raise close to Dollars 10bn in debt and
equity. Only Iridium is so far fully subscribed; having raised Dollars 1.6bn
in equity, it is now looking for a further Dollars 1.8bn in loans. Odyssey,
the newcomer, which has a guaranteed Dollars 150m from TRW and Teleglobe, is
seeking a further Dollars 850m in equity and Dollars 1bn in loans.
Outside the US, only Inmarsat, a London-based, international consortium, has
announced plans to set up a global mobile phone network, called Project P. A
pioneer of satellite communications, Inmarsat first offered maritime voice
and data services, using a geostationary satellite system, in 1982. It now
provides satellite communications to some 40,000 customers in shipping and
aerospace.
Inmarsat's owners - leading telecommunications organisations in some 75
countries - have until December 16 to decide whether to put up the Dollars
1bn the organisation needs for the first phase of the Dollars 2.8bn Project
P.
Inmarsat, like the other consortia, plans to act as wholesaler, selling to
'customers' who will distribute the capacity worldwide. These distributors
are likely to be existing telecommunications companies such as Vodafone, the
UK cellular phone group, which will become Globalstar's franchisee for
countries where it operates cellular networks.
The service will still be more expensive than conventional mobile telephony
but the target customer is the global business traveller prepared to pay a
premium for a service that will be available anywhere. Other customers are
expected to include governments, small vessels, public and private emergency
services and users in areas suffering from poor communications.
Each consortia has its own, jealously guarded set of estimates on the likely
rewards from this market. Most calculations, however, are tied to the likely
population of mobile phones. Mr John Windolth, a spokesman for Iridium, says
that if the consortia had 1m subscribers for its voice service by 2002, 'We
would be very profitable'.
Mr Patrick McDougal, a spokesman for Inmarsat, believes its service could
break even within three years of its launch in 1999.
The technology used may prove significant in determining the price of the
service, with Iridium and Globalstar planning to use Leos and Odyssey and
Inmarsat planning to use Meos. Leo operators need more satellites to cover
the ground, but provide higher transmission quality. Meo operators promise
lowest cost and technological risk.
But adequate finance and management commitment are likely to prove far more
conclusive than earth orbits in sorting the winners from the losers. And the
only real certainty at present is that the rivalry between the consortia
will be intense. Analysts believe it is unlikely the market will be able to
support more than two competitive services by 2000.

FT  21 NOV 94 / In league with the table makers: John Authers analyses the
effects of ranking UK schools and other parts of the public sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
England's soccer managers have long known the harsh discipline of league
tables: if they underperform in the Carling Premiership or Endsleigh League,
punishment often swiftly follows. Tomorrow the heads of the UK's state
secondary schools face similar pressures, with the publication of
performance league tables that will be widely studied by parents, governors
and local education authorities.
The tables are part of a new culture sweeping the public sector. The
performance of managers in other parts of the public sector is also being
measured by a range of indicators designed to test their success in
delivering services.
Tomorrow's school league tables, the third set published in as many years,
are the most ambitious so far. They will include figures for exam
performance at GCSE (normally taken by 16-year-olds) and A-level (taken at
18), vocational qualifications, truancy rates and - for the first time -
details of how long children spend in lessons.
The exercise is part of the prime minister's Citizen's Charter campaign to
improve the quality of public services. Mr John Major believes that poor
performers exposed by comparative statistics will be compelled to improve,
even if it is difficult for their customers to go elsewhere for service.
In the health service, hospital league tables were published for the first
time in June this year. They revealed wide variations in speed of service:
in general surgery, for example, 88 per cent of patients were admitted to
hospital within three months at the Dorset Healthcare Trust; at the
Kidderminster Healthcare trust, 24 per cent had still not been admitted
after a year.
Doctors complained that the indicators were crude, telling patients nothing
about the quality of medical care they would receive. But Mrs Virginia
Bottomley, the health secretary, was unrepentant: 'Information is a spur to
improvement,' she said.
Next spring will see the most ambitious league table exercise yet, when the
Audit Commission, the local government watchdog, publishes tables for the
449 local authorities in England and Wales. These will use 70 separate
measures to compare performance across all the main local services.
Residents will be able to find out how quickly their council answers the
telephone or how long it takes to complete council house repairs. The same
exercise will also provide statistics on law and order, such as the speed
with which emergency 999 calls are answered, and how many complaints are
made against the police.
Mr Andrew Foster, controller of the Audit Commission, has already decided
not to publish all 60,000 separate items of information - more than appears
in a typical UK telephone directory. However, edited comparative statistics
will be available next year.
Mr Foster believes that the decision to measure performance drives up
standards, even before comparisons are published. Including promptness in
answering mail and telephone calls in the local authority league tables, for
example, required councils to set targets, and measure how often they were
attained.
These targets, published in June without mention of whether authorities were
meeting them, revealed disparities in the tasks authorities were setting
themselves. Surrey County Council had aimed to answer calls within 60
seconds, but when it saw that this was far out of line with the rest it cut
its target to 20 seconds.
The Audit Commission has consulted local government officers closely in
choosing the performance indicators, avoiding the confrontational approach
adopted by education ministers when setting up school league tables.
Mr Foster justifies this by saying that acceptance of the validity of the
indicators is important if they are to influence managers' behaviour. 'If
practitioners can rubbish our methods, then all the work we've put in is of
little value. We can't afford to let our credibility about the nature of the
data or the methodology be impugned.'
In contrast, the launch of the first education league tables in 1992 was
marred by inaccuracies in the data. For example, schools that pooled their
A-level results in consortia were not credited with any A-levels at all.
Newspaper headlines concentrated on the inadequacies of the government's
information, rather than shortfalls in particular schools' performance,
dulling the impact of the tables.
Even though the data in school league tables are now more accurate,
controversy over the choice of performance indicators persists. Teachers,
backed by academic opinion, claim it is misleading to judge schools by exam
results alone. They say the most important factor in determining a pupil's
ultimate examination performance is the level of achievement he or she had
reached when starting at the school.
Publishing exam results in isolation inevitably shows schools with selective
intakes performing best, the critics add. They would prefer to see league
tables reflecting how well schools perform with the children they take in.
Supporters of such 'value-added' tables fall into two camps. First are those
who want tables to take account of social deprivation, which clearly
correlates with poor exam results.
The four least deprived local authorities in England (measured by the
government's educational needs index) are the Scilly Isles, North Yorkshire,
Surrey and West Sussex. They came in the top six in the GCSE results league
table last year. In contrast, six of the 10 most deprived authorities - the
London boroughs of Hackney, Newham, Lambeth, Islington, Southwark and Tower
Hamlets - were in the bottom 10 for GCSE results.
However, Labour politicians, who oppose the current 'raw' league tables, are
nervous about producing tables based on social backgrounds. They fear that
this could institutionalise low expectations in deprived areas.
They fall into the second camp, which wants to explore value-added measures
using academic progress. This would test children at 11 and 16, and see
whether they improved by more or less than the average.
The problem is that national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds will become
compulsory only at the end of this school year. Many local authorities
abandoned their own tests of 11-year-olds when the national tests were
announced. Reliable 'value-added' tables for secondary schools might
therefore be five years away.
But even the 'raw' tables derided by teachers appear to have improved
performance. Last year 41.1 per cent of 15-16-year-olds in England gained
five GCSE passes at grades A to C, up from 38.1 per cent in 1992 when the
league tables were first published. Sharp improvements in A-level results
have also been recorded by independent schools since newspapers started
publishing their own tables in 1990.
League tables seem to have had consequences for headteachers. In the private
sector, turnover of heads has roughly doubled in the past decade, with many
facing angry governors' meetings if their schools slip in the tables.
Two years ago, parents even forced the resignation of the high mistress of
St Paul's Girls' School in London - never outside the top 10 in the country
according to the Financial Times's own ranking - because they did not like
her policy of reducing the number of GCSEs which girls took. Football
managers will recognise the phenomenon.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Case against minimum wage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GRAHAM MACKENZIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr John Monks (Letters, November 15) refers to a recent Engineering
Employers' Federation, survey which found almost 40 per cent of respondents
in favour of a statutory national minimum wage. The full survey reveals a
rather different view.
More than half of the respondents opposed a statutory minimum wage. Forty
eight per cent of the same sample thought that a minimum wage would increase
unemployment, while only 8 per cent thought it would cut unemployment.
While the EEF wants a prosperous economy with high levels of pay this can
only be achieved through productivity and innovation, not by statutory
imposition of employment conditions.
The EEF, therefore, cannot be party to a consensus in favour of a
statutorily-imposed national minimum wage.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK seeking coherence in European
defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JONATHAN EYAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ian Davidson is correct in arguing ('Conflict of interest', November
16) that the US decision to withdraw from the enforcement of the arms
embargo on Bosnia should force the Europeans to look much more seriously at
their own defence structure. Yet he is wrong to suggest that Britain
advocates a 'loose, floppy, amoeba-like' security arrangement for the
continent.
The creation of a European defence identity depends on deeds, not just
vision or words; it ultimately requires increased military budgets,
something which no member state, with the notable exception of France, is
willing to contemplate.
The Eurocorps structure established by France and Germany has just managed
to work out joint emblems, command languages and the food served to its
soldiers; in short, everything necessary for a parade on the boulevards of
Paris, rather than actual fighting. And the Western European Union,
presented as the EU's budding military arm, consisted until recently of
little more than a few bureaucrats and some filing cabinets In transit
between London and Brussels. Faced with this reality, the British position
was that nothing should be done to supplant Nato as the alliance which has
both the means and the command structure necessary for any serious military
task. Davidson's 'amoeba-like organisms' swim in the murky waters of the
Balkans, where all current institutions piled in, and achieved nothing in
particular.
Far from seeking to place spanners in the works, the British government is
now actively pushing for a more coherent European defence arrangement. At
the weekend Franco-British summit the two countries created a combined air
force group explicitly designed to capitalise on the experience gained in
Bosnia. Britain is also working to enshrine the mechanisms by which Europe
could use US military equipment in future crises.
London's stance is no longer dictated by some wistful hankering for a
'special relationship' with the Americans: this was shattered by President
Bill Clinton fairly early on in his presidency. Instead, the British
behaviour is governed by a perfectly logical assumption that the security
structures currently touted for the continent must be real in order to be
credible. But perhaps your correspondent is right after all: bashing Britain
in every article on European affairs is much more predictable and tidy than
setting out a host of complicated arguments.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: CrossRail decision a joint one
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEOFF MAYNARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Yes, we are looking to recruit a new chief executive who can make a
valuable contribution to our thinking on the need to establish an entity
appealing to the private sector and separate from the three promoters of
CrossRail, the proposed east-west cross-London rail link ('CrossRail team
plans to split from partners', November 18).
The decision on the form of any separate entity, however, will not be down
to the new chief executive as you suggest; the decision will be a matter for
the government as shareholder, in consultation with the promoters, London
Underground, British Rail and Railtrack.
In reporting our conversation, your correspondent has taken two thoughts out
of context. The way CrossRail is eventually developed for the benefit of
London and the south-east region will in large measure depend on the views
of the private sector, since it is the private sector that will be providing
a substantial part of the finance needed.
The step change in journey experience and scale of resulting benefits for
London can only result from the introduction of a project such as CrossRail
 -just as has been experienced with cross capital RER services in Paris.
Some people have suggested that the same result can instead be achieved by
upgrading parts of the existing underground network. But all of our research
with London Underground shows that such measures do not produce a viable
alternative to CrossRail.
Maintaining and improving the existing rail networks is essential anyway.

Sir, Lex queried ('Growing companies', November 16) whether there is a need
for the Alternative Investment Market and for the planned pan-European
market, Easdaq.
Without further information on the latter, it is difficult to judge whether
Easdaq might be necessary; but I think that, for the most part, the stock
exchange's proposals for the AIM are well-balanced, and that there is a need
for this particular market.
Might I suggest that critics of the AIM keep a low profile and give the new
market a fair chance?

Cracker's new three-part story, Men Should Weep, starts tonight (9pm, ITV).
The shrink with a drink is superlatively well played by Robbie Coltrane,
proving the old axiom that stand-up comedy is the best training for a
serious actor. The mood is uncompromisingly dour, from the unlovely Mersey
accents to the unlovely attitudes of some convincingly nasty coppers, given
to such bibulous pleasantries as 'You're twisted and you're a pairvairt and
you'll make a blody good policeman.' A warning: there are two rapes in
tonight's episode.
Light relief from the Fourth Estate in C4's Cutting Edge: Absolutely Marie
Claire (9pm) which takes an unflinching look at a glossy woman's magazine.
Otherwise, apart from Martin Chuzzlewit (9.30pm, BBC2), dreariness abounds.
Barry Norman's blowsy autopilot chirpiness in Film 94 is now tawdry enough
to be camply cultish (11.05 BBC1). And a Late Show special, Forgotten Land -
Tales from Albania (11.15pm BBC2), describes a poverty-stricken country
seeking a cultural identity.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Arts: Of elegance and mild subversion / Review of plays at
the never-timid Glasgow Citizens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Glasgow Citizens Theatre has a feel like no other theatre in Britain,
but a feel that is a lot like the rest of Glasgow: lively, fashionable,
unaristocratic, outgoing, and mildly subversive. The foyer alone has a
unique blend of vitality and elegance. But the real excitement derives from
the stage. Stages, rather; for the Citz, since 1992, has housed not one
theatre but three. Repertory is adventurous, productions imaginative. I have
had bad evenings there (few), but not timid ones.
Recently, Philip Prowse brought together Rupert Everett and four other
actors to perform both Noel Coward's Private Lives and (joined by three more
actors) Tennessee Williams's The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore.
Prowse is a style merchant; you could never watch a Prowse production and
forget that someone had staged it. For these two, his stage was black and
white, with a few other very strong colours (like shocking pink); the maid
in either play is acted by a man; both plays are set in the present day; and
the already stylised parlance of the leading characters is stylised more
intensely. But the actors are stimulated by swapping between two such
dissimilar vehicles, and the plays are alive. Both were far more brisk,
funny, and fresh, than Prowse's current West End Lady Windermere's Fan.
No one went further in swapping roles than Everett. Remarkably, in neither
role did he fully reveal his most bankable asset - his film-star looks. In
both, he seemed to be in disguise, and each disguise was riveting,
entertaining, surprising. In The Milk Train, he was the dying ex-beauty
Flora Goforth; in Private Lives, he played Victor, Amanda's humourless new
husband, created in 1930 by Laurence Olivier. His Victor was a deliberately
two-dimensional romp, played with a crusty Prince Charles accent and thick
specs. I prefer Coward played 3-D, but Everett's cartoon creation was a load
of fun. His Flora, however, was one of those rare travesty performances
where a man uses his physical and vocal force not to distort a female
character but to intensify it.
Everett has large-scale authority onstage. He can command both superficial
languor and underlying hysteria, and he uses the full long-limbed physique
to great effect. I know that everyone is playing Hamlet these days, but
might not Everett reveal more in the role than most?
Flora Goforth, in The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore, is one of
Tennessee Williams's monstrous regiment. She is trying to finish the memoirs
of her racy life while only half admitting that her death is nigh; she is
mysteriously visited by Chris, a younger if not young man, a dark angel who
prepares her, as he has apparently prepared sundry other women of her
international circle, to meet death with a good grace; and meanwhile her
time is wasted by another chatty virago, 'the Witch of Capri' (splendidly
performed by Georgina Hale). All Flora thinks about is life; she even keeps
contemplating Chris as a potential lover.
Williams believed 'the play will come off better the further it is removed
from conventional theatre', and Prowse surrounded it with various kinds of
artifice. Whenever Flora uttered 'a good line', it was followed by instant
(taped) applause, in which he briefly revelled - before suddenly cutting it
dead with a gesture. Prowse also upped the homo element in the supporting
roles. You can imagine the new connotations this gave a play that was
already a meditation on the loves and life that are past, and the death that
approaches all too fast. And yet the effect made the play not morbid but
bracing.
Private Lives, though in modern dress, was presented by Prowse as the
brittle retreat into escapism that it indeed is. 'Jagged with
sophistication' was the style. Greg Hicks was the harshest Elyot I have ever
seen, with his cut-the-crap angry drawl; and his characterisation was
three-dimensional enough to set the tone for the whole production. The rest
were slightly more cartoon-like, but no less vivid. Sophie Ward, with her
Grace Kelly looks, was a robust, blasee, vituperative Amanda, and Victoria
Scarborough an amusingly doll-like Sibyl. It was astonishing how often the
cast charged past surefire laugh-lines but revealed the comedy elsewhere.
This Private Lives was all the more refreshing because it made no attempt to
be definitive.
Meanwhile, in the Stalls Studio, Antony McDonald's staging of Gertrude Stein
turns out to be nine plays and a recipe by the great American avant-garde
writer. Caesar kisses every night. Lucrezia Borgia had no cousins. Three
sisters who are not sisters. To hear Gertrude Stein is, at first, to plunge
into nonsense, and she sounds like Lewis Carroll's daughter and heir. Yet
the words never lose their sense. The opposite, rather. Stein sounds
wonderful, but she never employs words for sound alone. Listening, we are
unusually aware of the meanings of each word - often she recycles sentences,
with slight variations, to extract maximum ambiguity from them - and it is
the fact that we understand that makes us so deliciously baffled.
McDonald, one of the most original designer-directors on the British scene,
fills the stage with a little cartoon house and its solid, tilted, wooden
shadow on the floor. Four microphones hang from the ceiling, into which the
five actors sometimes speak. But, wherever we hear the voices coming from,
we are never in doubt that this is live theatre. Two of the cast are
outstanding: Paola Dionisotti and Siobhan Stanley. Dionisotti's wonted
vigour and economy pay great dividends here. Stanley has wit, elegance,
mordancy, pathos, stillness, and perpetual ambiguity. I would like to see
her now in a single large role. In Stein, she perfectly leads us into the
mesmerising rings and enigmas of the language.
Gertrude Stein is in repertory at the Citizens Stalls Studio, Glasgow, until
December 3.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Arts: Gloria - the sweet and sour porker / Huddersfield
Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Though it may seem an improbable place to anyone who never ventures north of
Watford, Huddersfield has boasted Britain's pre-eminent festival of
contemporary music for many years now. This year's festival, both
wide-ranging and intensive - for as usual it highlights particular
composers, by way of supplying focus - is unusually rich, and it has
something special to celebrate: a new theatre.
Since the old Victorian Theatre Royal was demolished more than 30 years ago,
Huddersfield has had none. In the new Lawrence Batley Theatre, constructed
within an elegant 1819 building which used to be a huge chapel, the town now
has just what it needed, and so does the festival. The interior is trim,
airy, acoustically excellent, comfortable to sit in (it holds an audience of
about 475 people), and pleasing to behold. For good measure there is a
smaller studio theatre, too. The festival is eagerly making plans for at
least one contemporary opera per year.
The inaugural choice was HK Gruber's Gloria, 'a pigtale' - Gloria von
Jaxtberg in the original German, but this porcine comedy-fable has been
transferred in Amanda Holden's bright translation to the Pennines. Not,
however, the staging, which is a co-production with Opera North and the Big
Bang Theatre Munich; it was Helmut Danninger of the latter company who first
wanted the opera from Gruber, and he has directed it as for the Bavarian
audience who will soon see it at their Volksoper. That, I think, has proved
a mixed blessing.
The story is sour-sweet and simple. Gloria, the prettiest pig around, is
rejected by her jealous sty-family, but dreams of a handsome prince who will
find her. Never having learned the meaning of 'sausages', she mistakes the
farmhand who comes to lead her to the slaughter for her romantic saviour;
there is a nick-of-time rescue. All the roles are taken by five singers, and
the curious little band consists of seven players doubling on various wind
and percussion instruments, a harpist and a single violin (rather a virtuoso
part).
The composer draws bracing, racketty, quirky sounds from his orchestra.
Superficially there are plain echoes of Kurt Weill, but Gruber's off-centre
basses, cunningly irregular rhythms and cross-tonal tricks are very much his
own. There is grateful music for the singers, though - in this account, at
least - with less lyrical glow than in his splendid concerti. After two
hearings, I still think that Danninger's production and Marc Deggeller's
designs do the singers no favours, not at any rate for a staging in Britain.
Despite the transposition to the Pennines, with suitable local references,
the costumes are cod-Bavarian and mostly in shiny black and white plastic.
In fact pigs and farmhands alike look to a British eye like German fashion
victims (not to put too fine a point on it), poor, pretty Gloria as much as
the rest. The gestures and movements visited upon the hard-working actors
are of a mock-naive archness that recalls the worst of children's
television, as do the sets. Character is barely sketched, because everyone
is kept so busy hopping, waving and laboriously shifting extraneous props.
One can imagine Gloria in a far crisper, wittier production, and some day we
must hope to see one. Mary Hegarty's sweetly vacuous heroine has her
moments, and the other Opera North singers work hard. Stefan Asbury conducts
an excellent band very efficiently.
Among several concerts on Saturday - the Huddersfield programming is always
generous - two stood out. The Danish Wind Quintet, wonderfully cultivated
players, delivered very early, faded Henze, but also wistful Hans Abrahamsen
(their compatriot), three evocative Jonathan Harvey fragments from 1978 and
a sort of vaudeville by another Dane, Mogens Winkel Holm. The real discovery
was an 'Eichendorff-quintett' by Gruber's colleague Kurt Schwertsik, tiny
pieces after single lines by that poet: every one odd, magically expressive
and perfectly musical.
That evening brought the Cambridge New Music Players, conducted by Paul
Hoskins, who confirmed their rapidly growing reputation. Besides early,
pungent Maxwell Davies (Antechrist) and recent chips from the workbench of
Harrison Birtwistle ('Songs by Myself', all with a sullen gleam), there were
several young Cambridge products of varying promise. Far and away the most
striking was Living Toys by Thomas Ades, tingling, brilliantly intricate and
fascinating - just as Max Loppert reported here several months ago. A lot of
people are watching the progress of young Ades's career with avid interest;
some others, no doubt, with envy too.
Festival continues until 27 November (Festival office 0484-425082); Gloria
visits Newcastle, Aldeburgh and Leicester before reaching the Queen
Elizabeth Hall on December 8

FT  21 NOV 94 / People: The faceless crime boss who is all too real - This
well-educated, well-spoken, cosmopolitan businessman is laughing all the way
to the bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While officials and ministers from more than 120 countries meet today in
Naples at the start of a UN conference on organised international crime,
many a big-time crook will be laughing all the way to the bank.
As Liliano Ferraro, a senior official with Italy's ministry of justice,
commented last week: 'The organised crime syndicates have already held this
kind of meeting . . . they just meet in a hotel in eastern Europe and divide
the profits.'
It has taken the Italians more than five years to generate sufficient
interest among UN member states even to talk about the subject. And that,
according to the organisers, is probably all they'll do in the Palazzo Real.
Attempts at improving international co-operation on law enforcement remain
hampered by a combination of political rivalries, jealously guarded national
legal systems, official corruption - and rank inefficiency.
In contrast, the organised international criminal fraternity has become
increasingly sophisticated; it is adept at extending its operations across
frontiers, establishing areas of common interest, and manipulating the
world's economic system for hugely lucrative ends.
'International organised criminals have learnt to outwit law enforcement
agencies,' says James Wyburd, an investigator with MRC Business Information
Group.
In the words of John Kerry, a US senator, these global mobsters cause so
much trouble that they are 'the new communism, the new monolithic threat'.
Who are they?
The really big boys are pretty far removed from his-tory's, and Hollywood's,
gangster self-publicist: Alphonse Capone, better known as Al - the man whom
the American crime writer Jay Robert Nash describes as 'a near illiterate
who acquired millions and knew not where to spend a dime of it'. Capone died
of syphilis and paresis of the brain. In the words of one of his gang: 'Al's
brain just exploded.'
Times have changed. Eduardo Vetere, a former professor in law who heads the
UN's anti-crime branch, based in Vienna, says: 'Today's big-time criminals
are more serious and dangerous than Capone ever was. The world has become
smaller, while the criminals have become bigger. It's a global village, in
which crime in one country is easily transferred to others.'
There is no one better to ask about old- and new-time crooks than Mike
Cherkasky. An employee of Kroll Associates, one of the world's leading
private corporate spook agencies, Cherkasky is a former New York attorney's
investigator who helped convict John Gotti, boss of the American mafia, in
1992, and was a prominent investigator in the BCCI case. Cherkasky now helps
supervise one of New York's garbage collection services, once the preserve
of the mob.
'The mob - blue-collar criminals like Gotti - may have worn Armani suits and
cashmere coats, but they used their fists to get to the top,' he says. 'They
had no choice. There's a different kind of corporate criminal around now. He
is a cosmopolitan businessman, well-educated, well-spoken, who knows how to
move among politicians and transfer his money from Wall Street to London to
Paris and onwards if he wants to. He has plenty of opportunities, but greed
makes him take the criminal route.'
The world's leading organised criminals do not give interviews bragging
about their activities, as Capone did, daily, to the Chicago press. The
meanest use journalists for target practice if they get anywhere near.
Behind today's organised criminal lies a veritable machine of hardware and
hard men which makes Capone's hoods look like chocolate soldiers.
Perhaps the most colourful prototype of the new international gangster was
Pablo Escobar, a collector of giraffes, camels, beautiful women and classic
cars, including Capone's Pontiac. Colombia's drug baron turned the smuggling
of cocaine into the world's biggest money-spinning bootleg operation. His
ability to bribe and corrupt officials went far beyond his home town of
Medellin, where he is believed to have authorised payments of Dollars 1m per
day to keep himself out of jail.
Escobar had a private army of 1,000 armed with state-of-the-art military
hardware, and an A-team of lawyers well-versed in the art of laundering his
ill-gotten gains through the world's (mainly off-shore) financial centres.
Escobar was shot dead almost a year ago by the Colombian army, supported by
the CIA, the US air force and the US drug enforcement agency. Yet he might
have escaped had it not been for rival drug barons turning against him.
Next to the Colombian boys, it is the emerging criminal fraternity in
eastern Europe which is likely to cause most worry at this week's
conference. In a background paper to the conference, the UN's anti-crime
division does not mince words when it comes to the new Russian mafia.
'Roubles as well as smuggled arms and valuable metals worth billions of
dollars leave the country in an unregulated fashion each month, while there
is a substantial inflow of black and grey money,' the anti-crime squad
states.
The criminal fraternity includes blue-collar villains not so different from
the one-time Chicago mobsters. But at his most sophisticated, the eastern
European criminal bribes officials, terrorises western businessman,
manipulates the banking system, launders money around the west with front
companies and exchange control fiddles, and engages in such transnational
activities as prostitution, drugs smuggling and arms trading.
Only last week a nuclear power plant was temporarily shut in Lithuania
because of 'terrorist' threats.
The Naples conference is a gesture fitting in a city of magic and death. But
that is all it is: a symbol.

FT  21 NOV 94 / People (Names in the News): Zarella - GM's ray of hope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In its efforts to rebuild its battered US auto business, General Motors has
turned to a man who knows a lot about contact lenses and sunglasses, writes
Richard Waters.
In a rare move, the car and truck-maker last week turned outside to pick a
new head of marketing for its core north American operations. Ronald Zarella
had been the number two executive at Bausch &amp; Lomb, manufacturer of trendy
Ray-Ban sunglasses.
Jack Smith, GM's chief executive, says the automaker was drawn to Zarella by
his 'enormous multifunctional experience and global brand-building
expertise'. Despite the overblown rhetoric, this may not be far from the
mark: Zarella, 45, has an engineering degree as well as an MBA, and spent
the early part of his career in engineering and manufacturing jobs. That is
no bad thing, given that in future he will have to negotiate with GM
engineers over the specifications of new vehicles for the US market.
The brand-building came in Bausch &amp; Lomb's international division, whose
sales jumped from Dollars 140m to Dollars 850m in the five years under
Zarella's control.
GM will hope he can rustle up the same magic for its own products, which
include venerable but hardly trend-setting names like Chevrolet, Cadillac
and Oldsmobile; it has lost ground to family sedans like Ford's Taurus and
sport-utility vehicles like Chrysler's Jeep.
Zarella says his job involves 'better defining customer segments', then
creating and selling products for each. Sounds easy? For GM, whose share of
the US market has slipped to 33.2 per cent, it has proved anything but.

FT  21 NOV 94 / People (Names in the News): Champalimaud empire restored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Antonio Champalimaud, the 76-year-old Portuguese entrepreneur who last week
bought back another part of the business empire wrested from him after the
revolution of 1974, is admired and abominated with equal fervour, writes
Peter Wise.
He has been both lauded as 'Portugal's greatest industrialist' and loathed
as an incarnation of capitalist exploitation. During the Salazar-Caetano
dictatorship, he was estimated to control two-thirds of Portugal's
industrial capacity. Starting with an inherited cement company, he moved
into steel, banking and insurance.
Making a fortune was easy the first time round in an economy protected from
outside competition and benefiting from captive colonial markets. But
Champalimaud, whose blunt, autocratic style leaves few people indifferent,
believes he has proved his worth as an entrepreneur by rebuilding the group
that was seized from him by a short-lived Communist-leaning government. Last
week he paid Es37.3bn (Pounds 5.74bn) to regain control of Banco Pinto e
Sotto Mayor, Portugal's sixth largest bank. He had already bought back the
insurance company Mundial Confianca in 1992.
Champalimaud once put in a claim for more than Es1000bn in compensation for
the nationalisation of his assets but has received only a small fraction of
that amount. Instead, he is buying back his Portuguese companies, through a
reprivatisation programme begun in 1989, with earnings from Brazil, where he
fled in 1975 and built an extensive business centred on cement and
livestock.
After years in the wilderness, Champalimaud is indisputably back at the top.
Portugal's Fortuna magazine ranks him as by far the country's richest
individual, with a personal net worth estimated at Es170bn. But he admits
Portugal is too small for him and is not expected to make any more important
re-acquisitions. He remains in Brazil, leaving the day-to-day management of
the family's Portuguese interests to his son Luis, chairman of Mundial
Confianca.

FT  21 NOV 94 / People (Names in the News): Abdellatif takes over from Saudi
at ABC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Ahmed Abdellatif, managing director of Riyad Bank, Saudi Arabia's
second largest, takes the helm of Arab Banking Corporation next year,
bankers expect a period of consolidation rather than revolution from the
former deputy governor of Sama, the Saudi central bank, writes Mark
Nicholson.
Abdellatif, 59, who will become ABC's chief executive once Riyad Bank has
replaced him, is a very different figure from Abdullah Saudi, ABC's founder.
Saudi, who quit last month after 14 years in charge, is credited with
turning the Bahrain-based offshore banking unit into one of the biggest
banks in the Middle East with offshoots in Europe and Asia.
But Saudi, despite his name, is a former Libyan central banker, and it is
widely felt that his nationality was the primary reason for his resignation.
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, who with Libya are the chief
shareholders in the bank, were concerned that Saudi's Libyan connections
might lead the US to freeze the bank's assets.
Abdellatif, by contrast, is a friendly, sure-footed Saudi who was plucked
out of his country's central bank to revive the fortunes of Riyad Bank, an
underperforming giant which had never made the most of its influential
shareholders and solid capital base. He is credited with doing a good job
but as an ex-central banker he is not expected to match Saudi's
entrepreneurial management style.
Another sign of the increasing Saudi Arabian influence is the appointment of
Sheikh Khalid Ali Alturki, who has taken over from Saudi as chairman of ABC
International Bank, the group's London-
based subsidiary. Sheikh Khaled, a leading businessman in Saudi Arabia's
Eastern Province, has been a director of ABC since 1992 and was founder
director of Saudi American Bank, the Riyadh-based joint venture bank of
which Citibank is a leading shareholder. Some Western observers had expected
Stanislas Yassukovich, the deputy chairman, to replace Saudi.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Architecture: Designed to work - Colin Amery discusses the
future for offices and factories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Major industrial companies often find themselves with an embarrassment of
old buildings that have outlived their purpose and would be wasted if they
could not be modernised. This is a special problem in Britain, where the
first industrial revolution began and where the pace of industrial change
quickly outstripped the usefulness of old plant.
The changes that automation brought to heavy industry represent only one
aspect of the evolution of working patterns in the late 20th century, for
advances in computerisation and information technology have only just
started to change the way Britons work in offices.
The future shape and design of offices and factories is far from clear, and
it is to architects that we must look as innovators and leaders of the
design revolution.
Last week saw the annual Office of the Year award, sponsored by the British
Institute of Facilities Management and Du Pont (UK). Memorably, the judges
described the office building as the 'all too immovable object' in any
company's portfolio of assets.
It is clear that the development of office design in Britain has improved
considerably even during the recession, and one area of noteworthy
improvement has been the involvement of the workforce in the process.
Consultation between architect and client is the key to successful design,
and it is vital that discussion about the working environment occurs
throughout any organisation.
Simple facts emerge with startling clarity when architects take the time to
ask questions. Underwriters, for example, would be a happier breed if Sir
Richard Rogers had let them see out of and open windows in the Lloyd's
building in the City of London. Air-conditioning and the regular but
scarcely discernible flicker of a flourescent tube often cause headaches or,
at the very least, a sense of edgy imprisonment for employees.
It is the feeling that office workers have no control over their working
environment that causes unhappiness. Architects hate to see the mass of
pin-ups and technicolour photographs of children, wives and mistresses that
adorns most work-stations. But this reaction is an overly purist one, and
indicates a wish to conceal anything that might reveal that life itself is
not particularly well designed.
It is fascinating that recent surveys by estate agents in London have
confirmed what we have known for a long time - that people prefer to be able
to open windows, see the world and breathe real air even if it is a bit
noisy and polluted. Fashion plays its part: it was not so long ago that
office builders and developers were equally convinced that workers preferred
the 'deep plan' with sealed windows and little access to views of the
outside world.
Of course, in reality it is more likely to be the enormous expense of
running and maintaining air-conditioning plant that will dictate a return to
a more natural and less profligate office environment.
The winner of the Office of the Year award, rather surprisingly, was a huge
purpose-built complex for Lloyd's Bank: Canons House, on an 11-acre site in
the dockland area of Bristol. Nealy 1,500 people work in this building,
handling retail banking business. The building was designed by Arup
Associates. It has a distinctive classical architectural look on the outside
but comprises conventional energy-saving office spaces on the inside.
A more interesting proposition was the offices of Hamilton Oil in London,
where the company has faced a problem common to many companies - the
conversion and upgrading of an existing and inadequate building. Hamilton
occupies part of Devonshire House in Piccadilly, a mid-20th century office
building. Inside it is a forest of structural columns; outside, there is
ancient fenestration that needed replacing. Traffic noise in central London
was also a problem in a building that faces on to Piccadilly.
Boots, in turn, is a company that should be glowing - in its case for a
highly successful and innovative treatment of one of its large industrial
plants near Nottingham. One of its factories on the site at Beeston was a
pioneer when it opened in 1933. In fact, it was seen by English Heritage as
a building of such historical and architectural importance that it gave it
that mixed blessing, a Grade I listing. This is an extremely rare
distinction for an industrial plant, and acknowledges the importance of the
design by Sir Owen Williams, which has been described as 'a milestone in
concrete architecture in Britain.'
The factory has been in continuous operation since 1933, and was designed to
allow a complete production process to flow north to south along the length
of the building. Owen Williams' design was highly innovative for the 1930s.
The production line dictated the length of the plant, and the need for as
much natural light as possible produced the design of a concrete roof with
150,000 glass discs. There are heating tubes in the glass walls to prevent
condensation (something that has not yet reached the average British
bathroom mirror), and cantilevered roofs offer loading bays as large as 28ft
with no supports.
Boots is to be commended for successfully carrying out a three-year, Pounds
20m renovation of this listed industrial masterpiece. The company has proved
that a building that is well designed for a specific purpose in the first
place, and takes account of basic needs for light and air, has a life far
beyond that of a property developer's speculative, low-cost offering.
The future for the design of places of work depends on the rate of
technological change. But the recent office awards, and the experience of
Boots, show that companies should look to good designers from the start,
because that is the way to ensure long life and flexible usage in return for
substantial investment.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Media Futures: Elvis found in cyberspace - Digital jukeboxes
are set to have a big impact on the music industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was almost exactly a year ago that Rob Lord and Jeff Patterson, a couple
of Californian computer science students, launched their digital jukebox,
IUMA, alias the Internet Underground Music Archive.
IUMA has since used the Internet to send samples of alternative rock music
everywhere, from Arizona to Australia. It charges each band of musicians
Dollars 20 to Dollars 75. Listeners tune in for free. All they need is
access to the Internet to download the music on to their computer sound
cards before transfering it to an ordinary cassette.
Lord and Patterson are cyber-buffs who used their skills and a Dollars
20,000 computer system to reach out to fellow music fans. Their concept has
since been copied by hundreds of other digital jukeboxes all over the world,
and is attracting the attention of the multinationals that dominate the
Dollars 30.4bn music industry. The major record companies now recognise that
digital diffusion is a serious phenomenon that will, eventually, account for
a significant chunk of music distribution. What they do not know is how
quickly it will take off - or how to approach it.
'We're working in the dark,' says Sara John, director of legal affairs for
the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in London. 'There's no doubt that at
some stage digital diffusion will become a major part of the music market.
My personal opinion is that it could happen very, very quickly.'
At present the industry is in the unenviable position of not knowing whether
digital diffusion is a golden opportunity to boost profits, or a threat to
its financial stability. The global music market is dominated by six
companies - Sony, Time Warner, Matsushita, Bertelsmann, Thorn-EMI and
Polygram.
If a compact disc sells for Pounds 12.99 in the UK, the artist earns 88p,
the producer 44p, the publisher 44p and the manufacturer Pounds 1.05. The
retailer takes Pounds 3.25 and the record company Pounds 4.66 (mostly to
cover distribution costs), leaving Pounds 2.27 for VAT.
This means that if a record company can deliver a compact disc directly to
the consumer's home, it will save the chunk of the Pounds 4.66 previously
spent on distributing it to the record shop and the retailer's Pounds 3.25.
In short, it will be able to sell the same product for the same price much
more profitably.
Such calculations have encouraged the major groups to dabble in digital
diffusion. Warner Bros, part of the Time Warner group, now offers on-line
access to some of its recordings through America Online and CompuServe, the
US on-line services.
Geffen Records, a Matsushita subsidiary, also releases material on
CompuServe. This summer it became the first major record company to produce
a CD-Rom game. Geffen joined with Jasmine Multimedia, a small Californian
software house, to create Vid Grid, a visual jigsaw that enables the user to
assemble videos from artistes including Red Hot Chili Peppers, Aerosmith and
Jimi Hendrix.
These projects are still seen as experiments. The current generation of
on-line music services is not sophisticated enough for mainstream use. It
can take as long as 15 minutes to download a three-minute song from IUMA on
the Internet. The sound quality is patchy (more like FM radio than compact
disc) and the visuals limited to black and white.
Some of the new digital diffusers - such as pHreak, a dance music format run
by Intermedia, a multimedia consultancy in London - deliver their services
by computer modem rather than the Internet. This means that pHreak has a
more limited market than the Internet's web of 25m users, but it can make
the most of the vivid colours and sharp definition offered by computer
graphics.
The Internet will become progressively more efficient. Digital junkies will
also soon be able to transfer music to compact discs, rather than cassettes,
with the launch of recordable video-CDs. The expansion of digital cable
radio, now a fledgling medium in the US and UK which relays dozens of
specialist music stations to the home on cable TV connections, will provide
another digital delivery system.
Each home could eventually have its own 'virtual record shop'. The viewer
would be able to order an album by remote control via a digital cable box
fitted to the TV set, pay for it by credit card and record it on to a
compact disc, rather than buying it from a retailer.
However, there is a risk that, rather than benefiting from digital
diffusion, the record companies will be marginalised by it. At present,
their major artistes need them to secure access to their vast retail
distribution systems. If digital diffusion became a major medium, the
artistes might be tempted to break away and handle their own distribution.
There is also the threat that digital diffusion will continue to develop in
its current fragmented form as an underground movement with devastating
consequences for the music industry's revenue.
The first wave of digital diffusers are effectively pirate operations. They
should, in theory, be licensed to 'sell' music by the appropriate industry
authority, such as the UK's Performing Right Society (PRS). They should also
pay royalties to that authority and the record company. Otherwise they could
simply buy one compact disc and send it to be copied by thousands of
subscribers.
The PRS estimates that 'literally hundreds' of on-line services have
surfaced in the UK this year. So far it has been approached by only three
and has licensed one, Cerberus, which received official sanction last week.
'We're not Luddites,' says David Uwemedimo, head of legal affairs. 'We
encourage new technology within the regulatory system. We want to find a
fair way for these new services to pay for their music. We're still working
on it.'
Time is running out. The BPI's research suggests that once people have
access to on-line services such as digital cable radio, their expenditure on
compact discs and cassettes declines dramatically.
'Record companies have historically made a lot of money from distribution
and if they don't act quickly they could lose it,' said Ms John. 'The
problem is that, as usual, technology is moving much faster than the law -
and the industry's process of thought.'

FT  21 NOV 94 / Media Futures: Mosaic - software sprat to catch an Internet
mackerel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
California's Netscape Communications has tens of thousands of eager
customers for its first product, a 'navigator' for the global Internet.
Which is not surprising, because this Silicon Valley software start-up
company is handing out free copies of its Mosaic computer program to anyone
who asks.
That might seem an odd way to go about building a new business, but Jim
Clark, chairman and co-founder of Netscape, has his eye on a prize far
bigger than the revenues he may be sacrificing today.
He believes that giving away the Beta version of the Mosaic navigator will
help garner support for Netscape's much more ambitious plans to transform
the Internet - a global network of millions of computers - from a playground
for computer enthusiasts into the primary route for electronic commerce.
Until earlier this year, Clark was an Internet sceptic. As chairman of
Silicon Graphics, a leading manufacturer of computer work-stations he
founded in 1982, he had been pursuing interactive television as the future
path for the information superhighway.
Then he met Marc Andreesen. A 23-year-old cyber-star computer science
graduate, Andreesen created Mosaic, a software program that enables even
computer novices to explore the Internet's vast resources.
Since Andreesen and a group of fellow students working at the University of
Illinois' National Center for Supercomputing Applications launched Mosaic on
to the Internet last year, it has been used by an estimated 2m people.
'I realised that Mosaic on the Internet was the way to create all sorts of
interactive multimedia services,' says Clark. 'While the television industry
is moving slowly toward interactive multimedia services, the Internet is
spawning more and more sophisticated applications every day.'
Clark resigned from Silicon Graphics and formed Netscape last April, hiring
Andreesen and half a dozen other former students from the University of
Illinois to get the venture off the ground.
Starting from scratch, Clark claims, the team created a faster, more robust
version of Mosaic as well as a 'NetSite' program for businesses that want to
create interactive services on the Internet.
Like the original Mosaic, Netscape's software provides Internet users with a
relatively simple way to find information using 'hypertext' linking between
different documents and databases.
By clicking on a highlighted word in a hypertext document, you are
automatically transferred to related material which might be stored in the
same computer data base or in another one half a world away.
Were you to read this article via the Internet, for example, there would
probably be opportunities to refer back to other FT articles about the
Internet. You might also be able to click on the word Mosaic to access the
NASC Internet server, or pick Netscape to download the company's free
software, or switch to Silicon Graphics' Internet server and read about its
products.
'When you click on a hyperlink, you initiate a process,' says Clark. 'Today
that is typically the retrieval of a document, a movie or an audio
recording.'
The Internet is essentially a set of standards: communications protocols
that define how data is moved from one computer to another, says Clark. 'The
Internet is going to be the de facto standard for all kinds of interactive
multimedia services.'
Just as the establishment of technology standards spawned the personal
computer revolution, Clark sees these Internet standards as likely to create
vast opportunities in interactive multimedia services. 'Those companies that
are writing applications today are going to be best poised for the
opportunity to create interactive digital businesses in the future.'
However, there are several technical barriers that must be overcome before
the Internet is ready for the mass market. Today, the infrastructure of the
Internet is primitive, says Clark. Standard telephone line access is too
slow to deliver video, and it takes several minutes just to retrieve a
colour picture. But as telephone and cable TV companies upgrade their
networks, the Internet will become faster and more versatile, he predicts.
Partnerships with telephone companies are a central element of Netscape's
plans to bring the Internet to a bigger audience. 'By early next year there
will be several telecommunications companies announcing that they provide
Internet-related services,' says Clark. 'I call it Internet dialtone. It
will become one of the basic services that 'phone companies offer'.
Security is another problem on the Internet. Today there is no way of
ensuring that sensitive information such as credit card numbers can be
protected from computer hackers - a serious impediment to electronic
commerce.
However, using advanced encryption technology from RSA Data Security, a
leader in the field, Netscape has created a secure version of its software,
which it aims to sell to companies that want to do business on the Internet.
The ability to track and bill Internet users is another essential element of
Netscape's plan to help usher in electronic commerce. For electronic
publishers, one of the most important things is building in the ability to
track subscribers in order to attract advertisers, says Clark. 'We believe
that advertising is an absolutely fundamental part of this.'
The biggest barrier that Netscape faces, however, is persuading businesses
to ply their wares in the electronic marketplace. Handing out free software
that draws tens of thousands of potential consumers to the Internet is
merely the first step.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Plague outbreak in China denied
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reports of an outbreak of plague in more than 200 cities in China were a
'fabrication', although seven cases of the disease had been detected since
June, an official report said.
Xinhua news agency, quoting an unnamed health official, said the disease was
immediately brought under control after the cases were detected in remote
regions of Tibet and Qinghai province, in south-western China.
The report said China had an average of 10 cases of plague a year, having
tamed the disease in 1955.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Business Travel: How to order room service and save time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What do you do after you have placed an order with room service? A shower is
out of the question - the food will arrive soon and you do not want to
answer the door wrapped in a towel. Telephoning home is not a good idea -
you might be interrupted, writes Michael Skapinker.
You could do some work, but you are jet-lagged and hungry. So you lie on
your bed watching CNN, noting how difficult it is to fill a 24-hour news
service. Fifty minutes later, your order has still not arrived. You are
seething at the wasted time.
You telephone room service to complain. You begin: 'I ordered some food
nearly an hour ago . . . ' only to be interrupted by a knock on the door.
'Ah, I think that might be it,' you say weakly.
Some hotels say they understand how you feel. Jane Mackie, European
marketing manager at ITT Sheraton, says interviews with guests at European
hotels showed that they wanted room service 24 hours a day, and more control
over when it arrived.
She says Sheraton plans to introduce an appointments system, allowing guests
to specify what time they want their room service order to be delivered.
Guests who want to go for a swim can ask for orders to arrive in exactly 90
minutes, for example.
When they go out in the morning, they can say they want their order to
arrive at a specific time in the evening. There will be a minimum delivery
period.
Kurt Ritter, chief executive of Radisson-SAS hotels, says he has come up
with another answer. At the company's hotel at Stockholm rail station, you
can order food from the McDonald's next door.
The order arrives in four minutes. The service is available 24 hours a day.
Your bill is debited and the hotel settles with McDonald's later. You can
order healthier fare from the hotel's restaurants, but Ritter says his
guests seem to prefer McDonald's.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Business Travel: New airport for Berlin
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A giant new airport for Berlin should be built far outside the city because
sites closer to the centre were unsuitable, an official study by Brandenburg
state says. Nuisance to residents and environmental concerns meant expanding
Berlin's Schoenefeld airport eastward was not a good idea. The report
advises against Schoenefeld because many people would have to be rehoused
and the extra passenger traffic would cause chaos. It recommends two
outlying sites - Sperenberg or Jueterbog - both about 31 miles away. Berlin
has three airports: Tegel (over-crowded), Tempelhof (rarely used) and
Schoenefeld.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Russian flight fears
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's airlines still want to expand into Russia, despite a series of
fatal crashes that have fanned concern about the safety of Russian airspace,
an international aviation official says. Pierre Jeanniot, head of IATA,
which represents some 300 airlines, said in Moscow that developing air
corridors over Russia was important for the world aviation industry.
The US State Department issued a warning about using Russian airlines last
July. It withdrew the warning last month. More than 300 people have died in
Russian air crashes this year, including 75 when a western-built Airbus
A-310, operated by an Aeroflot subsidiary, crashed in Siberia last March.
Jeanniot declined to comment in detail on Russian civil aviation and its
safety record, but said he was encouraged by a recent study on safety
inspections carried out by the US Federal Aviation Administration at the
request of the Russian transport ministry. He said IATA had been working
with Aeroflot to upgrade Russian aviation to international standards.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An airline passenger group in the US has advised its members to avoid flying
on aircraft with fewer than 31 seats because records show they have a far
higher fatal accident rate than bigger aircraft.
David Stempler of the International Airline Passengers Association said that
one reason for the disparity was that the US Federal Aviation Administration
allowed operators of aircraft with fewer than 31 seats to fly under less
stringent safety and operating rules.
He said about 65 per cent of accidents for smaller commuter aircraft
occurred at night, in bad weather, or both - about twice the rate for jet
aircraft.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Late again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European summer saw a deterioration in the length of delays on air
routes, the Association of European Airlines said last week. It said it
could confirm what air travellers had 'already been noticing: that delays
are on the increase again'.
The association represents 24 scheduled European airlines. In its quarterly
punctuality review it said that the proportion of flights delayed in the
July-September period by more
than 15 minutes was 16.7 per cent, against 12.2 per cent in the second
quarter and 13.5 per cent in the same period last year.
The association said it had been a 'tremendous summer for passenger demand'.
But there was another side to the coin: congestion. 'Record numbers of
passengers have passed through airports. Some of those airports have been
stretched to the limit.' The AEA reckoned that factors related to air
traffic control were the biggest bug-bears, along with mis-handling of
passengers' baggage.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Jaunt through the jams - Smart Guide /
Bangkok - Victor Mallet gives a few tips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is the best area in which to stay?
Pick a hotel as close as possible to where you will be working. The
notoriety of Bangkok's traffic jams is richly deserved. If your business
takes you all over the city, try hotels on and around Ratchadamri Road. That
way you should be able to reach government offices, the main business
districts and the airport without great difficulty.
On holiday, stay next to the river at The Oriental. It is more fun to look
at exotic rice-barges and river-taxis than the concrete shop-houses and
tower blocks that dominate the rest of Bangkok.
Hotels?
The Regent on Ratchadamri Road is efficient and quiet and has an Asian
flavour that distinguishes it from the rest of the world's wearisomely
familiar five-star hotels. The Hyatt next door looks like an ugly glass and
concrete wedding cake from outside, but is pleasant enough within. Next to
it is a Hindu-cum-Buddhist shrine where Thais pray to win the lottery.
On the other side of Lumpini Park is the Dusit Thani. Once Bangkok's tallest
building, this 1970-vintage hotel looks its age, but is arguably as central
as you will find. Not far away on Sathorn Road is the Sukhothai, a new and
well-designed hotel with ponds and statues that will calm frenzied
executives.
Officially, all of these cost between 5,000 and 6,000 baht a night, but
discounts are available if you ask.
How about restaurants?
Try not to eat in hotel restaurants. Thai food - fresh, simple, spicy, cheap
 -is usually better at a street stall than in a gloomy coffee shop.
It is hard to go wrong with Thai food outside the hotels. Among the better
Thai restaurants are Ban Chiang (Srivieng Road) and Ban Khun Por (in Siam
Square) - both are in wooden Thai houses.
For particularly spicy fare and north-eastern Thai mu-sic, try the outdoor
Ban Lao (Sukhumvit 36).
If your bowels cannot take any more chilli, Bangkok has plenty of Italian,
Indian, Arab, French and Japanese restaurants, and more besides. For superb
Kobe steaks and Japanese beer, the smoky Misu's Kitchen on Patpong 1 is a
must.
Entertainment?
Bangkok is as notorious for its night life as for its traffic - again,
justly. Patpong is the best-known drinking, whoring, ogling and night-time
shopping area in Bangkok, possibly in the world - but is not the only one.
Nor is licentious behaviour restricted to portly western men. The Japanese
have a street of bars in Patpong; unless you look Japanese, you will
probably not get past the door.
Other entertainments are scarce, but you could watch a Thai kick-boxing
match at Lumpini stadium. Cinemas are irritating: many films are in English
with Thai subtitles, but the sound quality is of-ten poor and the words
in-audible.
What local quirks should I be aware of?
Do not point your feet at people, touch them on the head, be impatient or
loud, or joke about the Thai royal family. If you bribe, bribe the right
person at the right time.
Obey these rules and you are unlikely to get into trouble. Thais say their
culture is non-confrontational, but you may dispute this if you watch people
driving. And in a recent A-Z business guide to Thailand, A was for
Assassination.
Transport?
This is the bane of Bankgok. Be flexible. Leap out of your taxi and walk if
it helps you reach a meeting on time, but remember that the city is hot,
humid, short of pavements and sometimes flooded with sewage.
On some routes, you may find it quicker to use a river-taxi or canal-boat,
but it pays to know exactly where you want to get off. Many businessmen
think nothing of using a motorcycle-taxi, but weaving through the traffic on
these machines is as dangerous as it is quick, and the air you breathe is
thick with fumes.
Suppose I have a spare day?
Take a boat up the Chao Phraya river (or a bus) to Ayuthaya, the temple-rich
former capital of Thailand sacked by Burmese invaders.
If you prefer nature to culture, drive to the Khao Yai national park at dawn
and walk in the forest. In the middle of the park are some food stalls
serving a dish listed on the menu as 'Untold Miseries Pork'.
Thai Airways is increasing flight frequency and capacity to Europe, as well
as adding Istanbul as a destination during the current winter season (to
March 25), the airline said.
It will raise flight frequency to Europe from 34 to 43 flights a week,
including a twice-weekly service to Istanbul and Athens and seven a week to
Paris and Frankfurt. It will also fly four times a week to Copenhagen and
three times to Stockholm.
An increase in regional services will include seven flights a week to
Kunming in Yunnan province, southern China.

FOOTBALL: European Champions League, November 23, IFK Gothenburg v
Manchester United.
Walloped 4-0 by Barcelona in their last game in Europe, United need to win
this one if they are to stand a good chance of reaching the knock-out stage
of the competition. Goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel is likely to miss the match,
after injuring a back muscle in the warm-up before Saturday's 3-0 win over
Crystal Palace - a victory that took United to the top of the Premiership.
Schmeichel was replaced by third-choice 'keeper Kevin Pilkington, but Gary
Walsh, who kept goal in the Nou Camp massacre, has recovered from a stomach
problem and will be fit for Wednesday. Too much was read into the Barcelona
defeat. The last time there was so much talk about English football lagging
the game elsewhere in Europe, it preceded a run in which Liverpool,
Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa totally dominated the European Cup.
                          *      *      *
CRICKET: Australia v England, Novemeber 25-29, 1st Test, Brisbane
Their performance was 'pathetic.' So said the normally mild-mannered England
team manager, Keith Fletcher, describing the tourists' dismal showing
against an Australian XI (effectively a second national team of Test
hopefuls) at the weekend - the final game before the first Test begins on
Friday at the Gabba. Captain Mike Atherton agreed: 'We really haven't played
well.' But Damien Martyn, Australian XI captain, yesterday refused to write
off England in the upcoming Ashes series. 'They will still worry Australia,'
he predicted. 'Graeme Hick and Graham Gooch look like being major forces for
them and I rate both Alec Stewart and Michael Atherton.'
Australia name their Test team today and, despite a glowing reference from
Martyn, fast bowler Merv Hughes could miss out on selection. One of the main
discussion points among the Australian selectors has been whether to recall
Hughes, after he missed the recent tour of Pakistan. Hughes took 3-46 in
England's first innings on Saturday, but is likely to be edged out of
contention this week by Damien Fleming, Glenn McGrath and Craig McDermott,
all of whom toured Pakistan.
                          *      *      *
RUGBY UNION: Wales v South Africa, November 26, Cardiff.
The repercussions of South Africa's violent clash with Neath are still
rumbling in Wales, and the Welsh Rugby Union is to study two videos of the
match at a meeting tonight in a bid to resolve the matter. However, the
Springboks will now have their minds on higher things. Francois Pienaar's
side answered several questions when they beat Scotland 34-10 at Murrayfield
on Saturday. They may be less eye-catching than
Australia, less disciplined than England or New Zealand and less spontaneous
than the French, but collectively they look a match for anybody.

Two of Britain's best-known 'musicians' musicians' release new albums this
week. Nick Lowe, one of the unsung heroes of the punk/new wave movement and
crucial to the development of figures such as Elvis Costello, has indulged
himself with a very pleasant collection of country songs. The Impossible
Bird (Demon) has a laid-back, authentic feel to it, which is more difficult
to achieve than it sounds, but Lowe always allows his characteristic humour
to shine through the potentially maudlin nature of his material. Jools
Holland has assembled an impressive 12-piece orchestra for Live Performance
(Beautiful Records), a highly polished set of boogie, rock and roll and jive
standards which sounds as though band and audience had a great time. The CD
even comes with an 'interactive' sleeve; it can be assembled to create a
Victorian puppet theatre.
                          *      *      *
It is not often that movie soundtracks stand up as musical works on their
own, but Zbigniew Preisner's score for Krzysztof Kieslowski's haunting Three
Colours trilogy is an exception. Latest in the series is Red (Virgin),
newly-released in Britain and every bit as good as its predecessors, which
can be bought on its own or in a triple box set.
                          *      *      *
Yet again, a television commercial leads the way for a compilation album
from a virtually forgotten figure: this time, Louis Armstrong (right), whose
'We Have All The Time In The World' spearheaded the latest Guinness
campaign. The Pure Genius of Louis Armstrong (EMI) includes 'What a
Wonderful World', 'Hello Dolly' and 'Georgia On My Mind'.
                          *      *      *
The latest new releases from Sony's 'Digital Club' series are both highly
recommendable: Stefan Vladar plays Mozart's Piano Concertos 25 and 20 with
Sir Neville Marriner and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields; and
organist Nicholas Danby plays a selection of Bach chorale preludes and
fugues.

FT  21 NOV 94 / This Week: Big clubs push the panic button - Sport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has, observes Terry Butcher, been like August 12 - with soccer managers
gunned down rather than grouse. From his new role as a hotelier in the
Scottish hills, where they know how to shoot, Butcher, former England
captain and sometime league manager, has observed the slaughter.
Mike Walker at Everton, Ossie Ardiles of Spurs, Ron Atkinson from Aston
Villa. 'Look at Atkinson. Won the Coca-Cola Cup last season. Took the team
into Europe and now he's fired after a few bad results,' says Butcher,
himself tin-tacked from Sunderland before embarking on a new life as mine
host at the Old Manor Hotel, Bridge of Allen. 'There isn't a manager in
England who isn't worried about next week.'
So what's new? In terms of job security, the British soccer manager and the
Colosseum gladiator would have had much in common. 'It's always been
precarious,' agrees John Camkin, secretary of the League Managers'
Association (LMA). 'But without a doubt we're seeing something completely
new here, to have big-name sackings in such numbers.' Panic is the new
factor. According to Camkin, and virtually everyone else in the game, the
financial gap between the Premiership and Division One is now so great that
club chairmen are terrified of dropping down and never being seen again.
This season, four clubs will be relegated to a soccer netherworld, where Sky
TV's money doesn't reach and Manchester United never visit. 'It's straight
down into the polar regions, in terms of crowds, money and resources. It's
an unbelievable difference,' says Butcher. For a club with high fixed
overheads, staying among the elite is not just about a place in the sun.
It's about survival.
'If you were to drop out of the Premiership, a lot of revenue streams turn
down simultaneously,' says Steven Kind, chief accountant at Leicester City
(themselves currently in the worry zone). 'As well as smaller gates, you'd
have to look at the ticket pricing structure. In Division One, where we were
last season, it would be a struggle to keep the same number of season
ticket-holders. You'd have to re-assess the whole running of City.'
A 'Foxes' season ticket currently costs Pounds 340, 30 per cent higher than
last year, when they were in the lower division. Sky TV revenues will form
around 13 per cent of the club's expected Pounds 6m-plus turnover this
season, whereas Division One is covered by ITV, which pays nothing like as
much.
Official statistics for English league soccer as a whole show an average
Premiership gate this season of 23,375. For Endsleigh Division One the
comparable figure is 10,567. Probably the biggest fixed cost for a club is
the players' wages bill. In the old First Division, two seasons ago, the
weekly average wage was Pounds 1,152. Now the Premiership estimates a figure
of Pounds 2,500, and that conceals some startling variations. Jurgen
Klinsmann at Spurs is said to be the highest-paid player in British soccer,
earning Pounds 12,000 a week. If the club goes down, the wage bill doesn't.
'In any normal business, personnel are not a fixed overhead. But in soccer,
because of transfer values, they are, and also a capital asset,' says John
Camkin, once a director of Coventry City. 'Until, that is, you stop paying
them, whereupon they become valueless to the club because they can go where
they please without earning a transfer fee for you.'
Clubs are not run by idiots - even if it sometimes seems that way. Most have
attempted to create income that doesn't rely solely on match results.
Manchester United now earn more from merchandising than from playing soccer.
Even Leicester have sold an incredible 25,000 copies of their new team shirt
at Pounds 35 a go.
'You daren't rely on what happens on the pitch every Saturday afternoon.
You're running a business, not just a soccer game,' says Steve Kind.
It may be felt that relegation and the subsequent struggle for upward
redemption are part of soccer's appeal to the lifelong fan. After all, there
is hardly a club that hasn't fallen from grace and had to struggle long and
hard to regain its rightful status. Teams built from effort and reward have
always been more popular with British supporters than the side full of
bought-in stars.
However, what seems to be emerging now is the real possibility that the
Premiership and Division One, although notional neighbours, will have the
same relationship as Savoy Hotel guests to the vagrant sleeping rough in the
kitchen doorway - occupying the same patch but hardly interchangeable.
'It will become more difficult for a non-Premier club, trading on its own
resources, to find the players to take it up - or back up - to the top
level,' predicts Steve Coppell, chairman of the LMA. 'There won't be any
more Wimbledons. It isn't going to happen.'
This fact hasn't been lost on the Division One clubs themselves. Although
two will be promoted next May, it will be a hollow victory if their
standards and finances are so below par that they become immediate
casualties after one season in the Premier League.
All season there has been a swirl of rumour that Division One is about to
break away from the Football League and ally itself with the elite as 'Son
of Premier League'.
Privately, the Premier League admits the pressure from below, but says it is
doing nothing to foment revolution. 'The bigger Division One clubs need
crowds, glamour and excitement, and they want out of the League as soon as
possible,' says Camkin of the LMA.
The other crucial change in the footballing scene has been the arrival of
multi-millionaire 'owners' on the model of US sport - men like Jack Walker
at Blackburn, Peter Johnson at Everton, Sir John Hall at Newcastle and Jack
Hayward at Wolves. Their near-limitless willingness to spend is able to
create a business large enough to operate in the big time of the
Premiership.
'Small-town clubs with big ambitions don't want to be out scouting for new
strikers. They should be looking for a billionaire,' says Coppell. 'In the
future, no one is going to take an ordinary run-of-the-mill football club to
the very top level without massive independent financial worth.'

FT  21 NOV 94 / This Week: FT guide to the Channel Tunnel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty thousand people have booked return tickets on Eurostar trains through
the Channel Tunnel in the past three weeks, with services over the Christmas
period proving particularly popular. Despite growing interest in the idea of
cross-Channel train travel, many people remain confused about differences
between the Eurostar trains and the car shuttle service due to begin within
the next three weeks. What are the various services on offer?
The Eurostars are high-speed trains, modified versions of the French trains
a grande vitesse, which run between London and Paris and London and
Brussels. They carry passengers, but not cars, from city centre to city
centre. Each train seats up to 794 people, nearly twice as many as a Jumbo
jet or an Intercity express train. The shuttle trains, by contrast, will
carry cars, their drivers and passengers on the short under-sea hop between
Folkestone and Calais. The Eurostars compete with the airlines, while the
shuttles will compete with the ferries. The Eurostars are operated by
European Passengers Services, initially part of British Rail but now
government-owned, and the French and Belgian railways. The shuttles are run
by Eurotunnel, the company which owns and operates the Channel Tunnel.
Can I drive my car through the tunnel?
No. But you can put it on one of the shuttles. Other things which you cannot
do are: put your car on a Eurostar in London, Paris or Brussels, or travel
on the shuttle without a car - unless you are part of a coach party or you
can persuade a car-driving friend to take you across.
What will it cost?
Eurostar tickets from London to Paris or Brussels cost Pounds 155 for a
standard adult return. If you travel first class you pay Pounds 195,
including a free meal. If you book two weeks in advance the standard return
fare is Pounds 95. Unlike most airline advance bookings, you do not have to
spend a Saturday night at your destination to qualify for an Apex ticket.
Shuttle ticket prices will be announced shortly before services start.
Earlier this year, when Eurotunnel hoped to start running shuttles in May,
it unveiled return fares - for any size of car carrying up to its legal
maximum of passengers - of between Pounds 220 and Pounds 310, depending on
time of year. Its revised tariffs are likely to be similar. Eurotunnel and
the railway companies which run Eurostar are keen to avoid a price war.
Their prices are very similar to their airline and ferry competitors, but
they are promoting their trains as providing a premium service offering
quality and convenience.
How long does the journey take?
Eurostar from London to Paris takes three hours, and London to Brussels 3
1/4 hours. Neither Britain nor Belgium has yet built high-speed lines to
match the French. But when construction work is completed in Belgium, in
1996, the journey time to Brussels will fall to 2 hrs 40 mins. And when
Britain completes its high-speed link through Kent, in about 2002, times
will fall to two hours to Paris and two hours 10 mins to Brussels. The
shuttles take about 35 minutes from terminal to terminal.
Eurostar keeps boasting about the quality of service, but all I seem to read
about in the newspapers is breakdowns?
Good point. There was a series of high-profile train failures during the
pre-launch period which stranded journalists, the bosses of Eurotunnel and
British Rail, and a party of MPs. These failures were partly due to the
complexity of the trains - Eurostars have been designed to run on three
different electrical power systems and four different signalling systems -
and partly the normal technical hitches when you test a new railway system.
If these problems occur when the trains are carrying paying customers, the
Eurostars will have a serious image problem. But the three railways believe
they have sorted the hitches out.
So it's a smooth ride?
The Eurostars are air-conditioned and very comfortable, though there have
been complaints about cramped conditions in the standard-class carriages.
Upgrading work on track in the UK and the new track through the tunnel and
in France makes for a very smooth journey. The car shuttles, too, provide a
smooth - if spartan - trip. The safety regulations require travellers to
stay with their cars so the journey is a bit like spending half an hour
standing in your garage. Eurotunnel is looking to introduce travelling
refreshment trolleys, but the internal safety doors impede movement up and
down the trains. There are no duty-free facilities on the shuttles or the
Eurostars, but there are duty-free shops at the Folkestone and Calais
shuttle terminals.
Should I stop flying to Paris and Brussels, or switch from the ferries to
the shuttle?
The main benefit of the Eurostars is that they provide an uninterrupted
journey from city centre to city centre, in contrast to air travel, which is
broken up into taxi or tube journeys, waiting in departure lounges, and
sitting on the aircraft. The shuttles, meanwhile, are independent of the
weather, which can delay or cause the cancellation of ferry sailings. And
they are slightly faster.

Travel sickness pills are required this week; and a new set of culture-shock
absorbers in your brain. You will be journeying across the known globe.
Your best bet would be to start in Japan with The Seven Samurai (Kurosawa's
classic swashbuckler revived); take a ferry to Hong Kong for the praised
youth film cum portrait of an era (1960s), Days Of Being Wild; cut across
the Indian Ocean to catch Sean Connery in A Good Man In Africa (from William
Boyd's colonialism-satirising novel); nip up to the Mediterranean for the
Italian comedy Dear Diary, an enchanter from film-maker/comedian Nanni
Moretti; then make a wide loop to Cuba via claymore-swishing Scotland
(Highlander III).
                        *      *      *
Cuba, if you arrive there in one piece, has the real oddity of the week.
Strawberries And Chocolate is a gay comedy that, after getting past Castro,
has spent most of the year winning festival prizes. Two young men - one gay,
one straight (is he a watchman for the regime?) - meet, make friends and
move about amid the bizarre subculture of crumbling Havana. Sly satire,
hints of farce - and a brave assault on dogma and bigotry.
                        *      *      *
If you have children you may prefer something more innocent like The
Nightmare Before Christmas. Tim Batman Burton wrote the original story for
this off-the-map puppet phantasmagoria set in Halloweentown. Henry Selick
directed, stuffing our eyes with the richest assemblage of bric-a-brac since
the last scene of Citizen Kane.
Other ghostly influences abound. The film is part Spitting Image, part
Muppet Show, part Svankmajer's Alice. Mostly, though, it is itself: a
gloriously endearing chunk of Toytown Gothic in rich paintbox colours.
                        *      *      *
The video market is bearish this week, growling out little except a poor
children's film (Josh And SAM) and a shlockumentary for adults: OJ Simpson,
The Rise And Fall. Enough already - many of us cry - with the murder-accused
American ex-footballer. But this saga will obviously run and run, at least
until Oliver Stone makes a film of it.

Superlatives flow like Bollinger in the world of high-fashion women's
magazines, and the gush rate is Niagara-like in Cutting Edge (Monday,
9.00-10.00pm, C4), which looks at Britain's fastest-growing glossy, Marie
Claire. The result is compelling, largely because of the editor, Glenda
Bailey, whom we see at the New York collections screaming: 'I want it, I
want it, I want it.' She wasn't so keen on the documentary, though. She
walked out of the press screening a couple of weeks ago. However, she's not
one to miss a promotional opportunity: The December issue of Marie Claire is
emblazoned with 'As Seen On TV'.
                        *      *      *
Seeing a famous photograph suddenly become animated is as odd as seeing the
Venus de Milo move. That is the feeling one gets from Omnibus (Tuesday,
10.20-11.15pm, BBC1), which delivers the first big TV profile of Henri
Cartier-Bresson. Using cine footage, it shows us what happened next in
Cartier-Bresson's photograph of the impromptu trial of a Vichy collaborator.
In the past, Cartier-Bresson has restricted cameras to shots of the back of
his head and a glimpse of his profile, because he doesn't want to be
'trapped by fame'. At 86, he has relented and given a frank interview and a
full-frontal view of his face with fascinating results.
                        *      *      *
Hedonism can be hard work, as we see in Great Journeys (Wednesday
9.25-10.30pm, BBC2), when Tony Robinson, aka Baldrick from Blackadder, goes
to the Caribbean to loosen his strait-laced Englishness. We see him get high
on mushroom tea, get massaged by two teenage girls, get rum poured down his
throat, get mud smeared over his body and get nauseous at a cock-fight. Most
hilarious of all, though, is the sight of him in a skimpy costume cavorting
at Carnival.
                        *      *      *
Dispatches (Wednesday, 9.00-9.45pm, C4) will be examining evidence it claims
to have uncovered that Britain's security services attempted to discredit
the National Union Of Mineworkers and that Roger Windsor, its former chief
executive, was allegedly an MI5 agent. The programme-makers will be
interviewing former MI5 and GCHQ personnel who claim that the surveillance
was so well-placed that key decisions were known in advance and smear
tactics could be employed.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Managment: Moving out of apartheid's shadow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
I was in the new South Africa last week talking to human resources
directors, consultants and managers.
All labelled themselves as 'pale males', whose jobs and futures are
threatened by new affirmative action initiatives. Apartheid, always a
pigment of the imagination, casts a long shadow in the business world of
this beautiful country.
Many are worried by the prospects of legislation that would make
organisations reflect the demographic status of society. In other words,
about 75 per cent of all staff at all levels should be black.
There is talk everywhere of 'Africanisation', although what this means is
rather unclear. The word Eurocentric is used pejoratively to dismiss any
idea or activity that is not favoured and is seen to be the practice of the
'white minority racist regime'.
Yet the American-originated concepts of victimisation, entitlement,
affirmative action and the equality of results (not opportunities or inputs)
are embraced with open arms. There is an obsession with the redistribution
of poverty. In so many spheres Mandela has shown an excellent example by
letting go of the baggage of the past. But the expectations of those who
voted for him were fanned by prospective parliamentarians and could never be
fulfilled.
Political and organisational leaders find themselves in a dilemma. Support
affirmative action publicly and the skilled whites the economy desperately
needs continue to emigrate, believing there will be less of a future for
themselves and their children. Let the 'disadvantaged of the past' remain
underdogs and the inflated expectations of the blacks might lead to more
revolution.
It all seems rather a no-win situation. Some organisations try to compromise
by giving 'glass-ceilinged' pale males a hefty financial reward for
promoting a young black manager over him or her as second prize. But only
the most successful can afford this strategy.
One of the big problems in the new South Africa is the whole process of
consultation. The country moved from paucity to plethora; from authoritarian
diktat with no consultation at any level to a proliferation of forums where
everyone can, must and does have their say however mundane, repetitive or
ill-informed. No manager dare not let a representative have his/her say.
This can lead to a whole series of problems. Many managers feel intimidated
enough to abdicate their responsibility for decisions and allow majority
rule to prevail.
Accountability is thus diffused and unfocused because the rules of
participation and responsibility are never spelled out. But the most notable
result is that all decision-making processes are long and tedious and
satisfy no one.
The old South African government was spectacularly successful at creating
decision-making structures of Byzantine complexity. Parliaments, boards,
committees multiplied, often to the advantage of those that sat on them.
Obtaining an approval in the old system was a nightmare because of the sheer
complicated nature of the government structures. Alas, not only did business
organisations mirror this love of complexity but the new masters, rather
than sweeping the state clear have only added to it. People from all
persuasions are aware of the fact that entanglement in bureaucratic niceties
can be an excellent ploy to hide real issues and promote the status quo.
This is not the slash-and-burn approach of revolutionaries nor the work of
right-sizing, re-engineering. It remains the analysis-paralysis approach
which may work well when one is dealing with constitutions, but is less well
suited to the world of making widgets.
As always in times of great change, people's time perspective shifts from
the long to the short term. For years, informed South African business
leaders were filled with a sense of impermanence and discontinuity. Trapped
between the powerful forces of Afrikaaner hegemony and Black African
nationalism, English-speaking whites and many Indian entrepreneurs simply
kept their heads down and tried to make money. . .and get it out of the
country. The short-term 'let's-live for the day' philosophies still prevail
in the 'wait-and- see' period. But business needs to invest in, and build
for a future which involves a significant cultural shift.
There is a saying in Afrikaans which directly translated means 'tomorrow is
another day'.
It is usually regarded as a statement of optimism about the future, looking
forward to the possibility of a new start. There is a lot of business
optimism in South Africa. But like all big political and economic
metamorphoses it takes time and effort. The economic situation of eastern
Europe is a reasonable parallel. In the words of the prime minister 'If it
isn't hurting, it isn't working.'

FT  21 NOV 94 / Management: Why do you deserve to be paid so much? / A look
at moves to counter recent criticism of big bonuses by establishing a better
link with performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, ANDREW HILL and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The search for an equitable formula for top executive pay has acquired a new
urgency this autumn, as pressure mounts on directors to curb embarrassingly
high pay rises.
This month, it was the turn of Sir Bryan Nicholson, president of the
Confederation of British Industry, to criticise 'increases and performance
bonuses which are not only well above inflation, but also out of proportion
with the rewards received by the workforce for the company's performance'.
So far, companies have failed to provide an adequate justification for the
rewards they pay top executives. The link between pay rises and performance
of the UK's largest companies is non-existent, according to a study by Graef
Crystal, a US pay expert. Interest in the issue has also been heightened by
pressure on companies to remedy shortcomings as many of the 10-year share
option schemes introduced from 1984 come to an end.
Large, poorly-designed, incentive packages can be a problem, rather than a
solution. The provision of performance-related bonuses on top of share
options is 'divisive, inflationary and . . . greed-promoting', according to
Sir Owen Green, former chairman of BTR.
A similar debate is raging in the US, where the rewards to top executives
have escalated rapidly in recent years, often helped by multi-million-dollar
share option gains.
Intense controversy has been aroused by attempts to regulate executive pay
more tightly and by proposed changes to the accounting treatment of share
options. Salaries are now subject to greater disclosure and higher taxes on
that share of the income which exceeds Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) a year
and is not performance linked.
Preoccupation with the size of executive rewards seems to be largely an
Anglo/American phenomenon, but the popularity of share options has spilled
into France, where companies have been quick to spot their tax advantages.
'Options have become practically the most significant element of executive
compensation,' says Eduardo de Martino, a partner with accountants Arthur
Andersen in Paris. 'You can't really recruit or retain a high-quality
executive without them.'
In most other European countries, the culture of share options has yet to
develop, although bonuses are commonplace. In Italy, for instance, where the
small- and medium-sized enterprises which form the backbone of the Italian
economy are not listed on the stock exchange, top Italian directors may
receive up to 25 or 30 per cent of their remuneration in the form of cash
bonuses.
The fiercest debates about executive pay, however, are taking place in the
US and UK, which both have highly developed stockmarkets and where the
influence of any individual shareholder on company directors is relatively
weak.
Much of the debate stems from the desire of institutional shareholders to
ensure that top managers are focused on their investors' interests. The rise
of the professional manager means that 'the investing institutions demand a
check on the otherwise unfettered power of the executives, who might be
tempted to live well at the shareholders' expense', according to Alastair
Ross Goobey, chief executive of PosTel Investment Management.
Not everyone accepts that shareholders can extract a better performance from
senior executives by paying for results. Alfie Kohn, a US management
theorist, believes that the motivational theory underpinning this doctrine
is 'profoundly wrong-headed'. The Pensions and Investment Research Council,
which advises UK institutions on corporate governance issues, thinks that
incentives for senior executives are inequitable and encourage short-term
thinking.
The idea that incentives should be an integral part of top managers' pay
packets, however, has become entrenched. Share option schemes, which
typically allow senior executives to buy shares (worth up to four times
their salary) at today's price in three years' time, are used by 98 per cent
of FT-SE 100 and Mid 250 Index companies, according to New Bridge Street
Consultants. Even the Labour party's proposal to remove tax concessions from
share options is unlikely to dislodge them, it believes.
Nonetheless, share options have come under increasing fire. The Association
of British Insurers believes that they 'may not provide the long-term
motivation to high performance that was intended when they were introduced.
Options have not created long-term shareholders, since they are usually
exercised, and the shares sold, at the first possible opportunity.
The most powerful criticism of share options is that they are based on a
fallacious linkage between share price and management performance. In a bull
market, executives with options stand to gain no matter how poor the
company's relative performance has been. Conversely, in a bear market, a
strong performance would not be recognised. Moreover, there is no downside
if the share price falls after a disastrous performance; the options simply
expire worthless.
This inability to punish failure in the same way as they reward success can
distort company policy. 'You might decide as a company to make acquisitions
to make the share price go up. If it goes wrong you have not lost anything,'
says Brian Friedman, head of compensation and benefits at Arthur Andersen.
But these arguments do not convince everybody. Brian Main, a professor at
the University of Edinburgh, argues that the portrayal of options as lacking
downside risk neglects the fact that they have a real value when they are
issued, which can be calculated using pricing formulae. Yet this solution
depends on finding agreement on an acceptable method of valuing executive
share options, which is fraught with difficulty. When the Accounting
Standards Board wrestled with the issue earlier this year, it concluded that
it was not practical to include a 'meaningful' money value of options in the
accounts.
In the US, the Financial Accounting Standards Board is mired in controversy
as it grapples with the same issue. It, however, is expected to conclude
that executive options can be valued and should be treated as a cost that
should be set against profits in a company's accounts.
This debate about valuation influences another controversial area of the
debate about incentives - namely, whether performance criteria should be
used as qualifying hurdles when managers exercise their options. The
Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension
Funds have decided to insist on performance conditions for options schemes
to ensure that rewards are for real performance rather than mediocrity.
Main argues that hurdles are illogical. Since they merely lower the initial
value of the option because of the lower probability of subsequent
profitable exercise, it has 'little net effect other than creating a
bureaucratic complexity'.
M&amp;G, the institutional investor, has resisted the introduction of
performance conditions for other reasons. 'We are firmly of the view that
performance benchmarks for the exercise of options may not be in the best
interests of shareholders,' says Paddy Linaker, then managing director, in
February.
His arguments rest on the arbitrary nature of a particular performance
yardstick and the potential conflicts of interest it can present. 'There is
a real danger that some companies, in their search for benchmarks, will
choose guidelines that are too demanding and which will result in unwise
corporate strategies being pursued,' he says.
Over two thirds of the 38 companies which have published benchmarks for
their options schemes since July 1993 have opted for earnings per share
targets, according to a new study. However, they have the weakness that they
can be manipulated through changes in accounting procedures.
The other most common measures are based on share price or total shareholder
return. Their main disadvantage is that options gains are already linked to
the growth in the share price.
In a few cases, other types of measures are being considered. Bradford
Property Trust, for instance, has plumped for conditions based either on
earnings per share or net asset value. BP, which considers that fluctuations
in oil prices and exchange rates rule out share price and earnings per
share, is considering using a measure that compares its own return to
shareholders against that of the other oil majors. Other possibilities,
based on concepts such as cash generation or return on capital, have been
proposed by compensation consultants.
As well as tinkering with their share option schemes, an increasing number
of companies are experimenting with an alternative, the long-term incentive
plan. These are schemes which reward management for performance over an
extended period with cash or shares.
Supporters of these schemes argue that they can neatly be tied to
performance, without being subject to the vagaries of the stock market.
Reuters has announced a scheme which awards shares to executives at the
beginning of the performance period, which are released at the end of five
years, subject to a strong showing on total shareholder returns. No shares
are released if Reuters is ranked in the last 25 companies in the FT-SE 100,
but all are released if it is in the top 40, with a graduated release
between these two points.
Long-term incentive plans are arguably an improvement on share option plans,
but risk being discredited if they are introduced as yet another hand-out to
top executives on top of what they already got.
Benefits are potentially large. 'A maximum award of between 50 per cent and
100 per cent of salary is becoming fairly common,' according to New Bridge
Street Consultants. Moreover, all but one of the 76 FT-SE 100 and Mid 250
Index index companies that have adopted incentive plans are using them in
addition to their option schemes.
Potentially, incentive plans are open to abuse. There is no formal
institutional shareholder limit on individual participation and they do not
normally require shareholder consent. Moreover, although awards are
eventually disclosed as directors' emoluments, this is long after they were
awarded and the amounts are often inadequately explained in terms of
performance.
This highlights the broader case for more rigorous rules about the
disclosure of executive pay. In the US, the SEC, the securities regulator,
introduced a requirement in 1992 for each firm to disclose its top
executives' pay, together with the firm's performance over the last five
years, compared with a relative index of a peer group of companies.
'The implications have been far-reaching,' says Peter Chingos of KPMG Peat
Marwick. 'It puts a significant amount of responsibility on a company to
demonstrate the relationship between pay and performance.'
Clearer and more detailed explanation of top executives' pay in the UK
would, on its own, do little to calm the public's disquiet. But by putting
greater pressure on executives to justify their salaries, it might lead to
more restraint on basic pay and more carefully designed incentive packages.
In the meantime, however, the escalation of top executives' pay will be seen
by many as serving nobody's interests but their own.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Management: Pioneers and Prophets - Max Weber
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Max Weber (1864-1920) is often portrayed by enlightened modern executives
and organisational thinkers as a villain of equivalent rank to Frederick
Taylor, father of the now discredited 'scientific' school of management.
That reputation is only half-deserved.
Weber, a German lawyer turned sociologist, provided the theoretical
underpinning for Taylor's much more practical influence by arguing that the
most efficient form of organisation resembled a machine: a bureaucracy
replete with hierarchy, rules and controls. He distinguished this
'rational-legal' model of organisation, as he called it, from 'charismatic'
(leader-dominated) and 'traditional' ones (those driven by custom and
practice).
In their best-seller In Search of Excellence, Tom Peters and Robert Waterman
took the 'villain' view, in tone as much as content. They reported that
Weber 'pooh-poohed charismatic leadership and doted on bureaucracy'. And
they blamed him for arguing, as they put it, that 'its rule-driven,
impersonal form . . . was the only way to ensure long-term survival'.
Together Weber and Taylor propounded the idea that the best form of
organisation was an inward-looking, 'closed' system peopled by rational
actors. The 'rational actor' part of the proposition was soon thrown out as
unrealistic by the likes of Elton Mayo and Chester Barnard, who saw managers
as messy, very 'social' actors. But the closed-system doctrine held sway for
decades.
Only from about 1970 did theory finally catch up with reality, combining an
open systems view of organisations with the 'social actor' view. Hence
today's fashion for the idea that managers and organisations must both
undertake lifelong learning.
Weber only half-deserves his modern reputation for two reasons. First, it is
never fair to judge with too much hindsight - at the time, his thinking
seemed quite reasonable. Second, he was less oppressive than most people
realise. He made a relatively enlightened distinction (for his day and
background) between power and authority. Power, he said, was the ability to
force people to obey, regardless of their level of resistance. Under
authority, however, orders were obeyed voluntarily.
The inadequate exercise of authority in most bureaucracies disturbed Weber;
he saw the excessive wielding of power as a threat to human freedom and
democratic values. He warned that bureaucracy could turn into an iron cage.
He even wrote 'this passion for bureaucracy is driving me to despair'.
Yet Weber's influence has perpetuated the dangerous metaphor of
organisations as machine bureaucracies, rather than adaptive organisms.
As the strategy and organisation expert Henry Mintzberg argues, machine
structures can only work well so long as a set of simple, repetitive tasks
need to be performed consistently. When tasks grow more complex and change,
the machine's regulated efficiency impairs the organisation's effectiveness,
impeding creativity and motivation. In today's world, that is a pretty
lethal combination.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Labour attacks ministers over spending on wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday accused ministers of having an 'obscene sense of
priorities' after disclosing that the government had spent more than Pounds
570,000 on wine for official gatherings in the past five years at an average
of Pounds 5.26 a bottle.
Mr Alan Milburn, a Labour MP, said the purchasing was done by a quango
called the Government Hospitality Fund Advisory Committee for the Purchase
of Wine, under the auspices of the Foreign Office. The quango, headed by Sir
Ewen Fergusson, a former Ambassador to France, cost Pounds 1,500 a year to
run.
Mr Milburn accused the committee of wasteful expenditure at a time when Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was calling for public expenditure
restraint. He said: 'With huge spending cuts being planned, it is an obscene
sense of priorities to lavish large sums of public money on buying wine to
dish out at receptions.'
Mr Milburn said the money spent on wine could have bought 500 cataract
extractions or 100 coronary artery by-pass operations.
The Foreign Office said the average spending of Pounds 110,000 a year 'does
not necessarily mean that money was actually used in the last year, because
some wine is bought and then stored'. It said there were 500 functions last
year across government departments.
Such entertainment, involving people from all walks of life, was in 'direct
support of government activities and objectives', it said, citing diverse
examples such as the promotion of exports and an achievement award ceremony
for disabled people.
Nor were members involved in decisions on purchasing, which was the
responsibility of officials of the fund.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Tories 'need killer facts' to stop electoral death:
Backbench 'yobbos' urged to hit back at Blair - Warning given that small
businesses feel let down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON

<TEXT>
'Killer facts' are what the Conservative party needs if it is to win the
next general election, according to a strategy paper produced by Mr John
Maples, the party's deputy chairman and a former Treasury minister.
The facts are soundbites, such as: 'Since 1980, the UK economy has grown
faster than Germany and the gap is widening.' They need to be trumpeted 'ad
nauseam' because, as the market research appendix to the paper shows, a core
element of the Conservative party's support, those on average incomes,
perceive the government as 'ineffectual and unable to deliver its promises'.
Written on September 30 and based on extensive research among people who
'voted Conservative in April 1992 but now say they might or would not', the
paper shows the large extent of the challenge faced by the party to reverse
Labour's lead in the opinion polls and plots a possible communications
strategy.
It throws light on the usually obscured relationship between party machinery
and government departments. As the introduction to the paper says: 'If the
ideas set out are accepted by ministers then detailed programmes will need
to be developed with relevant departments.'
Because the paper was intended to be read only by Mr John Major and a
restricted circle in Conservative Central Office and Downing Street, its
language and tone are rather more frank and perhaps cynical than the normal
ministerial soundbite.
To give one example, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, would
probably not wish to be caught saying: 'The best result for the next 12
months would be zero media coverage of the National Health Service.'
However, that is Mr Maples's conclusion to a long analysis of what the party
should do to reduce Labour's opinion poll lead over the Tories on which of
the parties would manage the health service better.
Nor would Mrs Bottomley opine publicly that 'we can never win on this
issue', as does Mr Maples. His paper says Labour's lead on this issue is 55
per cent and that a realistic target would be to reduce this margin to 30
per cent by October 1995.
The basis of the paper is a qualitative research programme - market research
which attempts to give a more detailed account of how individuals think and
feel than mainstream quantitative opinion polls.
The target of the research was two groups of Conservative voters: those in
the middle-income, white-collar 'BC1' category and those in the 'C2' top end
of the blue-collar group. Both have been a vital element in the party's last
three general election victories. The purpose was to 'explore in depth why
their support had slipped'.
Opinions were solicited from eight groups of eight people, with equal
numbers of men and women in each, divided between BC1s and C2s. The
discussions were held in Oldham, Birmingham, London and Brighton and
participants fell into one of two age groups: 25 to 40-year-olds and 40 to
60-year-olds. There were also two pensioners' groups.
There is a widespread conviction among senior Conservatives that the party
must keep the votes of individuals in these categories if it is to win the
next general election. At first glance, therefore, the results make grim
reading for the party.
Mr Maples provides points of the 'general picture' emerging from the
interviews. As the views of Conservative voters, they are slightly
surprising:
'There is a feeling of powerlessness and insecurity about jobs, housing,
health service, business, family value, crime etc and no vision of where we
are heading.'
'Although in the 1980s the Conservatives seemed to promise a classless
society of opportunity, the reality is now that the rich are getting richer
on the backs of the rest, who are getting poorer.'
'Privatisation has not been popular and small businessmen in particular feel
'let down'.'
'Very few people think we are out of recession.'
'The Conservatives have let voters down: they have been in government too
long, are complacent and have lost a sense of direction. They fail to fulfil
promises, are clumsy at implementing policy and 'shoot themselves in the
foot'.'
However, many of these individuals' other views - 'very rightwing views on
crime and immigration, deep disapproval of 'scrounging' on social security .
. . deep fear of 'loony lefties', distrust of politically-correct,
liberal-minded 'do-gooders'' - make them 'natural Conservatives'.
The market research identifies 'failure of communication' as at the heart of
the disenchantment. 'What we are saying is at odds with their experience,
which leads them to conclude that we are 'out of touch', 'lying', 'don't
care', 'think they are stupid',' it says.
That is why Mr Maples believes a detailed communications plan is important.
The period between now and the election, which 'could be as little as 20
months away and no more than 30 months' is divided into four phases in the
fledgling communications plan - up to the 1995 party conference; from then
to the start of a short pre-election campaign; a third phase, the
pre-election campaign, four to six months before polling day; and the
election campaign.
The 'phase one' proposal is to overtake or reduce the Labour party's opinion
poll lead in four crucial policy areas for these average income supporters,
as identified by the research. 'We should . . . by the 1995 conference . . .
seek to re-establish polling leads on the economy and law and order while
reducing our deficits on education and health.'
The messages should be positive in this initial phase. In stage two, the
party will 'need to scare the voters about Labour and the Liberals'.
The process of getting the message across has several strands, ranging from
party political use of the parliamentary timetable to a more ruthless
approach to relationships with press and television.
On the latter Mr Maples says:
'We should not just concentrate on political and specialist correspondents
but on columnists, leader writers and editors.'
'We need to set and control the agenda as much as we can and be much less
'reactive'.'
'We need to feed our friends and potential friends in the press with good
stories.' 'For television and radio, we should use good performers
ruthlessly.'
'The ability to react rapidly to events and Labour allegations is vital.
They are much better than us at this.'
'A programme of 'marking' and building relationships with proprietors,
editors, correspondents etc needs planning and implementation.'
A section on the style of a media campaign suggests Mr Maples may not have
learned one lesson of the research, which is not to patronise these middle
and lower income groups: 'While ABC1s can conceptualise, C2s and Ds often
cannot. They can relate only to things they can see and feel. They absorb
their information and often views from television and tabloids. We have to
talk to them in a way they understand.'
However effective any campaign to bring round the media may turn out to be,
the party also needs to regain control of the political agenda.
Mr Maples urges that the parliamentary timetable is managed far better so
that popular measures, relevant debates and ministerial statements receive
public attention, and are not crowded out by news of uncontrolled events.
One technique for propagating good news is to identify a series of 'killer
facts'. The paper says: 'We need to develop say five facts in each key area
which are positive and which we repeat endlessly eg 'One million more
patients treated annually since NHS reforms'.'
A series of policy changes are suggested to defuse the main criticisms of
disenchanted supporters. These include slowing the pace of NHS reform,
postponing the second instalment of value added tax on fuel and reform of
the system of taxing executive share options to deter some of the excesses
of executive pay packages.
Another important strand in the campaign is to solicit 'endorsements' from
'friends' such as the police and the Confederation of British Industry.
The main objective, underlying all strands of the communications strategy,
is to make sure that what the party says corresponds to supporters' real
experiences. Mr Maples identifies the economy as an important area of
weakness. He points out: 'While we trumpet the recovery, the voters do not
think the recession has ended. They still fear unemployment, have no more
'money in their pocket' etc. What we are saying is completely at odds with
their experience.'
The reason for this mismatch is that, because of tax increases, real
take-home pay is falling this year and 'will fall again in 1995 to 1996. We
have to see this rise soon or we will have had four or even five years of
recovery with no rise in living standards'.
The problem of matching ministerial claims to reality is less acute in law
and order.
Mr Maples says: 'We cannot be tough enough for our audience (on law and
order) but they do not know what we are doing and all the real evidence says
to them that crime is worse.'
One solution is to 'stop or at least criticise those responsible for light
sentences, safari trips, prosecution of people 'who have a go' at criminals,
early release from prison etc'.
Reversing Labour's 39 per cent poll lead on education issues will be
tougher. The market research survey showed that 'talk of competition,
budgets, management etc triggers negative perceptions of treating education
like a business'.
However, it continues: 'It does not matter that much of the education
establishment is hostile - they are rightly seen as part of the problem.'
The gravest problem of all for the government is perception of NHS reforms:
'People perceive the reforms as clumsy and believe what doctors and nurses
say about them, which is almost universally hostile.'
Apart from a total media blackout of NHS coverage, the next best strategy is
to identify a few 'killer facts' for 'endless repetition'. But these should
be more than national statistics: 'Could we have a number per month (of
patients treated) for a typical hospital, or even for particular local
hospitals.'
It would also help to dam the flow of bad news. 'We must think about what we
can do to stop the staff being so critical to patients.'
The paper devotes little attention to two traditional battleground areas -
the unions and Europe. Of the unions, the paper says: 'This issue is low on
people's priority lists.' The market research says: 'These (unions are no
longer seen as a threat, indeed people feel that employees now have little
or no protection against employers and need more.'
Europe, too, is said to be 'very low on their list of concerns'. The
ingredients for campaigning success are a united party and 'that we remain
more Eurosceptic than Labour'.
Apart from these individual issues, the paper urges a coherent strategy for
dealing with the Labour party. The research shows that 'apart from the NHS,
Blair is the only thing they really have going for them'.
He says of the Labour party leader: 'If Blair turns out to be as good as he
looks we have a problem.' The traditional method of attacking a Labour
leader is redundant because the Conservatives 'cannot paint Blair as a left
winger'.
They should, however, be 'constantly throwing his past views at him and
trying to create and exploit the huge gap between Blair and most of his
party'.
Mr Maples has a suggestion: 'Could we set some backbenchers on to this?
Maybe a few yobbos of our own to try to knock him about a bit and another
team to operate more subtly on the changes of mind and differences of view.'
He says the government should introduce legislation likely to split Mr Blair
from the rest of his party. 'A proposal on ID cards and/or further
industrial relations legislation (eg to reballot on public service strikes)
would force them to take a view. Either Blair will support our proposals and
divide his party, or oppose us and show he does not really mean what he says
about strikes and crime,' he says.
Mr Maples sums up the campaign in a section headed 'listen'. He says that
too often the party appears not to be listening to its supporters and is too
didactic. Instead he recommends: 'Listening, explaining, being honest and
open, inviting feedback and dialogue.'

FT  21 NOV 94 / Appraisal by staff urged for chiefs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Part of the pay of chief executives should be determined by employee
appraisal, the MSF technical union says in a report today.
It suggests that chief executives who expect employees to have part of their
pay related to performance should put their own performance and pay to the
same sort of test.
A survey of MSF representatives in 472 organisations found that
three-quarters wanted to be involved in the appraisal of their managers.
The survey found that before the introduction of techniques such as human
resource management and total quality management, 88 per cent of
representatives were ambivalent to them. After they were introduced the
proportion opposed to them doubled to 24 per cent.
The report says that while new techniques such as empowerment promised
greater employee control, only a tenth of those questioned thought this had
actually happened.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Call to put nuclear waste on tips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government should force local authorities to accept low-level
radioactive waste on council rubbish tips, says an influential advisory
body.
The Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee says in a submission to
the government's review of radioactive waste that it is highly
unsatisfactory that waste producers are forced to use Drigg, a repository at
Sellafield in Cumbria, because they are being turned away by councils.
The committee says that Drigg is a national asset. Some of its capacity is
being filled by material that is 'suitable to go elsewhere'.
Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group which published extracts of the
committee's submission yesterday, said it was unacceptable that an unelected
body wanted to ignore the safety fears of elected councils.
Ms Bridget Woodman of Greenpeace said: 'Even the smallest doses of radiation
can be fatal. Low-level nuclear waste can remain radioactive for thousands
of years, posing a threat to both ourselves and future generations.'
Under the 1990 Environmental Protection Act local authorities must be
'persuaded' rather than directed to make landfill sites available for
low-level radioactive waste. This reversed previous legislation which gave
the government enforcement powers.
The committee says there is little incentive for local authorities to be
persuaded to take radioactive waste because of opposition from pressure
groups and public fears.
The committee says: 'It is obviously unsatisfactory from the waste
producer's point of view to be pressurised to use Drigg, and therefore incur
higher costs, because suitable landfill facilities are not available
locally.
'The government need to ensure . . . landfill sites are available for
appropriate low-level waste.'
It adds that the government should adopt powers to enable it to direct
councils and private landfill operators to accept 'appropriate' low-level
radioactive waste on refuse tips and landfill sites.
The Department of the Environment said the committee's submission was one of
many which would be considered.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Blair presses worker rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Individual workers must be empowered with a minimum legal framework of
rights if they are to survive and prosper in the flexible labour market, Mr
Tony Blair told a trade union conference at the weekend.
The Labour party leader, outlining the future relationship between a Labour
government and the unions, said governments 'cannot and should not do it
all'.
He added: 'It is up to the trade unions themselves to take advantage of the
opportunities.
'They have a responsibility to adapt to the new circumstances and
realities.'
He said that unions had to speak up as effectively for part-time female
workers as they did for the full-time male worker. Such part-time women
would be a growing feature of the increasingly flexible labour market.
Mr Blair said there was 'a bond of belief' between Labour and the trade
unions that was 'more than a few lines in a rule book'.
He added: 'Unions know and accept that from a Labour government they can
expect fairness not favours. But fairness will be a big advance on the open
hostility they have had from governments over the past 15 years.'
Mr Blair praised the UCW postal union for its campaign which helped defeat
the government's Post Office privatisation plans.
He also praised the GMB general union for securing a European works council
at United Biscuits. He said this had made 'a mockery of the government's
opt-out from the social chapter'.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Hotel pay 'rises 3% or more'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many of Britain's biggest hotel chains and catering companies have raised
the wages of their low-paid workers by 3 per cent or more since the
government's abolition of the wages councils last year, says a study
published today.
The findings by Incomes Data Services appear to contradict fears that the
end of statutory protection for the low paid would encourage employers to
drive down wages in weakly organised sectors such as hotels and catering.
Mr Chris Pond, head of the independent Low Pay Unit, said yesterday that it
showed big companies were 'using their market power to gain a competitive
edge by attracting the best staff available'.
The report found minimum pay rates covering more than 10,000 employees in
hotels had been raised by at least the rate of inflation to Pounds 3.07 an
hour, maintaining in real terms the minimum set down by the wages council
for the industry before its demise last year.
The report says that many companies in catering have frozen minimum rates or
introduced new lower starting rates for staff, using the cost savings made
to provide higher rises for more experienced staff.
A report published today by the National Association of Citizens Advice
Bureaux says pay and conditions of employment have deteriorated in recent
months for a growing number of people working in London.
The report, based on evidence of employment problems from 48 local bureaux
in the capital, shows that the abolition of the wages councils and erosion
of employment protection have driven down wages in many small companies.
The report found that wages have fallen as low as Pounds 1 an hour for some
catering jobs. It says employers are replacing permanent staff with workers
on short-term contracts to prevent them reaching the two-year qualifying
threshold for employment protection.
The report says employers in London are withdrawing holiday and sick pay,
imposing commission-only work and breaching health and safety regulations.
'With no protection against unfair dismissal, many workers are faced with a
choice between accepting less pay and longer hours or the sack,' it says.
The report calls for a reduction in the two-year qualifying period for
protection against unfair dismissal to at least its pre-1979 level of six
months.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Smooth operator balked at the polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As a specialist communicator and a senior Conservative Central Office
official, it is clear why Mr John Maples was handed the responsibility of
finding ways for the government to turn back the tide of negative publicity,
William Lewis writes.
Following his defeat at the 1992 general election at Lewisham West in
London, where he had been MP since 1983, he was appointed chairman and chief
executive of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Government Communications Worldwide, the
advertising agency's government lobbying offshoot. The subsidiary was set up
after the election to 'deal with communications between governments and
their people and people and their governments'.
Mr Maples's move to Saatchi apparently came about after he impressed senior
executives at the company. In the approach to the election Mr Maples, then
economic secretary to the Treasury, emerged as one of the government's most
effective television communicators. His performances, routinely described as
smooth, made him one of the rising stars. He was tipped for immediate
promotion to the cabinet after the election.
Even after his defeat many in the party felt sure that it would not be long
before Mr Maples returned.
The path back has not been a wholly smooth one. He is said to have applied
to become the Conservative candidate for the Newbury by-election earlier
this year, but was rejected. This was widely blamed on support for his
candidacy from Central Office, against which there was some animosity in the
local party organisation. It remains to be seen whether he will find a safe
seat before the next general election.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Budget 1994: Mawhinney may turn transport in a new direction
 -Charles Batchelor says the government will be able to show at little cost
whether it favours public systems over the car
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government will have an opportunity to spell out its commitment to
public transport at very little cost in the Budget on November 29. Mr Brian
Mawhinney, transport secretary for the past four months, will be able to
demonstrate whether his sympathies lie with public transport or the car and
respond to growing pressure to switch spending.
At the same time government plans to involve private finance in the public
transport infrastructure mean it would not be required to pledge large
amounts of public finance to any ventures.
The Department of Transport set out its stall earlier this month in a glossy
catalogue, Building Tomorrow's Transport Network, which lists infrastructure
projects in which private finance will play an important role.
Among the opportunities identified are several projects for which
preparations are well advanced, such as the Pounds 500m West Coast rail line
modernisation, and 'design, build, finance and operate' road schemes. They
include Crossrail, the underground rail link across London which is looking
for an alternative way forward after being rejected by a parliamentary
committee.
A few days after the publication of this catalogue Sir Alastair Morton,
chairman of the panel set up to promote projects eligible for private funds,
said his main problem had shifted from finding suitable projects to handling
the work coming in.
Sir Alastair said the private finance initiative had the backing of Mr John
Major, the prime minister, and its potential was now more clearly recognised
in government departments. The panel has identified projects worth Pounds
10bn, some in transport but others in fields such as information technology,
water and sewage and education.
Among the projects the chancellor might seek to highlight in his Budget
statement are:
Light rail or 'supertram' projects planned in several cities. A strong case
for public backing can be made by the Croydon Tramlink, a 17-mile network to
improve communications in south London. It would provide an orbital link
between Wimbledon, Croydon, Beckenham and New Addington, reducing bus
journey times on crowded suburban roads.
Its promoters, London Transport and Croydon Borough, believe that because
London travellers are used to paying higher fares, the private sector would
be willing to provide more than half the Pounds 160m cost of the scheme.
This would be far more than raised for earlier tram projects in Manchester
and Sheffield.
A second tram project which is well advanced is the Midland Metro, which
would link central Birmingham with Wolverhampton over 13 miles of track. The
private sector contribution to this Pounds 112m scheme is estimated at just
Pounds 10m but it would make a considerable contribution to reducing
congestion.
New rolling stock for London Underground's Northern Line. London Underground
fought to have this project accepted under the private finance initiative
and has two remaining bidders for the Pounds 400m project. The chancellor
may announce final approval in the Budget.
Thameslink 2000, which would quadruple capacity on London's only cross-town
rail link, between London Bridge and St Pancras stations. The government has
said this Pounds 500m project must be financed entirely by the private
sector. It would extend the cross-London link to new destinations in East
Anglia and on the south coast.
The West Coast line featured in last year's Budget announcement and a
project team is trying to define the scheme more closely so that it can be
put out to tender next year.
The revival of interest in rail following the completion of the Channel
tunnel has attracted the attention of consultant engineers and construction
companies. The roads programme is being cut. Even so, road-related schemes
could still feature in the Budget. They could include:
Proposals for a second Forth road bridge costing an estimated Pounds 400m
which are being studied by the Scottish Office. On present estimates the
existing road bridge, dating from 1964, will soon be heavily congested. The
Lothian region would prefer improvements to rail services. Technologies for
the introduction of electronic tolls on motorways are being evaluated by the
Department of Transport for testing next year. The chancellor may announce
more details of the expected private sector contribution. A second tranche
of 'design, build, finance and operate' projects, paid for by the government
through 'shadow' tolls, may be announced following the unveiling of the
first four projects last August.
The chancellor may, however, surprise his listeners with schemes which have
received no previous publicity.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Swifter payment of bills reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The length of time taken to settle bills for small and medium sized
businesses has improved in the last four years, the Confederation of British
Industry said yesterday.
But late payment is still a 'major headache' for many businesses, and the
smallest companies are worst hit by the problem.
A survey of 400 small and medium sized companies by the CBI and Coopers &amp;
Lybrand found that the average payment time for bills was 52.8 days.
This compares with an average payment time of 60 days in 1990, and is
considerably better than the European Union average of 66 days, according to
the European Commission.
The CBI pointed out that improvement in the late payment record partly
reflects improvements in the overall business climate.
It suggested, however, that the improved results might also reflect a shift
in business practices, with 62 per cent of firms now using credit control
managers compared with only 49 per cent in 1990.
Mr Chris Hughes, head of insolvency at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'The
improvement suggests that credit management techniques in small and medium
sized firms have been strengthened.'
Nevertheless, Mr John Parsons, chairman of the CBI's smaller firms council,
warned that late payment remained a problem.
The survey showed that 11 per cent of companies said that late payment was
threatening their survival, compared with 17 per cent in 1990.
Nearly half of the companies said that more than 40 per cent of invoices
were paid late, and over a fifth said that more than 60 per cent were late
payments.

FT  21 NOV 94 / IRA admits its members killed postal worker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The IRA admitted last night that its members murdered a postal worker during
a robbery in Newry, County Down, 10 days ago.
But the IRA leadership insisted that it remained committed to the success of
the peace process and said it had not sanctioned the raid. It blamed a
'fault' in its chain of command and apologised for the attack.
Mr Frank Kerr was shot when masked raiders entered the sorting office in
Newry and escaped with more than Pounds 130,000. It was the first killing by
the IRA since its ceasefire started on September 1.
A statement issued in Dublin said: 'Those carrying out the robbery were
acting on instructions but the so-called operation had not been sanctioned
by the IRA leadership.'
It added: 'Responsibility for this incident lies with an identified problem
in the army's chain of command and not with the volunteers involved. This
has now been rectified.'
The statement followed an investigation the IRA promised on November 12 when
the organisation banned the use of firearms by its members.
Two men appeared in court last Wednesday charged with the murder of Mr Kerr
and stealing more than Pounds 130,000.
Neither Downing Street nor the Northern Ireland Office would comment on the
statement last night.
The BBC reported that Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, had said he was
disappointed at the IRA's involvement and added that it was now up to the
IRA to ensure there was no repetition.
Mr Peter Robinson MP, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, urged
Mr John Major, the prime minister, to 'wipe from his mind' immediately any
thoughts of entering into dialogue with Sinn Fein.
He accused the IRA of 'blatant hypocrisy'. In the same message, he said,
they had admitted murdering Mr Kerr and expressed their devotion to the
peace process.
Earlier Mr Ken Maginnis MP, Ulster Unionist party security spokesman, said
the IRA planned to launch an offensive of sporadic attacks under the guise
of a breakaway group.
Stewart Dalby in Belfast writes: The possibility of such a breakaway move
had been dismissed at the weekend by Mr John Hume, leader of the Social
Democratic and Labour party.
His comments followed reports that an IRA faction based in South Armagh
would split from the organisation and resume violence by March if Britain
did not make significant constitutional concessions to the republican
movement.
He said: 'I have been at the centre of the (peace) process from the very
beginning. I can tell you there are no deadlines for the IRA, no secret
deals.'
Earlier, Mr Hume said he firmly believed the ceasefires by the IRA and the
loyalist paramilitaries would prove to be durable.
He said: 'Peace and justice in the north transcend party politics in the
south.'

FT  21 NOV 94 / Names to fight recovery of debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Groups representing loss-making Lloyd's of London members have combined to
finance a legal challenge to the insurance market's latest attempt at
recouping money owed by the members.
The Litigating Names' Committee says it has enough cash for a High Court
challenge to Lloyd's proposals for ensuring damages won in court by
lossmaking Names are used to settle their outstanding debts at the market.
The Litigating Names' Committee says its legal advice suggests that, by
trying to put itself in a preferential position ahead of other creditors,
Lloyd's is breaching fundamental principles of insolvency law.
Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, whose members
last month won substantial damages for negligence, said: 'We are confident
that the High Court will declare these changes unlawful and we urge Lloyd's
to abandon them.'

FT  21 NOV 94 / British Gas chief receives 75% pay rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, has received a 75 per cent
pay rise, taking his basic annual salary to Pounds 475,000.
The Pounds 205,000 increase, which has been backdated to the beginning of
this year, makes Mr Brown's basic pay among the highest of any UK public
company director.
Other executive directors of British Gas have also received rises of up to
50 per cent following a review by the company's non-executive directors.
The news has provoked an angry reaction from trade unions and politicians.
Mr Alastair Darling, the Labour party's City spokesman, said that the
increases were 'sheer stupidity and stand to be condemned without
reservation'.
Mr David Stirzaker, a senior official of Unison, Britain's biggest trade
union, described the salary increases as 'scandalous at a time when British
Gas is shedding more than 25,000 jobs'. He said that Unison members who
worked at British Gas had received rises of 'less than 3 per cent'.
Last week the government committed itself to introducing big changes to the
UK gas market by allowing full competition in the domestic market.
Mr Donald Macgregor, a senior official of the GMB union, said: 'Such rises
give all the wrong signals to employees at a time when there is a very
difficult task ahead restructuring the industry.' The GMB will be the lead
union in pay negotiations with British Gas due to start soon.
British Gas said yesterday that the review by the company's remuneration
committee, which includes Lord Walker, the former energy secretary,
concluded that its directors were underpaid in comparison with other
British-based international companies.
The company added: 'We are expanding internationally and need to recruit,
retain and motivate top calibre international management.'
It also said that from next year the company's annual report and accounts
would contain far greater disclosure of each director's salary package,
including details of perks such as company cars. The directors' annual bonus
scheme has been abolished and no payments will be made this year.
The executive directors' share option scheme is also to be replaced with a
scheme 'designed to reward directors for increasing shareholder value over
the long term'. However, exact details of the new scheme are yet to be
finalised and will only be revealed to shareholders next year.
The second highest paid director remains Mr Richard Giordano, British Gas's
non-executive chairman, who joined the company in January on a basic salary
of Pounds 450,000.
Three other executive directors - Mr Roy Gardner, Mr Philip Rogerson and Mr
Howard Dalton - are all now on basic salaries of Pounds 285,000 with Mr
Rogerson having had the largest increase at 50 per cent, or Pounds 95,000,
due to increased responsibilities.
Two other executives have also received increases. Mr Norman Blacker's
salary increased by Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 250,000 and Mr Russell Herbert's
pay rose from Pounds 136,000 to Pounds 170,000.

Hualon Corporation of Taiwan has denied allegations that it has been
planning to go back on its pledge not to compete directly with European
producers at its projected Belfast textiles plant.
The British Apparel and Textile Confederation last week said it would appeal
to the European Court against the European Commission's approval of Pounds
61m in government aid for the Pounds 157m project, which it said had been
given on the basis that 'production from the plant would be high-volume
goods of low added value to compete with low cost imports'.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Albion wins Perkins contract
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Albion Automotive, created by a management buy-in to take over the UK
components operations of failed truckmaker DAF, is to manufacture
crankshafts for Perkins Group, one of the world's biggest engine producers.
The deal is expected to create about 50 jobs at Albion's plant at Leyland,
Lancashire, where last November's buy-in saved 310 jobs as well as 430 at
the Albion axle plant at Scotstoun, Glasgow.
The 30,000 crankshafts a year to be supplied to Perkins compares with the
18,000 the Leyland plant makes annually for its three core customers - DAF
Trucks of the Netherlands and the UK's Leyland Trucks and van maker LDV.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports could handle an extra 30m passengers
a year if two other small airfields were developed, the Adam Smith
Institute, the free market think-tank, said in a report yesterday.
The institute said expanding RAF Northolt in Middlesex and Redhill aerodrome
in Surrey would take much pressure off Heathrow and Gatwick. The government
is already considering developing Northolt - six miles from Heathrow and
currently used for Royal Family, VIP and military flights - for business and
smaller commercial aircraft.

Camelot, the consortium organising the National Lottery, was last night
waiting for two of the seven jackpot winners in the first contest to claim
their share of the Pounds 5.8m jackpot, Michael Smith writes.
The seven were being pursued by tabloid newspapers which have offered
rewards to readers to supply information on identities.
Camelot hopes to be able to announce jackpot winners' names in the next two
days, although it can only do so with their consent.
In all 1.15m people won prizes, ranging from Pounds 10 to the Pounds 839,254
which each of the jackpot winners will receive. The total payout was more
than of Pounds 22m.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Labour to woo Tory postal rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour hopes to inflict fresh embarrassment on the government over Post
Office privatisation by inviting Tories who opposed a sell-off to back a
Commons motion giving it greater commercial freedom.
Following the government's decision not to proceed with a flotation of Royal
Mail, the letters division, Labour plans to introduce an amendment to this
year's finance bill which would demand new commercial opportunities for the
Post Office within the public sector.
In previous years the Commons has held a single vote on the entire finance
bill, which contains the main provisions of the Budget.
However, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, believes there are strong
grounds for Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, to allow an amendment
relating to the commercialisation of the Post Office in this year's bill.
He also intends to introduce an amendment calling on the government to
abandon an increase in value added tax on fuel. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, is expected to give the go-ahead to the increase in his Budget
next week.
Labour whips in the Commons believe both amendments could cause difficulties
for the government because they might be supported by a number of Tory
rebels.
Earlier this month about 12 Tory MPs wrecked the government's plan for a
majority sell-off of Royal Mail by stating that they could only support the
commercialisation option.
Mr Nicholas Winterton, the Conservative MP for Macclesfield, who was one of
the principal rebels, said last night that he might be prepared to back the
Labour amendment on the Post Office.
'I might be driven, much against my will, to support a motion that would
facilitate greater commercialisation,' he said. 'The government seem to me
to be showing a level of dogma on this issue that causes concern and
surprise.'
The call for greater commercialisation for the Post Office has been strongly
advocated by Mr John Prescott, Labour's deputy leader. He has called for the
organisation to be allowed to enter joint ventures and to enjoy greater
powers to take investment decisions.
However, the government's opposition to this was made clear at the weekend
after the leak of a memorandum from Mr David Hunt, the public service
minister, to the prime minister. In the document Mr Hunt reflected the fears
of members of the cabinet's industry committee that 'the 'Prescott option'
would seriously undermine our whole approach to privatisation'.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Blunkett backs school exam tables
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Blunkett, the shadow education secretary, yesterday risked
provoking a clash between Labour and the main teaching unions by saying that
his party would continue to implement school league tables if elected to
power.
As the government prepared to publish the third annual set of school league
tables tomorrow Mr Blunkett said Labour would seek to improve the system of
categorising schools' performance, increasing the range of information that
the tables contain.
Amid indications that Labour is willing to back some aspects of the
government's education reforms he made clear that his party would modify the
tables to add better measures of effectiveness.
He told BBC Television: 'I am in favour of information and I don't think you
can hide that information from parents.' He said the publication of the
tables must 'mean something in terms of rewarding, backing, supporting
schools that are really doing a first-rate job'.
His comments were greeted as an 'enormous U-turn' in Labour policy by Mrs
Gillian Shephard, the education secretary. She said the opposition party had
finally 'seen sense' on the issue.
Mr Blunkett continued to take a particularly hostile stance towards tax
perks for independent schools, in spite of recent indications that Labour
politicians were seeking a less confrontational approach on the issue.
In particular, he said his party would abolish tax relief and charitable
status for non-state schools.
The NASUWT teachers' union said yesterday that the league tables were
divisive and too often 'simply a device with which to whip teachers'.
Offering different sorts of league tables was 'simply asking teachers which
sort of whip they would like to be beaten with'.
The NUT, the biggest teachers' union, was more cautious, simply stressing
its opposition to tables in their present form.
Mrs Shephard reiterated that she would no longer be working towards setting
targets for the number of schools opting out of local authority control.
She said that she would be working towards creating 'a great number' but
added 'I'm not working to targets.'

FT  21 NOV 94 / Poverty in biggest cities 'has spread'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's biggest cities became concentrations of growing disadvantage in
the 1980s, a study by the Policy Studies Institute concludes today.
Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester are shown to have experienced
growth problems, with inner city deprivation spreading to nearby areas.
London, in spite of the affluence of some citizens, 'increasingly contains
the largest concentration of poverty and relative deprivation in Britain'.
On the basis of new means of defining deprivation devised by the government
recently, 17 London boroughs appear among the 30 most deprived areas in
England.
The report - a study of changes in deprived areas between 1981 and 1991 -
reaches the 'depressing conclusion' that 'government urban policies over a
decade or more have as yet had only limited success in reducing disadvantage
in the most deprived urban areas'.
Employment opportunities in deprived areas are shown to be affected far more
by general levels of activity in the national economy than by initiatives
such as government task forces, 'however valuable they may have been'.
The study shows that the capital's unemployment rates rose more than 50 per
cent between 1981 and 1991.

FT  21 NOV 94 / War in Angola barely affects oil industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The war which has left most of Angola's economy in ruins has barely affected
the oil industry, which this year has hit new production highs, reports
Robert Corzine.
A new deep-water field off the coast of the Cabinda enclave is about to
begin production, taking Angola's daily output up to about 600,000 barrels a
day of generally high quality oil, well up on the 1993 average of 512,000
b/d.
The consistent rise in output has been achieved in spite of fighting earlier
this year which destroyed some oil storage and loading facilities around the
coastal town of Soyo, just south of Cabinda.
Part of the reason why the oil industry has proved so resilient is the fact
that much of the production is from offshore fields beyond the range of
land-based artillery.
The growing use of offshore processing and tanker loading facilities means
oil no longer needs to be piped ashore before being exported, mainly to the
US.
Although the war has not disrupted the industry, a political settlement
would probably encourage a faster pace of development.
Many companies, for example, are keen to explore further in the onshore
areas of Cabinda. But the threat of attacks from a Cabindan separatist group
has prevented them from carrying out seismic studies and other exploration
activities.
A good deal of exploration is taking place offshore, however. Earlier this
week the Angolan news agency Angop reported that Elf Aquitaine, of France
had discovered an oil field 130km off the coast.
Other companies, including Chevron of the US, are optimistic that the deep
water areas now being licensed will prove as prolific as those in shallower
waters.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Prospects for peace in Angola remained uncertain last night despite the
signing of an agreement to end the country's 19-year civil war which has
cost half a million lives.
A warm handshake between Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos and General
Eugenio Manuvakola, who signed on behalf of the Unita rebel movement, did
little to allay fears aroused by the absence from the ceremony of its
leader, Mr Jonas Savimbi.
The agreement, in which the warring parties pledge a ceasefire with effect
from midnight tomorrow, envisages the integration of Unita forces into the
army, a coalition government and fresh national elections, which will be
monitored by a 7,000-strong United Nations force.
Although the UN will be relieved that the signing took place, the occasion
fell well short of what had been planned. President dos Santos delegated the
signing of the document to his foreign minister and the government
delegation outnumbered the three-member Unita team led by Gen Manuvakola,
Unita's secretary general and chief negotiator.
The official programme for the ceremony, held in Lusaka's Mulungushi
conference hall and attended by African leaders and senior western
officials, listed Mr Savimbi as one of the participants. But over the
weekend Unita officials said that an Angolan government military offensive
launched a fortnight ago would prevent Mr Savimbi from attending.
Although Gen Manuvakola said yesterday that Unita intended to implement the
deal, Mr Savimbi has yet to make his position clear. A 1991 peace agreement,
negotiated by US and Soviet Union diplomats, collapsed after Mr Savimbi
refused to accept defeat by President dos Santos' MPLA party in the
following year's election.
The renewed conflict has left Angola even more bitterly divided but the
recent MPLA offensive may have left the government with the upper hand, with
some generals said to be calling for a further push.
Government forces recently captured the Unita stronghold of Huambo, 530km
south-east of the capital, Luanda. The offensive forced the postponement of
the signing, originally due to take place last Tuesday, and may yet imperil
the agreement. Privately some western diplomats wonder whether they should
have been more forceful in urging restraint on Luanda, but are letting
Africa take the initiative.
Southern African leaders who attended the signing are understood to have
warned Mr Savimbi that they are prepared to offer military assistance to the
MPLA government if they decide he is to blame should the peace process
collapse a second time.
Nicholas Shaxson adds from Luanda: Both sides in Angola have access to
substantial funds should war resume. The government is pumping around
Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.5bn) a year of offshore oil. Unita still controls
much of the north-eastern diamond trade, last year worth some Dollars 250m,
despite substantial advances by government forces this year. Mr Savimbi has
an old ally in President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, Angola's northern
neighbour.
Recent US Republican electoral victories will revive the influence of Unita
friends, such as Senator Jesse Helms, incoming chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, who formerly encouraged military support for Mr
Savimbi.
The government has ceded to Unita three second-rate provincial governorships
as well as four minor ministries. But key governorships including Luanda,
Huambo, Benguela and diamond-rich Lunda Norte, as well as the ministries of
defence, interior, economy and petroleum, will remain in MPLA hands.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Islamic fundamentalists force Arafat to remove his kid
gloves: Julian Ozanne assesses the Palestinian leader's position after
Friday's killings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yassir Arafat's Palestinian self-rule authority is fighting a battle with
a resurgent Islamic opposition for the minds and hearts of Palestinians in
the Gaza Strip. Although far from over, it is a battle he is so far losing.
Mounting confrontation between the authority and the Hamas Islamic
Resistance and Islamic Jihad - the two Islamic militant groups opposed to
peace with Israel - has strengthened the hand of Mr Arafat's opponents.
Exploiting Mr Arafat's apparent weakness and his inability to deliver on
promises of Palestinian liberation, the Islamic opposition has openly
challenged the Palestinian leader's authority on the streets of Gaza,
culminating in last Friday's killing of 13 Palestinians in internal
violence.
'There has been a big increase in support for Hamas,' says Mr Raji Sourani,
head of the Gaza Rights and Law office. 'But it's important to distinguish
support for their actions against support for their long-term goals. Few
Palestinians want to see an Islamic state but there is increasing
frustration and anger about a lack of progress and the Islamic groups are
using it.'
Hamas and Jihad have vowed to continue attacks on Israel until the Jewish
state is forced to surrender all occupied Arab land from the Jordan river to
the Mediterranean sea. Many Palestinians see Hamas and Jihad attacks as
legitimate resistance to Israeli occupation and are increasingly
discontented, with Mr Arafat who is locked into a peace process which
appears to many Palestinians to be going nowhere. Hamas and Jihad leaders
know that attacks against Israel win them support.
'The peace agreement has deprived Palestinians of their rights and it is our
right to resist occupation,' says Sheikh Abdullah Shammi, a leader of
Islamic Jihad. 'We are going to continue attacks against Jews anywhere and
make them feel they can have no security on our land, and we know this is
going to make us stronger with the Palestinian people because we are now the
only hope for Palestinian rights.'
In the aftermath of Friday's killings both Jihad and Hamas have tried to
portray themselves as the victims of oppression by Mr Arafat. In a culture
steeped in the political and religious values of martyrdom, the deaths are
likely to add to the appeal of the Islamic groups.
Publicly Hamas and Jihad deny they are seeking confrontation with the
Palestinian Authority and are anxious to rule out the threat of civil war.
Since Friday Islamic leaders have urged their supporters to step back from
violent conflict with Mr Arafat and turn their guns on Israel.
'Nobody can push us to a civil war,' said Sheikh Abdullah Izak of Islamic
Jihad. 'There will be more military activities against Israel but we don't
want confrontation with the authority. Arafat and the authority are our
brothers.'
But political observers believe that much of Hamas rhetoric is for internal
consumption because they do not want to be perceived by Palestinians as
challenging the authority and risking civil war. They are determined to
sabotage Mr Arafat's rule and force him into confrontation because they see
the authority and the peace agreement as an obstacle to liberating the
historical land of Palestine.
'The Islamic movement is greedy for power but it is not sure that they have
yet decided to go for power,' says Mr Sourani. 'They don't think like other
political groups in terms of ultimate political goals. For them it is quite
enough to go along with the struggle, which could take generations. It might
involve destroying Arafat and if there is chaos they don't mind so long as
they can keep the struggle alive and openly confront Israel.'
Furthermore the Islamic movement is diverse and often speaks with different
voices. While some leaders have called for dialogue and reconciliation,
others have said it is impossible to reach a modus vivendi with the
Authority.
Since his return to Gaza five months ago Mr Arafat has treated the Islamic
opposition with kid gloves against the advice of hardliners such as Gen Nasr
Yussuf, overall Palestinian military commander. Like his opponents he has
been anxious to avoid the possibility of civil war. But his authority has
been so openly flouted that before Friday's confrontation it was beginning
to look as if he was not in control of the streets.
Senior advisers to Mr Arafat say that unless the Authority cracks down
further they will be drawn into a battle which could attract Islamic
activists from the region who will see Gaza as a soft target.
It is a fear which is shared in neighbouring Egypt. President Hosni Mubarak
warned on Friday that 'without giving the Palestinians hope, Gaza could
become a base for destabilisation that will affect not only the Middle East.
. . It is going to affect Europe. It is very easy to go from here to Europe
especially as you have cells of fundamentalists all over Europe now.'
Mr Arafat yesterday called for national unity but said he would not allow
any force from outside to harm the Palestinian dream. The Authority has
repeatedly said since Friday that outside elements provoked the conflict, a
tacit reference to extremist groups in Syria and Iranian Islamic
fundamentalists.
As if to prove the claim, angry Iranian students protested outside the
Palestinian mission in Tehran yesterday calling Mr Arafat a tool of Zionism.
A leading Iranian cleric said revenge should be taken against Israel and the
US but that 'Arafat and his clique come next in line to be punished'.
Since Friday there has been a stand-off between the Palestinian authority
and the Islamic groups, mediated by Israeli Arabs and independent
Palestinians. But Mr Sourani warns: 'Neither side can afford to retreat
because one step backward means a loss of control.' Both sides are carefully
weighing the risks of further violence.

FT  21 NOV 94 / EU to monitor progress of Tokyo trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union will monitor the implementation of US-Japanese trade
accords to ensure they conform with multilateral trading rules and do not
unfairly exclude third countries.
The move was agreed at an annual EU-Japan ministerial meeting in Tokyo over
the weekend, in which the European Commission also told the Japanese
government that Brussels expected to see Japan's current account surplus
fall from last year's 3.1 per cent of gross domestic product to 2 per cent
by 1996. Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the finance minister, said the figure was
reasonable, but could not accept a date.
Sir Leon Brittan, European commissioner for external economic relations and
trade and leader of the three-Commissioner negotiating team, stressed that
the EU was not seeking a target for the surplus, in line with its continuing
aversion to the US strategy of seeking to pin Tokyo to precise figures on
opening its markets.
It was simply an expectation based on the Japanese government's economic
policies, said Sir Leon.
'We have made progress on many items,' he said, referring to a series of
Japanese market-opening measures announced by the government over the
weekend.
The meeting marks the EU's growing anxiety to ensure that European
businesses are not cut out of trade deals negotiated by the US, in the
18-month old economic framework talks between Tokyo and Washington. These
cover a wide range of sectors that include important European competitors,
including cars and car parts, telecommunications and financial services.
The EU, for its part, was not seeking concessions for European business to
the exclusion of others, but felt certain it could increase its share of the
Japanese market 'given the proper opportunities', said Sir Leon.
Mr Yohei Kono, the foreign minister, assured Sir Leon that Japanese trade
accords with the US would automatically be extended to other trade partners.
Sir Leon feared that Japanese private sector companies might, despite this,
still feel under political pressure to buy US cellular telephones, aircraft
and car parts, rather than equally competitive European ones.
In response, Mr Kono promised to remind Japanese private companies that they
were free to choose foreign suppliers on purely commercial grounds. However,
the government declined the Commission's request to monitor jointly the fair
implementation of trade deals with the US, with the result that Tokyo and
Brussels will monitor US-Japan trade in parallel. The Japanese government
will keep the Commission informed of further progress in its US trade talks.
The EU had no plans to revive its failed attempt to launch trilateral trade
talks with the US and Japan, said Sir Leon. The weekend ministerial meeting
had shown it was possible to make progress under present arrangements, he
said.

FT  21 NOV 94 / International Press Review: Little Prince pays a call -
Argentina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The arrival of the 'Little Prince', as some Argentine papers refer to
Britain's Duke of York, was by no means the only news story in town. The
official royal visit, the first since the 1982 Falklands war between
Argentina and Britain, vied for space with a political brawl over allegedly
extortionate telephone tariffs, the hotting-up of presidential elections
and, most notably, continued back-biting over government budgetary woes.
The last item was slapped across the front pages after President Carlos
Menem decreed a freeze on all public spending for the rest of the year.
Journalists inevitably produced reams asking if the state machine was about
to grind to a halt: would government officials have sufficient supplies of
coffee and toilet paper to last them until Christmas? Who was going to pay
for the president's forthcoming trip to Syria?
But the duke held his own against such feisty competition, even making the
front-page following flag-burning demonstrations outside the British
embassy.
The press was torn between whether to treat the visit as a serious news item
or to view it as a somewhat frivolous exercise in bilateral protocol.
'Twelve years after the Malvinas war, Menem received the Little Prince of
the British throne in an act of reconciliation: they played golf, they
exchanged military uniforms and today they will inaugurate the Canning
statue,' the daily Pagina/12 highlighted on its front page. Almost as an
afterthought, it added: '27 arrested and 5 wounded in protests.'
Not that the symbolism of the royal presence was lost on anyone,
particularly after recent controversy over Argentina's alleged proposal to
pay Falkland islanders up to Dollars 1.5m (Pounds 915m) each to give up
their British citizenship. 'The inhabitants of the Malvinas view the visit
with unease,' said Ambito Financiero. 'The apparently growing possibility of
a reconciliation between both countries makes them fear for the eventual
sovereignty of the islands.'
Ample coverage was also given to Argentine disquiet at the return of the
prince, who participated in the war as a helicopter pilot. El Cronista aired
the opinions of Radical deputy Raul Galvan, who 'exhorted the government not
to exaggerate in the honours bestowed upon the prince, because this 'would
signify a lack of respect to those who died in the Malvinas''.
Newspapers also focused on potential tension over the duke's visit to the
former naval base of the General Belgrano cruiser, 'sunk by the British
outside the exclusion zone'.
La Nacion said: 'A contradictory mood was expected among navy officials,
with many hinting that they would refuse to shake hands with the British
prince or to comply with the military salute.' It said, though, that most
Argentines were less worked up about fraternising with a former enemy.
'While some of those on the left and the right deplore the visit. . . for
most people the arrival of the prince does not constitute an important topic
of conversation (because) it reminds them of an incident they would prefer
to forget.'
The Falklands theme was not forgotten, though by the end of the week it had
shifted to the reported sacking of Argentina's ambassador to London. Mr
Mario Campora was said to have lost his job for criticising the plan to buy
back the islands - known locally as 'Menem's bribe' - on the grounds that
you should not pay for what was already yours by right.
The sovereignty buy-back idea, originally put forward by British prime
ministerial adviser Sir Alan Walters, has by and large been ridiculed. In
particular, Pagina/12 ran an article shortly before the duke's arrival in
which the Falklanders were represented by a photograph of penguins dressed
up in top-hats and tails. The paper felt that the 'kelpers' were basically
immune to Argentina's charm offensive. 'The foreign minister acts like a man
trying to seduce a woman. He will not be disheartened even though he is
slapped on the face at each hint.'
The article said Falkland-Argentine relations had perhaps been irreversibly
ruined by the conflict.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Japanese drinks regime comes under fire again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's practice of taxing its domestically produced shochu spirit more
lightly than whisky, gin and other internationally made drinks comes under
attack again today, writes Roderick Oram, Consumer Industries Editor.
In two days of talks with Japanese officials in Tokyo, a delegation of
producers from the EU, the US and Sweden will urge the government to use its
1995/96 budget to harmonise its liquor taxes. Seven years ago, Japan
accepted the finding by a Gatt panel that its taxes discriminated against
non-shochu drinks, but so far it has only partly amended them. Whisky and
brandy are still taxed between four and seven times more heavily than
shochu.
Shochu's share of the distilled drinks market has risen from 61 per cent in
1989 to 74 per cent today, according to Mr Tim Jackson of the Scotch Whisky
Association, who is leading the delegation. Imported drinks account for only
8 per cent of the market, compared with more than 30 per cent in most other
developed countries.

<TEXT>
The United Nations' top human rights official, Mr Jose Ayala Lasso,
preferred to play the diplomat rather then the judge when he visited Cuba at
the invitation of the government last week. The three-day visit was the
first to Latin America by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights since he
took up the newly created post this year. He stressed his visit was
primarily aimed at opening up a dialogue with the Cuban authorities, but he
made a point of meeting political dissidents as well as senior members of
Cuba's one-party communist government. He said that he had urged the
government to ratify existing human rights conventions, such as the
Convention against Torture. But he also noted that economic conditions were
inseparable from human rights and clearly endorsed a UN general assembly
motion calling for the lifting of a longstanding US economic embargo against
Cuba.

violent response by Eta supporters, who rioted in protest, served to dash

Volvo, the Swedish car and commercial vehicle maker, is to establish a truck
assembly plant in Poland. The plant, which will be located in Wroclaw, will
have a capacity to assemble up to 1,000 heavy and medium-duty trucks a year.
Volvo trucks have been assembled hitherto in Poland by Jelcz, the Polish
truck maker, but this agreement expires at the end of the year. The Swedish
group said that it would be moving equipment, tools and personnel from the
Jelcz facilities to Wroclaw, where it planned to produce more than 700
trucks in 1995. Volvo is the leading importer of heavy-duty trucks to Poland
and expects to deliver around 550 units this year. It has established a new
marketing and finance company during 1994 and has a network of 10 dealers
selling exclusively Volvo vehicles.

Saudi Arabia and Russia, which established full diplomatic relations after

strengthen trade ties. The agreement was signed during a two-day visit to
Saudia Arabia by Russian prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin, who held talks
with King Fahd and Saudi officials and businessmen. Russian officials said
that the agreement would open the door for specific deals on trade,
economics culture, technology and sport. They said that they also hoped for
closer political ties. Diplomats in the region said that Mr Chernomyrdin,
who is on a tour of Gulf countries, was keen to reassure wealthy Gulf Arabs
suspicious of Moscow's ties with Baghdad that Russia would not develop them
at the expense of relations with other states. Moscow has been leading a
campaign in the UN Security Council to ease sanctions on Baghdad imposed
after its 1990 invasion.

<TEXT>
Quebec has shelved its controversial CDollars 13bn (Pounds 5.8bn) Great
Whale hydro-electric project indefinitely. 'Great Whale is on ice for a good
long while and we don't need it now,' said Quebec's premier Jacques
Parizeau, whose separatist Parti Quebecois government won the September 12
provincial election. He promised a new review of Quebec's energy needs. The
decision on the 3,100MW project was welcomed by environmentalists and by the
Quebec Cree Indian leader, Mr Matthew Coon Crome. The Great Whale river,
running into Hudson Bay and its huge watershed, would have been dammed. A
big area in the ancestral lands claimed by the Cree, who have fought the
project since 1985, would have been flooded.
Labour and business groups warned of job losses, saying they would soon
lobby again in support of the project. Great Whale, 700 miles north of
Montreal, was to have followed the James Bay hydro development just south of
it. James Bay, now being completed, adds about 13,000MW to Quebec's power
capacity for CDollars 20bn. Quebec, Canada's second biggest province, has
total generating capacity of more than 30,000MW - almost all hydro. The
Great Whale project received a heavy blow in 1992, when New York state
cancelled 20-year supply options worth at least CDollars 17bn. Quebec could
not finance Great Whale without guaranteed exports to underwrite
international bond issues. Also, the slow economic growth in the
north-eastern US and in eastern Canada has reduced the need for more power
capacity.

Brazil's armed forces sealed off seven of Rio de Janeiro's shanty towns over
the weekend in a move one military commander described as 'psychological
intimidation' of the city's drug traffickers, Angus Foster writes from Sao
Paulo.
The exercises, which involved more than 1,000 troops and police, were the
biggest since the federal government last month gave the military control
over rounding up Rio's drug kings. The city's police force, widely corrupted
by drug money, had lost control of Rio's several hundred shanty towns to the
traffickers.
The armed forces' movements encountered almost no resistance and were
largely welcomed by residents.
The government decided to use troops partly because of a massacre of 13
shanty town residents by police last month.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Dole hopes for deal on trade pact

<TEXT>
Senator Robert Dole, Republican leader in the US Senate, yesterday said he
was close to a deal with the administration on passage of the Uruguay Round
implementing legislation this year.
Mr Dole is considered the key to approval of the Round; some lobbyists say
he can bring 12 Republican votes with him. Sixty out of 100 votes are needed
for passage of a budget rule, which would clear the legislation for floor
action. Even with Mr Dole's support, the vote is expected to be close.
Appearing on a television news programme yesterday, he also suggested
Congress would not support a renewal of 'fast track' legislation next year.
This could kill administration plans to negotiate further trade agreements
with Chile and other Latin American nations.
The so-called 'fast track' is a promise by Congress that it will vote trade
agreements up or down, without attempting to amend them. The administration
was unable to get fast track renewal attached to the Uruguay Round
implementing legislation this year, even with Democrat control of Congress.
Mr Dole met administration officials at the weekend and threw a new demand
on the negotiating table. He has asked for 'assurances' from Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, the treasury secretary, which would ease passage of a cut in the
capital gains tax rate next year.
As a potential candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 1996
Mr Dole is struggling to satisfy the concerns of the Republican right wing
that the WTO would mean a loss of US sovereignty.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Small steps forward for European exporters: William Dawkins
at the sixth EU-Japan ministerial meeting in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Satisfaction but not euphoria was how Sir Leon Brittan, the European Trade
Commissioner, described his mood after the sixth EU-Japan annual ministerial
meeting on Saturday.
Sir Leon and his two colleagues, Mrs Christiane Scrivener, in charge of tax
and customs, and Mr Rene Steichen, responsible for agriculture, returned to
Brussels yesterday with a briefcase half-full of small, yet concrete, trade
prizes designed to help European exporters make their way in the Japanese
market.
Individually, the fruits of the commissioners' visit are as technical and
low-profile as the components of Europe's attempt to achieve economic
integration - a process which may have lessons for Japan's present halting
steps to economic deregulation.
Yet in total, the outcome is enough, Sir Leon claimed, to show that Europe's
diplomatic style of trade negotiations with Japan is bringing results. That
message is intended to soothe any European executives who suspect they are
being cut out of Japanese trade deals achieved by their US competitors
through threats of unilateral action from Washington.
The EU trade prizes are: A Tokyo declaration that it wishes private sector
companies to allow no political considerations to influence commercial
decisions. Given the traditional power of nods and winks from Tokyo, this
could carry real weight, if backed up by bureaucrats in the ministries
concerned.
Tokyo is to negotiate with Brussels, starting immediately, on recognition of
each others' industrial certification and product tests. The EU is the first
trade partner with which Japan has had such talks. Japan has agreed that
imported food can carry 'use by' dates, rather than the date of manufacture,
as proposed in its most recent deregulation package, in July.
Japan will accept Japanese standards certificates issued by EU bodies, for
textiles imports.
Imports of high-quality EU linen will be permitted to carry labels
differentiating them from inferior competition.
European exporters of 400 electrical appliances will be able to certify
themselves as safe under Japanese standards from next year, rather than have
their goods tested in Japan.
On top of this, the Commissioners patted their hosts on the back for
progress in opening the Japanese market since the last ministerial meeting
in January 1993. They were especially pleased with a plan for clearer public
procurement rules, tighter laws against bid-rigging, and a recent boost to
the staff and operating guidelines of the formerly toothless Fair Trade
Commission.
Sir Leon pointed out that there was still a long way to go on other trade
gripes with Japan, such as the continuing wide gap in tax on imported and
Japanese spirits. Financial deregulation had not gone far enough and there
was still a large number of official curbs on large stores, said a EU
report.
While Japan's trade surplus with the US has continued to rise, by 9.4 per
cent to Dollars 44.29bn (Pounds 27bn) in the first 10 months of this year,
its surplus with the EU is in its second year of decline, perhaps evidence
that Europe's polite approach pays. Japan's surplus with the EU fell by 19.5
per cent to Dollars 18.55bn in the 10 months to October.
Sir Leon firmly denies that the EU is tempted by the US strategy of trying
to pin Japan down to targets for import market share or the reduction of its
current account surplus to a certain ratio of gross domestic product.
Yet the EU team's official 'expectation' that Japan's surplus would fall
substantially by next year indicates that it wishes to apply at least polite
pressure. 'We should not be starry-eyed. . . and yet we should not be overly
cynical,' said Sir Leon.

FT  21 NOV 94 / UK Navy welcomes wider Bosnia role: Bruce Clark gets a taste
of the gruelling schedule aboard HMS Invincible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fighter pilots on the Invincible, the British Navy's 20,000 tonne aircraft
carrier on patrol in the Adriatic yesterday added a strip of Serb-held
territory in Croatia to their potential theatre of operations after
receiving instructions from Nato.
Capt Richard Hastilow, the ship's commander, welcomed the prospect of
playing a wider role in policing the skies over the embattled north Bosnian
enclave of Bihac. The captain hoped it would be possible to deter Serb
aircraft from making further air attacks on Bihac from Croatian territory.
As the crisis in Bihac has unfolded over the last few days, the rise in
adrenalin levels among the 1,200-strong crew of the Invincible has been
perceptible but not dramatic, perhaps because they are already working so
near the limits of their capacity.
Ever since the carrier was deployed in the Adriatic three months ago, its
nine fighter pilots have been committed to a gruelling work schedule, with
pairs of Sea Harrier aircraft policing the Bosnian skies every few hours.
Engineers work eight hours on, eight hours off to maintain the Sea Harriers
and Sea King helicopters. In the rare moments when there are no duties over
Bosnia, pilots and seamen test one another's skills by staging mock battles
in which Harriers swoop towards the ship, and the crew go through the
motions of defending themselves by unleashing Sea Dart missiles.
Their tasks, routinely assigned by Nato, include enforcing the no-fly zone
over Bosnia - which could mean shooting down any aircraft which refuses to
leave - preparing for possible air raids in support of UN ground troops, and
old fashioned aerial reconnaissance.
Aircraft based on the Invincible also play some part in enforcing the arms
embargo against the former Yugoslav republics; and officers on board are
confident that the ban on arms deliveries to Bosnia can still be enforced,
despite the recent change of US policy.
The US is continuing to provide its allies with basic information against
sea traffic in the Adriatic, although its own ships will not stop arms going
to Bosnia if they find any. Both the Invincible and the Sea Harriers were
designed for very different roles in cold war times. The carrier was
intended for air defence in the Atlantic, with its helicopters engaging in
anti-submarine warfare and early warning tasks. But the carrier has adapted
well to the newly discovered art of 'off-shore peace-keeping'.
The tactics of Gen Sir Michael Rose, the British army officer who is head of
UN ground forces in Bosnia - and his insistence is on making only sparing
use of air power - are very well understood on board the Invincible. 'We are
not gung-ho about this,' says Capt Hastilow.
Thanks to a continuous exchange of liaison officers between land and shore,
the peace-keeping doctrine evolved by British forces in Bosnia - which
favours consensus over constraint, wherever possible - is as staunchly
professed by seamen and pilots as it is by ground troops.
To use one of the favourite metaphors of Gen Rose, soldiers sailors and
airmen are 'singing from the same hymn sheet'.
Ironically enough the carrier was not deployed in the Adriatic with the
intention of becoming more deeply embroilled in the Bosnian conflict. If
anything the opposite is true.
While the ship is currently providing services to Nato, officers on the
Invincible are highly conscious of the 'national task' of pulling out
British ground forces which would be their top priority in any dramatic
deterioration of the Bosnian crisis. But the insistence with which officers
on the Invincible discuss the moment when 'national tasks' might take over
is a reminder of how quickly the alliance solidarity could unscramble if its
members continue to disagree over Bosnia.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Kuchma to discuss Chernobyl closure
</HEADLINE>

   KIEV

<TEXT>
Ukraine will present a new plan to shut down the Chernobyl nuclear power
station during President Leonid Kuchma's summit in Washington this week,
senior Ukrainian government officials said at the weekend.
Ukraine will seek western financing of Dollars 1.49bn (Pounds 90m) to
decommission the plant, Dollars 2bn to finish work on three Soviet-era
reactors elsewhere in the country and Dollars 3bn to build two western-type
units near the Chernobyl site, they said.
In turn, Ukraine would cover up to Dollars 6bn in other costs associated
with shutting down Chernobyl - site in 1986 of the world's worst nuclear
accident - including constructing a new sarcophagus to encase the damaged
fourth reactor, according to Mr Mikhail Umanets, head of Ukraine's nuclear
power authority.
The proposal, on its face, falls short of conditions sought by the Group of
Seven leading industrialised countries this summer. Ukraine does not agree
immediately to close one of the two operating reactors at Chernobyl and does
not set a timetable.
The Chernobyl reactors can be closed only once the western-style plant is
built, Ukrainian officials said. Work on restarting a third Chernobyl
reactor, badly damaged by fire in 1991, continues.
'After ratifying (the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty last week), we want
the west to endorse this course,' said Mr Umanets, citing a deal the US and
Japan struck with North Korea earlier this year to build new plants. 'A
better option is hard to find.'
Mr Dmytro Tabachnyk, head of the president's administration, appealed for
support - especially from the EU - and pointed to Ukrainian willingness to
meet western states halfway.
Ukraine's government this month approved an energy sector overhaul drawn up
with World Bank help. The steps, including electricity price increases for
industry and household consumers, are aimed at more efficient energy use and
lessened dependence on Russian and Turkmen imports.
The EU states, led by Germany and France, have sought Chernobyl's closure
after Ukraine's parliament last year voted to keep it open and the
government last February secretly decided to restart work on the third
fire-damaged reactor.
At the Naples summit this summer, the Group of Seven leading industrial
nations pledged Dollars 200m in initial grants for shutdown if Ukraine
accepted its action plan. The EU, viewing Chernobyl as of paramount concern,
also offered Dollars 480m in loans and Dollars 115m in grant aid at the
Corfu summit this summer. Additional support would come from the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank.
Ukraine's government, after committing itself to eventual shutdown in April,
dismissed the aid as insufficient.
The US has worked to bridge differences.
Mr William White, the US deputy secretary of energy, last week hinted at a
breakthrough in Washington. 'Stay tuned,' he said. 'The energy sector and
Chernobyl in particular will be a big part of the summit agenda.'

FT  21 NOV 94 / Far left and right make running in Krasnodar: A poll battle
in south Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Battles for the regional and city parliaments in Krasnodar Krai, southern
Russia, are a microcosm of the disorder among Russia's democrats and the
organisational strength of the far right and left. The party campaigns
leading up to yesterday's election - the results of which will be known
today or tomorrow - have been dominated by two groups, both of which fielded
some 30 candidates: on the left, the hardline Communists united in a group
named Otechestvo, or fatherland; and on the far-right, the Liberal
Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), led by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
The far-left groups which make up Otechestvo were able to put aside their
sectarian differences, though they proved to be too extreme for the official
Russian Communist party, which ran separately.
Mr Igor Kolomiitsev, editor of the Kubansky Kurier, one of the main regional
papers which enthusiastically supports the LDPR says the party has several
leading members but that they all 'submit to the leadership of Vladimir
Volfovitch (Zhirinovsky). We have one leader, because we know that he is the
person people know and they will vote for us through him'.
Mr Alexander Kovalov, an organiser for the liberal Russia's Choice party,
led nationally by the former prime minister, Mr Yegor Gaidar, said: 'We
tried to unite but the people in Moscow won't have it. Each of them wants
the president's chair.' This view was illustrated by the absence of
democratic leaders in the campaign.
The local administration also put forward some 30 candidates to the regional
and city parliaments under the banner of 'Our Group, Our home'. A leading
light of that group is the city's mayor, Mr Valery Samoilenko who was fired
last week by President Boris Yeltsin for his 'refusal to fulfil the
president's decrees'. Local opinion was divided on whether this would harm
him, or increase his popularity.
Besides controlling the Kurier newspaper, the Zhirinovsky faction also
produces a party paper called Pravda Zhirinovskovo (Zhirinovsky's Truth) and
runs a local television station, M Studio, which last week was running and
re-running videos of Mr Zhirinovsky's tours of the area.
Mr Kolomiitsev says a group of wealthy local entrepreneurs have given
financial support to the LDPR. They support the party organisation, and put
up the money for, and advertise on, the television station.
'The main issues here,' he says, 'are crime and corruption: crime associated
with the immigrants who have come here from the Caucasus because of the
wars, and the corruption of the local administration. This is a special
area. A great deal of oil and metals goes out of the port of Novorossiysk;
the people in power take a slice of that and put it in bank accounts in
Cyprus.'
It was corruption, says Mr Kolomiitsev, which turned him from a democrat to
an avid supporter of Mr Zhirinovsky. He had collected a dossier on the local
administration, and went last November to Moscow to present it to President
Yeltsin. After a series of appointments with officials, he was told by a
fellow petitioner - with a similar dossier  - from Irkutsk that the latter's
evidence had persuaded Mr Yeltsin to sign an order dismissing a top area
official, only to revoke it two days later.
'I understood there was no good going on. I had an introduction to Vladimir
Volfovich from his local leaders. I went to see him and was immediately
shown in and had a long talk. . . . I became a member and never regretted
it. I think Russia needs a period of order - not fascism, not camps - but a
period where the guilty are punished.'
This sentiment is widespread in Krasnodar. Nikolai, a pensioner who would
not give his last name, made a torrent of complaints about migrants and
about crime. 'They have no fear of punishment,' he said. 'At least in
Stalin's time you could be sure of equality and of fear before the law. Now
you need someone in power who says, right, you're guilty, you've murdered,
you will be shot. Do that three or four times and you'll have peace.' For
all his robust views, Nikolai supports not the Communists or the LDPR, but
Yabloko, the reformist group led by Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, which fielded six
candidates
The liberal parties, too, have had to take note of local sentiment. Russia's
Choice, according to Mr Kovalev, has three principles: the clean-up of local
government and publication of the budget; unity among Kuban Cossack
organisations; and 'protection of Russian speakers'. Mr Kovalov says that
'there are many peoples living here peacefully - but the migrants who have
come in from the struggles in the Causcasus cause huge problems.'
Businessman Sergei Frolov, of the Economic Freedom party, who has spent
Rbs20m of his own money on the campaign, says: 'I don't talk to people about
economic reform, they don't understand these things. I talk about ensuring
water supply, getting new trams, getting stable prices'.
'We need a sense of our own history. We need to create a middle class and
property rights. People don't understand this. But they will respond to
people of character and energy: everything depends on the individual in our
politics.'
Mr Kolomiitsev agrees, but draws a different moral. 'It's not like the west
. . . Here everything is myth, rumour. People believe the opposite of what
they hear from the authorities. They respect strong characters. That helps
us now, which is why we're winning.'

FT  21 NOV 94 / Financial stability 'Russia's priority': Chubais spells out
new phase of development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Anatoly Chubais, Russia's newly-appointed first deputy prime minister,
yesterday said the country was entering a new phase of economic development
with a strong government team in place to reduce inflation, encourage
investment and achieve financial stability.
Mr Chubais said: 'The explicit instruction of President Yeltsin is that 1995
should be the new stage of Russian economic reform and that we have to reach
the goal that was not reached by the reformers since the end of 1991 . . .
Privatisation has been achieved. Stabilisation is not yet achieved.'
Mr Chubais, the former privatisation minister who has now emerged as the
standard bearer of liberal economic reforms, said both President Boris
Yeltsin and Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, were committed to
the 1995 budget, which aims to bring down the monthly inflation rate to 1-2
per cent by the year-end.
'It seems to me that until now the personal role of Prime Minister
Chernomyrdin, his fundamental change of Russian economic policies is still
underestimated and misunderstood in the west. His role is crucial and
extremely important. Now we have the strong support of Chernomyrdin and of
Yeltsin,' he said.
Mr Chubais said support from the International Monetary Fund would be
'crucial' if stabilisation was to work and said he was prepared to change
some budget details to respond to its concerns.
However, Mr Chubais foresaw a fight with the Duma (the lower house of
parliament) to enact the budget and accepted the need for compromise. 'We
could discuss the structure of the government expenditure. We could discuss
the sources of the non-inflationary way of covering the deficit of the
budget. But I will not accept changes of principle to the budget,' he said.
The government would not waiver over its commitments to reduce inflation to
its set targets and to refrain from issuing any central bank credits to fund
the budget deficit and from contemplating any rise in government spending on
the military and agricultural sectors.
The government would also attach a high priority to encouraging greater
domestic and foreign investment, Mr Chubais said. 'The main thing which
should be done is first financial stabilisation. People will never invest if
they have 15 per cent per month inflation. And the second also fundamental
task is to reform the Russian security market infrastructure,' he said.
Mr Chubais said the Russia's domestic savings had increased from Rbs5
trillion (thousand billion) in January to Rbs15 trillion in July. 'The
population is ready to invest but has no ideas what is the reasonable way to
invest. That is why they are using MMM. But I would like them to invest not
in MMM but in the small machine building factory in Kaluga,' he said.
Mr Chubais also met with western business leaders yesterday to discuss ways
of encouraging foreign investment. The meeting discussed ways of introducing
a more predictable and stable tax regime and of promoting Russia's access to
international markets.

FT  21 NOV 94 / European factories 'outclassed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only one in 50 European manufacturers are genuinely 'world class' - yet
three out of four believe they can compete with the best of their
international rivals, according to a four-country survey published today.
The apparent gap between companies' perceptions of their competitiveness and
the reality is revealed in 'Made in Europe' by Mr Philip Hanson of IBM
Consulting Group and Professor Chris Voss of London Business School. Their
study of more than 650 factories in Finland, Germany, the Netherlands and
Britain is billed as the largest and most comprehensive of manufacturing
practice and performance in northern Europe.
The findings have important implications for manufacturers. 'The best in
Europe is equal to the best in the world,' says Prof Voss. 'But the
challenge for Europe is to bring all companies up to this standard. In too
many companies and sectors in all countries, inertia and complacency are the
main enemies, but there are also success stories.'
Germany, the Netherlands and Britain have similar numbers of world class
manufacturers, but overall, the UK comes bottom of the four in both practice
and performance. This is because it has a much longer 'tail' of poorly
performing companies, depressing its overall position.
Using a strongly Japanese-influenced model developed by London Business
School, the study found just 14 of the 663 sites were world class, as
measured by qualities ranging from executive vision to effective use of
'lean' production techniques and manufacturing systems.
The performance is disappointing, say the authors. However, 46 per cent of
the factories came in the next best category, and, with determination, could
become world class.
Throughout the four countries, the self-opinion of international
competitiveness runs well ahead of evidence of world class best practice,
says the study. And those close to being world class were much more
realistic than less advanced companies. There was also clear evidence in all
the countries that foreign-owned companies - especially Japanese-owned -
outperformed domestically-owned ones in almost every area of practice and
performance.
Among the big surprises was the performance of companies in former East
Germany. Restructured under new owners, far more sites than expected were
moving towards world class status.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Oslo rally shows No camp's strength

Opponents of Norwegian membership of the European Union yesterday organised
a rally of some 25,000 people in Oslo, one of the country's largest ever
political demonstrations.
'This shows the strength of the No side - people came from all over the
country. If this support continues next week, we will win,' said Mrs Anne
Enger Lahnstein, head of the main opposition Centre party and leader of the
No campaign.
Norway holds its national referendum on joining the Union next Monday. The
No campaign, nervous that recent approval by neighbouring Finland and Sweden
could help swing opinion, has been encouraged by waning support for EU
membership following an earlier spurt after the Swedish Yes vote on November
13.
Surveys at the weekend showed opinion stabilising after a five or six point
surge by the Yes camp early last week. Two polls gave the No side 54 per
cent compared to 46 per cent for the pro-EU campaign, after eliminating
undecided voters, who still account for around 12 per cent of the
electorate.
Police estimated that 20,000-25,000 people attended the rally. Demonstrators
carried signs which read 'Yes to Democracy, No to the EU'. The organisers
chartered 300 buses and four trains to bring people from as far away as
Finnmark in northern Norway.
The No movement has also fielded seven prominent Norwegians opposed to EU
membership. They included Mr Jens Heyerdahl, president and chief executive
of Orkla, one of Norway's top five listed companies, which produces a
wide-range of consumer goods and which is one of the country's biggest
employers.
Most senior business and industrial figures are strongly backing EU
membership, saying it will benefit Norwegian companies. But Mr Heyerdahl
said that competition from outside would damage local manufacturers and cost
jobs.
Finland's parliament finally ratified the October 16 referendum result in
favour of EU membership at a session on Friday. The vote had been delayed by
anti-EU members until after Sweden had voted in the hope that Swedish
rejection would help them block Finnish accession. But the two-thirds
majority for ratification was easily achieved.

The fractious Italian government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi yesterday faced its
first electoral test since June, at the end of a week of political turmoil
and social unrest.
Italians in more than 200 towns and regions voted in local and regional
elections, the first poll since the June elections to the European
parliament in which Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement increased its
share of the national vote at the expense of the other main parties.
Within the last week, Mr Berlusconi has had to contend with anti-government
demonstrations across the country, starting with a rally of more than 1.2m
people in Rome on November 12 against plans for pension and welfare cuts.
Official results - due today - will be difficult to interpret because of
different alliances, sometimes pitting government allies against each other.
In some big mayoral elections there could be a second round of voting on
December 4.
Exit polls broadcast by state television last night indicated that Forza
Italia's share of the vote had dropped since June in the large cities, while
the centre-left opposition parties had gained. However, the leader of one
coalition party - Mr Gianfranco Fini of the far-right National Alliance -
pointed out that the government parties' candidates seemed to have
accumulated more support overall than the opposition.
Mr Berlusconi is likely to be more concerned about the passage of the
crucial 1995 budget through parliament, and Thursday's meeting with union
leaders at which the government will try to avert the second general strike
this autumn, scheduled for December 2. The government was defeated in the
lower chamber of parliament last Thursday, when the populist Northern League
 -one of three main coalition parties - allied with opposition deputies to
approve amendments watering down reform of the overburdened pensions system.
The chamber of deputies is likely to approve the overall package of measures
today.
Closer co-operation between the League and, for example, the opposition
Popular party could make it easier for the government to push through the
budget package in the upper house, where it does not have a majority.
Financial markets reacted positively on Friday, as investors looked forward
to possibile agreement with the unions.
Mr Sergio Cofferati, leader of the CGIL - one of three main trade union
federations - yesterday warned that it was premature to suggest that the
general strike might now be called off. But he agreed that 'the certainty of
reform and the commitment of the whole parliament and the social partners to
it would be a reassuring signal for the markets'.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Irish wait to see which way Spring jumps: John Murray Brown
assesses the tough choices facing the Labour leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Ireland's political parties try to patch together a new coalition
government in the wake of the last week's crisis, all eyes are on Dick
Spring, the Labour leader and outgoing deputy prime minister and foreign
minister.
The choice of coalition is largely Mr Spring's, in many ways the principal
actor in last week's drama, which resulted in the collapse of the 22-month
coalition and the resignation of Mr Albert Reynolds as prime minister.
He has three options. He can go back into coalition with Fianna Fail under
its new leader, Mr Bertie Ahern - the unanimous choice of the party on
Saturday. Labour and the conservative Fine Gael, the main opposition party
could put together a government with one or both of the smaller opposition
parties (the Democratic Left or the Progressive Democrats) although this
would produce a paper thin majority in the 166-seat parliament. The third
option is to go to the country, and seek a new mandate.
Overriding all this is another concern: that a protracted search for a new
government could damage the Northern Ireland peace process.
A poll in yesterday's Irish Independent suggests Mr Spring is the main
beneficiary of last week's turmoil. Confidence in his performance is at an
all-time high of 69 per cent. His party's standing is at 19 per cent. If he
heeds the results, a Fianna Fail coalition seems inevitable: 43 per cent are
in favour, while, perhaps more significantly, only 27 per cent want a
general election.
Returning last night after a weekend in his North Kerry constituency, Mr
Spring may well have reflected that he has been here before. In 1992, his
rating and his party's were also on a high. Even his parliamentary speeches
 -attacking Fianna Fail in a no confidence motion in November 1992 - have an
uncanny resemblance to last week's assault. And yet just two months later,
in January 1993, Labour was in coalition with Fianna Fail, for the first
time in the history of either.
How different is it this time? Mr Ahern is from the left wing of the party.
Indeed, as a former trade union negotiator, he earned a reputation as an
effective conciliator. Mr Ahern is also said to have a special relationship
with Labour's Mr Ruairi Quinn, who as employment and enterprise minister was
a key architect, with Mr Ahern, of the government policy programme under the
outgoing administration.
Mr Ahern is described as a Fianna Fail moderate. On social and moral issues,
some commentators believe he may be closer to Labour than his party's
mainstream. In Ireland, much has been made of the openness with which he has
discussed the breakdown of his marriage. However, in his acceptance speech
after winning the party nomination on Saturday, he promised social reform
'that takes account of our distinctive values and convictions' - a remark
which seemed to be aimed more at Fianna Fail traditionalists than designed
to court his possible coalition partner.
A coalition with Fianna Fail would have some supporters within Labour's
parliamentary party, anxious to avoid an election and confident in the
carve-up of cabinet jobs that Labour could dictate the terms to a cowed
Fianna Fail leadership. Labour party managers will be only too aware that
yesterday's poll, although showing increased support for Labour, actually
only restores the position the party enjoyed prior to the 1992 election.
Labour was bitterly criticised for betraying grassroots support. Indeed, the
party's strong showing in the 1992 election, where it secured 33 seats, was
largely because the voters believed they were voting Labour to root Fianna
Fail out of power. At grassroots level, Mr Ahern, who was present at the
cabinet meeting on Monday, is just as culpable as Mr Reynolds in misleading
parliament over the paedophile priest extradition case.
Mr Jim Kemmy, Labour's chairman and an astute judge of grassroots mood, made
it clear over the weekend he opposed another deal with Fianna Fail.
Given Mr Spring's personal difficulties with Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael
leader, that alternative would be difficult to imagine. Moreover, Labour
party managers will be aware that with three or more parties in coalition,
Mr Spring would have difficulty arguing for as many the six cabinet
portfolios which the party held in the outgoing administration.
If both options are ruled out, then the only alternative will be a general
election. It all rests with Mr Spring.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Socialists say Delors has duty to run
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LIEVIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French Socialist party yesterday told Mr Jacques Delors, outgoing head
of the European Commission, that he had a 'duty' to run for the presidency
in its colours.
Picking up Mr Delors's statement last week that if he decided to become a
candidate it would be out of duty, Mr Henri Emmanuelli, the party's first
secretary, said: 'In the name of the very great majority of Socialists, I
say to you, Jacques, that it is your duty.'
This appeal brought prolonged applause from the 4,000 Socialist delegates
and militants at the party's national congress which concluded yesterday.
The relative strength of the Delors-for-president camp within the party
probably approximates to the 87.5 per cent of delegates who earlier
yesterday voted for Mr Emmanuelli as first secretary.
Since Mr Emmanuelli faced no rival for the post to which he was nominated
last July in succession to Mr Michel Rocard, the 12.5 per cent vote against
him came largely from those who regard Mr Delors as too much a man of the
centre.
The possibility of a Delors presidential candidacy, partially reviving
Socialist hopes shattered in recent legislative elections, gave the congress
a rare degree of harmony.
Adding to the aura of reconciliation, President Francois Mitterrand came to
the former mining town of Lievin on Saturday to commemorate a colliery
disaster of 20 years ago, to make his peace with a party from which he has
seemed increasingly distant in recent years, and to stiffen its resolve to
keep the Elysee palace in Socialist hands.
Mr Emmanuelli reminded delegates that Mr Delors 'has been one of us for more
than 20 years and many of us were members of the same government' when Mr
Delors was finance minister in 1981-84.
The reality is that the Socialist party, winning only 14.5 per cent of the
vote in last June's European parliament elections under Mr Rocard's
leadership, is virtually at the beck and call of Mr Delors, whose opinion
poll rating is far higher. But Mr Emmanuelli promised delegates that the
party would go through the form of approving its presidential candidate and
platform, at a further convention probably in January.
Mr Emmanuelli made no apology for 'swinging the party to the left'. He
called for France's 39-hour working week to be reduced progressively to 35
hours without any comparable reduction in basic pay, not as a miracle cure
for unemployment but for a fairer division of effort and wealth. He also
said it was time for Socialists, particularly those in the European
parliament, to break their working consensus with Christian Democrats which
was alienating left- and rightwing voters from Europe.
He admitted 'some differences' on these points with Mr Delors, who has
warned against Europe harming its competitiveness by reducing work but not
rewards, and who has always valued the role played in European integration
by consensus-minded Christian Democrats. But there was no sense in the left
playing up its differences, he said.
The first secretary clearly indicated his view that the Socialist party's
role would be to anchor the left for Mr Delors, who would be free to reach
out to the centre.
Mr Francois Hollande, a former Socialist deputy who runs Mr Delors's Temoins
political discussion club in France, said he did not think Mr Emmanuelli's
public appeal would greatly influence the Commission president's decision.
'This turns on personal factors, and on developments on the right as much as
on the left.'

FT  21 NOV 94 / Treasury clears way for release of banks from charity
control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian treasury has cleared the way for publicly owned charitable
foundations to give up majority control of many of Italy's banks, in an
attempt to encourage further modernisation of the fragmented banking sector,
writes Andrew Hill. Mr Lamberto Dini, treasury minister, has approved a
directive which obliges the foundations to find new ways of funding their
charitable activities over the next five years. It will also provide fiscal
incentives for the foundations to 'privatise' their banking subsidiaries by
selling off more than 50 per cent of the shares. Following the 1990 reforms,
banking subsidiaries could be transformed into joint stock companies but
foundations had to retain a controlling stake.

FT  21 NOV 94 / UN force on alert over Bosnia: Moslem-led government demands
air strikes against Serb tanks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The 40,000-strong United Nations force in former Yugoslavia was placed on
high alert last night as intensifying warfare in northern Bosnia left the
peacekeepers vulnerable to assault from both Serbs and Moslems.
The Moslem-led Bosnian government angrily demanded that the UN follow up its
new resolution and authorise air strikes against Serb forces advancing on
the Moslem enclave of Bihac.
Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnian prime minister, said that despite an emergency
meeting of the UN Security Council on Saturday, Serb tanks were moving
towards Bihac yesterday. 'The concrete action would be to take out these
tanks - serious air strikes.'
On Saturday night the Security Council passed an emergency resolution
authorising Nato aircraft to extend their role as policemen of the skies to
the Serb-controlled areas of Croatia, after Serb aircraft based in Croatia
made two air raids on the Bihac area in two days. An aircraft in the second
attack crashed into an apartment block in the town of Cazin, near Bihac,
killing the pilot and injuring at least nine people.
Mr Willy Claes, Nato secretary-general, indicated on CNN television that the
alliance was waiting only for a request from the UN but stressed that 'we
are ready to intervene not only politically but militarily . . . we are
ready to give a very clear and strong signal to Serbs that this is enough
and it must stop.'
In the US, senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader in Congress, expressed
frustration with the UN's role: 'The UN should get off Nato's back and let
Nato take care of Serbian aggression.' He would visit Nato's headquarters
next week 'and tell them I don't see any reason for their existence if they
have to take orders from the UN'. The Security Council resolution was
welcomed by a senior British naval officer who is overseeing air policing
activities in the Adriatic. Captain Richard Hastilow, commander of the
aircraft carrier HMS Invincible, said the new policy was intended to stop
hostile aircraft leaving the ground in the Serb-controlled areas of Croatia.
The worsening situation around Bihac has presented the UN with one of the
toughest challenges since it became involved in peacekeeping in former
Yugoslavia in 1992. Any draconian action against the Serbs would leave
peacekeepers vulnerable to retaliation in many parts of Bosnia, while the
UN's failure to protect Bihac was incurring the anger of local Moslems.
Reports from Bihac said local people were attacking the vehicles belonging
to the 1,000-strong contingent of lightly-armed UN soldiers from Bangladesh,
whose stocks of food and medicine have run very low. A UN official said
there was 'major concern' for their welfare.
Fighters loyal to the maverick Moslem leader Mr Fikret Abdic, who opposes
the Bosnian government, were engaged yesterday with Serb support in heavy
house-to-house fighting in the town of Velika Kladusa, north of Bihac.
Ignoring threats of Nato air strikes if Serbs attack Bihac town, a
UN-designated safe area, General Manojlo Milovanovic, chief-of-staff of
Bosnian Serb forces, last night said his troops 'are at the very outskirts
of Bihac and are advancing from three sides'.
He claimed that his Serb forces had retaken all the land they initially lost
in a recent Bosnian-government offensive.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Tory chief sets out wish-list to boost party image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A blackout on media coverage of the National Health Service and a plan to
have back-bench 'yobbos' metaphorically beat up the Labour leader, Mr Tony
Blair, feature in the wish-list of a draft Conservative party communications
plan for the run-up to the next election.
Not intended for publication, it was written by Mr John Maples, the party's
deputy chairman, for Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Conservative
central office.
It is based on detailed interviews with 80 people who voted Tory in the 1992
election but who now say they might not or would not, because they see the
government as 'ineffectual and unable to deliver its promises'.
Those surveyed were in the so-called 'BC1' and 'C2' average income social
categories, whose support was crucial to the Conservatives' three previous
election victories. They are described in the research as 'natural
Conservatives', but they disapprove of privatisation and believe that the
'rich are getting richer on the backs of the rest'. Mr Maples' proposal for
wooing them back, dated September 30 1994, says the election 'could be as
little as 20 months away and no more than 30 months'. It identifies the task
before the 1995 Conservative party conference as eroding or reversing the
Labour party's lead in the opinion polls on four issues: the economy, law
and order, education and the National Health Service. On the economy, Mr
Maples says: 'The crucial issue here is living standards', which are
'falling in 1994 to 1995' and will fall 'again in 1995 to 1996'. He says the
government's talk of recovery is 'completely at odds with their (the
surveyed Tory supporters') experience'.
He believes that Labour's lead on law and order can be reversed, but is
pessimistic on the NHS, where Labour has a 55 percentage point lead over the
Tories.
'We can never win on this issue,' the paper says. 'The best result for the
next 12 months would be zero media coverage of the National Health Service.'
Labour's other great electoral asset is identified as its leader, Mr Tony
Blair. The paper says: 'If Blair turns out to be as good as he looks, we
have a problem.'
It continues: 'We cannot paint Blair as a left winger.' However, it urges a
strategy of drawing commitments from the Labour leader which illustrate the
divide between him and many members of his party. 'Could we set some back
benchers on to this?' the paper asks. 'Maybe a few yobbos of our own to try
to knock him about a bit.' The market research shows statements by Mr John
Prescott, Labour's deputy leader, on returning to full employment are
'striking a chord'. The paper asks: 'Can we go any way down this path? . . .
It would help neutralise any possible Labour advantage.'
Legislation designed to split Mr Blair from the rest of his party - such as
on ID cards - is proposed. Mr Maples also suggests delaying the pace of NHS
reform, postponing the imposition of the second instalment of VAT on fuel
and increasing the tax levied on executive share options.
Mr Tim Collins, Tory communications director, last night said that though Mr
Maples was formulating the communications plan, he had no policy-making
role.

FT  21 NOV 94 / VW board wants chairman to take calmer tone in public
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen chairman, will be told to tone down his
public statements at a meeting with senior members of the automotive group's
supervisory board this week.
Anxiety about Mr Piech's aggression was initially roused by a recent
outburst in an interview in which he accused his middle management of
cowardice and conspiring against him.
It was exacerbated at the weekend by the publication of extracts from a
letter accusing Mr Piech of being a dictator.
The letter, unsigned and purportedly from a group of middle managers, was
sent to Mr Klaus Liesen, chairman of the supervisory board, Mr Gerhard
Schroder, prime minister of VW's home state, Lower Saxony, and Mr Klaus
Zwickel, leader of the IG Metall trade union.
All are members of the supervisory board's powerful praesidium, which is due
to meet Mr Piech on Thursday, a day before a full supervisory board session.
The letter warned Mr Liesen not to be misled by the apparent recovery at VW.
'Make plain to Mr Piech that a global concern cannot be run like a feudal
fiefdom manned by serfs,' it said.
The signs of tension at VW have also revived debate among non-executive
supervisory directors on the possible need for a 'shadow cabinet', or
substitute top management, which could step in if Mr Piech did not stay for
his full five-year contract.
The proposal was first floated last year during the still-unresolved
industrial espionage allegations against VW's eccentric purchasing director,
Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua.
While the supervisory board is eager to avoid open conflicts with management
which could put VW's recovery at risk, it is also concerned that Mr Piech's
confrontational style is damaging the group's image. Its members are
understood to be more than satisfied with the benefits of the shake-out
started two years ago when Mr Piech took charge. VW last week announced its
losses after nine months had been cut to DM73m (Pounds 29.9m) this year from
DM1.53bn last year.
Although the origins of the letter, published in today's edition of the news
magazine Der Spiegel, are uncertain, the internal resistance to Mr Piech's
regime was confirmed in a recent interview in which he said he was 'still
working' on middle managers reluctant to toe the line.
He alleged that unknown VW employees had tried to bug his private telephone
and sabotaged his press office communications. The interview was widely seen
as the launch of a wholesale offensive on the next management layer.

FT  21 NOV 94 / Heseltine maintains ban on TV services from BT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any opportunity for British Telecommunications to offer television
entertainment and home-shopping services before the end of the century was
ruled out last night by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary.
The move came despite a recent call from MPs for a government ban on BT
providing such services to be lifted.
In a clear indication that the government wants to encourage cable TV
operators to invest in local cable systems, Mr Heseltine said that the
10-year ban, imposed in 1991, would be maintained.
He is due to give a formal statement on the issue this week to the Commons
Trade and Industry Select Committee, which called this year for the
restriction on BT to be removed.
However, Mr Heseltine gave a clear intimation of his response on BBC TV's
Money programme last night, when he was asked whether the ban forbidding BT
to offer video-on-demand and home shopping on an 'electronic superhighway'
would end early.
'That's not going to happen,' he replied, adding: 'I've made it absolutely
clear we will not break the government's word. There is effectively a
commercial, contractual relationship upon which people have invested
millions of pounds. You cannot then turn round and say: 'I'm sorry, the
British government's changed its mind'.'
BT has been lobbying for some time for a lifting of the ban, which forbids
it using its network to carry entertainment services until at least 2001,
with a review at some stage after 1998.
The company became particularly concerned about the issue several years ago
when cable companies began to expand from television services into the
telephone market.
However, Mr Heseltine's reluctance to lift the injunction has been
criticised by MPs on the Trade and Industry Select Committee, which fears
that it could leave the UK lagging the US and Japan in the development of
information services.
Last night Mr Richard Caborn, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said
he was disappointed Mr Heseltine had rejected his detailed proposals, which
would have protected the interests of both BT and the cable companies.
BT said last night it was 'disappointed' at Mr Heseltine's refusal to bring
forward the date for lifting the ban. 'We want a date when we can start so
that we can justify our present levels of investment,' BT added.

FT  21 NOV 94 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Pioneer slips into

Correction (published 29th November 1994) appended to this article.
Declining revenue from sales of karaoke equipment is calling the tune at
Pioneer, the Japanese manufacturer of specialist audio-visual electronics.
The company made a net loss in the six months to September, and indicated
that some 1,300 jobs may have to go during the next five years.
A strong yen and falling prices in the consumer electronics market, and
lower demand for karaoke equipment, combined to help push Pioneer to a
consolidated net loss of Y761m (Dollars 7.8m) in the first half, compared
with a profit of Y7.7bn at the same stage a year ago. Revenues slipped to
Y129.2bn from Y130.9bn previously.
Recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - fell to Y3.7bn from
Y7.9bn, although last year's figure included an exceptional gain.
It plans to focus on car navigation and audio systems which are expected to
be more promising than karaoke and laser disc systems.
Japan Tobacco, the Japanese cigarette monopoly, posted a rise in interim
earnings thanks to declines in raw material costs, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The company, listed on the country's leading stock exchanges last month,
said recurring profits for the first six months to September rose 7.7 per
cent to Y66.9bn as a result of a fall in tobacco leaf costs due to the
higher yen. The company increased the amount of imported tobacco leaves
since the domestic product costs three times as much.
Sales fell 0.5 per cent to Y1,372.4bn. The company lost 1.6 points of its
share in the domestic market to foreign cigarette makers while the overall
market only grew 0.6 per cent. After-tax profits rose 3.1 per cent to
Y41.4bn.
CORRECTION
In a recent report of Pioneer's interim results it was incorrectly stated
that the company's consolidated sales were down to Y129bn from Y130.9bn.
This should have read down to Y245.6bn from Y255.5bn.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): CGT indexation
allowances - October
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
The table shows capital gains tax indexation allowances for assets sold
  in October. Multiply the original cost of the asset by the figure for
  the month in which you bought it. Subtract the result from the
  proceeds of your sale: the balance will be your taxable gain or loss.
  Suppose you bought shares for Pounds 6,000 in October 1985 and sold
  them in October 1994 for Pounds 13,000. Multiplying the original cost
  by the October 1985 figure of 1.519 gives a total of Pounds 9,114.
  Subtracting that from Pounds 13,000 gives a capital gain of Pounds
  3,886 which is within the CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800. If selling
  shares bought before April 6 1982, you should use the March 1982
  figure. The RPI in October 1994 was 145.2.

FT  19 NOV 94 / International Company News: Goodman Fielder sees mid-term
fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Goodman Fielder, the ailing Australian food company, yesterday warned
shareholders that first-half profits in the current year would fall,
although an improved second half should produce a full-year increase.
The news of continuing poor performance - described by the chairman, Mr John
Studdy, as unacceptable - was given to investors at the com-pany's annual
meeting in Sydney yesterday, setting the scene for three hours of stormy
proceedings.
At the meeting, shareholders voted down the proposed appointment of Mr Neil
Lister to the board, although Mr Studdy subsequently asked for a poll, the
results of which will be announced on Monday. Mr Lister is one of the three
new board appointees which Goodman agreed to accept as part of a deal with
unhappy institutional investors in September.
Mr Lister is a director of Agrifoods, the privately-owned business belonging
to Mr Doug Shears, a Melbourne-based businessman. Mr Shears received a small
stake in Goodman when his Uncle Toby's business was acquired by the quoted
group. The objection to Mr Lister as a director came after one shareholder
pointed out that he - along with Mr Shears - had been directors of another
company which went into receivership in 1990.
The reappointment of Mr Donald Hughes as a director proved contentious, with
some shareholders arguing that he had been part of the board which approved
generous, non-performance-related remuneration packages for now-departed
executives. However, Mr Hughes was finally re-elected on a show of hands.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Brazil buys 7 UK warships
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's navy is to buy seven ships from Britain for about Pounds 100m in
the second large arms deal between the two countries this year.
Brazil is buying four type 22 frigates and three river class minesweepers
which the British navy put up for sale earlier this year. The frigates,
built between 1976 and 1980, are no longer needed following the post-cold
war fleet reduction.
In January this year Westland, the UK helicopter maker, won a Pounds 150m
order for nine Super Lynx helicopters from the Brazilian navy. British
officials hope the Brazilians will choose Westland again when they equip the
newly acquired frigates.
The frigates are the Broadsword, Brazen, Brilliant and Battleaxe and will be
delivered over the next three years. The minesweepers Humber, Helmsdale and
Ribble will be delivered next year.
Several of the world's leading arms exporters are looking at Brazil as a
potential growth market, even though its armed forces budget has suffered
from years of cutbacks. Mr William Perry, the US Secretary of Defence,
visited Brazil this week to discuss a number of potential defence contracts
and Brazil is also looking to Russia and China for limited arms purchases.
The British deal marks the end of a year of increased contact between the
two countries, restoration of British export credit cover and several
British ministerial visits to Brazil, including that of Mr Douglas Hurd,
foreign secretary, in April. Britain is also close to finalising an
extradition treaty with Brazil and discussions have started on a double
taxation treaty.
The contract was signed by Brazilian vice-admiral Armando de Senna
Bittencourt and Mr Michael Robinson, assistant director of the UK's Defence
Export Sales Office.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Railtrack sell-off plan to be announced shortly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is due to bring forward plans to sell off Railtrack, owner of
the rail network's infrastructure, and is expected to make the announcement
shortly, possibly next week.
The move, which would be one of the largest privatisations in recent times,
is expected to be announced by Mr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary,
in a parliamentary written answer.
It is understood Mr Mawhinney will give full details of the sell-off
timetable and a firm assurance that it will have been completed by the next
general election, due by spring 1997.
Industry experts had believed the privatisation might have been threatened
by the rail signal workers' strike and uncertainty over the charges
Railtrack will be allowed to levy on train operators.
However, a firm assurance of the privatisation would help the government
allay criticism from rightwing backbenchers that it had lost its ideological
cutting edge after abandoning plans to sell off the Post Office.
The Railtrack sale, which would be expected to yield between Pounds 3.3bn
and Pounds 4.3bn, could also help the government to announce tax cuts in its
1995 and 1996 Budgets.
The decision to make an early announcement came as British Rail and London
Underground announced fare increases of up to 5 per cent in the new year.
Passenger groups and opposition MPs condemned the rises.
Railtrack took over responsibility for BR's track and signalling operations
in April. BR will be further broken up into three leasing companies which
will own the rolling stock, and a large number of operating companies is
expected to bid for franchises to operate trains.
Railtrack controls 11,000 miles of former BR track, 2,500 stations and the
signalling network. Its revenues consist largely of Pounds 2.2bn of track
access charges paid by the operators of passenger trains. Additional revenue
will come from providing track for freight services. Most of these charges
will be met by government subsidy.
Railtrack's assets have been valued by the government at Pounds 6.5bn but a
more realistic estimate is about Pounds 4bn.
In the first City review of Railtrack's prospects to be published, Mr Chris
Tarry, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, calculated that
pre-tax profits in its first year would be Pounds 700m on an historic cost
basis.
Mr Michael Meacher, shadow transport secretary, said last night the
government was only announcing the sale 'to keep up its machismo over
privatisation'.
He added: 'If the announcement is made in a written answer it will be a
parliamentary outrage. It would throw into doubt the regulatory and safety
side of the railways and has been brought forward because of the abject
failure of the franchising process.'
However, Labour will not give a firm commitment to renationalise Railtrack
if the party comes to power.
Railtrack declined to comment last night.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Punch drunk and proud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The hook is a snappy punch. The proper technique is to get close to your
opponent, pivot quickly from feet and hips, and deliver a sharp blow to the
side of the head, ideally the temple. The object is to cause an abrupt
sideways impact; in ringside parlance, to make your opponent's brain
'wobble'.
Even in the short distance of an amateur boxing bout, a wobbled brain is
dangerous. The opponent is momentarily disoriented, and cannot focus on
subsequent attacks. That is why a well-timed, well-placed hook is probably
the most effective move in any fighter's repertoire.
Boxers and their trainers will be perfectly candid about this. Many punches
hurt, but the hook hurts in a particular way. Apart from jolting the
co-ordination powers of the central nervous system, a good hook will leave
even the most bovine-shouldered boxer with a headache for hours, perhaps
days.
Boxing is quintessentially about giving and receiving pain, and that pain
may include temporary or permanent damage to the brain. So for a group of
Royal Navy surgeons to 'prove', as they have done in this month's Lancet,
that boxing has damaged the intelligences of some of the servicemen who
participate in the sport, is hardly a revelation.
In this Lancet report, the incidence of 'cerebral profusion' is demonstrated
to be significantly higher among boxers than among comparable fit young
servicemen. The brain wobbles have left their mark, and that mark has been
scientifically measured. But no boxer or trainer is going to be at all
surprised. The amazement would come if it were ever proven that taking a
hook to the temple did not affect one's subsequent powers of reaction and
response.
So what is the upshot of this new report? Obviously, the neuro-surgeons at
Gosport would like to see no more inter-regimental boxing in the services.
As yet, a ban seems unlikely. But if the services do decide to dispatch with
boxing, it will not be a victory for good sense. It will go down as yet
another triumph of liberal busybodyism.
Busybodyism is often myopic: focusing on tiny problematicals, when giant
monsters loom. Such is the busybodyism which gave us rear seat belts, while
doing so little to prevent the poisoning of our atmosphere. And medical
busybodyism is often empirically suspect.
Few doctors box: so boxing is a soft target for their busybodyism. They are
much quieter about rugby, which is popular in the training hospitals. And
yet anyone who has tried both boxing and rugby will vouchsafe that the
chances of serious and lasting injury are far higher in rugby than boxing.
Which brings us to the most feeble element of the ban-boxing logic. Not long
ago, a survey was carried out on the risk factors of all sorts of sports and
pastimes. The statistics revealed, of course, that no one concerned about
safety should ever take up DIY, rock-climbing or white-water canoeing.
Curiously, fishing emerged as the most danger-ridden sport of all.
If ever boxing should be banned, one hopes for consistency from our
legislators: let us be rid, then, of not only fishing, but motor-racing,
yachting, and skiing too. To charge down an icy slope on two strips of
plastic is to flirt with paralysis: since this is a component of training
for the Royal Marines, perhaps it too shall come under medical scrutiny.
But what is most insidious about this busybodyism is its class-based bias.
Boxing is chiefly disapproved of by the middle-classes. It has disappeared
from even the heartiest of British public schools. It is a sport which
notoriously offers disadvantaged youths the chance to leave their
disadvantages behind them. Hence its survival - in urban boys' clubs, among
the Newmarket stable-lads, and the volunteers for the Territorial Army. If
boxing were ever banned, the prediction is that it would go underground, and
we would be flung back to bare-knuckle prize-fighting.
No one is claiming that boxing is a 'civilising' sport. But it is often
disciplining, and to aggressive, working-class youth it is probably also a
therapy. The busybodies would like such youth to be sitting down quietly
with copies of Tolstoy and Voltaire - for this, we are told, is how jailed
heavyweight champion Mike Tyson is spending his time. This is to wish not
only for a quiet world, but also a dull one. The French philosopher Michel
Foucault said: the proximity of danger is an essential part of being alive.

FT  19 NOV 94 / As They Say In Europe: How to make friends and destroy
people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last weekend, said Le Figaro, 'the voters of the majority anxiously heard
the tocsin.' The paper was talking about what was supposed to be a victory
rally in Paris for the leader of the major right-wing party, Jacques Chirac,
who gave up the post to announce he was standing for president next year.
No-one expects him to win, even though his party crushed the left in
legislative elections 18 months ago.
The great difference between Europe and the US is that in the latter every
electoral landslide signifies some kind of gigantic once-and-for-all change.
The mid-term elections altered the face of US politics for good. Until the
next time, that is. When the right swept France, everyone knew it was just
because people were fed up with the left.
Therefore, it seems, French and American circumstances are entirely
different. There will not be a left-leaning Congress for generations while
the Socialists will win a crushing victory in France at the next legislative
election, if not the presidential. Only Time magazine compared the two
countries but chose the period of cohabitation of the 1980s to set alongside
the situation President Bill Clinton faces. It is, however, the present
cohabitation which is peculiarly relevant to the looming battle in
Washington.
In Paris an embattled president of the left gazes out from his palace at a
legislative body dominated by political opponents. President Francois
Mitterrand, aged, maybe dying, and, in the minds of many, entirely
discredited, looks on as leaders of the right-wing RPR (Rally for the
Republic) and their allies fight it out to be his successor. Yet when Chirac
put himself forward as a candidate, he was attacking not Mitterrand but the
prime minister, Edouard Balladur, also of the RPR.
As a provincial paper noted: 'In seeking an excessive legitimacy at the
heart of the RPR, Jacques Chirac risks breaking in two the movement
inherited from Charles de Gaulle.' The rivalry between Chirac and Balladur
is only one element in the apparent determination of the right to smash
itself itself to pieces.
Not all its leaders are men of charm and grace: Balladur seems a pretty good
chap, Chirac is a bit rough - as mayor of Paris he can scarcely be anything
else - Valery Giscard d'Estaing a little shop-soiled. But by comparison with
the new majority leaders in Congress, they are cuddly toys. Nonetheless they
have relentlessly followed a path that is now known as one of 'suicidal
logic.'
In Washington, the new leader of the Senate will be Robert Dole, a man of
enormous ambition and a gift for in-fighting and poisonous abuse that few
can rival. Apart, that is, from the new House speaker, Newt Gingrich, who is
in turn regarded as the acceptable face of American conservative
republicanism when put alongside his senatorial colleague, Phil Gramm of
Texas. It is likely that these gentlemen will all excessively insist on
their legitimacy, as the French say, and seek their party's nomination for
the presidency.
President Clinton should study how Mitterrand contributed to the destruction
of his opponents. (This was a purely platonic act for Mitterrand himself has
nothing whatsoever to gain from his success.) He will see that the French
president has personal qualities that in some ways match his own, although
Mitterrand admittedly enjoys the advantage that his interest in the opposite
sex has not worked against him among his compatriots. What Clinton lacks is
that special crafty, malin quality that characterises the French leader's
approach to politics.
In fact all the President has to do is to work closely with one or other of
the Republican leaders, the less probable the better. The White House should
endorse his ideas and back his legislative programme. Once this potential
candidate has gained widespread fame and popularity, once his ambition has
been inflamed by presidential favour, the President himself will only have
to step back a little and watch his opponents smash the movement inherited
from Abe Lincoln. The dramatic idiocies which characterised the rigged
acclaim for Chirac last weekend could not quite be replicated in a US
primary, but it should not be too difficult to inject intra-Republican
relationships with the lethal venom that has almost destroyed the RPR.
It is all too easy to achieve a gigantic political sea-change in the US. In
the mid-term vote, 38 per cent of the electorate turned out. Of those who
did only one in eight, or 4.6 per cent of the total eligible, voted
Republican because they supported of the party's programme. The French
majority is based on support that runs rather higher than 4.6 per cent. Yet
it can be wrecked by its own internecine hatreds and a wag of the tail of a
lame duck president.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Confessions of a Bovril fondler
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I believe everything I read about supermarkets. The way they polish their
fruit to make it sparkle, the effort they put into wafting wholesome smells
down the aisles to make us feel good, the cunning ploy of moving their most
popular items to keep us guessing (and spending); the stories of their wiles
are legion, and I swallow uncritically every single one.
But unlike most of my fellow shoppers, who simmer in outrage at the thought
of being constantly manipulated, I love supermarkets. There is nothing I
prefer to spending a couple of hours in one of these temples of consumer
irrationality, watching the new brands come and go, noting the latest trends
in packaging design and watching punters whirl their trolleys around in a
haze of clashing subliminal signals.
Occasionally I like to pick up and fondle a supermarket design classic as a
kind of tribute, like flashing your lights when you come across an Aston
Martin DB5; there is nothing quite like enjoying the sleek sensuality of a
bottle of Perrier, the brash self-confidence of a Coca-Cola can, tempered by
the sinuous curve which represents the original bottle design, even the
beefy splendour of a jar of Bovril. It must look pretty weird on the store
video, but I can get lost in any of these innocent pleasures.
But my favourite game is trying to guess the motivation behind changes in
product packaging which seem, to my inexperienced eyes, to have no logic at
all. For instance, some years ago, my favourite cereal, Coco Krispies,
changed its name to Coco Pops. Presumably, it was a decision taken at a
high-ish level, for carefully-considered reasons; there must have been a
mountain of market research urging Mr Coco and his pals that while
'Krispies' contained a dangerously ambiguous message, the unique essence of
the product was rather better conveyed by 'Pops'.
Well, I, for one, was unhappy. As an act of protest, I never gave the new
product a chance. I felt we had grown too far apart. The years slipped by, I
grew up, and turned, as one does, to muesli, only to find that there was no
escape from the packaging gurus: now they were competing for my attention
with pictures of mountains. Everywhere I looked, Swiss landscapes beckoned;
in fact, I am sure the air got ever-so-slightly thinner as I approached the
breakfast counter. Nothing would have surprised me any more.
So now I no longer worry about these things. I can confidently stride up to
a counter of disinfectants and decide whether I prefer a pine toilet duck to
a pot pourri one, or vice versa. I have learned to enjoy the brain-curdling
dizziness of the ride, for now I know that none of it really matters. Only
one thing continues to bug me about supermarkets - their misguided belief
that we all crave the personal touch.
I could just about put up with assistants wearing name badges, but last week
I came across a truly horrific development - the personalised sandwich.
Stilton and apple on walnut bread, it said, with one of those manufacturer's
names which sound like a character from Brideshead Revisited, a list of
ingredients and a sell-by date - and then, underneath all these, the
dreadful words: 'Prepared by Frank'.
Now I have got nothing against Frank; in fact it was a lovely sandwich. But
escaping into a supermarket for an hour or two every week is one of the
great soulless joys of late 20th century urban life, and the last thing I
want to know is that there are real human beings at the other end of my
consumer transactions. I want my food devised in test tubes, prepared by
robots, delivered to the shelves by 40-ton trucks and checked out by
electronic wizardry. I do not want to talk to anyone, and if anyone wishes
me a nice day (a habit to which the British, thank goodness, seem immune) I
just growl.
I do not mind being hoodwinked, bamboozled, defrauded or ripped off, but
give me a break, Frank. If I wanted human contact I would go to the corner
shop. Except that it is not there anymore.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Private View: InFidelity of a Cuban exile - Christian Tyler
meets Guillermo Cabrera Infante, writer and punster, who fled Castro's
'Caribbean Albania' for freedom on Gloucester Road
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We are in a writer's room, a hermitage. On one side is a wall of books on a
scaffold of heavy iron shelving. On the other are cupboards stuffed with
manuscripts and 2,000 videocassettes (for this writer is also a film
critic.)
A giant monstera plant is splayed in tropical profusion across the bay
window, obscuring a dowdy London street of cheap hotels and pizza parlours.
The writer is short, tubby and somewhat stiff in the neck. He is smoking a
big cigar. His manner, like his writing, is humorous but his jokes are acrid
and melancholic. He is a ferocious punster with a technicolour writing style
 -it reminds one of a muscular Gore Vidal.
Guillermo Cabrera Infante is an exile, or rather political refugee, from
Fidel Castro's Cuba.
In Mea Cuba, a collection of political essays just published in England, he
caricatures Castro as 'Mefistofidel', as 'the world's most expensive
agronomist', as the man who spreads 'Castroenteritis'. Cuba, he writes, is
'the Albania of the Caribbean', ruled over by a tropical Stalin, a 'beastly,
power-hungry egomaniac'.
'I know him very well,' he told me. 'He has something you and I fortunately
don't have, which is a lust for power. He doesn't care about food, he
doesn't care about sex, he doesn't care about comforts. He only cares about
power.'
Castro, he added, is a great actor whose propaganda has been swallowed by
all but a handful of outsiders. Not until after his death would the
atrocities committed by the regime be known.
This writer, it is plain, pulls no punches. Perhaps he is lucky that his
enemies do. Eight years ago, while he and his wife were out, the door to
their flat was prised out its frame. Nothing was taken, not even money or
manuscripts.
'No, I'm not afraid,' he said. 'But I am concerned because I know what
happened to Georgi Markov.' Markov, an exiled writer who attacked the then
communist ruling family of Bulgaria, was killed with a poison-tipped
umbrella on Waterloo Bridge in London.
However, Cabrera Infante is a novelist and screenwriter rather than a
polemicist; as such, he has been largely ignored in Cuba even as his
literary reputation in the world outside has soared. 'Until this book
appeared in Spanish, they were trying to create a void around me, killing me
by silence.'
He was born into a poor family in Oriente province, 25 miles away from the
birthplace of the former dictator Batista and 20 miles from that of Fidel
Castro. His parents were founders of the Cuban communist party; this, he
said, was vaccination. 'My father was only concerned with saving the world,
not saving his family. Believe me, the political education of a man can
begin very early.'
Infante first knew Castro in 1948, when the future revolutionary wore a suit
and tie. Later, as editor of Lunes, the party newspaper's literary
supplement, Infante saw Castro and Che ('Chaos') Guevara at close quarters.
It was while serving as Cuba's cultural attache in Brussels that he flew
home for his mother's funeral and decided to leave for ever. He wrote: 'In
an incredible Hegelian capriole, Cuba had taken a great leap forward - but
had fallen backward.'
Despite the head of internal security, and with the help of highly-placed
friends, he succeeded in leaving with his wife Miriam Gomez, an actress, and
the two daughters of his first, short marriage to Marta Calvo.
First they went to Spain, but Franco's police declined to give them visas.
The writer was invited to London to script a film, and there he has lived
ever since.
'I know you British are very derogatory of London,' he said. 'But I like it
here. I work very well here. You see where I work. You see those windows.
When the weather is really foul, I see people hurrying to and fro with big
overcoats, umbrellas, cursing the weather. I don't curse, because I am very
cosy there writing.' He pointed to a big IBM electric typewriter planted
across the room.
And when the sun is shining . . ?
'That's a temptation because it then resembles Havana. When I came in June,
1966 there were girls everywhere, almost naked, in see-through dresses.
London was singing - swinging - and I thought it was going to last for
ever.'
About six years after settling in South Kensington, Infante suffered what he
calls a 'massive breakdown'. They gave him electric shock treatment until
his doctor intervened to say the writer's memory could be permanently
damaged. He takes lithium salts for manic depression.
I asked him if his exile was the cause. No, he said, because he had been
happy to leave. 'I myself think it is an effect without a cause.'
Perhaps you are super-sensitive?
'I am very sensitive, yes. But I've been like that all my life and nothing
happened. My wife is more sensitive than I, and she has never been crazy.'
He lit a cigar. I thought of the title of his book and said: I'm very struck
by your use of puns.
'You think that's a sign of madness?'
No, I said hastily. Do you use them when you're angry as well as amused?
'I don't want to sound too pretentious but I think it's some sort of poetic
system, the way you use rhyme or rhythm. Of course most of them are
conscious, but some are very unconscious. It's a mechanism inside your head.
'I was probably born with it. I probably was born mad. That's the way it is.
Some people get very angry with me. I say one man's pun is another man's
poison.'
He quoted Goethe's verdict on a fellow-writer: ''Whenever he made a pun, a
pain was hidden.' It's better in English than in German. Anyway, English is
a better language for puns - otherwise you wouldn't have Lewis Carroll or
James Joyce or Flann O'Brien.'
Cuba, he said, was like Ireland: a small country which had produced a
disproportionate number of celebrated writers. 'They have the gift of the
gab. Havana is 'Habana' in Spanish, and I coined the pun the hablaneros, the
talkers.'
Does writing give you the identity denied you by exile?
'I don't think so, not really. I'm not in search of an identity. I'm more in
search of a given expression, which I haven't attained yet.'
Do you write novels to keep your Cuba alive?
'No. I am trying to rebuild Havana with words.' To the peasant boy he once
was, he explained, Havana appeared an enchanted city. 'It was like some
miracle that stopped the night'.
Do you hope to see it like that again?
'Now, this is a vanity of mine. I only hope that they take my books as a
blueprint for a future Havana. I know it won't happen, but I long for it.
Some readers say my books have made them feel true Habaneros. That for me is
compliment enough.'
Would you go back if . . ?
'I wouldn't go back on the first plane if Castro died. I'll wait for them to
invite me. It's not a question of pride or vanity. It's that I don't feel
there's a place for me down there. I'm not a politician, I'm not an
economist, I'm not an entrepreneur. I'm only a writer. What am I going to do
in Havana? Write pamphlets and paste them on the wall?'
Cabrera Infante is a man who can put up with anything but being ignored. He
calls himself 'an invisible exile', a reference to the cold shoulder
treatment he has had from some left-wing intellectuals unable to concede
that Cuba was a place one had to leave. 'Who could be an exile from
Paradise?'
I referred to Castro's past denunciations of exiles as 'worms' and
'cockroaches'. If you are told that often enough, to you begin to believe
it?
'No. You know that 'worm' is gusano in Spanish. It means also 'caterpillar'.
So I devised a sort of metamorphosis. All the worms become butterflies.
Goebbels used to call the Jews 'vermin.' It means you can kill them because
they are not human.'
Are you angry that Castro has had such a hand in your life?
'All my reactions to Castro can be explained if you think of a Jew thinking
of Hitler.'
You have said exile is a form of martyrdom but also a rare privilege. What
do you mean?
'That's what the title of the book is all about. You have escaped from a
form of life which is for you inhuman. Therefore, to leave your country is a
liberation. Not many are able to do it. I was lucky.'
Talk of exile was clearly depressing the writer and he sounded tired.
However acute, however influential the penman may be, I thought, the
swordsman can always slice his feet from under him.
Does exile become a sort of profession? I asked finally.
'I have just come back from a symposium in Spain,' he said. 'They asked me
about writing. I said I find writing easy. It is life that is difficult, and
the life of an exile is even more difficult than life.
'And you can guess why. You have to rebuild a life that is totally false.
We're not English. We live in London but we don't live in England.
'Many people ask me where I'm from. I say 'Gloucester Road.' You cannot say
that unless you are an exile. If you are an emigre you talk about your
country. But if your country doesn't exist any more, what do you say? My
only country is this flat.'

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Serious Money): A prodigal returns to the
fold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Share buy-backs are one of those rarities: a financial fashion that is also
a thoroughly sensible idea. The regional electricity companies have been
buying back their own shares in dribs and drabs for some time. This week,
Boots and National Power joined the club.
The general argument in favour of buy-backs is being muddied by specific
discussion of the best way of doing them. A buy-back is just what it sounds
like: a company uses its own spare cash to buy some of its own shares, just
as it might use the money to buy shares in another company when plotting a
take-over.
Investment pundits such as Warren Buffett, the US guru, favour share
buy-backs as strongly as they condemn hubristic bids. Expensive take-overs
hurt shareholder value twice over. First, a bad acquisition damages the
actual business of the predator. Then, it damages the share rating as
investors see that loss of value and lose confidence in the management.
By contrast, if a company buys back its own shares, it creates a virtuous
circle. Provided the price is right, the move reduces the number of ordinary
shares more sharply than the offsetting fall in investment income reduces
earnings. So, earnings per share rise. An expensive bid often has the
opposite effect: earnings per share fall.
Thus, basic arithmetic suggests that a sensible buy-back is a better way of
spending shareholders' money than expensive acquisitions. Shareholders'
perception of this basic arithmetic prompts them to increase their estimates
of the company's earnings power and the ability of its managers - and so the
share price rises even further.
It is particularly heart-warming to see Boots in the buy-back club. Welcome
to a very prodigal son.
Here is the parable in brief. In 1989, Boots won a fiercely contested Pounds
900m bid for Ward White despite fierce opposition from some of its own
shareholders. Once recession bit, the only question was quite how badly
Boots had overpaid.
Now, Boots is selling its drugs business to a German company and has spent
Pounds 500m buying back its own shares. The only worry is that the
additional Pounds 350m Boots is due to get for the drugs business will soon
be burning a hole in its pocket.
MONDAY WAS A red-letter day for gambling buffs. The national lottery opened
its doors and BSkyB published its pathfinder prospectus.
Buying shares in a satellite television company which has yet to make any
worth-while profits is essentially speculative. Applying for BSkyB shares is
not quite such a leap in the dark as subscribing to the Eurotunnel launch or
a new biotech company, but it has very little in common with investing in
Marks and Spencer.
To label it speculative is not necessarily to criticise. As the stampede for
lottery tickets showed, many Brits love a good speculation. What is
important is clear labelling.
BSkyB (in which Pearson, owner of the FT, has a 17.5 per cent stake) is
setting out to woo the personal investor. And the shares will be sold
through share shops - Sid's old stamping ground.
But when the government sold off the riskier privatisations, such as British
Airways, it deliberately steered clear of Sids on the ground that the shares
were not suitable for inexperienced investors.
BSkyB can hardly afford to take such high moral ground. The satellite
company has an obvious interest in having customers who double as
shareholders.
One of the biggest worries of television companions such as TeleWest and
BSkyB is their 'churn rate' - lapsed subscribers. Customers who have a
vested interest in the company's success may well prove more loyal in both
their capacities.
What is needed is a strong wealth warning: 'These shares are likely to be
riskier than many others.' After all, it is unlikely to deter the punters.
IT SOUNDS AN unbeatable offer from Bank of Scotland: a five-year bank
deposit paying 5 per cent gross a year plus a bonus 'equivalent to the
average percentage rise in the FT-SE 100 index' between December 1 1994 and
December 1 1999.
Yes, but what exactly does the bank mean by 'average percentage rise' ? What
it does not mean is the actual rise over that period.
For the small print explains that the bank's stock market index deposit
calculates the 'average' by taking each of the 20 three-month periods
between the start and finish dates, working out a rise between December 1
1994 and the end of each period - and then averaging.
The bank's own example shows an actual stock market rise of more than 30 per
cent translated into a bonus of only 15 per cent. And both income and bonus
are subject to income tax. Tricky things, words.

BUSINESS
Ireland was pitched into political crisis after the prime minister, Albert
Reynolds, and his Fianna Fail cabinet colleagues resigned.
Camelot, the operator of the UK's first national lottery for more than 150
years, said it was 'absolutely delighted' with early sales of tickets.
Ready-made meals comprised almost 35 per cent of the average household's
food bill last year, a rise of nearly 10 per cent since the early 1980s,
according to the 1993 National Food Survey.
The Post Office is close to a deal with a leading insurer that would enable
it to sell travel insurance through many of its 20,000 branches.
Better than expected figures for UK inflation, unemployment and the public
finances provided chancellor Kenneth Clarke with a strong base for a
confidence-building Budget.
Independent gas companies hoping to enter the lucrative market for supplying
Britain's 18m households were relieved to learn from the Queen's speech that
legislation for removing British Gas's monopoly will be introduced soon.

new rights to vote on issues affecting societies if proposals put forward by
the sector's trade body are accepted by the government.
MARKETS
In one of the most frenetic days ever on the London Metal Exchange, prices
soared on Wednesday as wave after wave of investment fund and speculative
buying took copper, aluminium and lead to fresh four-year peaks and nickel
and zinc to their highest levels for two years.
Many large pension funds are close to including commodities in their
investment portfolios as a way of diversifying away from traditional
financial holdings, according to Steven Strongin, vice-president and
commodities strategist at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank.
The US Federal Reserve surprised the financial markets with an increase of
three-quarters of a percentage point in short-term interest rates intended
to keep inflation under control.

unveiled by a group of European venture capitalists, the Paris Bourse and
the US Nasdaq market.
Lazard Investors is to launch an Indian equity fund next week in conjunction
with BK Birla, the Indian business group, and the Bombay-based merchant bank
Creditcapital Finance Corporation, in which Lazard Investors holds 40 per
cent.
Rising interest rates are encouraging more gold mining companies to hedge
their future production, and this appears to be putting a 'cap' on any price
rise above Dollars 400 a troy ounce, according to the World Gold Council.
COMPANIES
British Aerospace has increased its bid for VSEL. The latest offer is a 3.3
for one share swap, worth around Pounds 14.70 for each VSEL share, with a
Pounds 14 cash alternative matching GEC's Pounds 14 cash offer.
Shares in cash-rich De La Rue, the bank-note printer, hit an all-time high
as the market responded to a sparkling set of interim results.

for the satellite television venture revealed.
British Sky Broadcasting believes it lost around 50,000 existing and
potential new customers through pirate devices.
GWR, the expanding Bristol-based commercial radio group, has had its radio
licences acquisition plan blocked by the Radio Authority, even though a
similar scheme involving Emap and Trans World Communications was accepted.
Attwoods described the increased bid of Pounds 391m from Browning-Ferris
Industries of the US as meagre and cynical, and urged shareholders to reject
the offer in favour of the proposed break-up plan.

dividend from 0.5p a share to 2p after a surge in half-year pre-tax profits
from Pounds 27m to Pounds 159m.

it expected losses of Pounds 1.25m at the half year, compared with pre-tax
profits of Pounds 565,000.
RJB Mining expects to have cleared all debts incurred in its bid for the
English regions of British Coal by the end of 1998, and is looking for
pre-tax profit margins of about 18 per cent in 1999.
Acquisitions following its 1993 rights issue helped Great Portland Estates,
the UK's sixth largest property company, announce interim pre-tax profits
ahead from Pounds 16m to Pounds 21.4m.
Boots is to end 80 years of prescription medicine manufacture with the sale
of its drugs business to BASF of Germany for 'about Pounds 850m'. Boots
later spent Pounds 508m on buying back its shares on the stock market, which
will leave Boots' management free to concentrate on acquisitions in
over-the-counter (non-prescription) drugs, probably in Germany.
Barclays Bank also reduced excess capital by announcing that it would buy
back Dollars 500m (Pounds 300m) of non-cumulative preference shares.

casualty. The company announced that its share offer would be 'delayed'.

means of honouring a commitment to try to dispose of 2,000MW of plant.
Gartmore is to launch an investment trust to track a new index covering the
smallest 1 per cent of UK equities by market capitalisation.
Foreign &amp; Colonial's offer of C-shares in its Emerging Markets investment
trust was almost fully subscribed, raising Pounds 113.7m, to add to its
existing Pounds 150m of funds. Fidelity's launch of the new Fidelity Special
Values investment trust was less successful, pulling in Pounds 45.4m against
early hopes of up to Pounds 125m. Most of the money came from private
investors through financial advisers.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Arts: Sibling rivalry full of tension - Alastair Macaulay
reviews the alternating cast of 'True West'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is surely no acting in London today more interesting to watch than
Mark Rylance and Michael Rudko swapping roles in Sam Shepard's True West at
the Donmar Warehouse - alternating at each performance. I reviewed Rylance
as Austin, Rudko as Lee, at the West Yorkshire Playhouse last month; but
afterwards I said to a friend: 'I can't imagine them the other way round.'
On opening night at the Donmar Warehouse, when they were playing the
opposite roles, my friend said: 'Well, I can't imagine it the other way
round.' So authoritative are their performances that at no point was I
reminded of how the reverse casting had felt. Each character has changed,
and so has the play.
Austin and Lee are brothers in southern California. Austin, the younger of
the two, is the writer, domestic, civilised. Lee, the elder, is the loner,
anarchic, desert-loving. The action takes place in their mother's apartment,
where Austin is living (and has been tending her house plants); Lee's
fondness for the desert comes from their father.
The play covers a brief period when they are in each other's orbits, during
which they travel, psychologically, in opposing arcs, each trying to become
the other. But the play is also an alarming, even terrifying, struggle for
power.
Rylance usually appears to be one of our most marvellously Stanislavskian,
naturalistic actors; but True West shows Rudko (an American actor) as
actually the more utterly natural of the two. In neither role could I spot a
moment's artifice or contrivance from him; you are not aware of his acting
at all.
Rylance's acting is superbly organic, but it is also - relatively speaking -
a triumph of technique. It is Rylance who can maximise the emotional highs
and lows of a character, who can draw out attention (by the subtlest of
means) to the vulnerability or cruelty of either role, and whose pacing is
full of danger and surprise.
When Rudko plays Austin, he emphasises his weakness; Rylance as Lee is a
more pronounced bully; and it is clear that the two are brothers who are
engaging once more in an old rivalry. When Rylance was Austin he revealed
his Apollonian restraint and quiet forbearance and anguish; and Rudko, as
Lee, was the vulpine, Dionysiac, prowler from the wild; and it seemed
astonishing, and exciting, that these two polar opposites could be brothers
at all.
Congratulations to Matthew Warchus, the director, for helping to elicit
performances of this calibre. True West is a lean play, acute in the way it
touches on the larger politics of sibling rivalry, but not endlessly growing
in the mind as one watches it. To my surprise, however, it had just as much
tension the second time around, and seemed less, not more schematic. For two
actors to alternate like this is daring, and marvellous.
At the Donmar Warehouse, WC2.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Arts: The future starts to reveal itself - Antony Thorncroft
takes a close look at arts funding, orchestras and the Baroness's successor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The nation's arts companies will be blessed if they expect little when their
cheques arrive from the Arts Council for 1995-1996. Lord Gowrie, council
chairman, said this week that he was not optimistic about persuading Stephen
Dorrell, heritage secretary, to restore the Pounds 3.5m cut in the English
Arts Council's grant made a year ago.
He is resigned to standstill funding and the possibility that some arts
companies will fold. By the end of this financial year the nation's Big Four
 -the Royal Opera, ENO, RSC and the National Theatre - will have combined
deficits of more than Pounds 5m: even getting back the Pounds 3.5m will not
bring financial health to the arts.
But Gowrie warned against public whingeing. As a former arts minister he
could confidently assert that when leading figures mounted their coffee
tables and demanded more subsidy, the political Establishment quickly sided
with the Treasury in keeping arts funding on a tight rein.
David Mellor's success as an arts-loving Treasury secretary in getting a
substantial lift in funding four years ago has proved a liability. The
Treasury regarded it as the final hand-out, but already recession-hit
companies are back with their begging bowls.
The next few months are crucial. By April lottery money will be feeding into
the arts. It is meant for capital projects but companies such as the
National Theatre are forced to spend large chunks of their grant on patching
up the building. If the lottery sorts this out the NT can release money into
new productions and eliminate any 1994-1995 deficit.
*
The orchestras are at last realising that they must change their ways if
they are to maintain a live audience for classical music.
The future starts to reveal itself at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on the South
Bank on November 30 when the London Mozart Players perform Mozart and Haydn
enhanced by a large screen at the back of the hall.
Blitz Vision is simultaneously videoing the concert, and the audience will
see close-ups on screen of the musicians and the conductor Matthias Bamert,
whose cool exterior apparently hides wonderful facial expressions until now
enjoyed only by the players. There will also be sub-titles.
The musicians have been told to ham it up a bit, with plenty of mutual
glances and soft smiles for the screen. They are also expected to improve
their behaviour on stage - less talking and more cohesion in their exits and
entrances.
The South Bank will watch the experiment with interest: it will be expected
to pay for any permanent screen coverage. Next spring the SB is planning to
introduce its own audio guides to concerts.
What with the more relaxed attitude towards dress pioneered by the RPO, a
visit to an orchestral concert will soon be as invigorating as watching Pink
Floyd at Earl's Court.
*
The hunt is on for a successor to Baroness O'Cathain who last week took
fully paid leave of absence as managing director of the Barbican. Bernard
Harty, the City Chamberlain, who has stepped into the breach, is expected to
keep the seat warm for her successor, or rather successors.
The Barbican needs two people, a managing type with arty leanings to run the
place, and an arts director to look after the programming. There should be
no shortage of applicants, with the top job commanding a salary of about
Pounds 100,000 a year, the highest in the arts in the UK, and the deputy
getting around Pounds 70,000.
The head-hunters will be looking at a short, select list. Patrick Deuchar
has made a success of the Royal Albert Hall and must be in the frame, along
with John Tusa, a successful ex-BBC boss. It would be difficult to lure
Brian McMaster away from the Edinburgh Festival, but Genista Mackintosh,
ex-RSC, now National Theatre, has the experience. Ian Horsborough, who runs
the Guildhall School, is on the spot and Anthony Whitworth-Jones might be
prepared to leave Glyndebourne now that the new theatre has opened.
For the arts planning job the successful applicant must be well versed in
classical music, so Paul Findlay, ex-Covent Garden, now RPO, might be
considered, or Ian Ritchie, who has just left Opera North.
Running the Barbican is an odd sort of job. The theatre programming is
handled by the RSC and much of the music by the LSO, the Barbican's house
band. The managing director must be on top of the bars, cafes, parking,
lavatories and general ambience of the place, but must also inspire arts
festivals and give the Barbican an artistic style and cutting edge.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Arts: Upbeat and dreamy - An unashamedly escapist 'A
Midsummer Night's Dream'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH HEMMING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Six years ago the Georgian Film Actors' Studio of Tbilisi was the toast of
the Edinburgh Festival with its mischievous Don Juan. The company's
irreverent version of Moliere's play was laced with witty stage business and
absurd characters, the most inspired being an onstage prompt who ran the
show from a hole in the stage, chivvying along her wayward co-performers.
The same light touch and impish mood characterises the company's A Midsummer
Night's Dream (showing in The Pit as part of the Everybody's Shakespeare
Festival), though this time the comedy is gentler and more benign. Mikhail
Tumanishvili, the company's charismatic director, developed this production
during 1992, when Georgia was gripped by civil war. Rather than reflect the
distress around him, he chose to cheer his audiences up, and his production
is unashamedly escapist and genial, turning its back on some of the darker
notes in the play.
The production's airy, dreamy mood is helped by the set, a simple cream
space backed by a brightly coloured curtain that looks like a Jackson
Pollock off-cut and a row of gauze screens also streaked with paint. This
suggests a spirit of creativity, while at the same time being reminiscent of
a nursery, and it makes for one single arena which, differently lit, is at
once Athenian court, dark wood and fairy bower. This emphasises physically
that the dream world and real world are closely intertwined - a notion
Tumanishvili reinforces by having Titania and Oberon played by the same
couple as Theseus and Hyppolita. Puck simply substitutes Theseus's golden
wreath with a crown of fruits and flowers, and we are in the fairy world.
This economy keeps the production moving along gracefully.
But while the production emphasises how the worlds of the play co-exist, it
also, paradoxically, extracts plenty of comedy from the fact that they are
oblivious to one another. Theseus and Hyppolita glide around in beatific
beauty, impervious to the muddle around them; the fairies scurry about
constantly, hiding behind the screens to titter at the mortals, and the
mechanicals keep creeping through scenes, cowed and whispering, intent on
their duty.
This is most effective, however, with the lovers, who are wonderfully,
idiotically wrapped up in their own little world. They are wittily coupled:
Lysander (Giorgi Pipinashvili) has a slightly rakish air that complements
Nineli Chankvetadze's sweet, girlish Hermia (who takes a favourite cushion
and a giant alarm clock with her to elope), while Gia Abesalashvili's
precious, petulant Demetrius is a nice match for Rusudan Bolkvadze's sad,
old-fashioned Helena. This foursome are delightfully young, foolish and full
of comedy - at one point Helena, in her pursuit of Demetrius, rings him up
on a silver phone, trying to cry without smudging her mascara as he rebuffs
her again.
The production is full of nice comic touches, repeated here and there to
pull the production together and lend it a feeling of harmony. The fairies,
having got their queen off to sleep, drop the fairy-like behaviour and whip
out a pack of cards; later, after a splendid rendition of Pyramus and
Thisby, the workmen sink on to their stage for a well-earned snout.
The staging lacks somewhat in sexual charge and is not as dark or mysterious
as some. But it is a charming, humane production, that brings the
Everybody's Shakespeare Festival to an upbeat close. Finishes today at The
Pit.

FT  19 NOV 94 / The FT Christmas Show Guide: A Dickens of a time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christmas, it often seems, means Dickens. You can see why. There is Scrooge,
of course, and the Spirits of Christmas Past, Present and To Come; there are
the affecting snow scenes in several other novels. And there is the love of
family and friends to which he so often returns.
Since Dickens has always prompted British character actors to their most
acute performances (there have been at least three new British stagings of
Great Expectations since early September), it is no wonder that several new
Dickens stagings occur this Christmas in London.
A Christmas Carol comes to the Barbican, in the world premiere of a new
adaptation by John Mortimer, directed by Ian Judge, with Clive Francis as
Scrooge, opening on December 6. (Meanwhile in Manchester Scrooge runs for
two months at the Palace Theatre.)
Oliver, the Lionel Bart musical version of Oliver Twist, comes to the
Palladium in an important new production by Sam Mendes, starring Jonathan
Pryce as Fagin (also starring Ruthie Henshall, Sally Dexter), opening on
December 8. At the Battersea Arts cafe, Sketches by Boz, adapted by critic
Robert Butler, with music by Stephen Lade and directed by Graham Sinclair,
opens on November 29. And a new version of A Tale of Two Cities by Matthew
Francis opens at Greenwich Theatre on December 19.
But Christmas can also mean novelty; and a surprising number of new or
modern plays comes to the West End in this period. One of the Royal Court's
most acclaimed novelties this year, My Night with Reg, by Kevin Elyot and
directed by Roger Michell, is opening at the Criterion Theatre in late
November. Pinter's supreme (and very short) one-act play Landscape comes to
the Cottesloe Theatre, in the staging (by Pinter himself) which was the
highlight of this May's superb Pinter festival at the Gate Theatre, Dublin,
and very nearly of all 1994; Penelope Wilton and Ian Holm star.
On November 29, Richard Nelson's New England has its world premiere with the
RSC at the Pit; Peter Gill directs, and the cast includes Angela Thorne.
Described as 'humorous and ironic', it deals with the feelings of English
exiles in America. The Theatre de Complicite opens its latest production,
Out of a House walked a man . . ., at the Lyttelton Theatre on December 1;
directed by Simon McBurney with a cohort of Complicite stars (Kathryn
Hunter, Toby Jones, Marcello Magni, Toby Sedgwick). And on December 13,
Slavs, the latest play by Tony Kushner (he of Angels in America) opens at
the Hampstead Theatre, with an illustrious cast including Annette Badland,
Ron Cook, Imelda Staunton, Paul Jesson, and Aisling O'Sullivan; Matthew
Lloyd directs. The subtitle is Thinking about the Longstanding Problems of
Virtue and Happiness.
Meanwhile, at the Bush Theatre, the excellent Dominic Dromgoole directs an
'epic' production of Raising Fires (opening on November 25), a prize-winning
new play by Jenny McLeod: desire, revenge, and arson in 16th xentury Essex
around Tilda, the town's first black woman. And, on December 1 in
Scarborough, Alan Ayckbourn presents, and directs, his third new play this
year: The Musical Jigsaw Play.
Christmas also means children's stories - by Kenneth Grahame, Hans Christian
Andersen, the Brothers Grimm, et al - several of which reach our stages this
year. The 1990 Alan Bennett version of A Wind in the Willows returns to the
Olivier Theatre on December 15, for what is said to be its final revival. At
the Young Vic (opening on December 7), the poet Carol Ann Duffy adapts Grimm
Tales (eight of them), directed by Tim Supple. At the Lyric Hammersmith
(opening December 12), Neil Bartlett adapts and directs Andersen's The
Little Match Girl; the effects, by Forkbeard Fantasy, include nine-foot
teddy-bears, dancing Christmas dinners, live satellite links to heaven, and
disreputable angels.
In BAC Studio One (Battersea, opening on December 7), Tom Smith directs
Peter Pan, an Edwardian Fantasy. And, straight after Christmas, the
unclassifiable Music Theatre London brings to the Queen Elizabeth Hall its
1992 hit version of Rossini's Cinderella (Cinderella's father is Essex man;
her step-sisters are played by men; Prince Charming is played by a woman).
Christmas, since it involves carols, also just means, for many people,
musicals. New British musical productions include Out of the Blue (opening
later this month at the Shaftesbury), two versions of Calamity Jane (one
opening at the Leicester Haymarket on November 22, one at the BAC,
Battersea, on December 9), and Phyllida Lloyd's staging of The Threepenny
Opera at the Donmar Warehouse (opening on December 14).

FT  19 NOV 94 / The FT Christmas Show Guide: Sound of Nut-cracking -
Unneccessary conflict in London dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since Christmas is a deja vu phenomenon anyway, it is - I grudgingly suppose
 -no surprise that this yuletide's dance offerings should be the inevitable
Nutcracker and Cinderella. There is an unnecessary conflict in London this
year, since both English National Ballet and the Birmingham Royal Ballet are
offering concurrent cracking of nuts.
ENB plays its traditional Nutcracker season at the Royal Festival Hall. The
staging is the sugary Ben Stevenson version but the young enjoy it and there
are some interesting principal casts - to which Santa's promised gift of a
pair of wild horses may just be able to drag me. Nutcracker is at the Royal
Festival Hall from December 21 to January 14 - plenty of matinees.
There follows a week of Swan Lake in ENB's sensible Bolshoi-inspired
version, from January 16 to 21. The Birmingham Nutcracker receives its first
London showing in a season at The Coliseum from December 22 until January 7.
The staging is Peter Wright's handsome version, handsomely decorated by John
Macfarlane, which has much to recommend it, including a couple of
performances starring Irek Mukhamedov (December 22 and the matinee on
December 24) and three guest appearances by Petter Jacobsson. There are
plenty of matinees. BRB also plays Nutcracker in its home Hippodrome Theatre
from December 9 until December 17, with the elegant Peter Boal as a guest
from New York City Ballet at a couple of performances.
At Covent Garden, the Royal Ballet shows an Ashton triple bill - which
should appeal to older children - on December 15, and matinee and evening on
December 17. Then its visually desperate Sleeping Beauty staging is exposed
on December 20 (matinee and evening), 21,22,28 (m&amp;e) and January 4, with
Ashton's irresistible Cinderella to delight us all on December 23 (m&amp;e), 26
(m&amp;e), 27, 30, 31 (m&amp;e), January 3.
There is - quelle surprise - a single Swan Lake on January 5. Check timings
of all performances carefully: there are early matinee and evening curtains,
which can mean glum faces in the Crush Bar while the first act goes its
no-seats-until-the-interval way.
North of the border, Scottish Ballet offers Peter Darrell's Nutcracker at
Edinburgh's Festival Theatre from December 28 to January 7. Again, please
check dates and times.
In New York, City Ballet will play its usual happy season of Balanchine's
lovely Nutcracker from November 30 until December 31, and then follow with
an eight-week season of varied repertory.
The Paris Opera Ballet, installed at the Bastille Opera House, performs
Rudolf Nureyev's version of Swan Lake during December with a wonderful
roster of principals (who may include Altynai Asylmuratova for a couple of
performances). Check locally for details.
For anyone needing more precise information, The Dancing Times carries a
monthly calendar of future performances, dates, timings, both here and
abroad.

FT  19 NOV 94 / The FT Christmas Show Guide: The pantomime strikes back - A
report on this year's seasonal fun of dubious cross-dressing and corny jokes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oh yes it is] Panto time is almost upon us and once again the nation will
over-indulge on a diet of corny jokes, sexist plot lines, dubious
cross-dressings, and a veritable orgy of political incorrectness.
There is something wonderfully unchanging about pantomime. Year after year
the same sets, the same costumes, the same stories, the same sweets
(provided by perennial sponsor Cadbury), the same casts are taken out of
storage to be thoroughly enjoyed by the same audiences. For many it is the
only occasion in the year they enter a theatre and, despite regular scare
stories that this is a dying art form, panto is actually enjoying a robust
revival.
According to panto king Paul Elliott, who will be masterminding around 30
pantomimes this Christmas, last season was a 'vintage' year. 'Every single
one of our pantos made a profit'. This year will be 'spectacular - bookings
are already 75 per cent of the way towards target'.
Every year Elliott invests in a new pantomime which - with a little sprucing
up - travels the nation for a decade or more. This year it is Jack and the
Beanstalk, a Pounds 400,000 investment which opens at the Birmingham
Hippodrome and has already pulled in Pounds 1m at the box office. It
features the biggest giant to stalk the boards in years, operated by a team
of four and measuring 15 feet from waist to head. There is also a 'Flight
through Space' film which should generate a few 'ooos'. Competing with the
special effects are the likes of Su Pollard, Don MacLean - and Scorpio.
Now Scorpio is a Gladiator and this year Gladiators, tough men and women
from the Saturday night television martial arts programme, are ubiquitous.
If little else changes in Pantoland every year, the latest craze is
incorporated into the format to pull in the kids. At one time it was pop
stars; then the performers from Australian soaps tested their acting skills;
then sports stars, like Ian Botham, Tessa Sandersen, and Annabel Croft, all
of whom are appearing again this Christmas, plus Kriss Akabusi making his
debut in Dick Whittington at the Mayflower, Southampton.
This year names like Trojan (at Bournemouth); Zodiac (at Crawley); Jet
(Reading); and Cobra (Swansea), Gladiators all, pepper the playbills. They
will be learning the ropes from old troupers, who have devoted their careers
to panto. Jack Tripp, for example, is well into his seventies, but still
regarded as the best Dame in the business. This year he teams up with
another old pro, Roy Hudd, in Babes in the Wood, at Sadler's Wells, the only
panto this Christmas in central London.
John Inman is another actor seldom seen at this time of the year without his
bloomers on: he will be bringing his Dame to Mother Goose at Stockport. A
younger rival in the field is Christopher Biggins who, as Widow Twankey,
will be giving Aladdin a hard time at Norwich. It will be interesting to
compare his technique with the Twankey of Danny la Rue at Plymouth.
Other old stagers to look out for are Lionel Blair, with Britt Ekland, an
enthusiastic pantomime fairy, in Jack &amp; the Beanstalk at Bath; Ronnie
Corbett (still the best Buttons in the business) in Cinderella at Cardiff;
Peggy Mount also in Cinderella - at Redhill; and Rolf Harris (with June
Whitfield and Ian Botham) in yet another Cinderella at Wimbledon.
There are the usual eye-brow raising permutations - the abrasive Dennis
Waterman and his equally feisty wife Rula Lenska in the Reading Aladdin;
Hinge &amp; Bracket sharing Beauty and the Beast at Crawley; Russ Abbot in the
rarely mounted Goldilocks at Woking: and, if you need to know, Little &amp;
Large are in Newcastle and Cannon &amp; Ball in Edinburgh. But often in pantos
it is the rarely recognised troupers in the smaller roles that steal the
show rather than the big names who get by serving up their traditional
material.
Of course, the popularity and success of panto (the box office take enables
many theatres to stay open for the rest of the year) upsets intellectuals,
and there is the usual attempt, invariably by the subsidised theatres, to
clean up the format. The Contact Theatre in Manchester is presenting a
politically correct Cinderella in which the heroine goes off with 'Buttons'
rather than the rich Prince.
There is also a trend to dramatise traditional children's stories as
alternative seasonal treats, like the multi-racial The Wiz at the Riverside
Studios in Hammersmith and tales of the Brothers Grimm at the Young Vic. And
in a real spate of Peter Pans, which offer all the hero-and-villain
excitements of panto plus some intriguing sexual and textual under-tones,
Barrie's Freudian story seems so suitable for Christmas that Richmond is
presenting a panto version starring the unlikely duo of Leslie Grantham and
Una Stubbs.
Pantomime now appeals mainly to very young children rather than parents, or
rather fathers, who a century ago were lured by the legs of the fast
disappearing Principal Boy. It remains the last bastion of family
entertainment and is surviving well. Critics of panto should ask themselves
why the packed audiences do not return to the theatre for other productions.

FT  19 NOV 94 / The FT Christmas Show Guide: A steadfast ritual
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christmas concerts vary little in substance from year to year. If they did,
they would scarcely qualify as Christmassy. Carols, Messiah, The Nutcracker
and a small range of cantatas and orchestra bonbons such as Leroy Anderson's
Sleigh Ride or Prokofiev's Troika from Lieutenant Kije are mandatory. A
small amount of variation and innovation is possible, but generally a
Christmas concert is as steadfast a ritual as a football match.
Each of the half dozen main London concert halls is rising to the seasonal
spirit and doubtless relishing the prospect of family sales. The Barbican
Centre - self-styled as 'London's Christmas Venue' - has developed a
tradition even though it is only 12 years old.
The Barbican Hall will be resounding with such festive numbers as Puccini's
Christmas Eve love duet from La Boheme and Leopold Mozart's Toy Symphony,
played by the London Concert Orchestra under David Arnold on December 10;
and Britten's Ceremony of Carols, Hugh Wood's Fanfare for Christmas, and
Stravinsky's Circus Polka is performed there by the Royal Philharmonic
Orchestra under John Scott on December 16.
There are two Messiahs - one to be given by the National Westminster Choir
and the Rosebery Orchestra under Ian Humphris, on December 12 and an account
by the City of London Sinfonia orchestra and singers conducted by Richard
Hickox with excellent soloists in Nancy Argenta, Michael Chance, Martyn Hill
and Stephen Roberts the following night. The night after that, Handel lovers
who missed these renditions can enjoy selections from the oratorio performed
by those Christmas veterans, the Choir of King's College, Cambridge, with
the English Chamber under Stephen Cleobury (Haydn's St Nicolas Mass and a
Vivaldi concerto for two trumpets also included).
Also in Barbican Hall there is the LSO Christmas Festival running on the
evenings of December 17, 18 and 19, in which Richard Hickox conducts the
London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus in standard seasonal items including
carols with audience participation. The King's consort and Choir of New
College Oxford join to perform Christmas things by Handel and Corelli on
December 22. Howard Blake's children's favourite, The Snowman, is being
given by the Wren Orchestra under the composer with narrator Robert Hardy
and treble Connor Burrowes on the afternoon of December 28.
The South Bank Centre offers much of the same sort of fare. David Arnold
directs the London Concert Orchestra on December 16 in the Festival Hall),
assisted by Patrick Harrild as soloist in Kleinsinger's Tubby the Tuba, and
compere Johnny Morris. Kids themselves - in the form of the two divisions of
the National Children's Orchestra - perform on Sunday afternoon and evening
in the Queen Elizabeth Hall with quite ambitious programmes: the first
beginning festively with Gordon Jacob's A Noyse of Minstrells, and the
second ending with Stravinsky's Firebird suite.
Running in the Queen Elizabeth Hall for a week just after Christmas is
Rossini's opera, Cinderella. Music Theatre London's irreverent version is
said to be a fine entertainment.
Soprano-animateur Jane Manning and her Minstrels, with the aid of the Park
Lane Group, are mounting a lively-looking production of The Snow Queen
involving children alongside professional singers and instrumentalists at
the Queen Elizabeth Hall on December 21. Not to be missed there on the
following evening is the Tallis Scholar's programme of seasonal but masterly
music by Palestrina, Lassus, Victoria and others. Simultaneous with this a
Christmas Jazz Gala in the Purcell Room featuring vibes player Orphy
Robinson, pianist Jason Rebello and other prominent figures.
The Wigmore Hall is mustering some distinguished singers and players - among
them baritone Thomas Allen and Young Musician of the Year, cellist Natalie
Clein - for the seasonal miscellany of The Wigmore Christmas Cracker on
December 17; while virtually every night in December at St John's, Smith
Square is devoted to festivity, with Messiahs conducted by John Lubbock on
December 15 and 16.
Most notable is the Magenta Music agency's week long International Christmas
Festival, which besides two more Messiahs on December 21 and 23 offers
carols from Copenhagen on December 22.
Christopher Bowers-Broadbent's recital of organ music by Charles Tournemire
on December 21 and a rich programme, 'Gloria in Exclesis', of 15th, 16th and
20th century polyphonic vocal music will be given by the The Sixteen,
conducted by Harry Christophers, also responsible for the second of those
Messiahs.
Handel's setting of the Amen alone will account for hours and hours of
musical time over the coming weeks.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Arts: The fine art of spoiling tactics - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recently visiting Prague, I noted the logo of a black bow-tie on posters for
the Classical Music radio station. While Radio 3 tries to popularise
classics with blokey accessibility the Czechs' selling-point is glamour
after dowdy egalitarianism. Our own Classic FM tends to the latter, with its
prize 'romantic weekends in the East Midlands' and genteel commercials for
Black Magic, investment advisers and Palmolive - whose products you may
sample from reception at Classic FM itself. How can the BBC compete? I know
from bitter experience that passers-by are refused even a bath-salt in the
lobby of Broadcasting House.
Spoiling tactics are part of market practice; Classic FM has this to a fine
art. Last week it countered Radio 3's live Romeo et Juliette from Covent
Garden with a recording of the same composer's Faust. This is hard on the
Corporation whose current opera-drive includes non-musical dramatisations of
well-known opera plots. Knee-jerk objections at the form's inanity overlook
the fact that most successful operas were based on books or plays anyway.
Sunday's Vie de Boheme, by John Clifford after Henri Murger, was quite jolly
and as well acted and directed as most drama on Radio 4. Bracing to be
reminded that Puccini's romantic garret-dwellers were con-men and trollopes.
North British listeners can enjoy Radio Scotland's The Score. Such
apparently esoteric themes as Xennakis' trombone concerto and
music-publishing in 18-century Edinburgh are presented with unpatronising
friendliness by Elaine Navickas who gets it just right. Perhaps Nick Kenyon
of troubled Radio 3 should lend an ear. Radio Scotland also scooped the
week's oddest news story: the MP for Monklands East battling with the
Benedictine brothers of Buckfast Abbey over their 'medicinal wine' which has
apparently turned North Lanark's youth into a race of drunks. Eighty per
cent of the monastic output finds its way north from Devon (those monks know
their market). 'I should have the healthiest constituents under the sun,'
she said (apparently not).
What would Radio 4's rebarbative Moral Maze make of it? The curiously
composed team of ethical experts includes the historian David Starkie who
sprang to media fame in a TV mock-trial of Richard III some years ago, when
he flew into a tantrum, insulted a distinguished barrister and hurled
schoolboy rudeness in all directions. He has now set up in garrulous
pomposity on his own account. He is well partnered by Edward Pearce of The
Guardian, notable for angrily shouting 'you fool]' at an elderly Jew
expressing concern at the rise of Italian neo-fascism. I seek moral
guidelines elsewhere.
Not with pharisaic local authorities, however. Saturday saw the launch of
Scapegoats (Radio 4), whose uncompromising title nails its accusing colours
to the mast. Hugh Prysor-Jones began with single parents and a reminder of
pregnant women driven over the parish boundary even in labour so as not to
be a local financial burden. More to come, including travellers and
homosexuals; and more that sounds uncomfortably familiar.
On Remembrance Sunday Angela Rippon softened her schoolmarm persona to talk
to a wide range of soldiers and civilians on Radio 2. Simple questions
prompted profound responses, as with the nurse whose precise Scots tones
faltered when she recalled Belsen survivors; or the Korean war amputee,
military antecedents going back to Waterloo, wondering when it would all end
(there are currently 17 wars involving British personnel). The absence of
rancour, the lack of rage compared favourably in the sensitivity stakes with
the average Guardian journalist.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Arts: Why Saturday night is not a lottery - Christopher
Dunkley finds himself trapped in a time warp watching television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cilla Black has gorra lorra Lycra tights, a lorra heart, and an awful lorra
ratings for ITV since 1985 when she began presenting the British version of
Blind Date early on Saturday evenings. The question is will the twinkle, the
charm, and the Liverpool accent - and of course the attractiveness of the
guys and gals on either side of the Blind Date partition - be enough to hold
the line in the ratings battle this evening when BBC1 wheels out what we are
told is going to be the biggest gun ever seen in the war for the television
audience in Britain: The National Lottery Live.
According to the ratings gurus who have studied lottery programmes in other
countries, we can expect as many as 25 million, even 30 million people to
watch, a figure which would immediately take the lottery not just to No 1 in
the weekly ratings, but No 1 in the year. It is a rare programme these days
that attracts more than 20m viewers; in 1994 only Torvill and Dean's bid for
Olympic gold has gone higher (23.95m). So if the lottery really does
regularly attract as many as 25m, it will completely upset the well
established pattern of viewing at teatime on Saturdays.
And what a good thing that will be. To immerse yourself in the programmes
which currently dominate the screen at this time is to find yourself
slipping into a time warp. Before settling down on the old green sofa you
may believe that you live in a post-communist, post-feminist age, the era of
cyberspace and the internet. But after watching Bruce Forsyth's Generation
Game and Noel's House Party on BBC1, or Blind Date and Family Fortunes on
ITV, you may wonder whether that futuristic stuff was all a dream. The
atmosphere in which Cilla and Brucie, Noel and Les (Les Dennis, host of
Family Fortunes) smother you is one in which it would come as no surprise to
be urged to 'Dig For Victory]'.
When I turned my attention back to these programmes recently, having ignored
them for years (on the same grounds that FT book critics ignore Barbara
Cartland's immensely popular novels) I was baffled by a sense of deep but
almost forgotten familiarity. Then it came to me. The activities and, more
important, the attitudes in these programmes bear a strong resemblance to
parties organised by my parents in the late 1940s and early 50s, events
which attempted to reproduce in the home the sort of parties they had
experienced at church socials in the 1930s.
There were lots of organised activities with mandatory jollity. Teams had to
pass an orange from one to another using only their knees, or a matchbox
using only their noses. There were costumes for acting games, just as on The
Generation Game. Practical jokes were elaborate: one person would be
required to imitate exactly the motions of another who would draw his finger
across the underside of a plate and then down his face, the victim not
realising that his plate had been coated in candle black.
As with Saturday teatime telly, what mattered was mucking in and having a
good time, bonhomie and laughing vigorously at weak jokes, the teller
laughing hardest of all. Above all you had to be a good sport when made to
appear ridiculous, just as you do when showered with green slime by Noel
Edmonds. On Blind Date even attitudes towards class seem trapped in the
1940s. Last week a Liberace lookalike was set up by La Black as some sort of
toff of whom she, as a working class lass, pretended to be in awe. This was
pursued throughout his time on the programme even though his supposedly
upper class clothing was actually a toastmaster's uniform.
If the lottery programme blows some of this stuff out of the water it will
be no bad thing, though we have yet to see what the new programme itself
will be like. Ominously it is to be presented by Noel Edmonds, a man who
gives the impression that he would regard the matchbox-on-the-nose trick as
a bit too sophisticated for Saturday teatime.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Arts: Expats on a shoestring - The British School in Rome
has had to come out from behind its elegant facade and justify itself.
William Packer argues the case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alone of the British Schools abroad, The British School in Rome is concerned
with study far beyond the usual range of classical antiquity and
archaeology. Almost from the start scholarships in painting, engraving,
sculpture and architecture were established at the school to match those in
archaeology.
But if fine art has always been integral to the school, it has also seemed a
thing apart. While archaeologists, historians, classicists and distinguished
visiting academics of all kinds came and went, the artists simply got on
with art. There was no actual harm in that, yet here was a college that
offered limitless opportunity for inter-disciplinary curiosity.
Under the present director, Richard Hodges, all that has changed. His term
has coincided with a period of financial uncertainty and so the number of
scholars has been reduced, and the Sargant Fellowship (established for a
senior artist - split three ways this year) and a number of smaller awards
set up to bring maturer artists to the school for shorter periods.
But Dr Hodges' strictures have applied not just to fine art, but to the
whole school. What before might have been assumed had now to be sought out,
earned, paid for. The British School has had to come out from behind its
elegantly defensive Lutyens facade above the Valle Giulia and enter actively
into the cultural life of Rome itself.
What is more, Dr Hodges realised that while books and libraries and
excavations are all very well, it was the visual arts that were, well,
visible. Some three years ago, a programme of exhibitions and related talks
was instituted, modest enough in itself, for the school's gallery is small,
but of quite disproportionate effect. It has brought to a steadily
increasing and now loyal Roman audience the work of nearly a dozen British
artists so far. All enjoy a certain reputation in Britain, but not in Rome.
Several have since been shown by Roman galleries.
It has to be said that hitherto the range of artists has been fairly narrow,
with almost all of them a sometime winner or on the short-list for the
Turner Prize. Of this year's runners, Willie Doherty is showing in the
school at the moment, (until December 20) and both Antony Gormley and
Shirazeh Houshiary have shown there. The balance has been very much with the
sculptural, the minimal and the conceptual.
That narrowness is at least admitted and we shall see to what extent
corrected. The argument is only against an apparent exclusivity, for a list
that has already included Howard Hodgkin, Antony Gormley, Hamish Fulton,
Richard Deacon and David Tremlett, with Rachel Whiteread, Lisa Milroy and
Bridget Riley to come, is strong enough.
The British Council in Rome has seen here an opportunity for itself, and now
supports works closely with the school, seeing it as a useful showcase for
what otherwise would not have been exhibited. New circumstances and mutual
opportunities have been exploited.
The exhibition programme is run on a shoestring, with some Pounds 9,000 put
up by the school itself and a further Pounds 16,000 coming from other
sources, including the Henry Moore Foundation and the British Council. An
annual budget of Pounds 25,000 is very small in terms of potential
sponsorship, but then so is the funding of the British School itself: Pounds
80,000 would secure all the activities of the school, from archaeology to
art, year on year. A capital sum of Pounds 2.5m would set up the School
completely for 50 years.
Here is an institution, characteristically British in its informality, yet
of world class in its scholarship, its reputation in archaeology second to
none, and now ever more prominent and active in its engagement with the
visual arts. Yet here it is, still insecure in its finances and fabric, and
undermined at a distance by academic prejudice and indifference. If that is
also very British, we should be ashamed of ourselves.
But the outlook is promising, if only because the school itself is so
special, and so good in what it does. An historian, Wallace Hadrill, takes
over as director next year, the first non-archaeologist in the appointment.
He is fortunate in his predecessor, first for the opportunity that Dr Hodges
has created and then for the impetus he has already generated in its
exploitation. In wishing him well, we are also telling him not to stop.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Books: New order in the archipelago

<TEXT>
A NATION IN WAITING: INDONESIA IN THE 1990s
by Adam Schwarz
UCL Press
Pounds 15.95, 370 pages
A country where the president's children are routinely handed control of big
businesses sounds more like a failed African dictatorship than one of Asia's
free market economic successes.
Such is the paradox of President Suharto's Indonesia: the authorities are
corrupt, prone to nepotism and have scant respect for human rights, yet the
country attracts billions of dollars in annual foreign investment and aid,
and its economy grows consistently at more than six per cent a year.
Indonesia is one of Asia's most important but least understood emerging
economies. With more than 180m inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous
country in the world, and home to more Moslems than any other nation. The
archipelago stretching from Sumatra to Irian Jaya includes somewhere between
13,000 and 17,000 islands; even the Indonesians are not sure.
Schwarz, who reported on Indonesia for the Far Eastern Economic Review for
four years, explains many of the baffling complexities of Indonesian
politics and commerce with clarity, precision and some well-chosen examples
of how nepotism and cronyism function in practice.
Due credit is given to Suharto's 'New Order' government for restoring
political stability after the overthrow of Sukarno in 1966 and laying
foundations for economic growth. But few businessmen in Jakarta would
dispute Schwarz's conclusion on the economic influence of Indonesia's first
family: 'In recent years,' he writes, 'hardly a single major infrastructure
contract has been awarded without one Suharto relative or other having a
piece of it . . the tendering process is just for appearances' sake. The
only suspense is over which crony will emerge victorious.'
Schwarz also explores the shifting balance of power between the armed forces
and civilians in government, the role of Chinese businessmen, the different
strands of Islamic thought, and the conflict in the Indonesian-occupied
territory of East Timor.
He also analyses the rancorous dispute between the 'technologists' and the
'technocrats': the technologists, led by BJ Habibie, the Research and
Technology Minister and close friend of Suharto, favour the immediate
establishment of high-technology industries; the technocrats dismiss this as
costly and over-ambitious, and believe Indonesia should use its cheap labour
to develop export industries step by step.
Indonesians and foreigners agree, however, that the most important questions
concern the succession to Suharto - the retired general is 73, has held
power for 28 years and has no obvious successor - and the future evolution
of the country's authoritarian political system. Will it be possible to
arrange an orderly transfer of power to a new president? Has authoritarian
rule, regarded as necessary by many Indonesians following the massacres of
the mid-1960s, outlived its usefulness?
Schwarz notes the increased militancy of factory workers, the frustration of
Indonesia's sophisticated middle class with the sterility of intellectual
and political debate, and the jockeying for power among army officers and
politicians, but he is prevented from predicting an outcome to the
succession debate by the enigmatic Suharto's refusal to state his
intentions.
Given that Suharto's opinions are crucial yet impenetrable, Schwarz has done
an admirably thorough job of explaining the most significant political and
economic dilemmas confronting the Indonesian elite.

ALL THE TROUBLE IN THE WORLD
by PJ O'Rourke
Picador
Pounds 14.99, 344 pages
Are you dreading the future? Do predictions of population explosion and
environmental apocalypse keep you up at night? Do you keep one eye on the
ozone layer and the other on the number of preservatives in your dinner?
Well, worry no more. P. J. O'Rourke is here to tell you that everything is
going to be all right.
In case you don't know, O'Rourke is a libertarian humorist who made a name
for himself in the Reagan/Thatcher years as that most oxymoronic of
creatures - a right wing party animal. With books like Republican Party
Reptile and Give War a Chance, he dared to suggest that conservatism can be
fun. In All the Trouble in the World, he takes on the world's doom-mongers
and worry-warts, maintaining that the dark clouds on our planet's horizon
are the product of their hot air rather than any real crisis.
His premise is simple. 'Life is sweet. But you could spend a long time
reading, going to the movies, and watching TV and not hear this mentioned .
. . we should be enjoying ourselves, and we are not.'
The reason for the psychic sourness is that we have let ourselves be conned
by environmentalists, UN bureaucrats and concerned politicians into thinking
that the world's a mess, when in fact life is better than ever.
To support this proposition, O'Rourke visits Bangladesh, Somalia, the
Amazon, Haiti, the former Yugoslavia and Vietnam, finding that people
everywhere are pretty much just folks and that, all in all, things are less
horrible than they used to be. Bangladesh may be overcrowded, but it is no
more densely populated than your basic California suburb, while life
expectancy, disease control and the infrastructure are improving all the
time (in Bangladesh, that is.)
Similarly, Vietnam, though still nominally Marxist, has largely thrown off
the shackles of central planning to embrace a market economy that allows it
both to grow and to forget the horrors of war. And as for the precious
rainforest, well, have you ever had chiggers? The author gets them while on
in Brazil, and, after weeks of unrelieved itching, finds the prospect of
deforestation considerably less repugnant.
O'Rourke is at his best when simply hanging out with people, observing the
way they live and soaking up the hospitality which seems to increase
geometrically the farther one strays from centres of wealth. He is
particularly enamoured of the Haitians, who invite him to witness a voodoo
ceremony, and the Vietnamese, who possess awe-inspiring industriousness and
good cheer. He is also a gifted humorist with a deadly accurate eye, never
sharper than when he points out that 'starving children are cute . . .
Steven Spielberg's ET owes a lot to the Biafran-Bangladeshi-Ethiopian model
of adorable suffering.'
O'Rourke proves less convincing when he puts on his thinking cap. When he
claims the current mess in Yugoslavia is an example of 'multiculturalism in
practice', he gets it exactly wrong - Bosnia is what happens when
multicultural tolerance is not being practiced. And when the author points
to the truly horrific pollution of Eastern Bloc countries as something that
inevitably happens when government manages the environment, he blatantly
ignores the state-regulated cleanliness of many Northern European nations.
These lapses are a pity - they sound a bitter note in an otherwise engaging
book. Rhetoric is a poor substitute for belly laughs. More visits with
resilient people and less theorising about lousy government would have gone
further to proving the author's point.

SCENES FROM A POISONERS'S LIFE
by Nigel Williams
Faber &amp; Faber
Pounds 14.99, 217 pages
SWEETS FROM STRANGERS
by Simon Corrigan
Andre Deutsch
Pounds 13.99, 180 pages
A killer cleaning lady from Guatemala, an arsonist electrician, serial
murder, an onanist in a coffin, racism, teenage love, middle aged love,
married lust, disillusionment and mail-order Satanism; all in the cycle of a
Wimbledon year - if it is Nigel Williams's SWl9.
Scenes from a Poisoner's Life, Williams's most recent fictional foray into
this London suburb, is a sequence of 12 tales, each offering a sting in the
tail. They provide an amusing way of getting to know the family Farr and its
patriarch Henry, the fat middle-aged solicitor who tried to poison his wife
in Williams's The Wimbledon Poisoner.
The underlying humour of is pointed up by the jokes. Like champagne bubbles,
the one-liners constantly force their way to the surface. Farr's marriage is
described as having survived 'like Kurt Vonnegut in Dresden, by bizarre
accident', while later his wife, contemplating adultery, thinks of her
husband as a man who makes 'Monsieur Bovary look like Paul Newman . . '
William's Wimbledon is a unique, rich, multi-textured if on occasion
somewhat bizarre society.
Even peripheral characters are deftly painted in: there is
Ella-I-was-at-RADA Makepiece, while another neighbour is characterised as
'Is the Mitsubishi Scratched Yet?'. In a few words Williams can summon up
the preoccupations and pathos of a life sentence in the suburbs. He is
hilarious when parodying the 'hey nonny no' pretensions of Doublet and Hose,
the Wimbledon Early Music Group, and disturbing when tackling the racism of
affluent Middle England.
If at times things get a little uncomfortable, Williams does at least temper
the grotesque with a tender appraisal of the misery of the human condition.
For example, when Farr is faced with overwhelming platonic love for a girl
in the newsagent, 'All love did for him was to remind him of the poverty of
his vocabulary.' Home-as-castle feelings are poignantly expressed when Farr
and his daughter return to 'the double fronted house where all their
feelings and opinions could be comfortably hidden from the outside world.'
Farr asserts his existence: 'I'm just an average guy, with slightly
lower-than-average feelings. But I am here. And I won't go away.'
The appeal of uncomplicated domesticity is not lost on Daniel, Cambridge
dropout and protagonist of Simon Corrigan's Sweets from Strangers. He flees
an unsavoury past in Paris to live quietly with his sister and her family in
Oxfordshire, until his previous life catches up with him. It is perhaps
unfair to compare two such different books, but while Scenes From a
Poisoner's Life seems confident and assured, Sweets From Strangers appears
disjointed and hesitant. The latter offers some clever psychological
insights, but it is difficult to get a real feeling for the characters and
their world.
The balming effect of Daniel's flight into the cosy banality of his sister's
household and a job washing up in a local hotel is neatly summed up 'as akin
to the grateful compliance of a rehabilitating addict, relieved to swap one
dependence for another, even if that second consists of no more than the
tending of the hospital garden.'
Corrigan's writing, however, livens up when it comes to describing Luc, the
decadent, charismatic homosexual who reappears in Daniel's new life; and
there is a sense of relief when the inevitable happens and Daniel returns to
France and, by implication, a life of pampered depravity.

THE PRIVATE LIFE OF CHAIRMAN MAO: THE INSIDE STORY OF
THE MAN WHO MADE MODERN CHINA
by Zhisui Li

Pounds 20, 682 pages
CHINA WAKES: THE STRUGGLE FOR THE SOUL OF A RISING POWER
by Nicholas D. Kristoff and Sheryl W. Dunn
Nicholas Brealey
Pounds 16.99, 502 pages
Grub Street hacks prying into the affairs of the royal family painted a
pretty idyllic picture of their lives until recent years. That they got
things so wrong within a democracy provides some indirect excuse for the
China watchers who for so long failed to penetrate the labyrinthine secrets
of China's palace politics. A full portrait, warts and all, of China's
Chairman Mao Zedong is only now emerging, almost two decades after his death
behind the high walls of Peking's Zhongnanhai compound in the Forbidden
City.
While he was alive, Mao's hagiographers dominated the field, partly because
so many wanted him to succeed. Cynical observers laboured away, piecing
together clues to Mao's towering failures from official propaganda. Today's
China watchers have an easier time of it, as evidenced by China Wakes, the
latest in a series of book-memoirs by American correspondents who have done
a stint in Peking. But although energetic and questioning, this
husband-and-wife team are still foreign devil reporters peering through
cracks in the wall, with the grace to admit that 'China Watching is the only
profession that makes meteorology look accurate and precise.'
But we need no longer rely on the China watchers. Zhisui Li, Mao's personal
physician for 22 years, takes us inside the walls of Zhongnanhai and into
the Chairman's personal swimming pool pavilion. There he lies on his huge
bed, sweating after one of his innumerable sessions with a willing female
attendant (preferably a peasant girl) and a run-down with hot towels (he
refused to bathe - 'I wash myself in the bodies of my women,' he said),
brushing aside traditional Chinese remedies for his latest ailment but
washing out his green, plaque-covered teeth in tea and then chewing up the
leaves, swallowing too many sleeping pills and then turning to a novel about
intrigue at the court of the Mings.
But this absorbing book provides much more than tittle-tattle. Dr Li was a
confidant, at Mao's elbow as the Great Helmsman voiced neurotic suspicions
of plots against him and twisted Marxist vocabulary to destroy those who
hinted that he bore some responsibility for disasters. He watched as Mao
slowly undercut the power of his imagined rivals, manipulated those who
surrounded him by monstrous demands on their loyalty, blackmail and fear.
The book's most convincing feature (raising it above Harrison Salisbury's
recent anti-Mao broadside The New Emperors: Mao and Deng, which largely
depended on Dengist sources anxious to distance the present strongman from
his predecessor) is Dr Li's refusal to pretend greater access than he had.
He scrupulously differentiates between what he saw and heard, what he
learned later and what he surmised.
'Il n'y a point de heros pour mon valet de chambre' may have been true in
the 18th century but today no man is a hero to his doctor (even Churchill
had his Lord Moran). Nevertheless, Dr Li progresses very gradually from the
young would-be surgeon who hero-worshipped Mao to the doctor who felt
nothing but relief when he died. He expresses disgust at his morals,
distaste for some of his personal habits and shock at his superstition and
ignorance about science but leaves the reader to deduce Mao's massive
stupidity in claiming that 'spirit' would accomplish his hopelessly
unrealistic economic goals, in ordaining the commune (and thus a great
famine), in wasting untold resources in millions of useless backyard
furnaces, in loosing anarchy on China and in choosing first a traitor and
then a nonentity (Lin Biao and Hua Guofeng) as his successors.
Mao, like Churchill, was a brilliantly charismatic war leader but, in the
piping time of peace, became an isolated monomaniac, feeding his paranoia
with old tales of intrigue, scrawling comments on endless streams of state
papers, asking 'Any news?' from all visitors, insulated by his scheming
courtiers from the outside world, like the most ruthless Emperors he
emulated. Only action could cure his depressions and his obsessive need to
make decisions - any decision - lay at the root of his most tragic mistakes.
Mao was the Monkey King who sowed chaos (luan) in heaven, the antithesis of
the neo-Confucianist leader which the region's dictators of today tell us is
the Asian ideal.
Jung Chang's magnificent Wild Swans rendered her and her parents into
paradigms of the betrayal of Chinese idealists' worship of the revolutionary
who enabled China to 'stand up'. Dr Li shows us the other side of the walls
which surrounded the man who inspired such hopes only to sacrifice them on
the altar of his own ego. Dr Li, sitting in exile in Chicago today,
contemplating his dead, heart-broken wife and his own wasted life, is just
another of China's millions of wild swans.

REMEMBERING MY GOOD FRIENDS: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY
by George Weidenfeld
HarperCollins
Pounds 20, 483 pages
Lord Weidenfeld, the publisher, has written an autobiography called
Remembering My Good Friends of whom he seems to have so many that the book
can be read as an exercise in name-dropping. It is perhaps fortunate that he
does not drink alcohol; otherwise he might have treated a list of French
wines in much the same gushing way.
It might be said of him - indeed Weidenfeld suggests it several times in the
course of these memoirs - that he was the great innovative publisher of the
post-1945 period. More critical readers might recall, however, that the list
of authors is more impressive than the books produced or the evidence of
them having been much edited.
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson is not alone in this, but the firm was the pioneer of
bulk memoirs, often too hastily written, too long, and insufficiently
checked. That led in turn to partial serialisation, which frequently gives a
wholly misleading impression of the book. The temptation to write them and
publish them has not diminished with time and Weidenfeld has himself
succumbed.
It should be an interesting story. Weidenfeld was a well-educated refugee
from Austria who made his way up in England first through the wartime
service of the BBC, then through publishing. It was an imperial world he
left behind, and at least an aristocratic world to which he looked forward.
Weidenfeld writes that his family had taught him that Vienna was the centre
of the universe, so much so that nobody bothered to teach him English.
In Britain he saw his challenge as being how to turn his condition of being
'with the English but not of the English into an advantage'. The old
background served him well. The chapter 'English Life: the Learning Process'
is devoted almost entirely to a study of the English upper classes:
aristocrats mingling with writers and the odd politician.
In a later chapter, 'Manhattan Mosaic', there is a similar approach to life
in New York: so-and-so, the younger son of a publishing family 'was adopted
and rumoured to be the illegitimate child of a member of the British royal
family.' The taste for the well-born extends even to Israel where Weidenfeld
dwells on the charms of the old Zionist aristocracy. In London he delighted
in being introduced to what he calls the 'British haute Juiverie'.
Israel forms the most serious parts of the book. Weidenfeld has no qualms
(nor should he) about the support he has given the Zionist cause over the
years. And yet there must be a question of balance, especially in a country
that is neither Jewish nor Arab and also a permanent member of the UN
Security Council. Here Weidenfeld writes in slogans, dismissing the British
Foreign Office - which he says that otherwise he admires and should be given
more money for entertainment - as having sold out to the Arabs from the
start, and accusing George Brown of becoming an 'Arabist' after helping to
push through UN Resolution 242 on the Middle East.
As even Weidenfeld admits, it was that Resolution which led to subsequent
dialogue. A little more humility towards the Arabs and occasional criticism
of Israeli intransigence might be in order.
These matters are subjective, but some readers might find errors in taste.
For example, the wife of an English MP whom Weidenfeld hoped to marry, but
who went off with somebody else, is described simply as 'an anglicized
blonde of Austrian-Jewish origin'. Readers might not take kindly either to
sentences like 'Shimi Lovat was known as the handsomest man in Britain'.
They might have some sympathy with Evelyn Waugh, who thought that Weidenfeld
and his set were pretentious and pushy.
There are also some errors of fact. The aspiring French diplomat and future
foreign minister who gave Weidenfeld helpful advice in Vienna was Jean
Sauvagnargues, not a 'Monsieur Savarnargue' as Weidenfeld calls him. The
name of the German central bank before the war was the Reichsbank, not the
Reichbank. The first name of Chancellor Brandt was Willy, not Willi.
Those may seem quibbles, though one would have thought that a seasoned
publisher would have had someone check the proofs. They are as nothing
compared to the story of Hugh Dalton and the economics writer, Nicholas
Davenport. 'Had Dalton been made chancellor of the exchequer, as he nearly
was,' Weidenfeld claims, 'Nicholas might well have become governor of the
Bank of England.' That seems unlikely, especially when one remembers that
Dalton actually was chancellor of the exchequer from 1945-1947, the very
years in question.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Books: Wife-beaters and worse - Thrillers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER HIRST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 59 bus route between Knightsbridge and Hackney provides the locations
for Frances Fyfleld's latest, excellent outing for frazzled lawyer Helen
West and her on-and-off boyfriend, blase detective Geoffrey Bailey. Despite
its summer setting, A Clear Conscience (Bantam Pounds 14.99) is a murky
tale, darkening from wife-beating to murder and incest.
Helen's shambolic flat is transformed by Cathy, an assiduous cleaning lady
recommended by the wife of a legal colleague. But Cathy is one of life's
victims and it seems inevitable that, like her brother, she will came to an
untimely and violent end.
Told in an elliptical style, dipping in and out of the character's minds,
this bleak narrative is lightened by flashes of humour - in particular
Helen's acidulous musings - together with superb characterisation and
pin-sharp detail. Its seedy terrain exudes a whiff of Greeneland. Though far
from being a conventional whodunit, few readers will foresee the double
twist at the finale.
A wife-beater also takes a central role in The Daughters of Cain (Macmillan
Pounds 14.99), the latest Inspector Morse mystery from Colin Dexter. This
villain is a child-abuser and drug-dealer into the bargain but as far as the
author is concerned his worst sin appears to be misuse of the English
language ('Where the 'ell a' you bin, woman?'). It hardly needs adding that
he ends up being dredged from the Thames.
Snobbish, sniffily didactic and pedantic, the Morse books are an accurate
reflection of the more complacent aspects of the city where they are set.
Yet despite the Latin tags and ostentatious parading of erudition, the
probings of Morse and his long-suffering side-kick Lewis provide
irresistible page-turning entertainment. The golden Oxonian backdrop is a
major advantage, as is, of course, the ineradicable image of the TV version
of the duo.
Mellowing as retirement looms, Britain's best-loved cop once again tackles
gory doings in the groves of academe. There is the customary mild flirtation
 -this time an improbable liaison with a prostitute. Dexter handles the
serpentine plot with exemplary clarity until the final chapters, where he
gets bogged down with some protracted and tenuous business concerning a
knife stolen from the Pitt-Rivers Museum.
In Political Death (Heinemann Pounds 12.99), Antonia Fraser comes up with
another souffle-light serving of her svelte sleuth Jemima Shore. A batty
grande dame entrusts her with a scandal-packed diary before apparently
committing suicide. The subsequent investigation takes the glamorous gumshoe
through the not-so-mean streets of Westminster and Kensington as she tangles
with a couple of high-powered dynasties involved in theatre and politics.
It is home turf for the author, but the huge cast is somewhat confusing. The
yarn hots up following the discovery of a second corpse and a literal
skeleton in the cupboard. Though distracted by a spat of steamy sex, Jemima
sorts things out with her customary stylish aplomb.
Dixie City Jam (Orion Pounds 15.99) by James Lee Burke is the seventh
mystery featuring Dave Robicheaux, New Orleans police detective (not that he
seems to spend much time at work). Goodness knows what happened in the
previous six episodes because this 367-page tome contains enough action,
usually of extreme violence, for a whole library of thrillers.
Central to this grisly epic are the efforts of a neo-Nazi psychopath to find
the whereabouts of a sunken German submarine discovered by Robicheaux years
ago. The author tops up the pot with hefty quantities of drug-dealing,
police corruption and racial tension. Though the narrative occasionally
splutters, the Delta dialogue is piquant as pepper sauce.
Marele Day makes the most of a Chinatown location in The Case of the Chinese
Boxes (Hodder Pounds 16.99), a second adventure for Sydney-based Claudia
Valentine. Latest in a wave of feisty female 'tecs, she is called in by
restaurant boss Victoria Chen to recover an ornate golden key which will
unlock an ancient box containing a relic - a finger - of the Buddha. Though
the key is nothing more than a colourful McGuffin - it is never found and
the box is never opened - the yarn maintains a zippy pace against an exotic
background of Triad war and oriental mysteries.

reviews a novelty handbook for disaffected youth

THE OFFICIAL SLACKER HANDBOOK
by Sarah Dunn
Abacus
Pounds 6.99, 116 pages
Once we had the Anarchist's Handbook: now this jokey apathist's handbook
sees the genre of novelty publishing hit new levels of disposability. Sarah
Dunn's book will be given as a Christmas present by unimaginative friends
and confined to the downstairs toilet before fetching up at the charity
shop.
Although more care and intelligence has been lavished on this loafer's guide
than is usual for a humorous book, its subject matter ensures a short
(bathroom) shelf-life.
Americans invented slacking as a handy term for a lifestyle with no life or
style, coralling the perennial traits of disaffected youth into a convenient
1990s phenomenon. Intellectual pretension and terminal laziness; a belief in
conspiracy theories, unrealised artistic potential and in sponging off
parents; bad clothes and bad haircuts. These predate the temporary label of
'slacking' - I remember them all embarrassingly well - and will outlive it.
Slacking is a glitch in the sociology of youth culture, and Dunn's book
slouches onto a bandwagon that began with Richard Linklater's film Slacker
and is already grinding to a halt.
To correspond with its subject matter, the Handbook (presumably rendered
'Official' by an endorsement from Linklater) is
thematically and graphically all over the place, styled with a deliberate
cut-and-paste sloppiness. Dunn is at her best when studying the supposed
historical basis for full-fledged slacking, co-opting Socrates, Hamlet,
Buddha and Jesus as prototypes in the pantheon of goofing off.
Second best is slacker
style, with its tips on
attaining functionally
insane hair ('submit to angry drunken girlfriends armed with prinking
shears') and
the history of the goatee beard.
Thereafter, Dunn's occasional flashes of incisive humour are swamped by too
many multiple-choice quizzes and flow charts on slack sex and slacker jobs.
The chapters on intellectual posturing are dull, although the conspiracy
theories are fun. The promised chapter on how to make hallucinogenic drugs
from household chemicals proves to be a fib, by the way.
Dunn has a witty command of contemporary phraseology, but her book is
unworthy of it. Like 'Generation', and 'The Blank Generation', 'Slacking'
will soon be confined to the scrapheap of labels pressed into service to
classify the seemingly unclassifiable post-1980s, late-20s, dissolute youth
culture.
The strain of The Official Slacker Handbook's false premise shows. The most
delicious irony, of course, is that no serious slacker wannabe would ever
find the time to read it.

TALES OF THE NEW BABYLON
by Rupert Christiansen
Sinclair-Stevenson
Pounds 20, 416 pages
PARIS INTERZONE
by James Campbell
Secker and Warburg
Pounds 20, 305 pages
One of Proust's characters reports that he was made to play in the Champs
Elysees as a child, and hated it. 'If only I had first read about it in a
book]' he in effect says, thus claiming that to know and appreciate Paris
best, one has to approach it through literature and history. For Paris is,
more than any other city, a place of imagination; it comes most vividly
awake to those who know the stories told by almost every one of its stones.
These two books tell such stories. They perform similar tasks on different
epochs and aspects of Parisian history: Rupert Christiansen displays six
tumultuous, crowded and disastrous years at the end of the Second Empire,
1869 to 1875, while James Campbell portrays 14 recent years of expatriate
literary life in Paris, 1946 to 1960. It is the same Paris in each case,
serving not merely as a decorative backdrop to the action, but as the
theatre where the events described were alone made possible. In each case
the tight time-scale and richness of detail makes for utterly absorbing
reading.
Christiansen's subject is the catastrophic end of Napoleon III's great
imperial dream. There is something half-touching about the liberal-minded
but vacillating Emperor at last beginning to institute long-promised
reforms, only to make the terrible mistake of going to war against Prussia
and suffering swift defeat and therefore his throne. Prussia's army besieged
Paris, forcing surrender; the Parisians' sufferings helped demolish the last
traces of civil order, resulting in the Commune of Paris and its bloody
suppression by the forces of France's newly-born Second Republic.
Napoleon III's Paris was a site of self-conscious Renaissance. Baron
Haussmann flattened large tracts of the old city and constructed great
boulevards and sumptuous buildings, resulting - depending upon your taste -
in 'mail-order grandeur' or a boldly handsome imperial capital. Napoleon III
would have liked literature and the arts to be likewise monumental, but the
sheer ebullience of Parisian life, not to mention its grimness, would not
oblige. This was the era of the Goncourt brothers, of Flaubert and Zola, of
the can-can and syphilis. Mix in the explosions of war and revolution, and
the account Christiansen brilliantly gives is of Paris as a tangle of
exposed nerves thrilling mercilessly in icy gales of change.
Paris became fashionable as a resort for American writers as early as the
Naughty Nineties, but their heyday was the 1920s, when Gertrude Stein,
Ernest Hemingway and Henry Miller, among many others, lived there. Hemingway
wrote most of The Sun Also Rises in a Montparnasse cafe and met F. Scott
Fitzgerald for the first time in the Dingo bar around the corner.
After 1945 aspiring writers from America and Britain made their way to Paris
partly as an act of pilgrimage, but mainly in emulation of these resounding
forebears. As Campbell shows, it was not always a case of lesser mortals
aping the great; for some, like the black writers Richard Wright, James
Baldwin and Chester Himes, it was a way of breaking free from racial
intolerance at home. For others, among them Vladimir Nabokov with Lolita and
William Burroughs with The Naked Lunch, it was the only place they could get
published. And for them all, it was the only civilised city where their
sexualities, of whatever persuasion, could be acknowledged.
Campbell recounts their Paris years marvellously. In the aftermath of war
they felt an urgent need to experiment. Paris was alive with ideas and
literature; Jean-Paul Sartre held court at the Cafe de Flore, and Jean Genet
was about to explode on the world. Expatriate writers founded magazines,
among them Merlin and the Paris Review. One of the chief triumphs of the
former was its rescue of Samuel Beckett from obscurity; but its editors
survived chiefly by writing pseudonymous pornography for the Olympia Press.
Americans were not safe from McCarthyism even in Paris. They were visited by
inquisitors testing for 'loyalty'. Some of those putatively writing novels
in cafe corners were CIA agents; fingers are pointed that way concerning the
mysterious death in 1960 of Richard Wright, author of the controversial
novel Native Son. He had once been a communist, and was permitted to leave
the US for Paris in 1948 only through the combined efforts of Gertrude Stein
and Sartre. After his hasty cremation rumours flew, adding to the already
foetid atmosphere of expatriate literary life in Paris.
Both books are net contributors to our understanding and enjoyment of Paris.
Proust's character would hugely approve.

THE MISSING OF THE SOMME
by Geoff Dyer
Hamish Hamilton
Pounds 15.99, 157 pages
The survivors are a tiny and a quickly dwindling band: even those who lied
about their age will now be tilting a century. Their experiences were
terrible, but the years have not failed to trump one horror with others. No
popular day of remembrance is demanded for Hiroshima, nor even for the
Holocaust. And although the church services and poppy campaigns extend their
appeals on the basis of the universal soldier, yet there is no doubt where
the focus of our pieties is trained: upon that war which we stubbornly
designate as 'the Great'.
Today marks the 89th anniversary of the end of the Battle of the Somme, the
bloodiest battle in world history, with more than a million casualties and,
in the wake of the annual rituals of Armistice observance, many - among the
young, at least - might ask themselves: why does this 'Great War' haunt us
still?
A new book and a new museum supply the answer. Geoff Dyer's The Missing of
the Somme is a curious book. It wants partly to be an extended scholarly
essay on the process of remembrance, partly a rather rollicking account of a
joint lads' outing to the Flanders battlefield sites, and partly a critique
of Great War literature (including modern successes such as Sebastian
Faulks' Birdsong). The author is not famous for his patriotic zeal. In fact,
he begins with an exercise in debunking - pointing out how Scott's fatal
expedition to the South Pole in 1910-12 was the project of an incompetent
and irresponsible amateur, and how the British are so ridiculously clever at
celebrating their military disasters (eg the Charge of the Light Brigade).
Elsewhere, he is censorious about the nationalistic sentiments recorded by
other visitors to the Flanders cemeteries, and like most modern young men
his appetite for militarism is weak.
His own connection with the war is perhaps average: a grandfather, drafted
from farm labour in the shires to tend horses behind the lines - but
thankfully, no need to join the hunt for names on a headstone. The text is
illustrated by some not very distinguished monotone shots of memorials in
both France and at home. On the face of it, Dyer's little book does not look
a promising work of enlightenment.
And yet The Missing of the Somme is a genuinely important means of
understanding our own relationship with the Great War. What Dyer has done is
articulate some very peculiar sentiments. Why should those so distant from
that war feel so touched and absorbed by its topography, images and
literature? Can it possibly - and perversely - be some sort of envy?
Undoubtedly there was a little patch of Europe which became a muddied
microcosm, and those within its limits felt a world apart: on either side,
feeling hardly any hatred towards each other, and reserving for themselves
the special bonds of slang, satire and pure solicitude. It seems
retrospectively that it was a mysticism of suffering that happened here, and
an emotional commonwealth from which one can still feel slightly excluded.
So gazing over a cemetery such as Railway Hollow, 'the Accrington Pals'
Valhalla' in the Somme, one stops short of describing this as futility. And
so even beneath the crazy six-figure statistics of daily casualties at the
Somme, one's attention is arrested by anecdotes: of Captain Nevill, who led
his platoon over the top by booting a football into No Man's Land and
challenging his men to be first to dribble it into a German trench. The ball
came back, but not Captain Nevill.
Whilst no one would ever want to actually join that deadly game, one can
nevertheless harbour something akin to admiration for those old
blood-brotherhoods - and understand why, when they had the opportunity to
sit out the war in convalescence, some soldiers (like Wilfred Owen) actually
chose to return. Dyer understands all this, and is accordingly more cheered
by the cemeteries than dismayed: for in the phrase of Camus, feelingly
quoted by Dyer at Beaumont-Hamel, 'there are more things to admire in men
than to despise'.
Edmund Blunden, marching down to the Somme in August 1916, recalled halcyon
days, passing 'through wooded uplands, under arcades of elms, past
millstreams and red and white farms . . . billets in clay-walled barns, and
'Cafe, monsieur' at any moment'. To meet up with shattered battalions in a
treeless mire of rain and rotting corpses was like the end of an age of
innocence, the fading of the pastoral mode; and Geoff Dyer's meditations
include, necessarily, the register (felt by many) that the 1914-18, in a
century of change, marked the greatest of changes.
Life, at least in Britain, forfeited certain provincial, rustic rhythms that
were irretrievable; and from the war seeped an elegaic tincture which we
would never lose. Both the dross of jingoism and the buttress of optimism
vanished: and not even the Battle of Britain would restore the old imperial
confidence.
'I don't think these shell-shocked war poems will move our grandchildren
greatly'. Sir Henry Newbolt, writing in 1924, got it badly wrong. Wilfred
Owen, Isaac Rosenberg and other Great War poets are now part of the school
curriculum, and fixed in the repertoire of English classics. That their work
created a poetics of scepticism about poetry's traditional beauty has had an
incalculable effect not only on modern literary consciousness, but also upon
the patriotic postures of us all. 'The old lie' that it is noble to die for
one's queen and country may still circulate in one or two high (or low)
places; but we know that it is the sort of nationalism which, if indulged,
would lead to the Balkanisation of all Europe. History is no longer on its
side.
Proof of that, if it were needed, comes from a new museum: the Historial de
la Grande Guerre, established at Peronne, in the centre of the Somme region,
by the local Conseil General. It is a much overdue enterprise: for although
the cemeteries of Flanders are kept immaculately, almost unnervingly
pristine, museums in the area have tended to be shabby and ad-hoc: as Geoff
Dyer says of one of them (Hill 60, near Ypres), 'it is as if Steptoe and Son
have opened up their own branch of the Imperial War Museum'.
The Historial at Peronne, by contrast, exudes professional touches at every
point: well-located (near the old chateau), landscaped and custom-designed
by Henri Ciriani, and impressively resourced, it describes itself as a
'musee des mentalities', offering 'a historiography of humanity at war'.
That is, it maintains a running comparison between the front line and
conditions at home; and not only is it studiously neutral in its trilingual
presentation of this material, but the wider involvement of colonial forces
is fully reflected (thus Canadians, Australians, New Zealanders, South
Africans, Indians, Egyptians and Chinese).
Though Peronne itself was under German occupation for most of the war, all
around are the visitable battlefields: Longueval, Martinpuich, Thiepval and
others. They have become part of an itinerary, like vineyards of the Cote
d'Or; except here graves supplant the well-tended vines, and ploughed-up
shrapnel fills the farmers' crates.
In the museum itself, the feeling that trench warfare belongs to prehistory
is heightened here by the fact that film footage is constantly whirring
away, yet none of it is truly documentary. Film crews were banned from the
Front: the films that survive are all staged actions. By contrast to the
surreal coverage of the Gulf War, or the absurd virtual reality of the
'invasion' of Haiti - Marines landing before a barrage of lenses - this was,
then, not only a Great War, but a Real War. And however much we might admit
to heroising those who took part in it, the lesson of the Historial is not
so much that 'this must never happen again', but simply: 'this will never
happen again'. As such, the Historial securely distances its visitors from
the war it preserves for them. It reinforces Francis Fukuyama's hypothesis
that history, understood as a chronicle of battles and national
aggrandisement, no longer happens; and, less momentously, the Historial
teaches Europe that the past dissonance of sovereignty is a wound which
should assist, not impede, a federal continent.
The Historial de la Grande Guerre is open throughout the year, at Place du
Chateau, 80200 Peronne. Tel. 22.83.14.18.

It strikes me as odd that a bride should take a pair of scissors and cut up
her dress at her wedding reception. Could it be that this is the essential
difference between a French and a British wedding?
But there are other distinctions to be considered. I was at the marriage of
a young Parisian couple in Tregrom, a village in Brittany's Cotes d'Armor.
Formality was shunned. They were married by a farmer, the groom doubled up
as a car park attendant, there were no boring speeches and no wedding cake.
'Le mariage' is a non-secular affair across France, signed and sealed in 10
minutes at the town hall. In Tregrom, the mayor is a farmer so it was his
job to rubber- stamp this occasion.
But Tregrom's chunky grey stone 15th century church did have a role to play
 -if only to provide a fine photo opportunity for camera-laden guests.
The bride, a literature student at the Sorbonne, her stylish white
halter-neck bodice and flouncy, full-length layered dress still intact,
wandered down the aisle unannounced while her husband, an engineer, finished
a cigarette outside.
Just before the blessing the priest signalled to those with cameras to step
up to the altar so that they might get a better view. I looked round the
church: the 100-strong congregation wore mostly casual dress. Some wore
colourful suits, but there were few hats and no tails.
A Breton pipe band, called the Sons of Plouaret - a trio of chubby
pensioners from a nearby town with ruddy, smiling faces - led the procession
from the church playing.
The next time I saw the groom he was standing in a wet field. We had been
part of a convoy of cars which had weaved its way through tiny country lanes
to the reception. In keeping with French tradition we tooted our horns at
anything that moved: an oncoming tractor, nonchalant farmers, hyperactive
sheep dogs and grazing cows.
The convoy halted sharply. We had arrived. It was chaos. Too many cars and
not enough field. And there was the groom, arms waving, directing cars into
hedgerows.
Meanwhile, an apparently unperturbed chef was sitting in a pit roasting a
pig on a spit.
We were in a romantic valley at a large converted 15th century mill house,
owned by the bridegroom's family. The river Leguer flows through forest
turning a huge, wooden water wheel.
Another English guest asked me: 'Do you think this is going to be like one
of those French films where you find clandestine couples in every corner?'
I could find no evidence of free love but plenty of free champagne. Enough
to occupy 200 guests for two hours. But something was definitely going on in
the mushroom house. A psychedelic orgy? No, it was the venue for a sumptuous
five-course feast.
This vast construction had been converted in to an ornate dining hall with a
dance floor and bar at one end. Even the concrete floor was decorated -
hand-painted by the bridegroom's youngest sister.
The happy couple sat with friends - elder family members were relegated to
other tables. We ate ham, chicken pate, salad with prawns, rice and salmon,
the roasted pork, camembert and chevre, chocolate gateaux and redcurrant and
blackcurrant mousse. It was drunk with copious quantities of Muscadet and
Chateau Larcharas.
Whenever anyone felt like it, they jumped to their feet and burst into song.
Most were rowdy, old school numbers I could not translate.
After the bridegroom had performed a tangled ceremony with several guests
which involved drinking numerous glasses of red wine then wiping his mouth
on their sleeves, the bride stood up and declared: 'Le marie est propre]'
This is a soul-cleansing exercise and not just an excuse to get inebriated.
The bride turned to me adding: 'Il boit comme un trou]' (he drinks like a
hole).
I will not forget the scene at 5am. The bride was dancing freely in her
adulterated wedding dress, cut to above the knee. A cluster of inebriated
men were bobbing around with the remains of her skirt draped over their
heads.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Travel: Conversations with a very Canadian dog - Nicholas
Woodsworth takes a philosophical canoe journey down the Gatineau river
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is autumn, perhaps the most beautiful time of year in Canada, and I am
trying to enjoy the lovely autumn weather in peace. But my temporary guide
and companion, Jenny, is determined to give me a cultural as well as scenic
tour of the area. Once she gets an idea in her head she does tend to rattle
on.
'The Canadian character', she is saying, 'has over the years become a sort
of jokey cliche even among Canadians themselves.' I sit back, as much as one
can sit back in a canoe, and wait for the rest. On the foibles of human
character Jenny is outspoken.
'Our souls are preoccupied with an endless search for something called 'the
Canadian identity'. Domestically, we tie ourselves into knots with political
quibbling of the most literal sort; never mind if something is going to work
or not - 'is it constitutional?' we want to know. And when we want to make
our mark globally, we join some hopeless, doomed UN humanitarian effort. We
are well-intentioned and civic-minded. We are pleasant and wholesome. We are
dull. Do we make the most of this country? No, we do not.'
Now, I cannot be sure that Jenny is really saying these things, because
Jenny is a dog. A golden retriever, to be precise. However intelligent and
communicative retrievers are, no one could be blamed for having doubts about
a dog's ability to pass judgment on national developments. Besides, Jenny is
12 years old and, I fear, getting a bit beyond it - she has arthritis in her
legs, for which she takes an aspirin every day. Goodness knows how sound her
ideas might be.
But try it yourself, and you will see. Sit alone with a dog in a canoe on a
river in the Canadian wilderness for a few days, surrounded only by sighing
boughs and whispering bullrushes. After a while you cannot be sure what you
are really hearing and what you are merely imagining.
However fanciful Jenny's notions of Canada may be, she is certainly more
aware of what is going on here than I. Although I am nominally Canadian, I
have been away so many years I have almost forgotten what this vast northern
country is all about. Now, on a short visit back to my parent's home on the
Gatineau River, I am trying to pick up the traces.
Jenny, on the other hand, knows the country well - she spends her summers
cavorting about the water chasing ducks and playing dangerous games with
porcupines, her winters lolloping down snowy trails on the river's frozen
surface.
So every morning now I walk down to the woodshed where Jenny sits watching
my father stack cords of birch and maple for the coming winter, and I borrow
her. She may be old, but those cocked ears, that eyebrow semaphore, that
twitching and investigative nose reveal Jenny as an acute and experienced
observer of the local scene. What source, human or animal, could better
inform my slow-drifting, paddle-dripping musings on what it is to be
Canadian?
'I doubt the Parti Quebecois could win an independence referendum next
year', Jenny opines during a quiet moment as we sit immobile in the reeds
one afternoon, watching dragonflies make aircraft-carrier landings on a
floating log. 'But frankly', she adds darkly, 'I am afraid there are other
ways of forcing the issue.'
Where does an outdoor dog like Jenny, at home in the great wilderness
spaces, get hold of her ideas, you might be asking. The extraordinary thing
about the Gatineau River, wild and unspoiled as it is, is that it sits just
15 minutes drive from Ottawa - capital of the country and nerve-centre of
its national debates and gossip.
Jenny does not even have to wander from the Gatineau hills down to the House
of Commons cafeteria to pick up the most recent gossip on the greatest
Canadian debate of all - the long-running and now fast-growing argument over
French Canada's place in the nation. Nor is speculation about Quebec's
secession from Canada - a move promised by the province's party in power,
the Parti Quebecois - far from her inquiring ear.
For the Gatineau, itself just inside the Quebec provincial border, is the
preferred home of senior Ottawa civil servants, government speech writers,
party spin-doctors, parliamentary journalists and electronic media types.
Each evening they retreat from the city to well-appointed cottages, cabins
and country homes scattered in the woods along the river banks, not far from
the hurly-burly but far enough that racoons still make a mess of the
garbage.
All Jenny has to do is wander about on a Saturday morning back-door-begging
from deputy ministers' wives. Along with the tit-bits she receives - she
likes a nice piece of bacon - she is also likely to pick up some juicy
political fat to chew on.
Jenny, though, has fundamentally different views from most of Canada's
politicians. 'What a pathetic lot they are', she whines as one day we paddle
off the broad Gatineau and up Blackburn's Creek. It is a sinuous, swampy,
forest-lined waterway, home to beavers, loons, muskrats and other Canadian
things, and just the sort of place Jenny loves.
'Take a look around]' she launches in. 'Here we are, a G-7 nation, one of
the most industrialised and prosperous countries in the world, and we're
still fortunate enough to have all this. Name me one country in the world
where unspoiled nature sits on the capital city's doorstep?' Jenny is
beginning to get over-excited, although the sight of a flock of merganser
ducks feeding not far away may have something to do with it.
'Can Canadian politicians possibly have their eyes open?' Her big pink
tongue lolls with agitation. 'Do they travel? Do they read? Do they ever
switch over from 'Hockey Night in Canada' to the CBC news? Do they have any
idea of how difficult, dirty, strife-torn, poverty-ridden, over-crowded,
under-privileged, race-divided, environmentally-ravaged and generally
miserable life can be elsewhere on the planet?
Jenny pants, out of breath. 'I doubt it.' She pauses to lean over the gunnel
and lap a bit of creek water, then starts in again.
'If they did, they would be out here enjoying what Canada has to offer
instead of threatening to tear the country apart. Do you realise you could
put France, the largest nation in western Europe, three times into the
province of Quebec alone? Dogs and cats aside, there are just 28m
inhabitants in the second-largest country in the world] There is more clean
water, more resources, more space than most people could imagine. Yet
Canadians, French and English, are going at each other more blindly than any
dogs and cats. Behind the mild-mannered image are some very spoiled, selfish
and stubborn people. If Canadians aren't careful, they are going to lose
everything.'
Well, after that tongue-lashing we both shut up for a while and simply drift
down the river. We feel somewhat ashamed, she for her outburst, I for our
national failings.
Instead we gaze at the weathered, pinky pre-Cambrian granite that fronts the
water; at brilliant blue kingfishers dropping like stones after unsuspecting
fish; at autumn trees along the banks, bursts of red, yellow, vermilion
flame; at the V made by a beaver as it swims through quiet water; at another
V, high in the sky, of geese heading south. And after a while, lulled and
soothed by these things, we feel better.
'You know', sighs Jenny, 'the Group of Seven - the closest thing Canada ever
had to a post-impressionist painting school - believed a sense of national
unity could be fostered by a sense of the land. So they painted magnificent
landscapes of all the things we enjoy looking at. Very rugged and wild, very
Canadian their tableaux were.
'I know what you mean, Jenny', I say, only half listening. I am thinking
about the sharp nip I can feel in the air, and imagining the fierce Canadian
winter that is not far away now.
'As far as I am concerned, it is the climate, not cultural differences, that
is the country's biggest drawback.
'Six months of snow and six months of hard sledding', I tease Jenny as I
turn the canoe around and begin the long paddle home.
'There's nothing to it', she growls, settling down for a snooze with her
nose under her tail. 'Just wear a warm coat, like I do.'

FT  19 NOV 94 / Sport: Backs to the future - Rugby / Last line of defence or
key man in attack? Derek Wyatt looks at number 15s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This afternoon at Murrayfield, the old fullback meets the new. The old is
Gavin Hastings, who seems to have been playing for ever. In the past two
years he has lost a yard or two of pace and has become a defensive fullback
still trying hard to play an attacking game.
Hastings will summon all his strength to stop yet another Scottish defeat.
He will try and orchestrate moves that centre on him. He believes he should
lead by example. Hastings, when isolated, kicks the ball in the air in the
forlorn hope that something will come of it.
The new is South African full back Andre Joubert who, by sharp contrast, is
at the top of his form. That makes him the best fullback in the world. He is
a challenging player, versatile, arrogant, pacy, with a basketball player's
handling abilities. He also has that rare instinct for try-scoring.
Opponents have not yet exploited his left-footed kicking or his head-on
tackling. On this tour his confidence has developed so much that it is
difficult to see anyone taking his place.
In the northern hemisphere, the modern fullback dates from 1967. That was
the year when the Australian dispensation law was accepted by everyone. That
law stopped players from kicking directly into touch from outside their own
22-metre line. Fullbacks had to kick less and run more. In the intervening
years the northern hemisphere has produced only a handful of players who
have mastered all aspects of modern play in the position.
In 1967, the Australian side of Ken Catchpole with Phil Hawthorne at
halfback and the big burly, running fullback, Jim Lenehan, beat England
conclusively at Twickenham by 23-11. Lenehan was the first modern full-back
I had seen play. Four years earlier, my father had come home from work to
tell me that the 1963 All Blacks would be training at the Honorary Artillery
Company's ground a stone's throw or two from Liverpool Street station. He
suggested I 'went ill from school' (I was 13 at the time) and travel up with
him.
If I had known the word 'awesome' then, that is how I would have described
the day to my peers in the under-14 rugby team at Westcliff High School. I
watched Don Clarke. I watched him kick goal after goal from absolutely every
position on the park. He appeared to do it with any and every size of
football - most caked in mud. He was totally unfazed.
Clarke was the last of the dinosaur fullbacks. He was there purely for his
ability to kick goals and make last-ditch tackles. His style of kicking was
of the old school. He would place the ball upright and kick it just below
the half-way mark of the seam. His run-up was barely five paces.
Many will feel that JPR Williams, the Welsh fullback, was his equal in the
modern game. He was thought to be one of the great running fullbacks. JPR
was sensational at collecting kicks and running them back at the opposition
(although his kicking out of hand was lamentable). The trouble was that he
found running into the line to make the extra man, to release the mercurial
Gerald Davies or the quick-silver JJ Williams, sometimes difficult to
fathom.
JPR was not alone. Many players who enjoyed some fame at fullback - Dusty
Hare, Hugo MacNeill, Paul Thorburn, Marcus Rose, Gwyn Evans and Peter Dods -
never mastered this art. Three who did were Andy Irvine, Serge Blanco and
someone you have probably not heard much about, Jimmy Waterman, of Oxford
University and Bath.
Irvine had everything: vision, pace, athleticism, nerve, majesty, grace and
tremendous mental strength. He was the first of the complete fullbacks. His
rival at international level was Serge Blanco. Blanco had electrifying speed
when he burst on to the scene in 1982. He also possessed a Corinthian
attitude to the game which became slightly twisted as he grew older and
contemplated giving up cigarettes or the game or both. His demeanour against
the English at Twickenham was often suspect. Yet he was brilliant. The game
misses him.
I played with or against most of these players. Waterman was the best at
judging when to come into the line to make the extra man and the best at
releasing the ball for the wing to gallop over for a try. In the west
country he is an unsung hero. He proved that you do not need searing pace,
you need timing.
Of the current crop of British fullbacks, three stand out: Mike Rayer,
Anthony Clement and Paul Hull. Rayer has Waterman's timing, Clement is a joy
to watch, the complete player; the Welsh are blessed with such a choice.
Paul Hull is the first modern fullback the England team has had. He has
poise and skill. Last weekend, when he played for England against Romania,
his pace and line of attack were too much for the Underwood brothers; an
indication that England must change their wing-threequarters if Hull is to
blossom.
But, the best modern fullback will not be in action today. He is playing at
Elland Road tomorrow afternoon for the Kangaroos against against the Great
Britain rugby league team. He is Brett Mullins. Mullins has JPR's strength,
Blanco's vision, Irvine's flair and Joubert's skills. He is awesome.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Sport: The art of dealing yourself an ace - Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK LAWRENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A golfer in America scored his first hole in one last week at the age of 79.
It all proved too much. He accepted the congratulations of his playing
partners, drove off from the next tee, and then collapsed and died. This
must sound a sad story to non-golfers but those readers who play the Royal
and Ancient sport will sigh to themselves and say: 'What a splendid way to
go.'
A hole in one represents a momentous occasion in any golfer's life. It
clearly signifies the completion of a perfect shot in a sport where
perfection is, to an overwhelming degree, unattainable. But here is the
paradox: whereas in every other sport the more accomplished a person is the
closer to perfection they get, in golf it does not work that way.
Harry Vardon, who won the Open Championship more times than anyone else, hit
just a single hole-in-one: while recuperating in Norfolk from a long
illness.
Fred Couples has built a reputation for playing exciting golf and, when he
is on form, no-one plays more aggressively or hits the ball closer to the
hole.
Couples achieved his first hole-in-one two weeks ago during the last round
of the Lincoln Kapalua International in Hawaii. He went on to win the
tournament by two strokes.
This ace demonstrated the part that luck plays. A 30 mph wind was blowing
across the course. Couples aimed for the left edge of the green and then
watched the wind blow the ball back towards the hole. It pitched on the
front of the green and rolled 20 yards before hitting the pin and falling
below ground.
'It was almost as shocking as watching George Foreman win the previous
night,' Couples said.
That weekend Mancil Davis, the president of the National Hole-in-One
Association, was preparing to set up shop at the European Golf Trade
Exhibition in Birmingham.
This 6ft 2in Texan has never had any trouble getting those 'lil'
holes-in-one'. He has had 50 in competitions alone, although, curiously,
none since taking over as president of the association two years ago.
Davis once caddied for Tom Weiskopf and admits that is the closest he has
ever got to top-class golf. 'My regular shots aren't great and I can hardly
manage a putt,' he says cheerfully.
Is it all luck?
'If you're right then I'm an exceptionally lucky guy. All that l can tell
you is that as soon as I strike a ball I know whether it's going to be a
hole in one. It's always been - that way since my first at the age of 12. I
call it an ability to run a movie in my mind. I have this Red Indian
ancestry and I don't know whether there might be such a thing as kinetic
power.
'Scientists have studied me and sports psychologists have studied me. I've
been wired up and I've been monitored and these guys have discovered that as
I'm about to hit a hole-in-one, there is a distinctive change in my brain
waves.'
The Golfer's Handbook is full of weird and wonderful stories about
holes-in-one at odds that make winning this evening's first UK National
Lottery prize seem straightforward.
After a lifetime of golf, Rev Harold Snider scored his first hole-in-one at
75 on the eighth hole of the Ironwood course near Phoenix. He then scored
his second at the 13th and his third at the 14th.
Tom Doty, assistant professional at a course near Chicago, once played four
holes in 10 under par, with two holes-in-one sandwiched neatly by an eagle
and an albatross. The inappropriately-named John Putt of Frilford Heath had
six holes-in-one in 1970 and three more the following year.
The golf writer, Henry Longhurst, achieved the highly unusual feat of holing
two consecutive shots with a mashie (a rough equivalent of a five iron),
without putting it back into his bag. It happened at Letchworth, where he
holed his approach to the long sixth, and then his tee shot to the short
seventh.
Longhurst recalled: 'Taking the same club for my second to the eighth I
actually believed that I was more likely to hole out than not - such was the
effect of the shock - while another part of my mind was saying: 'Later on
you will be amazed that you could have thought what you are thinking now.'
Doing five holes in 3, 3, 1, 4, 3, I was out in 30 and then became so
frightened that I took 39 to come home. This did not stop me celebrating in
five different towns.
Ah yes, the celebrations. These normally take the form of buying a round in
the bar, which can be expensive, as Greg Norman discovered during the US
Tour Championship at the Olympic Club in San Francisco last month. He holed
in one at the eighth during the second round and bought drinks for everyone
in the clubhouse. Back came the itemised bar tab for Dollars 18,413. It
included Dollars 3 worth of soft drinks.
Clearly, the Olympic members were keen to observe the spirit of one of
golf's great occasions.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Sport: The best bows out - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just how good was she? That is the question everyone has been asking me. You
know who we are talking about; Martina Navratilova, the 38-year-old
Czech-born American who retired from singles on Tuesday in New York after
two decades of unprecedented success that earned her more than Dollars 20m
in prize money.
Let us get the numbers out of the way first. Starting with a win in Orlando
in 1974, she collected 167 tournament titles including 18 at the Grand
Slams: two in France, three in Australia, four in America and a record nine
at Wimbledon. Only Helen Wills Moody (19), the great American of the 1930s,
and Australia's Margaret Court (24) have won more but 11 of Court's wins
were in Australia in an era when few players travelled down under. Martina
won 55 Grand Slam titles in singles, doubles and mixed, just seven short of
Court's 62.
What do the numbers tell us? First that Martina was not afraid to win, an
affliction that assails more promising young players than you might imagine.
When Martina first came to England in 1973, an athletic 17-year-old, she was
representing Czechoslovakia in the BP Cup, an under-21 team event I
organised for eight years during the winter.
In the final the Czechs played Britain, who had beaten them 2-1 in the round
robin. In that tie Martina had lost to Glynis Coles. In the second rubber of
the final Martina faced Veronica Burton, four years her senior. Burton led
7-6 4-1 but Navratilova, attacking the baseliner with a fearless disregard
for her accurate passing shots, won the next five games to win the second
set and took the decider 6-4. Martina then had her revenge against Coles to
clinch the tie.
It was obvious that Martina loved competing. She had the natural
serve-and-volley game so few women perfect. She was strong and fast. Her
forehand and serve, both beautifully timed, were her winning weapons but her
backhand was vulnerable. It was a sliced shot, rather like that of another
Czech left-hander, Jaroslav Drobny. Unlike Drobny, Martina added a topspin
backhand to her repertoire with the help of Renee Richards who coached her
from 1981 to 1983.
Ever the perfectionist, Martina realised that she needed expert help to
eradicate weaknesses. One of those was a love of rich foods. On that first
visit to Torquay, Dan Maskell and I drove the Czechs round to show them the
sights. We thought they would like to visit Mike Sangster's sports shop. All
they wanted was to sample the local ice-cream.
Junk food was a problem for Martina following her defection to the US in
1975. During those first years in America Martina indulged herself. Freedom
went to her head . . . and to her waistline. She became engaged in a
succession of lesbian relationships that did nothing to enhance her image.
To improve her fitness she turned to Nancy Lieberman, a basketball star, who
made Martina aware of the sacrifices athletes must make. Martina was
prepared to make them. She became one of the fittest, best trained athletes
in the world.
Her results proved it. For five years, between 1982 and 1986, Martina ruled
the game losing only 14 matches. The match I remember as the peak of her
career was the final of the French Open in 1984. On slow European clay, the
surface that least favoured her game, and against her old friend and rival
Chris Evert she contrived a 6-3 6-1 win that wasspellbinding in its
efficiency.
Aided by a succession of coaches, Martina prolonged her career with typical
tenacity. Hard as she tried, a 10th title at her beloved Wimbledon eluded
her this year. As she left the court to a standing ovation she knew that her
decision to make this her last season of singles had been right.
My lasting memory will be of that first Wimbledon win in 1978 when Martina
beat Evert 7-5 in the final set. Her parents, unable to get a visa, were
watching on TV at a friend's house near the German border. Martina was a
lonely figure, still not sure of her place in the universe. The look of joy
and relief on her face as she shook hands is etched on my mind. Martina knew
at last that she was a true champion. Time to answer the question. How good
was she? The best.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Christmas Food &amp; Drink: Books for tipplers - Wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Larousse Encyclopedia of Wine, edited by Christopher Foulkes (Larousse,
Pounds 30, 608 pages) invites comparison with the near-simultaneously
published Oxford Companion to Wine by the FT's Jancis Robinson, reviewed
here in October.
But, the main value of the encyclopedia is as a manual and directly
instructional work, essentially based on the wine countries of the world
rather than an alphabetically planned reference work on a highly-detailed
scale.
After introductory pages on how it is organised, and an encouraging article
by Michael Broadbent on how to enjoy wine, a long section starts with a
brief history of wine and its varying production and ends with information
on how to decant and serve wine, along with matching wine with food.
Most of the rest of this solid volume is devoted to the wine countries,
their regions, districts and appellations where these exist.
France occupies 175 pages, the new world nearly 100. Short notes are
provided on the leading, recommended growers. The articles are nearly all by
British wine writers, listed at the end. The more lengthy contributions
deserve more individual identification. The maps are excellent and the
volume is competently produced: a useful work for the aspirant wine amateur
and also for the more sophisticated drinker, looking perhaps for unknown
wines, particularly in the New World.
In 1971 I reviewed here - and have retained the original edition - of Hugh
Johnson's World Atlas of Wine. So I am able to see in the new fourth
edition, (Mitchell Beasley, Pounds 30, 320 pages) the great difference time
and the development of wine production throughout the world have made in the
intervening years, during which two further editions have been produced and
a total of 7m copies sold.
More than any other single wine book it has not only increased interest in
wine but also demand. For, 23 years ago, supermarkets and off-licences that
now sell most of wine in the UK, were in their infancy. (Marks &amp; Spencer
started selling wine in 1973).
More pictorially orientated than the Larousse, it contains all the essential
information on the history and making of wine throughout the world, but also
notes on looking after wine, serving and best temperature.
In the persistent argument on the relative importance of terroir versus
grape variety, largely supported in the New World, Hugh Johnson is firmly on
the side of terroir, for which he argues cogently.
The maps have been amplified and more clearly defined. France takes up the
biggest wine-country section, with 89 pages, and is described in great
detail and is well mapped.
Germany, often undervalued, is well covered, but parts of Italy might have
been alloted more space. Barolo - king of wines according to Italians - and
Barbaresco are worth more than a page. Also, the leading vino da tavola
contains 20 per cent Cabernet-Sauvignon not 10 per cent, and was first put
on the market in 1971 not 1878. But these are tiny blemishes for a work that
will certainly run into further editions and which can be fairly described
as indispensable to all those seriously interested in wine.
Ch Haut-Brion was probably the first of what later became the first-growth
clarets of Bordeaux. Mentioned initially by Samuel Pepys in 1663, it has
been the only chateau to lack an individual account. Unlike the books on
Lafite, Latour and Margaux that were written by wine-writers, Haut-Brion
(Faber &amp; Faber, hardback Pounds 25, 258 pages, paperback Pounds 9.99) it is
by an academic author, Asa Briggs.
He appears to have believed it necessary to intermingle the story of
Bordeaux and its wine trade with that of the chateau, and this pads it out.
It is planned in a confusing way, with early chapters on the place, the
soil, the growers and wine, while leaving until later the main history of
the families who owned it - from the Pontacs and the Fumels to the Dillons.
Then, near the end, there is an odd chapter, entitled 'Times &amp; Seasons',
which contains a good deal of history. Nothing is omitted, including an
account of La Mission-Haut-Brion, acquired in 1983, but it is perhaps a
jeroboam of a book whereas a magnum would have sufficed.
The undeniable complexity of wine and wine drinking makes many
introductory-books boring as they attempt, in a manner often hard to absorb,
its many facets.
But, with well-chosen, often specially commissioned illustrations and a
clear text, Joanna Simon's Discovering Wine (Mitchell Beazley, Pounds 14.99,
160 pages) succeeds. It begins at the right point: on how to taste, serve,
fit in with various foods and when to drink at maturity. This section is
enhanced by attractive pictures of the author.
Then follows a section on how wine is made, with particular attention to
different grape varieties. After this follows an informative tour,
well-illustrated, of the world's wine regions.
Published in hardback in the mid-1980s, but now available in paperback, The
Book of Wine Antiques by Robin Butler and Gillian Walkling (Antique
Collectors' Club, Pounds 19.95, 286 pages) provides a highly informative
guide to items such as decanters, wine funnels, corkscrews, tasters and
coasters that may contribute to the pleasures of the table. There are also
chapters on antique drinking glasses and bottle holders. Some 52
illustrations are in colour and 306 in black and white.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): This fertile field for
fraudsters - Blueprint for two kinds of pyramid schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The term 'pyramid scheme' can be used to describe a huge variety of
marketing and investment schemes. Some are legitimate - but many are dubious
or fraudulent.
Pyramid selling, also known as network marketing or multi-level marketing,
is the more respectable type of pyramid. These schemes offer a part-time
income from selling something: household cleaning materials, jewellery and
water filters are common examples.
Sales agents get commission on their own deals as well as those made by
people they have recruited. The more layers of agents below you, the more
you earn.
Pyramid selling does have its pitfalls, however. People are sometimes
encouraged to join with unrealistic projections of the amount of work
necessary and the potential income.
You should ask yourself if you really want to risk alienating friends,
relatives and colleagues by pressurising them to join a scheme. And if you
join in an area where a particular scheme has taken off already, you could
find that potential customers and recruits are scarce.
Some schemes ask for large initial payments, or make you buy large
quantities of products with no reliable guarantee of refunds if you do not
manage to sell them.
But if you are considering taking up pyramid selling, here are some
questions you should ask.
Is there a big market for the products? Would you buy them yourself?
Are the prices reasonable?
Is the company well-established? Or might it collapse, leaving you with
unsaleable products and unpaid commission?
Are you expected to pay for your own training?
How much are you likely to earn with the amount of time at your disposal?
The Department of Trade and Industry says that, to comply with the law,
schemes should not ask for money for goods and services before you have
signed a contract; offer instant promotion in return for a large cash
payment; or even require a large payment when you join (the maximum should
be Pounds 75).
Pyramid investment schemes are one of the oldest tricks in the fraudster's
book. They exploit people's gullibility, lack of understanding of financial
matters, and eternal belief in get-rich-quick schemes.
These schemes work (temporarily) by redistributing money from new
subscribers to those a few layers above. 'Investors' are attracted through
mail-shots or advertisements in shop windows and newspapers promising large
profits.
What they do not realise is that the 'profits' are actually the
subscriptions of the most recent recruits. As soon as the stream of new
'investors' dries up, so do the payments. There is no underlying investment,
just money whizzing round the system to make it appear to work. Continuous
expansion is necessary for anyone to profit, and those on the bottom always
end up losing out.
Titles such as Alchemy and Midas, conjuring up mythical riches, give the
game away. By the time these schemes collapse, usually in a haze of
recriminations and with thousands of people losing their savings, the
founders and a handful of early recruits have often made off with the money.
Some pyramid schemes are dressed up to look like legitimate multi-level
marketing plans or investment clubs by offering a 'product' - such as
photo-copied reports, newsletters or seminars - or discounts on consumer
goods. In fact, these frills are irrelevant to the working of the scheme.
Other schemes take the form of chain letters.
Pyramid investment schemes often fall through the web of investment and
consumer protection laws, although the DTI stepped in recently and closed
down a number of them on public interest grounds. Sadly, when this happens
or the schemes collapse, many investors refuse to believe they have been
duped, and, instead, turn their anger on the authorities.
Warning signs of a pyramid scam include:
Promises of fantastic money-making opportunities while being very vague
about how the money is to be made. Hints may be dropped about complicated
international currency transactions or investment in obscure areas (say,
Swiss venture capital or commodities) which ordinary people would not expect
to understand.
Absence of a realistic, saleable product.
Direct payments for recruiting new people.
Demands for large 'membership fees' or regular monthly payments, with
nothing concrete in return.
Classic pyramids always end in tears. Genuine multi-level marketing schemes
can sometimes bring in a reasonable income, although only from hard work
over an extended period. But any scheme which looks too good to be true - by
offering rich rewards for little effort - is bound to be a con.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): A reader writes . . .
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having just returned from a four-day holiday in Paris, I felt compelled to
write regarding the daylight robbery of holiday-makers by currency shops. My
first transaction - a Pounds 100 traveller's cheque on October 26 via Banque
Indosuez - was at a rate of 8.18 francs to the pound. This resulted in an
exchange of 818 francs, inclusive of commission.
My second transaction the following day was at a Chequepoint Bureau adjacent
to the Pompidou Centre.
When I inquired about the rate, the clerk pointed to a board which displayed
numerous figures and conditions - all, of course, in French, which I do not
speak.
While the rate of FFr8.05 did not appear quite as good as my previous day's
exchange, I was happy to proceed on the basis of expediency. So, I signed my
traveller's cheque for Pounds 200.
The clerk then made a lengthy telephone call which, he said, was necessary
to safeguard my interests against theft. Following this, I was presented
with FFr1,430 and a receipt showing an exchange rate of FFr7.15.
I questioned this but was told it was correct. An argument ensued, during
which I asked for the transaction to be cancelled and demanded my cheque be
returned. I was not successful so I went to Chequepoint's head office in the
Avenue des Champs-Elysees. There, I encountered a very hostile manager.
Incidentally, I checked the bank rate later that day with Banque Indosuez;
it was FFr8.12. The difference of FFr0.97 between the two rates is 11.9 per
cent - which is quite extortionate.
My error, of course, was in not firmly establishing the rate beforehand. But
I cannot imagine why the authorities in France allow such money shops to
operate.
I would be most interested to hear if you have received letters from other
aggrieved travellers. I should also be interested to know if there is any
authority in France to which I can write on this subject.
The French need to bring the activities of these 'money bandits' to heel.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I work on salary for the University of London and also have freelance
consultancy income. My salary is taxed under PAYE and the consultancy
earnings under Schedule D.
I pay pension contributions from my salary to the Universities
Superannuation Scheme (USS) but make no further pension provision from the
freelance earnings. Can I remain in the USS and, simultaneously, take out a
personal pension funded solely from my freelance earnings?
There is no reason why you cannot start a personal pension based on your
freelance earnings while remaining in the occupational scheme in respect of
your salary. You might also like to consider making free-standing additional
voluntary contribution (FSAVC) payments at the same time as contributing to
a personal pension. (Reply by Murray Johnstone Personal Asset Management).

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Profit from renting -
Briefcase, Q&amp;A
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My wife and I have been renting our houses in England while we have been
living in Germany where I am employed by a German company (my wife does not
work). This year will be the first when we will see a profit from our UK
rental income. The houses are in both our names. Are we each entitled to a
UK personal tax allowance for this year - and, if so, how much is it?
Yes - Pounds 3,445 each, plus a married couple's allowance for you of Pounds
1,720 at 20 per cent (viz, Pounds 344 actual tax relief).
You forgot to tell us if the houses are let furnished (and thus fall within
Schedule D case VI) or unfurnished (Schedule A), and whether the rent is
being paid direct to your joint bank account, for example (and thus having
25 per cent tax withheld by the tenants), or to an agent in the UK (and thus
having no tax deducted).
If it is being paid to an agent, the tax for the present year, 1994-95, is
due for payment on New Year's day. The way in which the New Year's day
liability is calculated (subject to adjustment after April 5 1995) depends
upon whether the profits are assessable under Schedule A or D.
If you are in doubt, the solicitor who acted for you in the lettings are
best placed to advise you, since he has ready access to the relevant facts,
figures and dates - as well, of course, as knowing the tax law and practice
relating to domestic property letting.

non-residents: liability to tax in the UK).

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Reducing a CGT bill -
Briefcase, Q&amp;A
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Some time soon, I intend to buy a house for my mother and stepfather.
Because it will be solely for their use, does this exempt me from CGT whilst
they are resident there, or will I be faced with it when eventually I come
to sell?
CGT relief for houses occupied by dependent relatives was abolished (except
for some existing cases) by the Finance Act 1988. But you could get a
substantial reduction in the prospective CGT bill by:
1. Granting your parents a formal tenancy (at modest rent, perhaps, but not
a tenancy for life, preferably).
2. Living in the house for a short time (perhaps before they move in).
3. Giving judiciously-timed main-residence notices under section 222(5)(a)
of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (jointly with your wife, if
appropriate under subsection 6(a) of that section).
The guidance of your solicitors - or other experts in the tax rules and
practice relating to domestic property transactions - is essential: the CGT
rules are quite arbitrary and generally are enforced rigidly with scant
regard for equity or logic.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Portfolio has a price -
Briefcase, Q&amp;A
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In September 1993, I was given a considerable share portfolio.
1. What tax liability does this entail for the donor and myself?
2. What is the position regarding letting of rooms in a house which is being
part-purchased by a mortgage of some 30 per cent of its value.
Is it necessary to notify the mortgage company that some rooms are being
let, and will the lettings have any implications for insuring the property
and contents?
1. The donor is liable to pay capital gains tax as though he had sold the
shares to you at their respective market values on the day of the gift.
Correspondingly, you will be treated (for CGT purposes) as though you had
bought the shares on that day at the market values. No doubt the donor will
let you have a list of the agreed values after his CGT liability (if any)
has been settled.
There will be no inheritance tax liability unless the donor dies before the
seventh anniversary of the gift. (This reply is based on the assumption that
all the shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange, and that the donor
is resident (and ordinarily resident) in the UK and domiciled in one of its
three constituent countries). 2. You will find that your mortgage agreement
obliges you to notify the lender of any intention to let part of the
property; and you will find that your insurance policy (contents section)
obliges you to notify the insurer before allowing any third party to live in
the house. (We are a little puzzled, however, that you wrote to us, rather
than simply reading the documents).

FT  19 NOV 94 / Christmas Food &amp; Drink: Treading in the vintage - Giles
MacDonogh takes off his shoes and socks in the Douro valley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vila Nova de Gaia is the showroom for port wine. It lies opposite Oporto on
the south bank of the Douro just before the river debouches into the
Atlantic.
There the big companies have their lodges and visitors may go on special
tours and taste the wines. Port, however, comes from miles away up river,
beyond the high Serra do Marao.
The mountains have the advantage of keeping out the Atlantic climate which
can make Oporto such a cussed, drizzly place. There it is generally hot all
summer, resulting in what is called 'Douro bake'; hard on humans, but
marvellous for the thick-skinned black grapes destined to be trodden (well,
ideally) for port.
The Douro is one of the remotest places in modern Europe. In spite of all
that has happened in the past century; in spite of the revolution of 1974,
the region still has a feudal feel.
At the centre of the feudal structure is the quinta: a farm estate planted
with vines and occasionally olives. Pretensions to architecture are rare,
quinta houses are large, solid, white-washed buildings. Every now and then
they are distinguished by a baroque chapel or a few stone dressings around
the windows.
There live the lords of the Douro. Some are directors of port houses in Vila
Nova. In the majority of cases, however, the owners remain independent of
the port business, preferring to sell their grapes for the best price.
Either way the structure remains the same.
Life in the Douro Valley can never have been easy. The soil is thin and
stony - suitable only for vines and olives. Even today transport is slow
and, occasionally, hazardous. Not so long ago the only way down to Oporto
was by river.
The limited vocation of Douro agriculture explains the jubilation which
surrounds the vintage. The villagers arrive with their friends and relations
and pick the grapes. Once the harvest is in the villagers gather around the
shallow, stone lagares; there the bunches destined for the very best wines
are trodden underfoot.
Only a few years ago only port houses such as Taylors continued to tread a
percentage of their grapes. Recent studies, however, have shown that
footwork is simply the best way to derive the maximum colour and extract in
the shortest period of time. This is a vital consideration with port, where
the still-fermenting juice must be run off on to brandy after only two or
three days in the vat.
Treading the grapes in the lagares has another advantage: It gives the
villagers the chance to enjoy the harvest in their traditional way. Much of
the fun takes place in the vat itself.
Arriving at Taylors' Quinta de Vargellas on the last day of this year's
vintage, we were taken down to see the locals at work in the lagar. At first
glance they seemed rather gloomy. A lugubrious character had taken on the
role of sergeant and was drilling his little squad backwards and forwards
through a thick mass of grapes.
When we returned after dinner the scene had been transformed.
Someone had got hold of a synthesiser; a few bottles of rough local brandy
had been cracked; and there was dancing in the vat.
We jumped in too. It was not easy to dance in a cold, sticky stew of grapes,
pips and husks, but the villagers were clearly enjoying it; nor did they
seem much inhibited by the presence of the squire and his guests. Within
moments we were clamped in the arms of the stout village women.
The next day the vintage was over. The occasion was marked by a procession
up to the quinta house beaded by one of the prettier of the younger women
flanked by a man with an accordion.
The woman carried a cross with a bunch of grapes at the centre surrounded by
seven red roses. This was presented to Alastair Robertson, of Taylors, to
keep as a talisman until the next vintage. It was the cue for the Robertsons
to turn the quinta over to a sort of saturnalia: the lords waiting on the
villagers: providing them with food and fetching them drink.
Once the dancing had stopped, Robertson took his guests on an excursion to
the other side of the river.
I should have gauged from the look on his face that he intended to surprise
us when we docked beside a bar-cum-restaurant called the Cafe Sa da Ribeira.
A wild-looking character wearing a greatcoat and the Portuguese flag on his
head greeted us at the quay, then followed us to the cafe where a shiny
brass plaque informed us that John Major, the British prime minister, had
lunched there on August 30 1993.
The cafe owner informed us that Major had eaten grilled chicken with chips
and drunk a simple white wine. We were all so chuffed at our scoop that
no-one remembered to ask who had paid the bill. Nor was it explained to us
whether Major was attracted by the remoteness of the Douro Valley or by its
surviving feudalism.
What was, however, clear, was that he had chosen the wrong year: 1993 was a
wash-out, one of the worst in living memory. On the other hand 1994 was a
peach and come 1996 Taylors might well to decide to declare a vintage. If
that happens I shall like to think that my sore feet played a small part in
its success.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Christmas Food &amp; Drink: Shopping without tears, a food
lover's armchair guide - Nicholas Lander sorts out the best British postal
suppliers for your Christmas poultry and game, fish and meats, cheeses and
oils, treats and sweetmeats for the Christmas and new year holiday season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Three factors have led me to spend another lengthy period on the phone
talking to Britain's most individualistic suppliers and retailers.
The first was hearing from many readers how useful this guide has been not
just in the hectic run-up to Christmas but during the rest of the year.
Bulky boxes of food delivered to your door can save you time and backache.
In talking to these suppliers I also realised how widely last year's guide
was appreciated. One Lancashire supplier received a phone call and orders
from a reader in Canada while another, based in London, was soon packing
orders for Eire and Norway.
Finally, there is the growing conviction among suppliers that they have
weathered the worst - the recession and the costly imposition of new health
regulations - and they can now concentrate on producing first class
ingredients.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Saving and Borrowing): Persistence pays off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The days when choosing a mortgage was a simple matter of either repayment or
endowment are long gone. House-buyers now have dozens of options,
complicated by tempting offers of discounts and cashbacks.
Earlier this year, when there was uncertainty about which way interest rates
were going, fixed-rate mortgage offers were sometimes being introduced and
withdrawn within 24 hours. In such an atmosphere, it is difficult enough for
ordinary people to negotiate the maze. Sometimes, it seems bank and building
society staff are not clear, either.
When Weekend Money reader Gillian Turner and her family were planning to
move house in April, she researched the mortgage market thoroughly. After
calling the Abbey National's national telephone help-line, she thought she
had found the perfect combination: a four-year, fixed-rate mortgage with a
cashback arrangement to cover her valuation fee and solicitor's costs.
On three occasions, she spoke to Abbey National staff over the telephone to
check the details. She then applied for the mortgage through her financial
adviser. He was surprised that a cashback was available on a fixed-rate
mortgage so he called the Abbey National himself to check - and was told it
was. So, the application went ahead and purchase of the house was completed
on June 14.
The Turners moved in - but no cheque arrived from Abbey National. She made
numerous phone calls and wrote several letters to find out what had happened
to the Pounds 689.40 she felt she was owed.
It was not until August 4 that Abbey National told her the mortgage she had
chosen had never been eligible for a cashback. The offer to reimburse
borrowers for their mortgage valuations and conveyancing costs applied only
to variable-rate mortgages.
Turner persisted. 'My argument throughout has been that the product I was
sold is not the product I now have, and that I want what I bought.'
More letters and 'phone calls followed. Abbey National offered her an ex
gratia payment of Pounds 100, then Pounds 150, then Pounds 350, all of which
were refused. Finally, late last month - and 4 1/2 months after moving into
her new home - she received a cheque for Pounds 689.40.
Yet, Abbey National still did not admit liability. 'We are not convinced we
were at fault but, because she had become an Abbey National customer and was
clearly unhappy, we felt it was appropriate to make an ex gratia payment,' a
company representative said.
Clearly, it is difficult to determine who said what to whom in conversations
months ago, but a few precautions might help house-buyers avoid this sort of
problem.
If you discuss any financial product over the 'phone, note the name of the
person to whom you are talking and the time of the conversation.
Ask for written details to check that all the conditions are as you
understood them.
As well as checking your eligibility for cashbacks and discounts, ask about
other conditions.
If you feel you have been misled or misinformed about a product, but your
initial complaint is rejected by the company responsible, do not give up.
Turner's experience shows that persistence can pay.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Christmas Food &amp; Drink: A special experience - Giles
MacDonogh travels (without a donkey) in the Cevennes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is it which makes France so special? One reason is variety.
With certain notable exceptions, such as the Brie, the Beauce or the
monotonous Landes, the landscape changes every 30 kilometres; parasol pines
might give way to maquis, olive trees and vines cede their places to
chestnut trees and herds of goats. With every mutation there is a new
culture, patois and diet.
I have been to Montpellier dozens of times, but before this autumn I had
never ventured up into the Cevennes.
My destination was the hotel-cum-restaurant Chantoiseau in Vialas in the
Lozere, a place so remote that even its owner, the lyrical chef Patrick
Pages, is heard to exclaim 'est la ou Jesus Christ a perdu ses savattes', an
idiomatic way of saying it is a hell of a place to find.
The Cevennes were made famous in Britain by the writings of Robert Louis
Stevenson. This is Protestant France. Many fled to Britain, Holland and
Germany after the infamous dragonnades of the 17th century. Those who
remained maintained a careful secrecy about their lifestyles and even to
this day they can be closed and withdrawn.
The chestnut is the module of Cevennes cooking. It was a region of intense
poverty. and every part of the tree served some practical purpose: the
leaves were used to feed the animals; the wood served to make furniture;
while the nuts themselves were smoked to rid them of their maggots and used
to provide force during the cruel winter months.
As Pages points out, a mere handful of chestnuts is enough to nourish a man.
Normally they were offered with goats' milk as badjana. In the poorer
villages of the Cevennes this is how children are fed to this day. As Pages
puts it: 'Chestnuts are not trees, they are an entire civilisation.'
The frugality of this basic diet was relieved by the occasional feast. The
great speciality was a calves' head vinaigrette with boiled potatoes; or
tripoux, a dish which might have reconciled them to their Calvinist ccusins
in Scotland: little packets of sheeps' stomach cooked with mutton trotters
much in the manner of the pieds et paquets de Marseilles.
The onerous task of cleaning the tripe made it one of the few meat dishes
consumed by the poor. The soil was so terrible that only the rich possessed
sheep or cows. Their diet was slightly different: they consumed slow cooked
meat stews or daubes; the plentiful game; or salt cod au gratin.
Potatoes were another important staple; either cooked in a puree with herbs
or as aligot, an unctuous puree of potatoes and young Cantal cheese which
should be so elastic that you are obliged to wrap it round your fork like
spaghetti.
There was no systematic cultivation of the vine, no beer, no cider and no
perry. From the late 19th century onwards, what little wine there was came
from the Clinton grape, which, as the name suggests, was imported from
America. This hybrid made light coloured, thin wines which were rumoured to
affect both the heart and lungs. Pages asserts that it was Clinton, rather
than vinegar, that was in the sponge passed up to Christ on the cross: 'It
was that which killed him.'
This account of the gastronomic specialities of the Lozere might seem
calculated to put off potential visitors, but let me assure you that there
is no Clinton among the 1,020 wines listed at Chantoiseau. Nor will you be
dissatisfied with the menu: Pages is a highly respected chef and sommelier
who represents the Languedoc-Roussillon region both in France and abroad.
He is, however, more than happy to make use of local Ingredients.
He lists as one of his specialities, in the Michelin guide, the plate of
juicy sausage which greets you as you arrive at table.
The famous chestnuts of the region found their way into the quail consomme
with ginger and Soissons beans as well as the exquisite raviole of
pelardons, the local goats' cheese; this was served on a bed of Swiss chard
and a little sauce of fresh mousseron mushrooms.
This is a paradise for mushroom lovers and come the autumn wild mushrooms
figure largely on the menu. Some tender fillets of stag, for example, came
with two significant piles of mushrooms: one of ceps and the other of
grisettes, together with a dollop of aligot.
The same pelardons also loom large on the cheeseboard but they are joined by
other goats' cheeses and some of the greats of the nearby Auvergne.
The name of the restaurant is a little pun which demonstrates something of
the owner's humour. His father was a boulanger (baker) who became the owner
of the Hotel Platon (no relation to the philosopher) in Vialas.
Pages changed the name to Chantoiseau after the man credited with opening
Paris' first restaurant in the 1770s. Chantoiseau was his nom de guerre. His
real name was Boulanger.
Chantoiseau, Vialas 48220 Lozere. Tel: 66 41 00 02. Open April 8-November
11. Closed Tues night and Wed. It is advisable to get instructions on the
best way to get there when you book.
Menus range in price from FFr130 to FFr720. A la carte FFr400 to FFr500.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Christmas Food &amp; Drink: Over from Dover - Jill James
recommends shops and eating places in north France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mary Tudor may have had Calais engraved on her heart but I shall have it
tattooed on my Wellington boots.
Arriving in a particularly nasty squall last month, for Le Shopping, I found
it a little hard to explain to my family why we were forsaking the pleasures
of London for a week in the Pas-de-Calais.
The reasons were looking even ropier after two indifferent and expensive
meals at recommended restaurants.
But then came the turning point. At my 11-year-old's insistence we booked in
to an old favourite, the Atlantic Hotel in Wimereux, a small resort a couple
of miles from Boulogne run by Aron and Marie-France Misan.
Here we ate some of the best food of our stay - including a dish that I
thought it would be very difficult to make a success of - foie gras stuffed
with lobster and spinach, which worked surprisingly well.
Lobster is the speciality of the house and so, in season, is fruits-de-mer.
Out of season the menu is commendably short. Expect to pay about Pounds 35
to Pounds 45 a head with wine. Hotel accommodation is modest.
And now, for those of you on the annual drink-buying pilgrimage, here is a
selection of the very best restaurants and food shops in Calais and Boulogne
(see panel opposite).
Necessarily it is entirely subjective, gleaned from many visits. Mostly I
have either visited the shops and restaurants personally - and paid for
meals and goods out of my own money - or they come highly recommended from
friends and colleagues.
I have concentrated on small, good quality businesses, many family-owned.
Mammouth and the rest of the hypermarkets you can seek for yourselves.
You should find all the shopkeepers I have mentioned happy to greet you -
and for a very good reason: 'The British visitor represents 15 per cent of
the general turnover of the trade in Calais,' says Gerrard Baron, chairman
of the town's Chamber of Commerce.
When I popped in to see him last month, a group of the town's shopkeepers
were in a basement room busily honing their English language skills in order
to provide an even better service to visitors.
So good shopping and bon appetit.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Christmas Food &amp; Drink: Top food and drink shops for
cross-Channel trekkers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Calais has a population of only 120,000 - but between the beginning of
November and Christmas it will be swelled by some of the 1.5m to 2m Britons
who will have crossed the channel to shop there or in the surrounding area
of northern France. In Calais the shopping streets are in two groups, around
rue Royal and place d'Armes, and along the boulevards Jacquard and La
Fayette. Although it is not as attractive as neighbouring Boulogne it still
offers top quality small shops of the sort which are all too uncommon in
southern England. Boulogne is France's biggest fishing port. More attractive
than Calais, I have always had a soft spot for the walled haute ville.
However, I think the best food and drink shopping is to be had below the
haute ville in the Grande Rue, rue Faidherbe and the little streets that
criss-cross them. Here are some of my favourites:
Calais
AU BEC FIN,
32 Bd La Fayette,
Tel: 21 82 63 80. A very good cheese shop which also sells fine wines.
LA MAISON DU FROMAGE,
1 rue Andre Gerschell

Tel: 21 34 64 57, and
HUITRIERE CALAISIENNE,
12 Bd La Fayette,
Tel 21 36 50 97. Two good fish shops.
BOUCHERIE CHARCUTERIE DAVELU,
87 Bd La Fayette,
Tel: 21 34 39 64. The best butcher in town.
MARKETS: Thursday and Saturday mornings, place Crevecoeur. Wednesday
mornings, place d'Armes.

haven't yet tried).
BOURGEOIS JEAN
1 Grande Rue,
Tel: 21 31 53 57. Excellent butcher. I get my Toulouse sausages here.
MARKETS: Wednesday and Saturday morning, place Dalton.
DRINK
The government has laid down a 90-litre guideline for those bringing drink
into the UK from the EC. In fact, there is no legal limit and you can bring
in what you want provided it is for your own personal use. Among the
plethora of guides to the drinks market the best I have come across is Tom
Stevenson's The Cross-Channel Drinks Guide (Absolute Press,Pounds 6.99, 272
pages).
The best cross-channel drinks outlet is the Grape Shop in Boulogne. There is
now a branch at the SeaCat terminal, Gare Maritime, 62200 Boulogne, (tel:
010 33 21 30 16 17 from the UK), in addition to the shop at 85-87 rue Victor
Hugo in the town (010 33 21 30 16 17). Martin Brown, who runs them, is
English and extremely helpful.
CHANNEL crossings: Check the newspapers for fare bargains - most of the
ferry companies offer remarkably good deals for trippers at this time of
year. And there is always the Tunnel . . . (see Stuart Marshall, Page III).
Jill James travelled with Hoverspeed from Dover to Calais and by SeaCat from
Folkestone to Boulogne. Reservations: 0304-240241

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Pensions): Annuities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER QUINTON, Annuity Bureau
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent speculation as to whether the Inland Revenue will reinstate the
flexible annuity in April has prompted people approaching retirement to ask
if they should buy their annuity now, or wait.
Personally, I see little indication that the Budget will bring about any
major changes and, in view of the fact that annuity rates have been falling
since their peak in September, it is likely that most retired people will
have more to lose than gain by delaying their decision.
It is important to realise that a number of life companies have decreased
their rates in the past few days, and it is likely that these will continue
to drop.
On Tuesday, Stalwart Assurance moved all its annuity rates down by 1.9 per
cent. Sun Life of Canada decreased its rates by 0.7 per cent on November 10
and Sun Life cut its purchase life annuities by 1.3 per cent the following
day.
You should also remember that although the flexible annuity offers many
excellent benefits - including a greater ability to control retirement
income as required - the inherent risks of this product mean it is suitable
for only a select group of retired people. Thus, it should be viewed as an
alternative to the conventional or phased retirement annuity and not as a
replacement.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
TOP ANNUITY RATES
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
An annuity provides a guaranteed income for life in return for a lump
  sum investment.
The bulk of the fund built up by many types of pension plan must be used
  in this way. This week's table shows COMPULSORY PURCHASE ANNUITY RATES

  contribution plans (AVCs) and free standing AVCs (FSAVCs) among
  others.
The rates do not include inflation proofing.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Pensions): Why household names can cost you
plenty - Be on guard for big differences in what providers charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When it comes to selecting a personal pension, relying on a household name
with a good performance track record could prove an expensive mistake. The
amount of your premium deducted in charges not only varies from provider to
provider but can vary greatly between contracts from the same stable.
The latest research from Bacon &amp; Woodrow, a leading actuary and consultant,
shows that Gartmore, Equitable Life, Legal &amp; General and Britannia Life -
all top providers for one or more example combinations of term and premium -
are over-priced for others (see table).
The survey also raises a serious concern about the details financial
institutions provide on their charges. Andrew Warwick-Thompson, head of
partnership pensions at B&amp;W and author of the report, said: 'The annual
management charge, bid/offer spread (the initial charge) on the purchase of
units and administration fees are not the only costs passed on to
policy-holders.
'In most cases, unit-linked funds bear additional costs which are reflected
in the unit price - for example audit fees, dealing commissions, trusteeship
fees, custody fees and stamp duty.' According to Warwick-Thompson, these
costs can add up to the equivalent of an extra 0.5 per cent on the annual
management charge and are most likely to occur where the stated annual
charge appears low.
He pointed out also that these hidden charges will not be revealed under the
rules that come into force on January 1 1995 and require providers to show
prospective clients the management and sales commission costs - an oversight
the regulators should have spotted.
B&amp;W examined 233 managed unit-linked funds, the most popular choice for
investors. Using performance statistics, it eliminated funds that achieved
below-average returns, or were inconsistent or volatile.
As Warwick-Thompson explained: 'The use of past performance statistics is
probably the best guide to gauge future performance - provided it is coupled
with a clear understanding of how past performance was achieved, an
assessment of the investment style of a management team, and a knowledge of
whether the individuals responsible for past performance are still in
place.'
Only funds with a five-year track record and Pounds 20m under management
made it through to the final short-list. Since B&amp;W operates on a fee basis,
it also excluded providers who were not prepared to strip out the commission
costs and re-invest these in the fund. And several funds were eliminated
where the provider's contract imposed penalties on transfer or early
retirement.
The final short-list of 15 funds from 12 providers was: Britannia Life,
Commercial Union, Equitable Life, General Accident, Gartmore, Legal &amp;
General, Lincoln National (three funds), London &amp; Manchester, M&amp;G, Norwich
Union, Standard Life (two funds) and Sun Life.
B&amp;W then calculated reduction in premium (RIP) figures for each fund to find
the most competitive provider for a series of contract terms and premium
levels (see table). RIP analysis shows the effect of charges expressed as a
percentage reduction of each premium paid throughout the term of the policy.
The short-list and tables do not tell the full story, however. Recently, B&amp;W
published a report that predicted the imminent demise of 40 of the 100 life
offices now in business.
Smaller life offices, particularly the mutuals, are vulnerable to take-over
in the post-January 1995 competitive environment. Thus, advisers may not
recommend for long-term investments those offices regarded as take-over
targets.
The results of the survey are based on the terms negotiated by B&amp;W. These
may not be available through other advisers. The Bacon &amp; Woodrow Personal
Pension Handbook and Unit-Linked Survey 1994-94 is available from NTC
Publications Ltd, Farm Road, Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire RG9 1EJ (tel:
0491-574 671). Price: Pounds 27.50.

FT  19 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: Crowd-beating gift hunting - Lucia van der
Post meanders through the Christmas mail-order catalogues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If those geniuses at Sears Roebuck, JC Penney and Montgomery Ward (those
pioneers who had the bright idea that people might buy goods through the
post) could see us now, they would be astonished. Once mail order was just
for the utilitarian and the everyday. Today you would be hard pushed to
think up anything that you could not buy by mail.
At Christmas, mail order comes into its own. Forget the forays into bleak
car-parks, the crowded shops, the over-heated shops and the battle to get
the parcels home. There is still time to order the catalogues, sort through
the lists and get everything delivered on time.
These days few catalogues come with a cover price - they flutter out from
almost every magazine and newspaper in the land - but for anybody whose
doormat has been neglected here are some of the best of the commercial ones
around.
Shaker, 25 Harcourt Street, London W1. Tel:071-724-7672. Pounds 5.
Those who love Shaker-style will probably already know this charming, small
company. This year's catalogue is fatter than ever and a source of
beautifully simple household goods ranging in price from about Pounds 6.95
for home-spun, gingham soap bags to much, much more for serious furniture. A
small Shaker hanging cupboard at Pounds 299 is especially charming, so, too,
are the tin, scented candle-holders and lanterns. There is a lot for
children - this year's collection of hand-made decorations are on a woodland
and fishing theme with lots of gingham fish, wooden sledges and
sweetly-dressed little dolls. Beckett and Graham, 3 Langton Street, London
SW10 0 JL. tel: 071-376-3855.
A small catalogue, filled with ideas for household accessories - photograph
frames, flower-bedecked trays, sweet little jugs and wrought-iron fruit and
candle holders. There are some nice old-fashioned games - pick up sticks

best pieces from more than 600 craft members. You could buy a warm and
tweedy country jacket for Pounds 189, a carpet bag from Pounds 42.80, tartan
picnic rugs for Pounds 45, leather luggage from Pounds 100, a hand-made
rocking horse or a traditional wooden trug. The Royal Academy of Arts, Royal
Academy Enterprises Ltd., Harrington Dock, Liverpool L70 1AX. Tel:

footstools. An old teak book rest costs Pounds 24.95 and white, cotton
nightdresses at Pounds 29.95 and there is a charming amber necklace at

centralised buying for many of the charity catalogues, almost everything
seems unique to the gallery and relevant to its purpose. Portraits, ranging

little too extravagant to buy for ourselves. You can buy hand-drawn,
threadwork guest towels at Pounds 12.50 a time, some golden yellow French
Provencal oven-to-tableware with basketwork holders, beautiful see-through

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Income): Risks, but sterling
qualities, too - Bonds that offer wider choice than gilts and can produce
unusually good value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nobody should invest in anything they cannot understand. So, personal
investors who find gilt-edged stocks difficult will be right to steer clear
of sterling bonds - unless they have a reliable adviser.
These bonds, issued by UK companies, offer an even wider choice than gilts
and usually provide slightly higher returns. This is reasonable, since the
repayment guarantee from issuers is not as solid as the UK government
guarantee behind gilts.
But investors willing to take on that additional credit risk can often get
the slightly higher returns without penalty. And, as in all markets,
particular corners of that in sterling bonds sometimes offer unusually good
value.
A slightly speculative case in point is preference shares. These are
conventionally assessed and traded as if they were bonds but they are, as
the name suggests, shares.
This means that - like ordinary shares - they pay dividends, not interest,
and they pay their dividends net but with a tax credit.
The gist of the argument is this. Back in the summer, there was a scare that
the Budget to be introduced on Tuesday, November 29, might reduce the
dividend tax credit.
If this were to happen, investing institutions which are not liable to
income tax, such as pension funds, would see a reduction in income.
Normally, they can claim back the tax but, if the credit were reduced, there
would be less tax to reclaim. So, the gross dividend they received would be
reduced, too, and the gross yield along with it - and prices would fall.
Predictably, the result of the scare was that prices of preference shares
weakened, even though nothing had yet happened.
Securities firm BZW puts forward two reasons why preference shares are
attractive to taxpayers such as personal investors interested in income.
First, shareholders who do pay income tax would not be affected adversely
even if the tax credit were cut: they would continue to get the same net
yield.
Second, BZW no longer expects the tax credit to be tampered with in the
Budget: hence its suggestion that, if it is right, prices of preference
shares will rise to eliminate the present anomaly.
At the moment, a couple of insurance company prefs (Commercial Union 8.375
per cent and General Accident 7.875 per cent) offer yields of 6.5 per cent
net to the 40 per cent taxpayer, compared with 6.2 per cent from the broadly
comparable Halifax permanent interest-bearing share (Pibs) and 5 per cent
from the relevant gilt.
Preference shares and Pibs are mainly of interest to income-orientated
investors prepared to keep their money invested 'for ever' and willing to
accept the enduring capital risk. So, the hope of a price rise is a bit of a
red herring.
One snag with preference shares is that most issues are small and the shares
may be difficult to buy and sell. But the two large insurance companies, GA
and CU, and some high street banks including NatWest, have issues of Pounds
100m or more. Private investors should stick to these.
The preference share yields mentioned above are equivalent to a gross yield
of 10.9 per cent, roughly two points better than the fixed deposit rates
shown on page 10.
Neither is 'better': they suit different types of investors who have
different attitudes to risk and different time horizons.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Income): Bonds that beat the
building societies - Regular incomes, second of a series
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are many ultra-cautious investors who need a guaranteed income but
want to preserve capital. The two products examined here - pensioners'
guaranteed income bonds from National Savings, and guaranteed income bonds
sold by insurance companies - can provide a higher monthly income than
variable-rate building society accounts.
The income is fixed for five years for pensioners' bonds and three to five
years for most of the insurance company bonds. At the end of the guarantee
period, you get your original capital back - but its real value will have
fallen because of inflation.
To counteract this, those with long-term income needs should protect their
capital against inflation by investing in equities as well.
Those who need short-term income might be interested in a guaranteed income
bond. But they should remember:
National Savings products do not pay commission to advisers, so this could
influence recommendations. But the insurance company bonds pay commission of
between 1 and 2 per cent of the lump sum investment.
National Savings products are backed by the government, but insurance
company bonds are sold mainly by the smaller life offices. Your guarantee is
only as solid as the company backing it, so be on the alert for unknown
companies offering high rates. If a company goes to the wall, only 90 per
cent of your money is covered by the Policyholders Protection Act of 1975.
The level of income on guaranteed bonds is determined by underlying money
market interest rate movements. Clearly, the aim is to fix a deal before
rates start to fall - but are you confident you can predict the direction
they will take when the experts consistently get it wrong?
These are short-term products, but you will be penalised if you withdraw
money early. With pensioners' bonds, you must give 60 days' notice of
withdrawal; during this period, you get no interest. Insurance companies
have similar penalties. While rarely disclosed and virtually impossible to
calculate, they are likely to be punitive.
Tax status
This is a crucial factor. The income from pensioners' bonds is paid gross
but the income from the insurance guaranteed bonds is deemed to be paid net
of basic-rate tax. In theory, this should make the former a clear winner for
non-taxpayers, but the slightly higher income available on the insurance
bonds can offset this tax advantage. Depending on rates at the time,
non-taxpayers should consider both products.
Pensioners' bonds are not attractive for taxpayers, who should choose
insurance bonds if rates are good.
Income level
Rates for pensioners' bonds do not change often and the income level is the
same for any investment between Pounds 500 and Pounds 20,000. Insurance bond
rates change frequently and also vary according to the provider, the term
and the amount invested. The top rate of 8 per cent net quoted in the
fact-file applies to five-year terms where the investment is Pounds 10,000
or more.
Tips from the experts
Michael Bryant, marketing director of Rathbone Brothers, a private client
banking and asset management group, was particularly concerned about the
erosion of the underlying capital associated with these products, and the
gamble on interest rates.
'Investors could be better off shopping around for the best building society
rates and sticking to a maximum notice period of one month,' he said.
'Guaranteed income bonds are sensible only if you have fixed income and
known capital liabilities. Very few people are in this position.'
Andrew Jones, a partner with The David Aaron Partnership, an independent
adviser, added: 'With these guaranteed products the investor and his adviser
have to make a decision based on future interest rate movements.
'We believe the 8 per cent now offered by the insurance guaranteed income
bonds represents good value.
'But if you think a Labour government will be elected in two years and that
interest rates will rise, you might decide to keep your money in a
variable-rate building society account and hope to lock into better
guaranteed rates later.'

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Investing For Income): Gilt issues - best
value v tax status
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Your capital gain on a gilt - a UK government bond - is tax free.
However, you pay tax on the interest. Therefore, gilts which deliver a
higher proportion of their total return as capital gain are more tax
efficient, and - other things being equal - more attractive to higher
rate taxpayers.

interest-bearing shares

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Pibs are the closest you can get to holding ordinary shares in a
building society. They are fixed interest securities with no redemption
date - so your capital cannot be guaranteed. You can realise your
investment only by selling them on the open market - with the chance of
capital gain or loss. They provide a relatively high yield, as the table
shows. This is partly because a building society is theoretically not
obliged to pay out if doing so would drive it into loss. Also, the
market is relatively small and the shares are not always easy to buy and
sell.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Fashion: Party-time dress pointers - Witty accessories are
the key to looking good this season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to feel skittish at the beginning of the party season without the
tonic of a new dress. If you have to make do with last year's model -
probably black - accessories are the way to give it a new lease of life.
Even if you could afford a new dress, buying new accessories may be a better
investment.
A witty pair of shoes or a jewel-bright evening bag can enliven the most
sober Little Black Dress - and seldom has the choice been larger.
You could spend hundreds of pounds on an intricately-worked, hand-crafted,
silken scarf or under Pounds 10 on a chain-store bargain.
Although there are plenty of inexpensive accessories around, there is a new
generation of designers which takes the view that it is better to own one
exquisite piece that than a drawer full of workaday pieces.
Take, for instance, Catherine Avison's floral embroidered scarf, which comes
in cappuchino or powder pink - it is a fine example of delicate
craftsmanship, each flower made and embroidered by hand. Avison has just
graduated from The Royal College of Art and was immediately taken up by
Browns, of South Molton Street, London W1.
Just as finely wrought is Natasha Barrault's pleated silk Fortuny-esque bag.
Saint Laurent's scarlet corset-belt is a modern classic which not only will
lift midnight-dark monochromes but can enliven daytime tweeds.
For evening, I have always been of the opinion that if the shoes, bag and
jewellery look snappy then you can get away with the simplest backdrop.
The sauciest shoes this season come either from Valentino, in the form of
silky satin ankle boots trimmed along the cuff with impossibly frivolous
marabou feathers, or from Patrick Cox - Cruella de Vil spiky courts and
thigh-high boots in blood-red or fuschia-pink satin.
The elegant modesty of Joseph Azagury's court and bar shoes, especially his
matt satin, may also appeal.
Legs need highlighting with the sheerest black hosiery; please him with
stockings rather than tights and you by eliminating the cumbersome rigging
of suspenders in favour of lacy-topped hold-ups. The Black Rose, a stall in
Kensington Market, London, run by an Australian with ghoulish attire and
gentlemanly manners, offers a wonderful range of novelty hosiery - fishnets,
Lurex and bumble-bee stripes by Pamela Mann and Mary Quant for between
Pounds 3 and Pounds 6.
The waist and the bosom are focal points and, depending on your assets, one
or both should be emphasised.
VV Rouleaux, the trimmings shop behind Peter Jones, Sloane Square SW3,
stocks delicate black passementerie imported from Paris at around Pounds
30-Pounds 40 a metre and multi-coloured braids hung with lambent silken cord
tassels which add conversation-piece interest to any waist or throat.
Dolce e Gabbana's romantic black chiffon and silk velvet neck-tie, decorated
with faded, old, silk roses is exquisite, but at Pounds 350 perhaps not for
everyone. For those on a budget a few black roses at Pounds 1 each from The
Black Rose, or fin de siecle silk ones at about Pounds 20 each from Virginia
Antiques, would recall Odette's boudoir charms.
Wacky false eye-lashes of an Olympian excess and labelled 'Cow Lashes' are
on offer in gold or silver tinsel at Stargazer Makeup, in the basement of
Kensington Market, along with coloured wigs, ranging from a sharp,
bitumen-black Louise Brookes' bob at Pounds 33 to Anita Ekberg blonde
waist-length tresses for Pounds 65.00.
One of the most striking jewellery ranges at the moment is Odalisque, made
by an imaginative Persian woman who spent time on the north-west frontier
with the Red Cross. Collecting stones and pieces of old jewellery, she
reconstructs them into parures and tasselled beads. Colours are muted and
subtle, such as sunset mauve with eucalyptus green. Prices range from Pounds
100 to Pounds 450.00.
It is the transient nature of parties, that moment of flirtation seized and
relished, that makes them a compelling stage for performance art. The
adventurous extrovert, who is clever with a needle, could sew edible
nasturtium flowers along the neckline of her dress. A box of six can be
found at any good supermarket.
Or make a pair of fur cuffs to slick up a plain, black sweater. Simply sew a
wrist-sized piece on to a wide band of elastic and slip over the wrist.
For those modernists who favour this season's sleek transparency, Jimmy
Choo, Senso and Pied-a-Terre are all offering see-through plastic sandals,
sling-backs and mules.
There are myriad tiny handbags which echo this trend - but bear in mind that
the contents will need to be taken into serious consideration]
Baudelaire loved to chronicle what he called 'that feminine lust for
bargains' and this season adversity - if you can call not having a new dress
adversity - may inspire you to use invention, artifice and allure instead.

FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Income): How to choose the
right fund - Scheherazade Daneshkhu has some suggestions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone who wants to invest in a broad spread of equities through a unit
trust faces the basic choice of investing for 'income' or 'capital growth'.
Unit trusts are divided into different sectors by the Association of Unit
Trusts and Investment Funds - the industry's trade body - which makes it
easier for investors to find their way around the 1,500-odd unit trusts on
offer.
The UK equity income sector might seem a natural place for anyone wanting an
income to place their money. But funds within the sector are very different
and the type you choose depends on your income needs and tax position.
Q. If the funds are all in one sector, presumably they pay out similar
levels of income?
A. No. There is a good deal of variety. Some funds lay the emphasis on
'total return' to provide income and capital growth; they tend to have a
lower yield - or payout - than others which aim to deliver the highest
possible yield. Yields ranged from 1 to 9.9 per cent at the beginning of
November.
Q. I have heard that unit trust managers can charge their annual management
fees to capital instead of income. What effect does this have?
A. Until recently, these charges had to come off the 'profit' or income of
the fund and could not be deducted from the capital base, but new rules
introduced earlier this year allow income trusts to do so. (Capital growth
funds are still not allowed to charge to capital.)
Some unit trust companies including M&amp;G, the largest, are opposed to
charging to capital but others, such as Save &amp; Prosper, HSBC, Invesco,
Schroder and Credit Suisse, are already doing so on some of their funds. The
main effect is to increase the yield and, therefore, income available to the
customer.
Annual management charges tend to be in the region of 1.5 per cent, so a
unit trust with a yield of 5 per cent can, as a result of the change, post
one of 6.5 per cent without altering the composition of the fund.
In practice, unit trust companies which have bought lower-quality stocks for
their high yield, may pass on only part of this increased yield to the
customer and use the rest to buy higher-quality stocks with better capital
growth prospects.
Q. That sounds like good news, so why the opposition?
A. It is good for those seeking as much income as possible, but they should
also be aware that charging to capital can reduce the size of their capital
or constrain its future growth. The danger is that by receiving an increased
payout, investors may think they are getting something for nothing.
M&amp;G's Rachel Medill says: 'No one will be better off in total return terms
by charging to capital. You are not taking charges out of the profit but out
of the base capital, and that is what is providing the income growth.'
Taxpayers, particularly at the higher-rate, should also be careful because
they will be taxed on the 'extra' income.
Q. Can't you pay less tax by choosing to take less income?
A. This is one of the most common investor misunderstandings, according to
Ian Chimes, managing director of Credit Suisse investment funds (UK). 'They
think that if they do not take the income, they will not be taxed on it.' In
fact, it makes no difference if you take the income or choose to have it
re-invested - it will be paid to you (or re-invested) net of basic-rate tax.
Higher-rate taxpayers must pay the difference.
The exception is when the unit trust is bought within a tax-free personal
equity plan. 'The Pep allows an investor to re-invest income gross until it
is needed when distributions can be paid, again, gross,' says Mike Webb,
sales and marketing director of Prolific Unit Trust Managers. 'Many income
unit trust Peps are sold on the basis of pre-retirement planning precisely
because for this reason.'
Q. How do I re-invest income if I do not want to take it?
A. If you want to re-invest income, it is best to choose an income fund
offering accumulation as well as income units. Accumulation units
automatically invest the income generated by the fund to buy more assets,
which pushes up the price of the units.
Income units, as the name implies, pay out income at set dates. If you try
to re-invest it, the fund buys more units, so the number you hold will
increase. But Clive Boothman, managing director of Schroder Unit Trusts,
says there is a disadvantage: 'If a fund has only income units, re-investing
is perfectly possible but may incur front-end charges which are absent when
re-investment takes place in accumulation units.'
Some funds will waive the front-end charge but you might still end up paying
a bit more this way because of the spread - the difference between the
purchase and selling price - of the underlying assets. You can tell if an
income fund has accumulation units by looking at the FT's managed funds
pages. Q. I am a higher-rate taxpayer - is there a more tax-efficient way
for me to take income from unit trusts?
A. Yes. Less than 0.5 per cent of the population pays capital gains tax
while most pays income tax. Yet, you can make up to Pounds 5,800 of gains
tax-free, thanks to the annual capital gains tax allowance.
So it is a good idea to try to take income in the form of capital gain. You
cannot take returns solely as capital gain in an income unit trust because
(as described above) the pay-out is treated as income for tax purposes.
The alternative is to invest in a capital growth unit trust and to sell
units periodically to provide yourself with an income. The gains will be
tax-free, as long as you do not exceed the CGT allowance.
Some capital growth trusts have a yield. Try to avoid these because the
income will be taxed at 40 per cent (as a higher rate taxpayer), regardless
of whether it is taken or re-invested. Chimes says many higher-rate
taxpayers prefer Far East or US trusts which pay no income, for this reason.
But take care with this method - if you withdraw too much capital, the
chance for future growth will be damaged.

FT  19 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: A celebration for the great innovator - 25
years of Saint Laurent's ready-to-wear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is just over 25 years since Yves Saint Laurent opened his first
ready-to-wear boutique in London. Today, with hindsight, it seems such an
obvious thing to have done. But then it looked different.
St Laurent was the star couturier of the day, a day in which haute couture
was all. No other had deigned to submit his talents to the challenging
disciplines of ready-to-wear. A few had boutique collections, attached to
the main house, but they were heavily influenced by haute couture.
Yves Saint Laurent was the first to see that ready-to-wear required a
different approach, that it deserved a line of its own and that the right
place to sell would be a tiny shop in the rue de Tournon, a then
unfashionable venue on the left bank (hence the Rive Gauche label).
The fashion world looked in amazement as those accustomed to shopping in the
chic boulevards of the right bank crossed the river and queued to buy a
genuine Saint Laurent label for about FFr200, a fraction of the haute
couture price. But, much more importantly, Saint Laurent had discovered that
he could reach a completely new market - those who had neither the money nor
the inclination to shop in the grand couture houses.
As Marguerite Duras put it, in a foreword to a book encapsulating the work
of Saint Laurent: 'With pret-a-porter, elitism in high fashion is no longer
an issue. Yves Saint Laurent women are made in the harem, the chateau, on
the edges of cities . . . they are in the streets, the Metro, Prisunic, the
Bourse.'
The timing was perfect. Women's lives were changing. As they began to take
on jobs, to lead more active as well as busier lives, as servants
disappeared from the houses of all but the truly wealthy, they needed
clothing for this new way of living. Saint Laurent gave it to them.
He was genuinely radical, intuitively deciding that women would need clothes
that gave them authority without denigrating their sexuality. He invented
the trouser suit for women, proving himself a past master at making women
who wore them look more and not less feminine, playing on the ambiguity.
Saint Laurent defined the difference between ready-to-wear and haute couture
thus: 'Rive Gauche is for the necessities, for the needs of daily life. In
haute couture you can allow yourself to dream.'
His perception, that the necessities, the needs of daily life, were not yet
adequately or stylishly enough catered for, proved correct. It turned out to
be the pot of gold and almost every other designer of note followed suit -
fast. Today the turnover of the ready-to-wear collections is FFr280m (Pounds
33.29m) at wholesale prices, there are nearly 100 ready-to-wear boutiques,
some of which Saint Laurent owns outright, while others are franchised.
In 1969 Clare Rendlesham, who had been fashion editor of Vogue and Harpers &amp;
Queen, brought Yves Saint Laurent's ready-to-wear to London. Jacqumine
Bromage, her daughter, who runs it now, was only nine years old at the time
but she remembers clearly that her mother, who had never owned a business
before, was 'besotted with Yves Saint Laurent's clothes.
'She was convinced that British women would love them. I can still see her
in a long, denim skirt and tight lace-up boots. She wore almost nothing but
Yves Saint Laurent and when she used to weed out her wardrobe some of them
would come down to me.
'I used to go to school wearing them and I remember everybody laughing at me
as I was one of the first to wear Saint Laurent's baggy boots when everybody
else was still wearing tight ones.'
When that first boutique opened, the famously frail couturier appeared in
person - as did his perennial muse Loulou de la Falaise. Princess Margaret,
pop stars, all the fashion press and movers and shakers of the day also
turned up.
It was a poignant moment in the creative life of Saint Laurent. These were
times when hemlines were deemed of universal interest. In 1969 when, for
starters, he dropped the hemline 12in and, later, all the way to the ankle,
he had as definite an affect on the fashion business as Pompidou's
devaluation had on the money markets. The fashion press went wild but there
were doubts that the look would catch on.
Yves Saint Laurent hedged his bets. He was photographed outside the shop
with one model in a classic 1960s mini on one side and another with the
longer look on the other.
The press, it is fascinating to note, were almost universally shocked by the
prices. 'Girls buying his ready-to-wear in London will have to be loaded,'
wailed the Daily Express. 'Dream clothes, nightmare prices,' moaned the
Daily Mail. Other fashion editors pointed out helpfully that at least the
fare to Paris could now be saved. 'Rich women used to go to Paris to buy
their clothes: now they need not bother - the clothes are here.'
'One of the big problems at the time,' says David Roberts, who joined Clare
Rendlesham early on and has been there ever since, 'was persuading people to
spend Pounds 30 on a skirt. Clare did a lot of educating. She persuaded her
customers that it was more intelligent to buy better and buy less. She
herself would buy only about two outfits a season and wear them to death.'
Looking back, the clothes seem a steal. A trouser suit cost about Pounds 50,
a day suit Pounds 30 but scarves could be bought for around Pounds 10 and a
silk shirt for Pounds 15. Anyone who bought a piece then, and still owns it,
would almost certainly still be able to wear it.
All those classics - the sleek trouser suits, the 'smokings', the shiny
trench-coat raincoats, the Scarlet O'Hara corsetry, the pea coats, the
safari jackets, would look perfectly, beautifully, at home in the
contemporary wardrobe. His clothes more than anyone's capture the spirit of
our age.
The great innovator, the designer whose clothes were genuinely radical
(women, it is worth remembering, were banned from serious restaurants for
wearing his trouser suits so provocative were they deemed to be), these days
is sickened by innovation for innovation's sake. In his mature years (he is
now 58) he seeks a refinement, an updating, a perfection of the style and
the craft he has spent his life exploring.
Many of his most classic designs, for instance, have been reworked for this
season. For winter evenings he has updated 'le smoking' - one rather mannish
version, single-breasted, one-buttoned and a slightly softened one with
satin lapels and cuffs and satin flap pockets. These days his prices are not
so different from many a less distinguished label - a jacket runs at about
Pounds 795, trousers at about Pounds 240.
It would be hard to better Alexander Lieberman of Conde Nast's summing up of
the appeal of Yves Saint Laurent: 'He understood that women needed certain
clothing if they were to function in a modern world. He understands, as few
other couturiers do, the sex-appeal of women. Other couturiers clothe women
to hide their sexuality. He liberates it. Whereas the troubadours of old
wrote poems for women, he makes clothes.'
Yves Saint Laurent for women is at 137 New Bond Street, London W1 and 33
Sloane Street, London SW1. Yves Saint Laurent for men at 135 New Bond
Street, London W1 and 33 Sloane Street, London SW1.
