FT  18 NOV 94 / Management: A word in Tony's ear - Kevin Brown offers tips
on how to influence Britain's Labour party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So you want to lobby the Labour party? You are not alone. With Labour nearly
30 percentage points ahead of the Tories in most opinion polls, businessmen
have been queueing up to talk to the people many expect to form the next
government.
It was not always like that. Michael Heseltine, quick to spot an opposition
weak point, raised a big laugh only a couple of years ago by poking fun at
Labour's attempts to make business converts by dining in boardrooms - the
so-called prawn cocktail offensive.
'Never have so many crustaceans died in vain,' Heseltine told the Commons in
a hilarious skit on the campaigning efforts of the late John Smith, then
shadow chancellor, and Margaret Beckett, his deputy.
The jibe prompted Tory cheers - and not a few wry grins from Labour MPs -
because of the widespread view that any hope of cordial relations between
the party of trade unions and its class enemy was a joke.
But Labour is having the last laugh. The charm offensive launched by Smith
was continued when he replaced Neil Kinnock as leader after the 1992
election, and put into overdrive when Tony Blair took over in the summer.
Even Robin Cook, one of the more traditionally minded of Labour's leading
figures, undertook a protracted tour of Britain to consult small business -
an undertaking inevitably dubbed Labour's Cook's tour by Commons wags.
'For a long time in the 1980s Labour had very little to do with business;
frankly, they thought we had two heads, and that was what the prawn cocktail
offensive was designed to overcome,' says a senior Labour official.
'Things have changed a lot recently, partly because people now see us as
serious contenders for government, and partly because of the perception that
the party under Tony's leadership is more interested in a healthy business
sector.'
Roland Wales, director of policy development at Labour's London
headquarters, says the party welcomes the increasing number of approaches
from business because 'it is in our interests for our policies to be well
thought out'.
But it is important to go about it in the right way. So here are some tips
for those who spent the 1980s ignoring the people's party but now want to
make their voice heard.
Don't bother with lobbying companies. Kinnock's office had an iron rule of
never dealing with them. Blair's Labour party is more flexible, but the
lobbyists will probably be wasting your time and money.
Senior officials say that most businessmen will probably be given
lower-level access through a lobbyist than through a direct approach. But
consultants can be useful to businessmen who don't know how the party works.
Charles Clarke, who worked for Kinnock and now runs Quality Public Affairs
in London, advises clients seeking to influence Labour to steer well clear
of the mushrooming lobbying industry. 'A lot of people are fobbed off by
lobbyists with cocktail party contacts, which are usually a waste of time.
You have to make your case, and you have to make sure you are making it to
the right people,' he says.
Don't make unsolicited personal approaches, especially to people's homes.
'Once or twice we have had people who come to the front door and demand to
see us, which is not a terribly helpful way to go about it,' says Wales.
Never offer inducements (although a slap-up meal will not be refused).
Labour frontbenchers and officials believe they have the government on the
run in the sleaze battle. They want to be in government too much to risk
doing anything questionable, even if they are tempted.
Do remember that there are several ways of influencing policy development.
For most companies, the best will be via the party headquarters policy unit
or the shadow minister who speaks for Labour on your subject.
But Labour also has a standing Industry Forum specifically designed to
foster contacts with business. And there are usually a number of
consultation exercises going on - the current crop includes health, the
economy and crime.
Do make your initial contact in writing. Labour is short of resources, so
don't expect a lengthy reply, but shadow ministers and officials say they
respond to all their letters eventually - and they will meet you if you have
something worthwhile to say.
Do make sure you have worked out clearly what your concerns are, and that
your arguments are cogently explained. Many business people apparently think
their views are self-evidently correct, especially if they usually talk only
to Tories.
Do identify carefully who you need to talk to. Remember that each shadow
minister has a team of front-bench MPs to assist him or her. Sometimes you
can make your point better by not going to the top.
Do remember that officials can be useful points of contact, too. Access to
Blair is tightly controlled, for example, but you might have more luck with
David Miliband, the leader's young and imaginative head of policy.
There are also some very influential MPs in apparently junior positions.
Formally, for example, Peter Mandelson, the MP for Hartlepool, is a mere
junior whip. But he is also an intimate confidant of Blair, with far more
influence than most members of the shadow cabinet.
Do remember the regional approach. If you are based in Scotland, try
approaching George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary; from Wales try Ron
Davies, shadow Welsh secretary; from Northern Ireland try Mo Mowlam, shadow
Ulster secretary. London has its own shadow cabinet spokesman - Frank
Dobson, who also handles transport.
And finally, do make sure that a senior executive makes the approach.
Socialists are like everyone else, they like to have their egos massaged.

FT  18 NOV 94 / People: Priddle to monitor the West's energy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Priddle, head of corporate and consumer affairs at the Department of
Trade and Industry, was yesterday elected executive director of the
International Energy Agency, the West's energy monitoring body. Priddle has
been elected for a four-year term to the Paris-based organisation as
successor to Helga Steeg, who had held the post for 10 years.
Priddle's election comes as the 23-member organisation is in the middle of
re-defining the agency's role in an economic and political climate which has
changed considerably since it was set up after the 1973 oil crisis. 'The
energy market is much more diverse and the political situation much less
confrontational,' Priddle says.
The IEA was set up to monitor security of energy supplies and share fuel at
times of crisis. But Priddle says it must now work much more closely with
the international markets for oil.
The IEA must also concentrate on other aspects of energy security such as
environmental measures. 'Unless energy producers and users are properly
sensitive to environmental damage, the security of energy supply may be
called into question,' he says.
The agency will also need to develop its relationship with non-OECD
countries in future as the dominance of the OECD in the oil market has
diminished, he believes.

FT  18 NOV 94 / People: Supervisory role for Sir Dennis at the Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England has achieved a notable catch with the appointment of Sir
Dennis Weatherstone, the retiring chairman of the US bank JP Morgan, as an
independent member of the Bank's board of banking supervision.
Sir Dennis will succeed Sir Peter Leslie, the former deputy chairman of
Midland Bank, and serve for a five-year term. The board is responsible for
overseeing the work of the Bank's supervisors in its financial stability
wing.
Sir Dennis, who has taken an interest in supervisory issues relating to
financial derivatives in his work with the Group of Thirty senior banking
executives, will be the best known of the six independent members of the
board.
The Bank yesterday made no secret of its delight at having attracted Sir
Dennis to the board. Figures of equal weight, such as Sir David Scholey of
SG Warburg, tend to sit on the Bank's governing Court rather than its
supervision board.
Sir Dennis, who will be 64 on his retirement from the helm of JP Morgan at
the end of the year, has become a notable figure in the international debate
on derivatives, leading calls for banks to self-regulate their activities.
At the monthly meetings of the banking supervision board, he will have
access to all supervisory reports on UK banks, as well as being able to quiz
Brian Quinn, executive director for financial stability, on the department's
work.
The bank's supervisory department has been overhauled since being criticised
over its handling of the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, and several new senior officers have been brought in.
Sir Dennis was thought to be a possible candidate to become governor of the
Bank when Eddie George was appointed. Lord Swaythling, whose term on the
board expires at the end of the year, has been appointed for a further
five-year term.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL POWER yesterday announced the first of what will be a growing list
of board changes as the bulk of its executive directors move towards
retirement.
Keith Henry has been appointed chief executive of the electricity generation
company. He is chief executive and a long-time employee of Brown &amp; Root, the
US-owned engineering, project management and construction group, and will
fill the vacuum left by John Baker's appointment as chairman when Sir Trevor
Holdsworth retires next April after five years in the position.
National Power had little choice but to recruit externally for the job of
chief executive, since three of its five executive directors will retire
within the next 18 months. Only the finance director, Brian Birkenhead, and
the managing director of its international business development operations,
Graham Hadley, will remain.
John Baker's switch to non-executive chairman will leave him more time to
devote to other directorships and to his new post of chairman of the World
Energy Council. He will play a strategic role and devote two days a week to
National Power.
His replacement is an experienced civil engineer. He landed the top job at
Brown &amp; Root in 1990, taking responsibility for the group's operations in
the UK, Europe, Africa and the former Soviet Union. He has worked for the
group for 23 years.
The company has also announced that non-executive director Sir David Walker
would stand down as a result of his move to become chairman of Morgan
Stanley in Europe.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Property: Signs of life on the sites - Activity is picking
up but financing remains a problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chill wind of recession sent property developers into hibernation, and
the warm glow of recovery has brought them blinking back into the light.
Land Securities, the largest quoted UK property company, this week announced
that it was gearing up its development programme. It plans to spend Pounds
350m over the next two to three years, its biggest burst of development
activity since the late 1980s.
Smaller developers are also starting to stir, including some notable figures
from the past. Mr Godfrey Bradman, former chairman of Rosehaugh and one of
the biggest casualties of the bust, is now operating from offices
overlooking Regent's Park.
Yet the development climate is hardly balmy. As the graph shows, planning
permission has been granted for an additional 13.6m sq ft (1.26m sq m) of
office space within the City of London. Of this, more than 7m sq ft (630,000
sq m) covers sites which are currently empty and waiting for work to start.
Yet during the first six months of this year construction started on only
1.7m sq ft, only a shade more than in the same period of last year.
The reason for the modest pace of activity is that rents are too low and
property yields too high to give developers a clear profit.
For example, with top City rents at Pounds 35 per sq ft and new office
developments being sold forward to investment institutions on yields of 6.5
per cent, a 30,000 sq ft development might have a finished capital value of
about Pounds 15.5m.
Yet building 30,000 sq ft of office space for much less is difficult, unless
the developer has bought the site cheaply.
The following hypothetical example assumes that the developer has paid about
Pounds 175 per sq ft for the site. This is not unreasonable, given that one
core City site is rumoured to have changed hands for Pounds 250 per sq ft
last week.
Land cost: Pounds 175 per sq ft + building costs: Pounds 130 per sq ft +
professional fees: Pounds 25 per sq ft x 30,000 sq ft = Pounds 10m capital
value.
So far so good, except that the developer needs to finance the project.
Awareness of the risks and uncertainty about the outlook mean that banks are
extremely wary of financing speculative developments.
'There is only a handful of banks willing to look at speculative development
projects and they are understandably discreet about it,' said Mr Peter
Champness, partner at surveyors Gerald Eve.
Only big property companies such as Land Securities can attract sufficient
bank loans to finance large speculative development programmes. Smaller
developers are forced to rely on investment institutions such as pension
funds and life insurance companies.
Small, independent developers also recognise that speculative projects
financed with bank debt expose them to very high risks. At this early stage
of recovery, most would anyway prefer to share the risks with an
institutional partner. Under this type of funding arrangement, the developer
usually agrees to sell the finished building to the institution at an agreed
yield. If the property market weakens during construction, it is the
institution rather than the developer which suffers.
The pay-off is that the institution gets the building at a higher yield than
it could be sold for on the open market. Our hypothetical City office block
could probably be sold for 5.5 per cent on the open market, yet the
institution is paying 6.5 per cent as part of the funding agreement.
The details of an institutional funding package could be complex. But if the
developer arranges finance over a four-year period at, say, 2 percentage
points over base interest rates, an all-in funding cost of about Pounds
3m-Pounds 3.5m would be about right.
It is also likely that the developer will have to contribute to fitting-out
costs for the tenant, in which case another Pounds 1m will have to be set
aside.
In total, the hypothetical office block has cost the developer Pounds 14.5m
to build and fit-out. Since the institution is getting the finished building
cheaply, this leaves a development profit of less than Pounds 1m, or about 5
per cent of the capital value.
Such calculations explain why development activity is still muted. Either
rents need to rise or property yields need to fall before many projects
become viable.
Moreover, institutional appetite for development finance is limited. Even
large pension funds cannot afford to have more than a few speculative
schemes in hand at any one time. Smaller funds are often wary of getting
involved with development activity at all.
One reason is that fund managers have historically seen poor returns from
development. Figures from the Investment Property Databank, a research
group, show that development activity has been a drag on the performance of
institutional investors in 14 out of the past 19 years. Only in the period
from 1983-87 did development actually enhance investment returns from
commercial property.
Unless this changes, the flow of institutional development funding will be
steady rather than spectacular. Fund managers are also likely to demand good
terms from developers, which will keep development margins under pressure.
Much therefore depends on whether banks start funding speculative
development projects again and whether the developers themselves feel
confident enough about the outlook to proceed without an institutional
partner.
In the current climate, with little sign of rental growth and uncertainty
about the economic prospects, the banks have no reason to rush back into the
market.
Developers point out that the debt-financed development peak of the late
1980s was unusual. Previous property cycles were funded by institutional
investors rather than banks. The extent of over-building was far less severe
as a result.
While the pace of development activity is sure to pick up as rents rise and
more projects become viable, there are signs that developers will have to
rely far more on institutional finance. If that holds back the pace of
development until tenants are ready to fill the space, the property market
will be healthier for all concerned.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Budget 1994: Personal finance banks on tweaks to the system
 -How the Budget might affect savers and investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Savers and investors have had little joy from recent Budgets and will be
hoping for some this year when Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, stands up
on November 29. But few insiders expect personal finance to be in the
spotlight this time. Most anticipate little more than tinkering, though no
one rules out surprises.
One problem the chancellor may wish to minimise is the threat of an outflow
from building societies when Tessas - tax exempt special savings accounts -
mature. These five-year deposit accounts were the brainchild of Mr John
Major, the prime minister, when he was chancellor, and interest on them is
tax-free on a maximum investment of Pounds 9,000.
More than Pounds 21bn is invested in Tessas, of which about Pounds 15bn will
mature at the beginning of 1996. Rules state savers can only reinvest Pounds
3,000 in a new Tessa in the first year.
Competition in the retail savings market has been fierce in recent years,
and building societies, which hold two-thirds of Tessa money, are concerned
that equities are being given an unfair tax advantage through the existence
of tax-free Peps. These allow an annual Pounds 6,000 to be invested in a
general plan - with a further Pounds 3,000 in a single company plan.
Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies Association,
said: 'There is no reason why the government should give greater tax
incentives to invest in equities rather than deposits. We are calling for
level playing fields.'
One possibility is to postpone the problem by extending the life of Tessas
to perhaps seven years. A more radical move would be to shake up the entire
industry by giving savers and investors a single, tax-free allowance to be
divided as they wish between deposit and equity-based investments.
A married couple could have sheltered more than Pounds 100,000 of shares in
Peps since they first began in 1987. They have proved so popular that fears
abound that a cap could be put on the total amount which can be invested.
Yet Mr Nick Nichols, secretary-general of Pepma, the Pep managers
association, doubts the industry is in for a shock. 'I do not want to seem
complacent but I do not think there will be any drastic measures. We are too
entrenched an industry.'
He believes there may be some tinkering aimed at using Peps to encourage the
flow of money through industry, possibly with measures such as allowing
investment trusts, which invest in unlisted securities, to be eligible for a
Pep.
Mr Philip Warland, director-general of the Association of Unit Trusts and
Investment Funds, also doubts the chancellor will wish to target Peps for
adverse treatment and hopes to see their parameters widened to include
bonds.
Mr Ernest Fenton, director-general of the Association of Investment Trust
Companies, said his main request to the chancellor was for a change in Pep
rules to allow investment trusts to qualify for the single company Pep
allowance.
'Investment trust companies are the only type of company that does not
qualify for single company Peps, which seems to us rather odd,' he said.
At present, the whole Pounds 6,000 general Pep allowance can be used to
shelter investments in collective schemes, such as investment and unit
trusts. But the Pounds 3,000 single company Pep allowance can only be used
to buy shares in any quoted company except investment trusts, which are also
quoted on the London Stock Exchange. The association argues that investing
in single companies is a high-risk activity unsuitable for many private
investors, so they should be encouraged to choose lower risk collective
funds.
The association has also lobbied the chancellor to change the rules slightly
so that more venture capital investment trusts qualify for Peps. A recent
rule change, which said at least half a fund's assets should be in ordinary
shares, was meant to block trusts investing in gilts and bonds. But it had
the side effect of disqualifying many venture capital trusts, which often
have substantial holdings in preference shares.
Getting rid of this anomaly would also prevent existing venture capital
trusts from being disadvantaged in tax terms when the new-style venture
capital trusts - which are intended to focus on the smallest start-up
companies - appear next year.
According to brief details in last year's Budget, these new capital trusts
will automatically have tax-free status comparable to Peps. This year's
Budget may also introduce some additional tax relief for them, possibly in
the form of roll-over relief on capital gains from other investments.
The pensions industry is the subject of a pensions bill - expected next
month - which will deal with equalisation of the pension age, and changes to
occupational pensions law as recommended by the Goode committee. Further
wide-ranging measures are not therefore expected in the Budget, and even the
fear that pensions may lose some tax benefits have not surfaced as
prominently as in previous years.
Instead, the chancellor is expected to bring forward a measure due to be
implemented in 1997, giving holders of personal pensions the flexibility to
delay purchase of an annuity until the age of 75, instead of immediately on
retirement.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Sports Council forced to change managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the principal organisations set to receive funds from the National
Lottery has been forced to carry out extensive management changes following
a damning report into its operations by Whitehall's accountancy watchdog.
The Sports Council, which is responsible for promoting sporting activity in
the UK, has made the changes after a claim by the National Audit Office that
senior executives were involved in business relationships that were
incompatible with their official duties.
The audit office said in a confidential memorandum last month that 'real
conflicts of interest' had arisen in the Sports Council's relations with a
company called Sportspartner, which acted as its trading arm and ran
managerial contracts for national sports centres.
The memorandum, sent to members of the Commons public accounts committee,
reinforced a report earlier this year in which the organisation was
criticised for poor administration of public funds.
The Sports Council, whose parent body is the Department of National
Heritage, said yesterday that urgent action had been taken to meet the NAO's
criticisms following the appointment of a new chairman and vice-chairman.
In particular, the conflicts of interest relating to Sportspartner were
resolved last week, when it was decided that the company would be wound up
by March next year. The council said that Mr Ian Johnson, the former
director of finance, had stood down as director of the company in the
meantime.
The council said: 'We are confident that there are now no transactions
occuring that the NAO could take exception to. All the people who were
referred to in the initial NAO report have retired or resigned.'
It is understood that the Sports Council has received a copy of the NAO's
latest memorandum, but officials refused to discuss it yesterday. The
organisation will be sending a memorandum to the public accounts committee
detailing efforts to achieve transparency of financial flows and avoidance
of conflicts of interest.
A number of MPs said yesterday that the organisation, which expects to
receive about Pounds 1.6bn from the National Lottery in the next five years,
could be censured by the committee, which is due to publish its report early
next year.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Clarke likely to continue widening 20% tax band
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In recent years Conservative chancellors have established a pattern of
measures for personal taxation, many of which are expected to continue after
the Budget later this month.
The 20 per cent lower rate of income tax, introduced in the March 1992
Budget, has been gradually extended from the first Pounds 2,000 of income to
Pounds 3,000. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is expected to continue
widening the band - if he is feeling generous it may advance by more than
the Pounds 500 in the past two budgets.
Some allowances and reliefs have been left to wither and are not expected to
be revived. These include the married couple's allowance, frozen for many
years at Pounds 1,720 for those under 65 and further weakened by its
restriction to tax relief at 20 per cent this year and to 15 per cent from
April next year. The allowance has been increased for those over the age of
65 and it remains to be seen whether the chancellor regards this as an
anomaly worth tackling.
Mortgage interest relief is also expected to continue to be restricted,
unless the chancellor is persuaded that it would deal too heavy a blow to a
lacklustre housing market - or seeks to balance it with a sweetener.
A thaw is expected for personal allowances, frozen since 1992. Mr Richard
Law, tax partner at accountants Ernst &amp; Young, said: 'There is a belief that
some of the real pressure is off the chancellor, giving him scope to deliver
a positive message by increasing allowances.'
The threshold for capital gains tax and inheritance tax, unchanged in the
last Budget, may be increased this time. Accountants Price Waterhouse
believe Mr Clarke may declare 'cashback' offers on mortgages and cars exempt
from capital gains tax - a small but populist measure. If he is feeling bold
he could decide to simplify capital gains tax with measures ranging from
abolishing indexation to eliminating the tax altogether.
Other expected measures are details on closing National Insurance
contribution loopholes, to which Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary,
alluded last month, and greater movement towards self-assessment of personal
tax.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Thatcher takes up arms of war
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Baroness Thatcher's coat of arms, with the Falklands war a central theme,
was unveiled yesterday.
The former prime minister is said to be delighted with the creation by Sir
Colin Cole, the retired Garter King of Arms. Sir Colin said it symbolised
Lady Thatcher's 'sentiments, career and achievements'.
The Falklands victory is depicted by the figure of an admiral on active
service. A representation of Sir Isaac Newton, who came from the the same
area as Lady Thatcher - Grantham, Lincolnshire - symbolises her abiding
interest in science.
The motto 'Cherish Freedom' was chosen by Lady Thatcher as being 'short and
appropriate'. The coronet with four pearls is the traditional heraldic
symbol for a baron or baroness. The lions, representing patriotism, are
supporting a double key, which alludes to the double office of prime
minister and First Lord of the Treasury. The tower and portcullis represent
the Palace of Westminster and the cross beneath, the Order of Merit.

The chancellor should increase incentives for investment in the Budget, says
a survey of businesses by Barclays Mercantile, Philip Coggan writes.
Businesses were asked to pick the three measures they most wanted to see in
the Budget. The most popular response, picked by 56 per cent of those
surveyed, was higher first year capital allowances for investment. Nearly 47
per cent wanted to see a reduction in National Insurance contributions,
while 34 per cent wanted to see a cut, or at least stability, in interest
rates.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Lloyd's may lift offer to Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London last night revealed that it may have a proposal for a
fresh settlement offer to loss-making members who are suing agents
represented at the insurance market for billions of pounds in damages, Ralph
Atkins writes.
Executives at Lloyd's suggested discussions between action groups
representing Names, individuals whose assets have traditional supported the
insurance market, and Lloyd's members and managing agencies may have reached
a point where a new attempt at a deal - possibly worth Pounds 1bn or more -
was conceivable.
An outline plan could be considered when Lloyd's ruling council meets on
December 7, raising the prospect of resolving the bitter disputes which have
plagued the insurance market since the early 1990s.
The market confirmed that any proposed out-of-court settlement would have to
be approved by both the Names action groups and the defendants in the many
court cases pending - by no means a certainty.
The 'errors and omissions' insurers who provided cover for many Lloyd's
agencies against negligence claims have been reluctant to disclose how much
may be available to fund any settlement, but in a possibly crucial step, a
High Court judge earlier this week ordered full disclosure of E&amp;O cover,
estimated to be up to Pounds 1bn.
Names action groups would also have to be persuaded that a settlement
offered comparable returns to pursuing legal action. In February, Names
rejected an earlier attempt at an out-of-court deal that was worth Pounds
900m, and it is unclear whether a new deal could exceed that total unless
Lloyd's agreed to make a significant central contribution.
In October Names in the Gooda Walker Action Group won damages they estimated
at Pounds 504m, though a final total has not yet been agreed.
Lloyd's said it was no secret that it has been maintaining a dialogue
between action groups and those members and managing agencies and their
insurers who might provide some recompence for court judgments.
Meanwhile, many Lloyd's members being pursued by the insurance market's
financial recovery department are either disputing or unaware of their
obligations, statistics released yesterday suggested.
Lloyd's said the department's strategy of trying to enter into a dialogue
with lossmaking Names was working. But more than 330 out of 1,300 who had
responded by earlier this month, either disputed or did not recognise the
figures supplied. More than 100 rejected liability.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Surge shown in holidays abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Travel agents' sales of overseas summer holidays rose 24 per cent this year
to 9.8m, far exceeding the previous record of 8m set in 1987.
The increase was greater than predicted by the travel industry, which had
been expecting sales of summer 1994 holidays to be between 10 per cent and
15 per cent higher than last year.
Lunn Poly, the biggest travel retailer, said the rise was stimulated by
agents' discounts and increasing consumer confidence. The sales growth was
achieved in spite of tax increases earlier in the year and a warm UK summer.
Mr Richard Bowden-Doyle, Lunn Poly's marketing director, said that by the
end of last month summer 1995 sales had increased 15 per cent compared with
the same period last year. Lunn Poly dismissed the view of some of its
competitors that sales for summer 1995 had been disappointing.
The average price of a 1994 summer holiday through Lunn Poly was Pounds
345.28, a Pounds 2 fall from 1993. The top-spending region was north London,
with an average Pounds 384.84, followed by north Scotland, with an average
Pounds 370.54.
Spain was the top-selling summer 1994 destination, accounting for 43 per
cent of sales, compared with 38 per cent last year. Greece was the second
most popular destination with a 17 per cent share.
Cyprus, the US, Portugal and Turkey accounted for 5 per cent each. Sales to
Turkey suffered before the end of June as a result of terrorist activity
there, but recovered later.
Florida was the most popular long-haul destination, with 35 per cent of
long-haul holidays sold. This was down from 46 per cent, largely because of
attacks on tourists.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Smaller retailers 'being squeezed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intense competition among high street stores is squeezing smaller retailers
particularly hard, the British Chambers of Commerce warned yesterday.
With consumers still cost conscious, price discounting among bigger stores
has become a key issue in retailing this autumn.
That message was reinforced by Central Statistical Office figures issued
yesterday which showed that the volume of retail sales had risen by a
seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent in October compared with September, and by
3.1 per cent in the year to October.
The value of retail sales rose 3.5 per cent in the year to October,
highlighting the low level of inflationary pressure in the high street.
Mr Richard Brown, deputy director of the chambers, warned that this pattern
was squeezing smaller businesses. He said: 'We remain concerned that small
retailers are losing the fight for survival through the 'discount culture'.'
Meanwhile, the CSO said that in the third quarter of this year the value of
sales made by businesses with a 1990 turnover of more than Pounds 3m was 6
per cent above those in the same period a year ago. The value of smaller
retailers' sales was 1 per cent lower.
In food retailing big retailers increased their sales by 8 per cent during
this period. Small food retailers saw their sales fall by 2 per cent.
This divergence is greater than last year's. Last year big food retailers
increased their business by 7 per cent compared with 1992, while small food
retailers saw business shrink by 1 per cent.
Some economists believe that the fact that big food retailers may be gaining
market share could be distorting the figures, since big retailers may be
over-represented in the statistics. This is disputed by the CSO.
Nevertheless, yesterday's figures showed food retailers' sales volumes grew
0.2 per cent in October compared with September. In the three months to
October food retailers' sales volumes rose 1 per cent compared with the
previous three months.
The volume of sales by non-food retailers was unchanged, both on the month
and in the three months to October compared with the previous three months.
Clothing and footwear sales fell 0.8 per cent in October compared with
September. The British Retail Consortium said that this was because warm
weather at the end of October depressed the sale of winter clothes.
Sales of household goods grew 0.2 per cent in the month. Sales by other
non-food retailers rose slightly in the month, although they dropped 1.5 per
cent in the three months to October compared with the previous three months.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Disqualification cases rise by 55%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Disqualification proceedings against company directors are running at 55 per
cent more than at the same time last year, says the insolvency service of
the Department of Trade and Industry.
The increase reflects the service's response to a report from the Commons
public accounts committee that more cases of unfit conduct should be pursued
by the agency.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Vocational training project launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General vocational quali-fications for 14-year-olds will be piloted in
English and Welsh schools next year, with an assessment system which has
been radically altered in response to attacks from inspectors.
Schools already experienced in vocational education have been asked to
tender for pilot courses in three subjects - business and finance, health
and social care, and manufacturing - from September next year.
Ministers want to pilot more courses in 1996 including leisure and tourism,
art and design and science. They also want to expand to include schools with
little experience of teaching vocational courses. If all goes well, the
courses, to be known as General National Vocational Qualification (GNVQ)
Part Ones, will be offered to all secondary schools from September 1998.
Each GNVQ will be equal to two GCSEs.
The education and employment departments have worked jointly on the
syllabuses for the new courses, following proposals made in January by Sir
Ron Dearing, the chief government curriculum adviser.
Sir Ron attacked claims that vocational qualifications would be viewed as
second-rate. He said: 'I think that's a traditional view and it's a national
tragedy. We've suffered grievously from that value structure, and our
competitors have not.' He said the new courses would be attractive to the
most academically able pupils.
The system for assessing the qualifications has been overhauled after
criticism from Ofsted - the government's education inspectorate - of last
year's pilot scheme for GNVQs for sixth-formers.
The inspectors said GNVQs needed tougher external checks. The qualifications
made insufficient attempts to grade students and merely checked whether
students had achieved a basic competence.
Under the new arrangements for GNVQ Part Ones, students must prove their
competence by gaining at least 70 per cent in multiple choice 'mastery
tests'. These can be taken at three times during the year, and are included
at the request of employers.
Students must also produce a portfolio of work to show that they have
satisfied various performance criteria. In practice this will require
extensive work experience with local employers. They cannot, however, win
'merit' or 'distinction' marks without taking further external extension
tests, designed to assess the depth of their knowledge.
Controlled assignments have been added to GNVQs for the first time. Pupils
must undertake tasks set by the bodies awarding the qualifications, under
the supervision of a teacher. They will be marked by both the teacher and
the awarding body's assessors.
Ofsted said these developments answered its criticisms on standards and
external checks. Both innovations are likely to be adopted for advanced
GNVQs if the pilot is successful.
Students will be barred from passing their GNVQ if their coursework for
academic GCSEs does not demonstrate mastery of the core skills of literacy,
numeracy and use of information technology.
The Confederation of British Industry welcomed the proposals, saying they
had the potential to 'transform the learning of young people'. It said that
teaching staff in the pilot schools should receive extra training, and that
they should have established links with employers.
Teachers' unions welcomed the initiative, but insisted that they should be
properly resourced with 'appropriate in-service training'.
Labour was more guarded. Mr David Blunkett, shadow education secretary,
said: 'There is a very real danger that we will end up with a two-tier
qualification system if we don't ensure that GNVQs are seen alongside GCSEs
as of potentially equal esteem.'

FT  18 NOV 94 / Queen's awards to colleges announced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday announced that 21 colleges and universities had
been honoured in the first Queen's Anniversary Prizes for Higher and Further
Education.
The awards, similar to those for export and technology, will be awarded
every two years to educational initiatives which involve outstanding service
to local businesses and to the community.
Winners ranged from the University of Oxford, which won for its new
programme designed to help companies exploit its intellectual property using
spin-off companies and its Innovation Society, to City &amp; Islington College
in London, which has developed schemes to improve access to higher education
for inner city and ethnic minority students.
Heriot-Watt University, in Edinburgh, was awarded a prize for developing
international academic-industrial partnerships in petroleum engineering.
Loughborough University of Technology was recognised for a similar programme
involving aerospace industries. Luton Sixth Form College won an award for
pioneering work using student volunteers to lead workshops on Aids and HIV.

FT  18 NOV 94 / CrossRail team plans to split from partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CrossRail, the Pounds 2bn project for an east-west main line rail link
beneath London, is to establish itself as a separate company with a chief
executive recrui-ted from the private sector.
The CrossRail scheme is a joint venture between British Rail, London
Transport and Railtrack. Its three promoters are keen to see it become
independent.
According to Mr Geoff Maynard, BR director of London rail development, this
would make it easier to bring in private sector partners and would allow
managers to focus their energies on the project. At present CrossRail has to
compete with other projects being pursued by BR, London Transport and
Railtrack.
The CrossRail team is working on plans to revive the project by means of the
Transport and Works Act, an alternative to the private bill procedure under
which the scheme was rejected by parliament in May. A private bill committee
of four MPs objected to it on the grounds that traffic estimates made in the
late 1980s were no longer relevant and that the project was not sufficiently
integrated into other rail lines.
A draft order seeking powers under the act will be put to parliament next
May.
The Transport and Works Act procedure being followed will allow detailed
objections to be dealt with at a public enquiry rather than in parliament.
It would also allow construction work to start in early to mid-1997 for
completion in about 2002.
Mr Maynard said headhunters had been recruited to find a chief executive for
the project, It was likely he or she would come from the private sector. The
appointment would be made early next year.
It would be up to the chief executive to decide on the body set up to take
over the project, but it is likely initially to be a company with the three
original promoters as shareholders. Private sector shareholders could be
brought in later.
Some private sector companies in the engineering and construction field have
criticised the CrossRail project as over-ambitious and expensive. They have
proposed a simpler scheme which involves upgrading existing underground
lines.
Mr Maynard said private sector partners would be expected to co-operate in
building a system to carry main line trains under London 'and not just
tinker with the Underground network'.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Forecast brightens engineering sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong growth in exports - especially to recovering markets in western
Europe - and revived investment spending by UK industry will boost
engineering output by 4 per cent next year, the Engineering Employers
Federation said yesterday.
The federation says in its half-yearly trends survey that employment in the
sector, which has fallen by 400,000 since 1990, will stabilise - dropping
only another 18,000 to 1.66m by the end of next year.
The upbeat forecast underlines the better prospects for the engineering
sector after the recession, but Mr Ian Thompson, the federation's economics
adviser, cautioned against euphoria.
Overall, the engineering sector's sales will exceed Pounds 140bn this year,
but even by the end of next year its output will be no higher in real terms
than it was in 1990.
By the end of next year only two sectors of the industry - electrical and
instrument engineering and automotive - will be producing at a higher rate
than in 1990. Mechanical engineering, metal goods and aerospace output will
still be substantially below 1990 levels.
The federation says cyclical revival of investment spending is boosting UK
demand for engineering products, but from a low level. It still wants
changes in capital allowances to ensure that the next 'investment recession'
is not as deep as the last downturn.
Meanwhile, the recovery of European markets from recession is an important
development for the sector and for the UK economy as a whole.
Western Europe already accounts for 60 per cent of UK engineering exports,
and the proportion could rise next year. Mr Thompson believes the upturn
will prevent the Pounds 6bn trade deficit in engineering goods from
worsening - although the federation continues to believe the deficit is not
a good thing in the long term.
He said the fall in employment had almost bottomed out. Small and
medium-sized companies were increasing employment of engineers and skilled
shop-floor workers, but big firms continued to cut back.
The federation says overall output has increased 'exceptionally rapidly'
this year, paced by a sharp expansion in the electronics and computers
sector. There has also been growth in other electrical and instrument
engineering sectors, in mechanical engineering and in the automotive sector.
The federation predicts slightly slower growth overall, next year, but with
more even balance between the main sectors.
Its growth forecasts for the 12 months to the fourth quarter of next year
are:
Electronics and computers, up 7 per cent.
Other electrical and instrument engineering, up 4 per cent.
Mechanical engineering, up 4 per cent.
Motor vehicles and parts, up 6 per cent.
Metal goods, up 2 per cent.
Aerospace equipment, nil.
The strong growth in electrical and instrument engineering underlines the
long-term structural shift in the composition of UK engineering in the past
15 years.
Next year, for the first time, the electrical sector will account for a
bigger share of engineering output than mechanical engineering and metal
goods combined.

FT  18 NOV 94 / GDP statisticians aim at a 'moving target'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial markets will pay particularly close attention to today's third
quarter gross domestic product figures. With the City on tenterhooks about a
possible interest rate rise, any upwards revision to the preliminary
estimate published this month could create a stir.
But the reaction from economists may be more sceptical. In spite of the
attention paid to GDP, many economists suspect the data are one of the more
ambiguous elements of the statistical series.
Part of the problem is that calculating GDP requires a huge pool of data on
output, expenditure and income. Since this data arrives at different times,
new data can prompt revisions, not least because the three methods the
Central Statistical Office can use to calculate GDP rarely result in the
same figure.
The CSO points out that these revisions have fallen in the past four years.
It recently set itself a target to keep revisions in annual GDP data below
0.4 per cent. Some observers believe the data still understate the recovery.
Mr Andrew Cates of brokers UBS points out that annual GDP data have been
revised upwards on average by 0.5 per cent over the past 25 years.
But the second difficulty dogging the statisticians is the speed of economic
change.
As Mr Doug McWilliams, head of the centre for economics and business
research, said: 'The CSO is chasing a moving target. The economy is
restructuring so fast it is hard to pick up these shifts.'
The issue revolves around 'weightings'. The CSO calculates the relative
weight of sectors in the economy every five years. The weighting given to
the oil and gas sector, for example, fell from about 60 parts per 1,000 in
1985 to 21 parts in 1990, following the decline in the North Sea sector in
the late 1980s.
But since this rebasing occurs only every five years, changes in the
performance of sectors within this period are not reflected.
A big question mark hangs over rapidly changing sectors such as financial
services and electronics. With the computer sector having increased turnover
by 50 per cent in the past year, according to the Engineering Employers
Federation, observers such as Mr McWilliams suspect a five-year rebasing is
too clumsy to reflect these shifts.
The CSO itself argues that any discrepancies from this are small.
Nevertheless alternative systems of updating are being considered, not least
because other approaches are being developed elsewhere. The Danish
government has introduced a continual rebasing method into its data.
CSO officials fear that introducing this would be costly, could lead to less
accuracy in the actual rebasing used, and provide an additional statistical
burden for businesses.
Faced with these problems most observers, such as Ms Kate Barker, chief
economist at the Confederation of British Industry, simply take the data
with a pinch of salt.
She said: 'I am not sure it is worse now than before. But the general point
is that financial markets sometimes get too excited about figures, as if
they represented reality - which of course they don't'

FT  18 NOV 94 / Pensions body wants saving to be compulsory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Association of Pension Funds, the trade body for pension
providers, is proposing that the government makes saving for retirement
compulsory for employers and workers.
The association, at its annual autumn meeting in London yesterday, said it
would call on government to allow employers to make membership of an
occupational pension scheme a condition of employment, provided the scheme
meets certain criteria.
In addition, employees not in a suitable occupational pension scheme, and
their employers, should be required to contribute 10 per cent of pay between
them to an approved money purchase arrangement. Although there may be
increased costs with this arrangement, they would be offset by removal of
the obligation to make other contributions to the State Earnings Related
Pension Scheme.
The association, which has launched a review of retirement provision,
proposes a gradual phasing out of Serps while protecting the scheme for
people over the age of 50.
Self-employed people should be required to contribute 10 per cent of net
relevant earnings to an approved money purchase arrangement, and all pension
arrangements should increase each year in line with the retail price index
or 5 per cent, whichever is less.
In 1986 laws banning compulsory occupational scheme membership took effect.
The present government has taken a hard line against compulsory pensions
saying saving should be a matter for individual choice.
The association is also proposing the introduction of an element of
means-testing into the basic state pension, which should be increased each
year in line with wages, not prices, which rise more slowly. Those whose
incomes are above a certain level would have their state pension reduced by
a set percentage, while those whose incomes fall below a certain level would
have annual increases above the average.
Separately, the association said a poll of its members showed the
'overwhelming majority' now believe that executive directors' rolling
contracts should last no longer than 12 months.
Mr Geoff Lindey, chairman of the organisation's investment committee, said:
'We will make it known there is a strong feeling among our members that
three-year rolling contracts are not appropriate. Furthermore, we will
encourage our members to exercise their right as shareholders to vote
accordingly.'

The nine London Training and Enterprise Councils yesterday launched an
economic development prospectus for the capital, calling for flexible skills
training for London's employees.
Mr David Hill, chairman of Aztec, the Tec for south-west London, said
training would have to be more general, rather than targeted at precise job
descriptions. The prospectus said the key issues for London's employers
were: updating skills to combat obsolescence, reskilling to enable staff to
make job changes, upskilling to respond to the rising skills content of many
jobs, multiskilling to enable staff to work across a range of tasks, and
improving generic skills such as customer service and personal relations.

Nestle said yesterday that it will close its Norwich confectionery factory
in two years with the loss of 900 jobs, Roderick Oram writes.
Production will be transferred to several other plants. York, home of the
Rowntree's business Nestle bought in 1988, is apparently the biggest winner.
It is the third tranche of job losses announced by the Swiss multinational
since it completed a review of its UK operations this summer. Job losses so
far total 2,000 out of a UK workforce of 17,000.
Mr David Harris, managing director of Nestle Rowntree, said: 'We need to
reduce our capacity and costs to improve competitiveness so that we can
protect and develop the business for the future.'

FT  18 NOV 94 / Welsh power pay deal accepted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trade unions at South Wales Electricity have negotiated a wage agreement
that will reduce pay levels for workers who join the company after December
5.
The deal will extend performance-related pay or annual appraisals for wage
increases to all the company's existing employees from April. The pay of
existing workers will be protected.
Existing staff will receive a 5.9 per cent backdated increase, made up of
2.9 per cent for last year and 3 per cent for this year, as well as lump sum
one-off payments ranging from Pounds 350 to Pounds 1,250 to buy out
allowances.
Mr Andrew Walker, the group's chief executive, said: 'I consider the new
agreement is at the forefront of deals across the electricity industry.
'We have placed great importance during the negotiations on improving
employee flexibility and cost effectiveness.'
The company insisted that there should be market related pay scales for all
new recruits to ensure greater flexibility.
Employees have accepted a range of new working practices under the deal.
These include the introduction of flexible working hours for everybody, with
an average 37 hours a week.
A single pay structure is to replace the three-tier wage scale and single
table bar-gaining is to be introduced for all five unions in the company.
The agreement will introduce monthly credit transfer for paying all workers
and extend maternity leave to 14 weeks on full pay.
The agreement guarantees a role for the trade unions.
The company said it would recognise the 'full value of collective bargaining
arrangements' for which their 'support and commitment' were necessary.

FT  18 NOV 94 / British Gas sets prices to reward good payers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas yesterday fired the first shot in the battle to retain its
dominance of the domestic gas market, due to be opened for competition in
1998.
Only a day after the government said it would introduce legislation to
abolish the company's monopoly on supplying 18m mainly residential users,
the company announced a price restructuring that will reward British Gas'
best customers, while recovering some of the costs of dealing with those
with poor payment records.
The restructuring includes a 2.9 per cent increase in the standing charge
and the cost of gas for those customers who do not take up British Gas'
offer of a 5 per cent discount in exchange for agreeing to pay by direct
debit.
British Gas expects 5m households to join the scheme. It said that 92 per
cent of its customers had access to a bank or building society account, and
could therefore take advantage of the savings.
But there was criticism that it did not cover prompt payers who preferred to
deal in cash, or who did not want to give the company access to their bank
accounts.
The Gas Consumers Council said: 'We had hoped that British Gas would have
offered discounts for prompt payment by any method.'
The company said it would extend the scheme to such customers later next
year, when its new national billing system was in place.
It said the removal of cross-subsidies and the establishment of
cost-reflective pricing for various categories of customers was essential if
it was to compete in a liberalised gas market.
It noted that it cost 10 times more to deal with customers who delayed
paying their bills, compared with those who paid on time.
Ofgas, the industry regulator, said the new pricing policy appeared to be
fair. The price increase is the first since 1991.
An additional price adjustment is likely next year when British Gas
implements a regional pricing policy approved by Ofgas. Customers could face
variations of plus or minus 2 per cent to 4 per cent. British Gas yesterday
said it expected that any rises would be closer to 2 per cent.
The shift to more cost-reflective pricing is likely to affect the company's
policy on debt and disconnection.

FT  18 NOV 94 / PIA to go ahead on advice guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial regulators are pressing ahead with plans to inform customers of
whether any financial advice they receive is independent, in spite of
resistance from banks and building societies.
From next May, financial organisations will have to make clear to consumers
whether they provide independent advice or advice only on a particular
company's products.
The Personal Investment Authority, the retail investors' watchdog, yesterday
outlined rules saying that the type of advice given by each of its members
should be disclosed by signs in branches and in marketing material.
The PIA also says the disclosure requirements should apply to broadcast as
well as printed advertisements for mortgages, unless the material refers
only to repayment mortgages.
Most banks and large building societies have their own life insurance
subsidiaries or are linked with a single life insurer, and so do not provide
advice about products from a range of companies.
Of the large high street financial institutions, only Bradford &amp; Bingley
Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society offer solely independent
advice.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Mortgage benefit cuts to be limited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will try to consolidate the housing
market's fragile recovery in this month's Budget by introducing only limited
cuts in mortgage benefit payments to people on low incomes.
He is, however, expected to signal that there will be further cuts in the
amount of mortgage interest relief to recipients of income support,
encouraging householders to take out private insurance in future years.
As the government prepares to cut about Pounds 5bn from its public spending
bill in this year's Budget, the chancellor is expected to announce a
reduction in the ceiling for which mortgage benefit can be paid from Pounds
125,000 to Pounds 100,000.
This is a smaller reduction than had been expected by mortgage lenders, who
had assumed that the top limit would be set at Pounds 90,000.
Treasury officials have accepted an argument from Mr Peter Lilley, the
social security secretary, that a reduction of the ceiling to this lower
level would hit the broad mass of mortgage holders and could amount to
another serious setback for the housing market.
Ministers believe that it would be politically difficult to implement
drastic reductions in the mortgage benefit system, which costs taxpayers
about Pounds 1.2bn per year. They have also said that they will shy away
from announcing projected cuts for future years in this month's Budget.
They have, however, made no secret of their long-term desire to phase out
the system, arguing that it is difficult to operate because of constant
changes in the level of interest repayments.
As one official put it: 'It is unlikely we will set a target for the future.
But we are sending out pretty strong signals that people should not rely on
this form of support for ever. We'd be very keen on people taking out
private insurance.'
Earlier this month the Council of Mortgage Lenders warned that a cut in the
top limit for relief to Pounds 90,000 would mean that more than 200,000
mortgage-holders would run a greater risk of having their homes repossessed.
This would affect almost twice as many mortgage-holders as would be the case
if the ceiling were reduced to Pounds 100,000. The CML, which represents
banks, building societies and other lenders, is opposed even to this smaller
change.
Although the number of properties repossessed has been falling in the past
couple of years, repossessions are still at historically very high levels.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Blair underlines retreat from unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour leadership yesterday delivered a double barrelled warning that it
is serious about plans to reform the party's relations with the unions.
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, told the unions that it was in their best
interests not to be associated with one particular political party.
Mr Blair's comments, in the leftwing magazine New Statesman, went
significantly further than his earlier warnings that unions could expect no
special access to a future Labour government.
The significance of his remarks was underlined by Mr John Prescott, Labour's
deputy leader, in a speech to a conference on relations between managers and
unions. Mr Prescott, regarded as the most traditionalist member of Labour's
leadership, said that the party would no longer take 'a partisan approach to
industrial relations, sometimes in spite of our judgment of what is best'.
The concerted declaration of Labour's independence from the unions comes as
the leadership prepares for a battle with union leaders and leftwing MPs
over the future of Clause IV, the party's commitment to widespread public
ownership.
Separation from the unions and the emasculation of Clause IV are regarded by
Mr Blair's supporters as vital elements of his plan to modernise the party
by distancing it from its traditional socialist roots.
Mr Blair, who is expected to expand his view of the relationship between the
party and the unions at a London conference tomorrow, told New Statesman
readers that unions had a role in protecting working families from economic
change. But he said that unions could protect their influence only by 'being
a broad voice of the working people, not a direct party political voice, or
one that is concerned for a narrow interest of individual unions'. He said
that unions 'do not want, and will not get, favours from a Labour
government'. Unions 'should be able to thrive with any change of government
. . . because they speak for the broad interest of working families'.
Mr Blair said the unions must adapt to change by developing better services
or risk losing members to private-sector organisations that would 'cherry
pick' their profitable activities.
'Just as Labour is now looking again at the culture, organisation and
constitution of the party, so are many unions who see that the present
structures and objectives are out of date,' he said.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Settlement hopes grow for BCCI creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A settlement for creditors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International moved a significant step closer yesterday when dissident
creditors welcomed a new agreement put forward by the liquidators.
The BCCI Depositors Protection Association (DPA) said it would sign a new
agreement based on a Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.14bn) contribution from the
government of Abu Dhabi. The DPA helped block an earlier agreement offering
a range of compensation from Dollars 1.2bn to Dollars 2.2bn.
BCCI was shut down in 1991 with liabilities of up to Dollars 10bn following
the discovery of the world's biggest banking fraud. The bank's assets may
total up to Dollars 4bn. Estimates of the number of creditors range from
140,000 to 500,000.
The liquidators, accountants Touche Ross, said the new agreement had been
considered by BCCI creditors' committees in London, Luxembourg and the
Cayman Islands and was 'unanimously approved by those who voted'.
The depositors' association said that it wished to end the delays caused by
court appeals. It pointed out that the new agreement, unlike the original,
allowed creditors to pursue claims against the government of Abu Dhabi.
Before an agreement can be completed it must be passed by courts in three
jurisdictions. The liquidators said yesterday that the case would be heard
in London on December 13, in Luxembourg on November 30 and December 1, and
in the Cayman Islands on January 11 and 12.
Under the new agreement the Abu Dhabi government, the principal shareholder
of BCCI, will pay Dollars 1.55bn after the successful completion of the
court hearings, Dollars 150m 24 months later, and Dollars 100m 36 months
after completion.
The DPA said: 'The DPA believes that the new agreement represents a
significant improvement on the old agreement and vindicates its opposition
to the old agreement.'
Referring to claims against the Abu Dhabi government, the DPA said: 'The DPA
hopes that such actions will be pursued and is investigating the formulation
of such a claim.'
Representatives of the DPA, which has 200 members, fought the original
agreement in the courts in both London and Luxembourg. The agreement was
blocked on appeal in Luxembourg in October 1993.
The DPA said yesterday: 'The liquidators must now commit themselves to
payment of an initial dividend of no less than 20 per cent (20p in the
pound) by July 5 1995.' Estimates of the final dividend payable have usually
ranged between 30p and 40p in the pound.
In a statement published yesterday the liquidators said an interim dividend
depended on the courts and the calculation of the total number of creditors
and assets.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Tunnel effect on homes outlined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly 100 homes will be demolished and a further 70 will lose part of their
gardens to make way for the Channel tunnel rail link and the associated
widening of the M2 motorway, the department of transport said yesterday.
Details of the impact of the proposed Pounds 2.7bn rail link on communities
and the countryside were published in environmental statements required for
such projects.
The statements, comprising 12 documents and 54 volumes of special reports,
will play an important role in determining the level of protest to the
proposals. Several thousand petitions are expected to be put to the select
committee which considers the plan.
About 410 homes will be affected by noise from passing trains and a further
1,600 will experience groundborne noise and vibration. About 160 are on the
Mardyke Park Estate, Purfleet, where the line will be on a viaduct.
The rail link will swallow 850 acres of agricultural land. Some 75 acres of
ancient woodland will be lost and 21 listed buildings will be demolished.
The M2 widening will take 173 acres from the edge of the Kent Downs and
consume 57 acres of woodland, although these will be replanted.
The rail link will affect ground water resources near Pepper Hill, in the
Nashenden Valley and at Thurnham.
The bill authorising construction of the rail line and the motorway widening
is expected to be put to parliament on November 24. Its passage is expected
to take two years.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Banking watchdog calls for members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Small banks were criticised by an independent bankers' group yesterday for
not joining the Banking Ombudsman Scheme.
The Code of Banking Practice Review Committee said they were denying their
customers independent arbitration on disputes.
The review committee, an independent group which reviews the banks'
voluntary code of banking practice, said in its annual report that it was
'disappointed at the comparatively small number of banks' that had joined
the scheme.
The 65 banks that are members cover nearly all personal banking customers in
the UK, but the committee is concerned that small foreign banks dealing with
ethnic minorities tend not to join the scheme. Annual membership to the
ombudsman scheme costs Pounds 2,500.
It said 99 per cent of customers were covered, but it was 'unsatisfactory
that there remains a minority of customers, albeit small, which has no
opportunity of having complaints dealt with by an impartial outside
arbitrator'.
The committee said it was surprised that some small banks had refused to
join on the grounds of cost because the annual charge for smaller banks had
remained un-changed for eight years although annual running expenses had
grown.
Mr Martin Karmel, the committee's secretary, said that all building
societies were compelled to be members of the scheme, but this was often
inappropriate for small banks because many of those operating in London had
no personal customers.
Mr Karmel said the committee was particularly worried at the number of
foreign banks serving ethnic minorities in the UK which were not part of the
scheme. Banks were asked to give reasons for not joining in the committee's
annual compliance survey.
Mr Karmel said that banks generally appeared to be becoming more aware of
their responsibilities under the code of banking practice. Fewer banks were
explaining their responsibilities to customers in 'gobbledegook'.
The committee's fourth review of the code is due to start in March.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Hurd refuses to give pledge over Pergau
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, yesterday refused to give a firm
commitment that future donations for Malaysia's Pergau dam project would not
come from the UK's aid budget.
Following a court judgment last week that payments on the Pergau project had
been illegal, opposition MPs asked Mr Hurd to give an assurance that UK
spending on the Pergau project would no longer be made by the Overseas
Development Administration (ODA).
Amid growing controversy about Britain's aid programme they also sought an
assurance from Mr Hurd that previous spending on the dam from the ODA's aid
and trade provision would be given back.
However, in the Queen's Speech debate on foreign affairs Mr Hurd said that
he had not yet received the High Court's full written judgment on the issue,
that he had not yet decided whether to appeal and that no final decision
could be taken until then.
Mr Hurd told the Commons: 'There have been no decisions on any of these
points, either on past or future spending. We will have to take that
decision. If I decide not to appeal, and as soon as that decision is taken,
the House will be informed.'
Mr Hurd confirmed that the next payment to the Malaysian government to help
build the dam would be made by the end of the year.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow foreign secretary, said he would add Baroness
Thatcher's name to the 'charge sheet' on Pergau, but added that Mr Hurd
could not escape 'his own personal responsibility for having got it wrong'.
He said the episode had been 'an alarming glimpse into the private arrogance
of this government, that has been there so long it no longer even asks
whether there are any limits to its personal authority'.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence is to set up a new tri-service executive to manage
its married quarters' estate of some 68,000 homes, Mr Malcolm Rifkind,
defence secretary, announced yesterday.
The new body - the Defence Housing Executive - will assume responsibility
for the estate from April. It is currently managed on single-service lines.
Mr Rifkind said the body would be established in the first instance as a
budgetary unit within the MoD 'but with a remit to move towards autonomous
operation as a likely candidate for . . . privatisation in due course'.
The MoD faces a Pounds 500m gap in its budget next year if it cannot find a
way of transferring the estate to the private sector. The ministry last
month appointed NatWest Markets to advise on new options for privatisation.
MoD officials said yesterday the executive would be 'a short-term
arrangement while we continue to work towards privatisation proper'.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Tory quits cash for questions committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior Conservative MP is stepping down from the powerful Commons
committee investigating the 'cash for questions' affair because of his past
links with House of Fraser, the one-time owner of Harrods.
Sir Peter Hordern, MP for Horsham, is set to be replaced by Sir Donald
Thompson, Tory MP for Calder Valley, a former junior agriculture minister.
Sir Peter, who acted as a consultant to House of Fraser for most of the
1980s, said yesterday he had no connection with Mr Mohamed Fayed, the
present owner of Harrods, whose allegations about payments to MPs have
damaged the government.
Sir Donald lists a range of paid adviserships and consultancies in the most
recent register of MPs' interests.
These include: adviser to the National Federation of Meat Traders, adviser
to the British Agrochemicals Association, adviser to the National Caravan
Council, and adviser to Catering Equipment Manufacturers and Suppliers.
The cash for questions investigation has been thrown into confusion by Mr
Tony Benn, the veteran Labour leftwinger. Earlier this month he defied
parliamentary rules by publishing details of its private deliberations.
Calls for Mr Benn's expulsion from the committee may be discussed when it
next meets on November 21.
The committee is also to look into The Guardian's use of a fake fax to
investigate a stay by Mr Jonathan Aitken, chief Treasury secretary, at the
Paris Ritz hotel.
Mr Peter Preston, The Guardian's editor, has admitted using the House of
Commons logo on a letter sent to the Ritz, in which details of Mr Aitken's
bill were requested.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Lords battle their way to higher public profile: A new
readiness to challenge legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major thinks he has done the double.
In the Commons yesterday rebel MPs were queueing up to declare loyalty in
the wake of the prime minister's threat to call a general election over the
European finance bill.
Up the corridor in the Lords, senior ministers were confidently predicting
that the upper house is also back under control.
Their confidence may yet turn out to be misplaced. The government has had a
traumatic year in the Lords, and there is no evidence that peers regret the
savage beating they handed out to ministers in the last parliamentary
session.
On the contrary, many peers relish the higher profile achieved by the Lords
as a result of its battles with the government. Even some senior Tories say
the house now has a better public image than its much derided democratic
rival.
The worst mauling was handed out to Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary,
whose bills to reform the police and the criminal justice system were
criticised by a succession of law lords and former Tory cabinet ministers.
But Mr Howard was not alone. Their lordships also ensured a torrid few
months for the education bill piloted by Mr John Patten, the former
education secretary. Mr John MacGregor, the former transport secretary,
faced stiff opposition to many of the provisions of his bill to privatise
the railways.
Government defeats in the Lords are not particularly unusual. There have
been an average of 15 to 20 a year since 1979. But there is nervousness
among some in government that the calibre of last year's tussles between the
upper house and the cabinet may have marked a step change in the Lords'
willingness to challenge legislation.
This year, ministers say, it will be different. The Lords is under fresh
management following the retirement of Lord Wakeham, the former leader,
whose reputation as the cabinet's consummate 'fixer' was tarnished by last
year's revolts.
Government business is now in the hands of Viscount Cranborne, a former
Conservative MP, and Lord Strathclyde, the 34-year-old chief whip, who has
held a series of minor government jobs since entering the Lords in 1985.
If ancestry counts for anything - and it remains more important in the Lords
than elsewhere - Lord Cranborne may have an easier ride than Lord Wakeham.
His family, the Cecils, has been in the House since the early 17th century.
The new team will also be helped by the cabinet's caution in framing the
legislative programme. Shorn of Post Office privatisation at the last
minute, the Queen's Speech contained little to provoke a fight in either
house.
The government's business managers have also learnt the lessons of last
year, particularly the importance of consulting senior backbench peers early
in the process of framing legislation.
Senior ministers say privately that much of the opprobrium that descended on
the heads of Lord Wakeham and Mr Howard during the troubled passage of the
law bills was ill-informed and undeserved.
But they are taking great pains to make sure that there is no repetition of
the clash between the home secretary and Lord Whitelaw, one of his most
eminent Tory pre-decessors, over the police bill.
Lord Whitelaw objected in principle to the centralising elements of Mr
Howard's police reforms, which he succeeded in watering down. But friends
say that much of the trouble could have been avoided if his opinion had been
canvassed earlier.
Other former Tory home secretaries, such as Lord Carr, were equally put out
by the government's apparent lack of interest in the views of knowledgeable
backbenchers. That, they said, was not how the Lords was supposed to work.
The business managers have taken care to start the Lords' legislative
programme with two relatively uncontroversial bills on the Scottish criminal
justice system and agricultural tenancies.
The bills, both of which were introduced yesterday, have the potential to
prompt spirited interventions from the back benches, but neither is thought
likely to provoke serious criticism of the government.
There could be problems with the third bill slated for the Lords, which will
merge a number of environmental agencies, with a potentially significant
impact on the management of the countryside.
But the government has gone to great lengths to minimise opposition to the
bill by consulting widely - inside and outside parliament - on its contents
and publishing draft clauses to test public and parliamentary reaction.
A senior peer said: 'There is awareness that the bill must be cohesive,
reflect government policy, and not fly in the face of people who can make
life difficult for us.
'Consultation does not guarantee a trouble free passage for the bill, but it
does make it more likely that the heffalump traps can be more clearly
defined.'

FT  18 NOV 94 / Pugnacious Newt takes a fresh tack: Bomb-thrower of far
right seeks to become a leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If as Erich Segal once wrote, 'love means never having to say you're sorry',
then Mr Newt Gingrich has never known true romance. The evidence is that
once or twice over the past week he has been caught apologising for being a
bit too rude to the President and First Lady.
The speaker-presumptive of the US House of Representatives has even
apologised for himself, of whom he was always reckoned to be extraordinarily
fond. He told a prime time television audience: 'The truth is occasionally
I'm not very smart. . . I probably need to be 30 per cent less pugnacious
and 50 per cent less negative.'
Indeed, his first week since the Republican electoral landslide may be seen
as a remarkable voyage of discovery for the nation's capital. The great game
is to ascertain if the bomb-thrower of the far right has been transformed
into a new kind of leader capable of doing business not only with the
Democrat in the White House but with those in his own party less persuaded
by his own ideological convictions.
The new emollient Gingrich has struck a few chords - one even from across
the Pacific. In Jakarta, President Bill Clinton shocked his dwindling
liberal constituency by suggesting that the next speaker might have a point
in wanting the reintroduction of voluntary prayer in state schools,
proscribed by the US Supreme Court in 1962 as a violation of the
constitutional separation of church and state.
Back home, the White House scurried about to clarify that Mr Clinton was not
supporting Mr Gingrich's modus operandi - a constitutional amendment - but
rather saw nothing wrong in time set aside for 'quiet reflection' in
schools. But the president also agreed to sit down to a policy summit with
the new Republican leadership early next month, if not before.
In assigning committee chairmanships in the next Congress, Mr Gingrich also
showed a willingness to forgive and possibly forget. Most conspicuous was
his support of Congressman Gerald Solomon of New York to run the rules
committee. Mr Solomon is certainly conservative enough but once had the
temerity to challenge Mr Gingrich for the position of minority whip, an
offence considered tantamount to lese majeste in the old Gingrich handbook.
He also had no problems with the selection of Congressman Benjamin Gilman,
another New Yorker, to head the foreign affairs committee. He is a leading
party moderate who promises to offer a counterweight to Senator Jesse
Helms's right-wing stewardship of the counterpart Senate panel.
Unlike Mr Helms, who threatened in a letter to Mr Clinton to create all
sorts of trouble on foreign policy if a vote on the Gatt treaty were not
postponed until next year, Mr Gingrich also renewed his promise to work for
approval later this month.
Finally, the next speaker said he would make his House a more humane and
'family friendly' place in which to work. Democratic staffers on Capitol
Hill, facing job losses running into many hundreds, construed this as
meaning they would be spending more time with their families, though his
proposed abolition of three standing committees - on the merchant marine,
the post office and civil service and the District of Columbia - will
certainly cut down on the workload.
On the other hand, in speeches and interviews beyond number, the Gingrich
message was as much one of no compromise as it was of co-operation.
Regardless of what the Republican Senate does next year, the 'Contract with
America' manifesto promising less government, lower taxes and more prisons
will be on the House agenda from the very beginning. It will even be read
out loud at the start of each daily session.
Mr Gingrich described his mandate with these blunt and familiar words:
'There's been an enormous effort in the Washington elite to avoid the
reality that this election was actually about some fairly big ideas. . .
those who argued for counterculture values, bigger government,
redistributionist economics and bureaucracies were on the losing end in
virtually every part of the country.'
An important part of this 'elite' is, of course, what Mr Gingrich has long
seen as a pernicious 'liberal' media, and it has to be reported that the
course of true love between the next speaker and the press is already
running no more smoothly than it has done with the current president.
Of many assaults from the left, Anna Quindlen's in the New York Times was
merely the most pointed in writing of his 'not-like-us ethos (that) makes so
much bigotry possible'. Even the non-doctrinal David Broder of the
Washington Post contrasted his 'arresting, powerful ideas' with 'the demons
he seemingly cannot control'.
Mr Gingrich is thin-skinned enough to have banned from his office reporters
from the Atlanta Journal Constitution, his home-town newspaper, after it ran
a cartoon recalling the circumstances of the break-up of his first marriage.
As Mr Clinton knows only too well, even ancient and personal history is no
longer off-limits for those in power.
Even those long forgotten can still bite back. No sooner had Mr Gingrich
assailed the Clintons as 'counterculture McGoverniks' than ex-Senator George
McGovern himself, the failed presidential candidate of 1972 and more
recently New England hotel-keeper, was back in print professing 'nothing but
disdain towards this unscrupulous demagogue'. This is one love affair never
to be consummated.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A handful of results from last week's mid-term elections remained undecided
yesterday, making the final size of the Republican majority in the House of
Representatives still in doubt.
But Mr Parris Glendening, the Democrat, finally felt secure enough to
announce his transition team as governor-elect of Maryland. With only 1,400
absentee ballots to be counted, his lead of 5,405 votes seemed unassailable,
although Mrs Ellen Sauerbrey, the Republican, still refused to concede
defeat and was alleging unspecified voting irregularities.
In California, Congressman Michael Huffington, the Republican, also had not
conceded to Senator Dianne Feinstein, though her lead had widened to nearly
138,000 votes with just over 500,000 still to be counted.
The outcome of one House race, in Connecticut, seems certain to be decided
either in the courts or in the House itself. The final tally gave
Congressman Sam Gejdenson, the Democrat, a four-vote lead, double the first
count, over Mr Edward Munster, but state officials refused to certify the
result.
In 1984, an equally close race in Indiana was eventually decided by the
House itself, then under Democratic control, in favour of the party's
candidate, Mr Frank McCloskey, after a recount had given the edge to a
Republican.
In California, Washington and New York, three first-term Democrats - Jane
Harman, Elizabeth Furse and Maurice Hinchey - were clinging to tiny leads,
but all less than the number of votes still to be counted and with
challenges on the cards. If these three and Mr Gedjenson survive, the House
line-up would be 230 Republicans, 204 Democrats and one independent.
Likely to be announced today is the result for the Alaskan governorship now
held by Mr Walter Hickel, an independent. The last count gave Mr Tony
Knowles, the Democrat, a 517-vote lead over Jim Campbell, the Republican,
with about 9,000 ballots outstanding.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Home building activity fell in the US last month, the Commerce Department
reported yesterday, showing that rising interest rates were starting to damp
the housing market even before this week's Federal Reserve decision to raise
short-term rates by  3/4 of a percentage point.
Privately owned housing starts fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
1.42m in October, the Commerce Department said, 5 per cent below September's
revised rate of 1.5m and only fractionally above the rate in October last
year.
The drop was created by a 7 per cent fall in the number of single family
homes started to an annual rate of 1.14m in October.
The number of new building permits issued also fell to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.4m, 2 per cent lower than in September but still 8 per cent
higher than in October a year ago.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Cardoso gears up for drive on reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's president-elect, yesterday promised
to deliver 'sustainable' economic development and said the victories of
candidates from his Social Democracy party (PSDB) in this week's state
elections showed voters wanted a 'more modern, more open' economy.
Mr Cardoso, who takes office on January 1, was speaking after Tuesday's
elections in which the PSDB won six out of 27 governorships, including the
three most important states. Political analysts say the party's strong
performance, and Mr Cardoso's easy win in the presidential race last month,
has given him an exceptional opportunity to push ahead with reform of
Brazil's economy and government.
Mr Cardoso said his advisers were working on detailed reform proposals,
which would be announced closer to his inauguration. He the first priority
would be to continue the struggle against inflation. Inflation has fallen
this year thanks to a new currency, the Real, which Mr Cardoso helped plan
when finance minister. He said a 'series of measures' were needed to reform
the public finances.
As well as tax and social security reform, his advisers are thought to be
planning a shake-up of the government administrative machine and overhauls
to the nearly bankrupt state banking system.
He said he would announce his cabinet 'around the end of December' and
wanted a mixture of technical and political experience.
Mr Cardoso said he would soon begin talks with the leaders of other
political parties to build a working majority in Congress. He is especially
interested in attracting the support of the so-called 'ethical wing' of the
Democratic Movement (PMDB), the country's largest political party.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Republicans promise new telecoms bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senate Republican leaders are promising an all-out effort to pass new
telecommunications legislation early next year.
Sen Larry Pressler of South Dakota, who will take over as chairman of the
Senate commerce committee when the new Congress meets in January, said he
plans to meet other Republican senators, including Sen Robert Dole, the
party's leader, to sketch out ideas for a telecommunications bill in the
next two weeks. 'If we don't pass the bill next year I don't think it's
going to happen in the election year,' he warned.
Telecommunications legislation passed the House of Representatives this
year. Although a similar bill was agreed by the Senate commerce committee,
it never made it to the Senate floor, largely because of objections from Mr
Dole.
Companies in the telephone and broadcasting industries are increasingly
anxious to have a new set of rules to replace the 60-year-old law which has
been overtaken by technological and competitive changes.
'There seems to be unanimous agreement that if we could agree on a bill and
get the rules set, everybody would be better off,' Mr Pressler said.
The thrust both of this year's House bill and of the bill produced by Sen
Ernest Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat from whom Mr Pressler will take
over the committee chairmanship, was to let cable companies, local telephone
companies and long-distance telephone companies enter each other's markets,
though the different versions differed on how quickly this should happen in
each sector.
The activities of the Baby Bells, the regional telephone giants which have a
near regional monopolies on local telephone service, are now restricted
under terms of the court order which created them 10 years ago by breaking
up the original AT&amp;T monopoly.
Mr Pressler said he expected to produce a bill somewhere between the
Hollings bill and the alternative proposed by Mr Dole, which leaned closer
to the Bells' position.

FT  18 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Paris all at sea over shipyard subsidy
deal - Withdrawing threat to scuttle OECD accord is proving difficult
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French government is trying to wriggle off the hook on which it impaled
itself when it publicly threatening to torpedo the international agreement
to ban direct subsidies to shipbuilders from 1996.
It will not be easy. Even before he formally opened his campaign for the
presidency, Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist leader, was fulminating at the
accord, negotiated in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development last July.
Mr Chirac dubbed it the 'maritime Blair House', a reference to the
preliminary transatlantic farm deal two years ago that was so hated in
France. His presidential rival, the prime minister Mr Edouard Balladur, must
therefore make any climb-down as discreet as possible.
In fact, unlike French complaints about the agricultural Blair House, the
Balladur government has no real quarrel with the way the European Commission
negotiated the OECD deal on behalf of the European Union twelve. It simply
rues the fact that the previous Socialist government joined other EU
governments in giving Brussels a negotiating mandate in the first place.
Instead of being able to use OECD consensus rules to stymie any ship subsidy
ban at the outset, Paris now finds itself with a choice of submitting to the
desire of all its 11 EU partners to ratify the accord, or blocking an
international agreement that already carries the signatures of the US,
Japan, South Korea, Finland, Norway and Sweden.
The latter option puts Paris on a collision course with Bonn, which is keen
to get the OECD deal ratified during its EU presidency, preferably by EU
foreign ministers on November 28.
Paris is banking on Bonn's help in finding a formula to save face. It was US
complaints against German subsidies that triggered the OECD negotiation, and
Paris reckons it deserves to be reciprocated for agreeing to let Bonn give a
special, temporary subsidy (equivalent to up to 36 per cent of turnover) to
the Rostock yards in eastern Germany.
The main effect of the OECD deal would be to ban, from January 1 1966,
direct subsidies which, in the EU, are allowed to be up to 9 per cent of a
ship's cost. The Commission is now advising France to cease its fixation
about the ban of this direct subsidy, and to make the most of permitted
indirect aids. The OECD accord allows governments to pay up to 100 per cent
of a yard's research costs and 25 to 35 per cent of its development costs,
as well as some environmental and training aid.
But CSCN, the French shipbuilders' association, was yesterday
unenthusiastic. 'Shipyards on average only spend 1 per cent of turnover on
research, and perhaps 2 per cent if you define research 'creatively' like
the Japanese,' said a CSCN official. 'Even if the government pays for all of
this, it wouldn't compensate for the disappearance of direct subsidies.'
The OECD accord gives three other EU countries - Spain, Portugal and Belgium
 -longer to phase out direct subsidies, because they have agreed to new
capacity reductions. But France refused any further formal restructuring,
arguing in the words of Mr Fabrice Theobald, head of CSCN, that the industry
'has so little capacity left to lose'.
Over the past 18 years, employment in the sector has fallen from 25,000 to
4,800. Some 4,000 of these work at St. Nazaire for Chantiers de l'Atlantique
(CAT), which is owned by GEC-Alsthom, the Franco-British joint venture. It
has a new plan to boost productivity by 30 per cent over five years, but
hopes to do this with minimal cuts in capacity or jobs.
Apart from CAT, French civil shipbuilding is composed of Constructions
Mecaniques de Normandies at Cherbourg (which tried to save Swan Hunter in
the UK from going under), Chantiers du Havre, and smaller operations at St
Malo, Dieppe and Lorient. None of these locations - even St Nazaire, which
has high unemployment - warrants regional aid, which other European yards
are eligible for, certainly not on the scale of Rostock's.
Some of these companies get a few French naval contracts. But the vast bulk
of that is reserved for the French navy's own huge DCN yards at Brest,
Lorient and Toulon, which employ about 30,000 people.
The OECD accord allows governments to subsidise 'home credit' to their own
shipowners to the level they subsidise 'export credit' to foreign buyers of
their ships. But, with the French merchant fleet now only ranking 36th in
the world, France complains it hardly has any shipowners left to take
advantage of these 'home credits'.
French shipping is unquestionably in poor shape; the average age of the 210
French-flagged vessels has doubled to 15 years over the past decade.
Compagnie Generale Maritime is pulling out of Asian and North Atlantic
routes in an effort to cut its losses so that one day the government can
realise its plan to privatise the shipping group. The private Bollore group
has also scaled down its shipping operations.
Of the 15 ships on order from French shipowners now, only four are to be
from French yards. The mismatch between domestic supply and demand is the
result, as Mr Theobald admits, of his industry's decision to sidestep
cut-price competition from Japan, Korea and Poland in containers and bulk
carriers, and to specialise in passenger liners, LNG gas carriers and
ferries, where they only face Finland and Italy.
In one sense, this has paid off. CAT has in terms of orders 20 per cent of
the world LNG market and, with the Royal Caribbean Cruise Line recently
ordering a new 2,000 passenger cruiseship and placing an option on another,
the St Nazaire yard has a similar share of world orders for passenger
liners.
But the upshot of such specialisation is that French yards depend on exports
for more than 90 per cent of their business, and have left themselves little
home market to fall back on.

Gresik for construction at Tuban, East Java, where Fuller has already
supplied a plant with output capacity of 7,500 tonnes a day. The new order
is accompanied by a memorandum of understanding for the supply of a third
plant at Tuban, for which it is expected that negotiations will be completed
in the first half of next year, said FLS Industries.

Airbus Industrie said it would freeze the price of spare parts for its
aircraft at current 1994 prices for orders next year. The statement follows
recent reports that US rivals Boeing and McDonnell Douglas are close to
landing big aircraft orders in the competitive world jet market. More than
80 per cent of Airbus's suppliers have joined the price freeze, which covers
parts for early Airbus aircraft as well as those in current production.
Airbus has spares centres in Hamburg, Singapore and Washington DC which
together stock Dollars 750m of parts. It is opening a centre in Beijing. The
Airbus consortium comprises Aerospatiale, British Aerospace, Dasa of Germany
and Casa of Spain.

The UK's biggest-ever trade mission - a week-long tour to four cities in
India - notched up further successes yesterday when two small UK companies
signed distribution and technical agreements with Indian concerns. The
mission, led by Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister (pictured left), aims
to win deals in the fast growing Indian infrastructure market and help
smaller UK companies secure business. Speaking in Bombay, Mr Needham pointed
to the success of Checkpoint Security Services, a small Reading-based
company, which has signed an agreement with Bradman of India enabling
distribution throughout India of its cheque security products.
Mr Needham said this showed it was not only big companies which could
success in overseas markets. 'I would encourage the small- and medium-sized
companies to explore the Indian market,' he said. Another company,
Uxbridge-based High Value Horticulture, secured three tie-ups with Indian
companies to supply technical knowhow, expert advice and specialist planting
material for food processing and horticulture.

Five groups of Israeli and international companies have been selected for
the final stage of an international tender to construct a Dollars 150m
highway tunnel and toll road near the Israeli city of Haifa. The Haifa or
'Carmel' tunnel, expected to be completed by the year 2000, is the first
infrastructure project in Israel to be submitted to international tender and
the first in which all stages of production will be carried out by private
contractors.
The highway will be the first toll road in Israel and if successful the
project could pave the way for the private sector into a vast array of
infrastructure projects in transport, water and communications. The groups
picked for the 5km Carmel tunnel are international companies specialising in
tunnelling and electronic traffic control systems to operate toll roads.
Among companies included in the groups are Astaldi of Italy, Fougerolle
International of France, Dragados Construcciones of Spain, Autostrade of
Italy, Parsons Brinckerhoff of the US, Abay TS of France and LK Comstock, a
US subsidiary of Spie Batignoles of France.

The US will remove Thailand from its 'priority watch list' of countries
threatened with US trade sanctions for violating intellectual property
rights, following the recent passage through parliament of Thailand's new
copyright law, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said yesterday.
Thailand will be moved to the less rigorous 'watch list' under the terms of
US trade legislation known as 'Special 301', according to senior US
officials.
'We will continue to keep a close eye on Thailand's protection of
intellectual property rights,' Mr Christopher told reporters in Bangkok.
'Improved protection of these rights could prevent the loss of over Dollars
150m in annual income to US firms.' Pirated computer software, videos and
music cassettes are easily obtainable in Bangkok, but the new Thai law
extends copyright protection to software and provides for jail terms of up
to four years and fines of up to Bt800,000 (Dollars 32,000). Mr Christopher
also said the Thai government had agreed to open its market for the first
time to American citrus products.
Thailand will offer export insurance facilities starting on November 23 to
boost the competitiveness of the country's exporters.

FT  18 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Regulation blamed for stifling new EU jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government barriers to competition rather than labour market rigidities
explain why recent employment creation has been lower in the European Union
than in the US and Japan, according to a study on comparative employment
performance published today by McKinsey Global Institute, research arm of
the leading international consultants.
The report asserts: 'If European countries had matched the job creation
performance of Japan and the US over the 1980s without suffering a
productivity penalty, their gross domestic products would be 5 to 15 per
cent higher and their unemployment problems would have gone away.'
The study urges European policy-makers to 'abstain from regulations limiting
competition even if they are intended to preserve jobs'. Strengthening
general anti-trust regulations and removing barriers to market access 'are
important instruments for increasing competitive intensity and overcoming
vested interests'.
The report examines employment performance in a number of industries,
ranging from cars, computers, furniture and banking to film/video/tv and
construction. It covers the US, Japan, France, Germany, Italy and Spain, and
concludes 'product market barriers play an important role in determining
employment levels'.
The report says restrictions in Europe have 'inhibited the emergence of new
labour-intensive segments' in the film/tv/video industry while in European
construction 'the myriad rules and regulations' of land use, building
quality, safety, rent and taxes stifled the product market.
It adds that in Europe retail trade has been hit by 'restrictive opening
hours, excessive zoning restrictions and the veto power given existing
retailers' thereby limiting the creation of new jobs.
The study also urges reform of Europe's labour market institutions, calling
for stricter rules covering payment of unemployment benefit and social
assistance and cuts in non-wage labour costs for part-time workers and the
low paid.
McKinsey also questions a number of widely held assumptions about the
alleged inflexibilities of the western European labour market. It suggests
job protection regulations do not 'play a major role' in creating
rigidities.
The study notes: 'While many employers complained about inflexibility in
interviews, the evidence showed when companies were forced to react to
dramatic changes in the market place, they were able to overcome these
barriers. The transaction costs of hiring and firing play a relatively minor
role compared to total labour costs.'
McKinsey also found that while Europe 'may lack the institutions that can
provide temporary workers and in some cases there are restrictions on
part-time work, this is not a binding constraint'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Market liberalisation agreed in the Uruguay Round could benefit all
countries and reduce trade conflicts and protectionism, according to a
report issued yesterday by the International Monetary Fund.
'Given the fairly long implementation period, any transition costs are
likely to be felt gradually, providing time to exploit the opportunities
opened up by the Round,' the report says. However, developing countries
could suffer from two costs of transition: the decline of benefits from
preference schemes, under which industrialised countries allow specified
imports with little or no duties, and also higher food costs.
The IMF says preliminary analyses suggest that erosion of preference margins
is small. The main beneficiaries have been the more advanced developing
countries, which have more to gain from tariff cuts and liberalisation of
agricultural, textile and apparel trade. However, some countries (notably in
North Africa and the Caribbean), which rely overwhelming on preferences on
industrial products, could be adversely affected. Although developing
countries which import much of their food might be hurt by higher prices,
farm sectors in other countries could thrive as world market distortions are
reduced.
Countries protecting their farmers may simply replace their quotas with
prohibitive tariffs, the report notes, and anti-dumping measures could still
be used for protection.
Still the achievements in market liberalisation, strengthening of rules and
institutions and extension of discipline to new areas will be far reaching,
the report said. 'Equally important, it has created an environment conducive
for tackling future challenges in trade policy.'

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Chilean President Eduardo Frei said Chile would enter the North American
Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) 'sooner or later,' Reuter reports from Tokyo.
He also said the summit of the Americas in Florida next month would raise
trade issues including Nafta. Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said he
was 'very optimistic' about talks aimed at bringing Chile into Nafta, but
did not expect any significant advances until next year. Chilean officials
have been in contact with Clinton administration officials about how and
when to bring Chile, next in line to join Nafta, into the free-trade pact.
But Chile's move into the agreement was put on hold in September when the
Clinton administration withdrew from Congress clauses which would give US
negotiators 'fast-track' powers to implement bills without amendment.
Chile became the 18th member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation
(Apec) in Indonesia this week. President Frei and US President Bill Clinton
met for talks including trade issues at the Apec forum. 'The Apec includes
the members of the Nafta, such as the US, Canada and Mexico. This means that
Nafta is a part of the Apec at the same time,' Mr Frei said.

FT  18 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Hope dims for all-Americas trade bloc -
Plans for a wider Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, NANCY DUNNE and BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US and its western hemisphere trading partners are struggling to chart
the next stage in the economic integration of the Americas.
After the successful negotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement
between the US, Canada and Mexico, which came into force at the beginning of
the year, hopes were high that the accord could be the first step towards a
free trade zone across the hemisphere,
In the afterglow of Nafta's passage, the Clinton administration called a
summit of western hemisphere heads of state. That summit, to which all the
region's heads of state except Fidel Castro were invited, is due to take
place in Miami on December 9 and 10.
Since last year, however, the prospects for hemispheric economic integration
have receded, rather than advanced. While integration across Latin America
has continued apace, the idea of the US being at the centre of a hemispheric
free trade zone has suffered badly.
The Clinton administration lost its authority to push through trade
agreements under 'fast track' - without line-by-line scrutiny by Congress.
With that receded prospects of a rapid accession to Nafta of Chile - the
next country in line. Also buried was a proposal that would give for a
period the countries of central America and the Caribbean 'Nafta parity' -
the equivalent access to the US market enjoyed by Mexico.
The losses for Mr Clinton's Democratic party in last week's mid-term
congressional elections have further increased uncertainty about his
administration's ability to carry through on its promises. And while a row
over Haiti has been averted by the success so far of US intervention there,
Latin countries will raise the contentious issue of the US embargo against
Cuba.
All this has worried some participating governments. In a bid to ensure that
a lack of progress towards hemispheric integration does not imply the
process will go into reverse, Canada, Mexico and Chile have been pressing
the US to come up with a coherent hemispheric strategy for the summit.
Some governments now think the summit may do something useful, after all. Mr
Eduardo Aninat, Chile's minister of finance, said last week: 'Three months
ago, we saw the summit as having a very unchallenging agenda. It's OK to
talk about good government, corruption and drugs and that kind of thing -
but trade had to be part of the talks. Otherwise, we would not have needed
all those presidents and ministers there. Now, we think there might be an
interesting discussion.'
He said he saw two possible concrete developments emerging from the summit:
A survey of existing trade and integration arrangements in the hemisphere to
bring out what tariff and other rules apply. This would be a first step to
ensure that current free trade arrangements do not place obstacles in the
path of future economic integration.
A timetable for action that would 'at the very least' freeze existing tariff
and non-tariff barriers within the region.
The patchwork of free trade agreements and customs unions that has been
established in the region has been a source of worry for some trade experts.
They are concerned that rules of origin and other arrangements in some free
trade accords would be incompatible with others. They are also worried that
the proliferation of bilateral free trade accords could hinder broader
economic integration.
These concerns are reflected in a joint paper from three pan-American
organisations - the Organisation of American States, the InterAmerican
Development Bank and the UN Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean -
prepared for the summit. Moving towards free trade in the hemisphere through
bilateral accords 'has several inherent limitations which make it less
viable and less active than a multilateral route'. Using Nafta as a basis
for a multilateral approach, it says, would be 'strong option'.
This is the route favoured by Canada's Liberal government. A year ago, it
was dithering over whether or not to ratify Nafta. Now it views Nafta
enlargement as a centrepiece of foreign policy. Ottawa is nervous of losing
what limited influence it has, should the US cut bilateral deals with its
Latin American trading partners. Some work - such as harmonisation of trade
statistics - is already under way to smooth the way for Chile's entry into
Nafta.
'We're trying to make it as easy as possible for Nafta accession to go ahead
should the US decide to do the right thing,' says one Canadian official.
The joint paper suggests the summit set a target date - for example, the
year 2000 - to complete formal multilateral negotiations on a hemispheric
free trade zone.
It proposes a commitment to annual ministerial meetings to establish
principles to underpin the negotiations and to avoid the creation of
obstacles against hemispheric integration. It says an existing group - the
OAS special committee on trade - should act as the forum for these meetings,
thereby avoiding the premature establishment of an institution which may not
be the most appropriate in the long-term.
It also suggests more support, in particular from the IADB, for investments
linked to integration and trade, such as regional infrastructure projects.
Priority finance could be given to those groupings following principles laid
down by the OAS committee.
Mr Jeffrey Garten, the Commerce Department undersecretary for international
trade, says the US would like the summit to endorse free trade in the
hemisphere and adopt 'concrete measures' to move towards that goal. However,
the process will not be rapid. He acknowledges that 'our goals cannot be
achieved in one year, or even five' but says 'the momentum towards trade
expansion should be bolstered and accelerated'.

<TEXT>
Shares in Pacific Dunlop, the Australian conglomerate, fell to a five-year
low in heavy trading yesterday amid speculation that the company could face
product liability suits over pacemakers made by one of its subsidiaries,
Telectronics, and sold internationally.
Late in the afternoon, Pacific Dunlop put out a statement, saying that
Telectronics had withdrawn three models of pacemakers leads, and that
physicians who implanted these devices were monitoring patients. The company
said the decision followed reports of lead failures 'over recent years'.
Mr Phillip Brass, managing director, said the leads first came on the market
in 1987, while the group had become aware of problems 'largely in the last
three years'.
Pacific Dunlop said seven failures had been reported in an implanted
population of 42,000 recipients since December 1987. Of these seven
failures, six were in the US, where two patients have died. One further
failure was in Australia, where 1,169 leads of this type have been
implanted.
The leads connect the pulse generator - which electronically stimulates the
heart - to the heart tissue.
Pacific Dunlop noted that the leads had been approved by the US Food and
Drug Administration and said it was still studying the problem. 'Preliminary
information indicates a fracture in an implanted lead can be identified by
X-ray,' it said, adding that four faulty leads had been identified in this
way in Japan.
On the legal issue, Mr Brass said the group had received no product
liability suits.
Telectronics has sales of around ADollars 400m (Pounds 181m), a third of
which come from the US, out a group total of ADollars 7bn. Pacific Dunlop
has been introducing a new generation of leads, but says these have yet to
gain FDA approval, although other regulatory regimes have given a green
light. The product withdrawal, therefore, has most effect on sales in the
US, although pacemakers made by the company can still be implanted using
alternative leads.
The statement came after the market closed. The shares fell 15 cents, after
a 12-cent fall on Wednesday, to ADollars 3.62.

New Zealand's Serious Fraud Office is investigating the financial affairs of
the former auditor general, Mr Jeff Chapman - the country's top financial
watchdog - after a highly critical report found he owed the Audit Office
more than NZDollars 156,000 (Pounds 60,700).
Mr Chapman resigned two months ago citing personal financial difficulties.
Mr Bruce McCallum, the government-appointed investigator, found that Mr
Chapman had insufficient regard for the prudent expenditure of public money.
Mr McCallum said that 'as the government's own financial watchdog it was a
pity that he did not follow his own advice'.
The report said that much of the money owed to the department was due to
overseas travel. Mr Chapman travelled first class and stayed at the best
hotels and one trip alone cost NZDollars 101,000. He had also claimed
NZDollars 14,000 in expenses and had cash advances of NZDollars 48,000.
Mr Chapman says he disputes two-thirds of the debt, as well as large parts
of the report.
Mr Paul East, the government minister in charge of the Audit Office, said he
was shocked and disappointed by the revelations which showed a 'very
unfortunate state of affairs'. Mr East said that appointment procedures
relating to senior civil servant positions would be reviewed.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Saudi budget may have to reflect some harsh realities: There
are hints of structural reform to deal with Riyadh's acute two-year-old cash
flow problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saudi Arabia's economic policymakers are busy preparing the annual January 1
budget statement, the kingdom's main public declaration of economic policy.
It is traditionally rather a spare document - usually little more than a
statement of intended government spending.
But this year's budget, if hints by senior Saudis prove correct, may contain
somewhat more. They suggest it may include serious steps towards structural
budgetary reforms to address the government's acute cash flow problems of
the past two years.
'One should expect major decisions,' said one official, without elaborating.
'You will be surprised, we are realistic. We will face the situation, and
it's going to be across the board.'
The 'situation' is the worst slump Saudi Arabia has faced since the oil
price collapse of the mid-1980s and an unprecedented tightness in public
coffers - the product of the Dollars 55bn bill for the Gulf war Desert
Storm, subsequent costly military purchases, unhelpfully soft oil prices and
the cumulative effects of a decade of high spending.
Saudi Arabia's 1993 budget deficit of around Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.3bn) was
its 11th in a row, and 10 per cent of GDP.
Such pressures, augmented by warnings from the International Monetary Fund,
embarrassing reports in some western media about 'bankrupt' Saudi Arabia and
consequent speculative assaults on the riyal, led the government in last
year's budget to announce a 19 per cent cut in state spending in 1994 to
Dollars 46bn. Some economists believe this may still leave a Dollars 6bn
gap, given best estimates of this year's oil earnings.
But they also believe the 19 per cent cuts may be met. Government
departments all report slashed travel, frozen hiring, cut perks, abolished
overtime and, most important, either cancelled projects or frozen payments
for those to which they were committed.
The result, however, has been to extinguish economic growth. Bankers and
economists believe the economy has shrunk this year by 2-5 per cent, the
first GDP fall in nominal terms since the mid-1980s. Government non-payment
of bills to private sector contractors is the chief reason, and one which is
stretching to the limit both private companies and, in turn, the banks on
which both government and private sectors rely for financing.
So far there have been few company failures, but this is largely because
banks have extended bridging credit to their main clients. Most of the
kingdom's 12 commercial banks are now increasing provisions and hoping for a
revival of government payments. But between the increasing demands of
private clients and the government's equal reliance on bank financing,
bankers say the system is now at capacity.
Money supply and bank deposits are both down in recent months. And though
Saudi British Bank this year pioneered a Dollars 280m floating rate note to
help ease the government's pinch, and is believed to be considering a
second, bankers say they have reached the crunch. 'The banks can't deal with
any more,' says a Riyadh banker. 'More than half the banks are over the
official lending limit and the rest are right up against Sama's (the central
bank's) prescribed loans to deposits ratio.'
The government has made almost all its borrowings through the sale of
treasury bills and development bonds to the commercial banks. Saudi Arabia's
foreign debt amounts essentially to a post-Gulf war syndicated Dollars 4.5bn
jumbo loan, which bankers say is being repaid. But domestic borrowing has
accumulated at a pace which alarms the IMF and others. 'In six years it has
gone from zero to Dollars 84bn, which is 70 per cent of GDP,' says a western
economist. 'That's quite a rise.'
All of which points to the need for the 'major decisions' hinted at for the
January budget. And with sources of borrowing drier than ever, the
government has apparently little option but to broaden its revenue base. One
option, which King Fahd has mentioned twice in recent speeches, is
privatisation of some of the state's assets. But while Saudi officials have
canvassed preliminary information about managing state sell-offs from, among
others, the British government, most observers believe privatisation to be
some way off.
A sale of some of the government's 70 per cent holding in Sabic, the
industrial holding company, is not ruled out. But Saudia, the heavily
subsidised state airline, for instance, would require considerable and
costly restructuring to make it attractive to buyers.
Another much discussed option would be to raise electricity, petrol, water
or telephone charges, which are indulgently subsidised. Petrol, for example,
is 5 cents a gallon. But this would be a brave step on to hugely sensitive
political terrain. such a move would almost certainly excite opposition -
not least from hardline Islamists who argue that the country's wealth should
be enjoyed as a right by all.
They are also highly critical of what they see as royal profligacy, and
would make political mileage out of attempts to tax Saudis while senior
princes continue to build palaces. And they are not alone. Hard-pressed
Saudi businessmen have also become unusually critical of royal spending, and
royal economic management. 'There's not been a year like it in terms of the
openness of the grumbling,' says a seasoned foreign Riyadh banker.
September's unrest in Burayda, when more than 100 demonstrators were
arrested after the detention of a cleric who was critical of the royal
family, will have given the government pause. Not least because the
agricultural area around Burayda, while historically a sternly Islamic
heartland, was also among the most affected by the government's main
structural budgetary change to date - a swingeing cut in previously generous
subsidies to wheat farmers.
How King Fahd weighs such factors in making the budget decision - for the
ultimate decision will be his - is unknowable outside his close court. So is
the true state of the kingdom's finances. Some observers believe oil
earnings this year, for example, have been better than budgeted for last
January. They point to IMF figures showing that reserves, minus gold, rose
from an April low of Dollars 4.5bn to Dollars 8.4bn in July. King Fahd may
therefore believe the government can muddle through another year, crossing
fingers for an improvement in the oil price, without having to take awkward
political decisions at all.
As one diplomat puts it: 'There's almost a tradition here of putting off
difficult decisions until there seems to be absolutely no other choice.'
Only on January 1, therefore, will anyone outside the royal court know quite
how seriously the Saudi government believes its present economic
difficulties really are.

yesterday, Reuter reports from Dubai. They said the payment was due on
November 21 or 22, the third of five quarterly instalments of Dollars 900m

Bankers said the repayments were watched carefully as evidence of Saudi

The Saudi government made the first payment last May on its first-ever

FT  18 NOV 94 / Kenyan president pledges to stamp out corruption: Measures
aim to open way for aid and investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya yesterday pledged to rid his country of
the corruption that has in recent years been a significant factor in
blocking new aid and investment to his country.
Speaking at a London investment conference on Kenya, the president said
liberalisation measures introduced by his government in the past 18 months
would contribute to the reduction of corruption in Kenya. 'Import and
investment licensing procedures and foreign exchange controls which have now
been abolished were some of the avenues for corrupt practices,' he said.
The president pointed to the country's anti-corruption unit as evidence of
his government's determination, and urged business people to refrain from
bribing government officials or officers of rival companies.
'I would not be making this appeal if I did not think that the culture of
bribery and kickbacks had been major sources of corruption,' he said.
The conference is Kenya's first attempt in many years to attract foreign
direct investment and the president emphasised that the recent package of
reforms designed to help win investment would not be rolled back. Long-term
investors were the country's priority.
Mr Moi acknowledged that the downturn in the Kenyan economy had led to a
decline in investment in the country's infrastructure, once considered among
Africa's best, and indicated that the private sector would be invited to
participate in schemes such as road-building. The government had also
decided to invite the private sector to develop 50 per cent of the country's
future thermal and geothermal electricity generation, in which the
government planned to invest more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 636m) over the
next five years.
Political reforms of the past three years, including the introduction of a
multi-party system, were also addressed, and the president said he and his
party were committed to the new system. But he warned: 'The imposition of
foreign political models without careful consideration could easily create
upheavals in the African continent.'
Turning to the international aid community ahead of next month's Paris Club
meeting of aid donors, Mr Moi said: 'We have done all they asked us to do.
The ball is now in their court.'
Included in the presidential delegation was Mr Nicholas Biwott, former
energy minister and confidant of Mr Moi. Mr Biwott, who developed a
substantial business empire in Kenya, was sacked in 1991 but has since
resumed his place in the group of presidential advisers. Another prominent
Kenyan businessman, Mr Ketan Somaia, was also in the audience.
Kenya's shilling plunged by 17.9 per cent against the US dollar yesterday in
panic buying because of increased demand by exporters, commercial bank
officials told Reuters. They said commercial banks quoted the dollar at a
mean rate of 48.75 shillings compared with an average 41.35 shillings on
Wednesday.

Samsung Heavy Industries faced a storm of criticism yesterday after being
accused of industrial espionage, allegations which may cost the company its
entry into car-making, officials and analysts said, Reuter reports from
Seoul.
The state-owned Korea Heavy Industries and Construction said it had lodged
an industrial espionage complaint against Samsung Heavy, the shipbuilding
and heavy equipment arm of Samsung Group.
A KHIC spokesman said his company lodged the complaint with local police in
the southeastern city of Changwon after a KHIC worker detected four Samsung
engineers taking pictures of production facilities. He said the photographs
showed that Samsung wanted information about the production, setting up and
operation of KHIC cranes.
In its rebuttal, Samsung Heavy said the crane in question was old and there
was nothing valuable to know about it.
Analysts said the case could seriously damage the credibility Samsung has
tried to build up in its efforts to win government approval for its plans to
enter the car market. The company has for two years been trying to move into
the highly competitive car market. 'Samsung has so far been unable to
explain how its car business will be good for the national economy,' said an
Economic Planning Board official.
Seoul's trade ministry said Samsung's entry to the car market might cause
overproduction, as three big carmakers were already vying for a share of the
crowded market.
The company faced severe criticism from established carmakers when it was
accused of attempting a hostile takeover of Kia Motors in October 1993.
Analysts said Samsung feared it was leaning too heavily on the service and
light industrial sectors, compared with such rivals as the Hyundai Group and
the Daewoo Group.
They said manufacturing accounted for less than half of Samsung's sales last
year, while making up more than 90 per cent of Hyundai's sales and more than
85 per cent of Daewoo's sales.

The Angolan rebel Unita movement yesterday suspended its participation in

'We suspended our participation in the meeting late this morning because. .

Eugenio Manuvakola told reporters. Asked if the formal signing of a peace
accord to end the 19-year Angolan civil war could go ahead as planned in
Lusaka on Sunday, he replied: 'Let us wait and see.'
Unita earlier accused the government of violations of a truce which should
have come into force on Wednesday to smooth the way for Sunday's signing by
Unita leader Jonas Savimbi and Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Mr
Manuvakola said government troops had overrun the northern Angolan city of

Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, expressed disappointment
yesterday that Thailand had denied a US request to position military
equipment on ships in Thai waters but said he was sure other sites could be
found. The US wants to keep weapons and vehicles ready in the region to be
able to respond quickly to crises in the Middle East or Asia; such equipment
could also be used for humanitarian purposes, Mr Christopher told a news
conference.
He said he would not be surprised if the reason for President Saddam
Hussein's recent withdrawal of Iraqi troops from the Kuwaiti border was the
rapid arrival of US troops flown in to man equipment already positioned in
the Gulf.
Mr Christopher yesterday met Mr Chuan Leekpai, the Thai prime minister, and
the foreign and defence ministers. The government had previously decided
that US arms stocks might endanger rather than promote peace.
Thailand has been a close US ally since the Vietnam war, and Mr Christopher
said the strong security relationship continued. The US armed forces have
conducted 35 joint exercises with the Thai military this year, more than
with any other Asian country, and the US has access to Thai ports and
airfields.

Hong Kong cleared another hurdle yesterday in its quest for a comprehensive
agreement with China on building a modern airport and railway. The
Sino-British Land Commission agreed the terms by which the land occupied by
the airport and its connecting railway will be vested in the two government
corporations responsible for the project. The land will be released as part
of the commission's annual land grants over the coming three years as the
need for it arises. Sales of the land are expected to help finance the whole
project to the tune of HKDollars 20bn (Pounds 1.6bn).
The agreement comes ahead of deliberations today in the colony's Legislation
Council on a government request for HKDollars 23bn in funds for the project.
The council is expected to support this request, which will clear the way
for the Mass Transit Railway Corporation to award formally many works
contracts it had only let provisionally. These are expected to total in
excess of HKDollars 15bn and will cover such items as rolling stock.
Britain and China have yet to agree the detailed terms by which the MTRC and
the Provisional Airport Authority will be permitted to borrow a further
HKDollars 23bn of funds. The Hong Kong government hopes agreement can be
reached by the end of the year.

China yesterday issued another urgent call for belt-tightening as inflation
defied controls, the value of industrial output surged and the goal of
cooling the booming economy receded out of sight. Consumer price inflation
was a year-on-year 27.7 per cent in October, the State Statistical Bureau
said in a report carried by the official Xinhua news agency. The consumer
price index in October was 1.7 per cent higher than in September. For a
chosen group of 35 cities, the index rose by 24.8 per cent compared with the
same month in 1993 and was 1.0 per cent higher than in September, indicating
that urban price rises may be slowing.
China has adopted urgent measures to control inflation, including limiting
new construction projects and squeezing credit, but has already said it will
fail to hold price rises to its target of 10 per cent this year. Retail
sales in October jumped by 37.4 per cent to Yn144.4bn (Pounds 10.3bn), the
biggest monthly rise this year, the bureau said. The Finance Ministry
directive, broadcast on state radio, ordered departments and state
enterprises not to exceed wage and bonus limits before the end of the year
and to curb what it called rapid growth in the spending of state funds on
consumer items.
The value of industrial output in October rose 24.3 per cent on a
year-on-year basis to Yn142.6bn or a 6 per cent increase compared with
September when calculated on a daily basis, the statistics bureau said.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Drugs improve heart patients' prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first strong evidence that cholesterol-lowering drugs reduce mortality
and improve health in heart disease patients is published today.
The five-year Scandinavian study followed 4,444 people who had suffered
heart attacks or angina (chest pains). Half were treated with simvastatin, a
medicine to reduce cholesterol levels in the blood, and half took dummy
tablets.
There were 30 per cent fewer deaths overall and 42 per cent fewer deaths
from cardiovascular (heart) disease among the treated group.
The trial was financed by Merck, the US drug company that makes simvastatin,
but conducted independently by cardiologists in five Scandinavian countries.
The results, presented at the American Heart Association annual meeting in
Dallas, are published in The Lancet, a UK medical journal.
The study steering committee called it 'the first and only clinical trial to
demonstrate conclusively that long-term therapy with a cholesterol-lowering
medicine substantially improves survival.'
Prof John Kjekshus, the study chairman, said: 'Over the next five years we
expect these findings to have a tremendous impact on standard treatment for
heart attack and angina patients. The message is very clear: if you have a
heart attack, you have to reduce cholesterol. It is as important as quitting
smoking.'
Until now, many doctors have been reluctant to prescribe drugs to reduce
cholesterol, a fatty substance that clogs up blood vessels, because there
has been no proof that they extend life.
Other specialists who were not involved in the study agreed on its
significance. 'I think this is the trial that was necessary to convince the
sceptics,' said Dr Malcolm Law of St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. 'It
should change medical practice.'
Professor Brian Pentecost, medical director of the British Heart Foundation,
also called the study 'very encouraging'.
Merck is the world's leading manufacturer of cholesterol-lowering drugs. Its
sales of simvastatin and lovastatin, a similar drug, amounted to Dollars
2.2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) last year and could rise substantially if more doctors
prescribe them for heart patients.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Fatal weakness in the Irish body politic: In a crisis, a
minister is almost certain to fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the scale of Ireland's political crisis this week began to sink in, Irish
commentators were yesterday leafing through their files trying to make sense
of the mess.
Was it really on a scale with the beef sales scandal, the 1990 presidential
election bugging affair or the 1970s Haughey arms scandal, as the newspapers
suggested? Or is Ireland simply afflicted with an inability to make
coalition government work?
To the outsider, the break-up of the third coalition in as many years is all
the more surprising given what has been a commendable record on the economy,
an apparently harmonious approach to difficult social policy reforms and a
key breakthrough in Northern Ireland, where the outgoing prime minister, Mr
Albert Reynolds, was largely instrumental in helping to secure an IRA
ceasefire.
In the pandemonium that gripped the Dail, the Irish parliament, this week,
there was something of an inevitability that the Chinese whispers wafting
from the chamber would lead to the government's break-up.
As more and more emerged of the row that was sparked by Mr Reynolds'
appointment of his attorney-general, Mr Harry Whelehan, as president of the
High Court, a move bitterly criticised by his Labour party coalition
partner, the question was not if but when it would happen.
What did it in the end was the resignation as deputy prime minister of Mr
Dick Spring, the Labour party leader, on Wednesday. Mr Spring accused Mr
Reynolds of misleading him and the Dail about the failure of Mr Whelehan's
department to act for seven months on a request from British-ruled Northern
Ireland for the extradition of a priest who was later convicted of child
sex-abuse.
But it was more than that issue alone. With a population of 3.5m people,
about that of a medium-sized European city, Ireland has politics with a
special type of intimacy. The Charlies and Alberts who run the country's
political parties are household names in a way quite different from much of
Europe's politicians. Ireland also has a relatively small civil service. It
is not so easy for a politician to hide behind his official, though Mr
Reynold as a last resort, in perhaps his most tragic pose, did his best.
What is perhaps more important is that in the neighbouring UK for instance,
a row like this would more than likely have been absorbed somewhere within
the bureaucracy, by the creation of an inquiry or commission or by the
removal of a minor official. In Ireland, when a crisis breaks, it seems
almost a given that a government minister will fall.
Part of the problem lies with the character of the Fianna Fail leadership.
The party, which for almost 40 years until 1973 ruled with a series of
majority governments, has since had to contemplate the need for coalitions -
an experience which, as recent events underline, has been far from easy. The
imperatives of accommodation and compromise have been difficult to reconcile
with Fianna Fail's corporatist can-do image and its back-room dealing.
The reasons go to the heart of its identity. For Fianna Fail is not so much
a party as a political movement. The comparison often made is with Gaullism
in France. Traditionally, the party has been a broad church, an alliance of
interest groups, including business and labour, underpinned by a strong
republican ideology.
But today, with the rural vote base eroded as people move off the land, so
the electorate has become more difficult to please. The large number of
parties in Ireland - six of some size are now represented in the Dail -
underscores the breakdown of the old political loyalties and the dramatic
social and demographic changes that have taken place in the last two
decades.
Mr Reynolds is the last of the old school of Fianna Fail leaders. His
successor - Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, last night seemed the
favourite to win if the parliamentary party's poll goes ahead tomorrow as
planned - will be under increasing pressure to show that the party can live
by its coalition undertakings.
Yesterday there was some bitterness in Fianna Fail circles that Mr Spring
had openly schemed for the prime minister's downfall. Such is the breakdown
in trust between Fianna Fail and the other parties that many of its MPs last
night seemed prepared for a period in opposition.
Mr Reynolds had made clear to the house, in his defence on Tuesday, that
'good government must be decisive'. His error was not to have made the
decision to appoint the attorney general, as he then argued, but to proceed
without having brought Labour on board.
The facts are still a little hazy. Even at the last hour, as Mr Spring made
clear, the government could have been saved.
In the end it was a morning telephone conversation with the new attorney
general, which revealed that the prime minister had misled the Dail, which
sealed the coalition's fate.
As P J Mara, a well known voice in Irish politics and one-time adviser of Mr
Haughey, said: 'I'm deeply saddened. A generic sadness.'

FT  18 NOV 94 / Obituary - Magda Hamsher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Magda Hamsher, editorial office manager for the FT in Paris for almost 20
years until last July, died suddenly but peacefully at her home on November
15. She was born in Moravia and studied English and French literature at the
Charles University in Prague. In 1948, she married an English journalist,
Bill Hamsher, who was reporting the Communist takeover. After a brief stay
in London, they were posted by the Daily Express to Berlin (where their
three children were born) and then to Bonn, before settling in Paris.
After Bill's death, Magda was recruited by Bob Mauthner, then FT bureau
chief in Paris, to run the office administration and build up the filing
system. She was unfailingly cheerful, and always delighted when a useful
source document could be swiftly traced, in spite of the reluctance of
journalists to put anything back in its place. She was even more pleased
when, with a diffident confidence, she was able to educate one of her
colleagues on some point of French history or politics without reference to
any source material. The Velvet Revolution in Prague in 1989 thrilled her.
It also brought to Paris a childhood friend, Hugo Mensdorff-Pouilly, who
brought a charming romance to the last five years of her life. She is
survived by Hugo and her three children.

West German wholesale prices fell 0.3 per cent in October from September,
but were up 2.7 per cent from a year earlier, the federal statistics office
said. Figures for the previous month were rises of 0.1 per cent and 2.8 per
cent respectively. Wholesale prices of fish products jumped 26.1 per cent in
October from the previous month. Coffee extract prices rose 11.5 per cent,
aluminium 6.4 per cent, organic chemicals and basic products 3.4 per cent,
plastics 3.3 per cent and heavy heating oil 2.4 per cent. By contrast, the
wholesale price of raw coffee fell 13.4 per cent, fresh fruit 12.3 per cent
and fresh vegetables 9.9 per cent.
Turkey's foreign trade deficit narrowed to Dollars 207m (Pounds 132m) in
September against Dollars 1.141bn a year earlier, according to official
figures. For the first nine months, the deficit fell to Dollars 3,793bn from
Dollars 10,440bn in the same period of 1993.

<TEXT>
Moslem rebel forces backed by Serbs yesterday pressed forward in the
northwestern Bosnian enclave around the town of Bihac, with the United
Nations threatening to call in air strikes if the town itself was attacked.
Forces loyal to renegade leader Fikret Abdic were reported to be closing in
on the UN-designated safe area, as Bosnian Serb forces came within 2km of
the town. Meanwhile, two people were wounded in a missile attack on
Sarajevo, prompting the UN to call in Nato fighters to buzz the capital.
'Any attack on the safe area of Bihac would inevitably result in the use of
Nato air power,' said Mr Paul Risley, UN spokesman. But a defiant Bosnian
Serb commander General Manojlo Milovanovic promised to attack if the Bosnian
fifth corps withdrew into the town. Mr Abdic's forces crossed into the Bihac
pocket on Wednesday from Serb-held territory in Croatia in a push bolstered
by Serb troops and heavy artillery from Krajina, their self-styled state in
Croatia.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Milan court in bourse ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Milan court has made the first ruling under Italy's three-year-old law
banning insider trading. The court imposed a L20m (Pounds 8,000) fine and a
four-month suspended jail sentence on Mr Giuseppe Gennari, a Tuscan
financier, for manipulating the market. The rules against insider trading,
passed in 1991, have been criticised as cumbersome and legalistic. But
Consob, the Italian stock exchange watchdog which brought the case, hailed
the judgment as a landmark ruling which would reassure small shareholders
and international investors. The development of Italy's comparatively small
equity market was blighted in the late 1980s and early 1990s by a reputation
for widespread insider trading.
Mr Gennari was accused of manipulating the stock market, rather than
profiting directly from insider information. In February 1992, he announced
that he had agreed to buy control of the troubled Banca Nazionale
dell'Agricoltura for some L1,200bn, roughly double the then market price.
The news was almost immediately denied by Count Giovanni Auletta Armenise,
whose stake Mr Gennari claimed to be buying. Consob was forced to suspend
BNA shares and those of related quoted companies to avoid further confusion
in the market. Mr Gennari's lawyers argued during the case that he made the
announcement in good faith.

<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of France and Britain are today expected to unveil a planning unit
to co-ordinate use of their air forces in peacekeeping missions. Greater
defence co-operation will be the main theme at today's one-day summit
meeting in Chartres. Prime Minister John Major and several of his cabinet
will have some six hours of talks with the French side, led by President
Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. On defence there is
a communion of interest between France's ambition for a strong EU defence
effort and the UK's desire to play a positive role in foreign and defence
policy discussions in advance of the EU's 1996 constitutional conference
that may pit London and Paris against each other on other issues.
The air planning unit will initially involve only about 10 officers from
both air forces. But it is part of a broader defence dialogue which has
involved contacts between French and UK rapid deployment forces, and a
continuing discussion of nuclear doctrine. On joint arms projects, France
will be keen to press the UK to join it and other Europeans in building the
Future Large Aircraft, a new troop transport designed to give European
armies the capacity to project power overseas.

FT  18 NOV 94 / EU telecoms deadline set
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EU member states last night set a clear deadline of January 1 1998 for
liberalising telecommunications infrastructures. In a move which should
sharply lower prices in Europe's highly regulated telecoms sector, industry
ministers agreed to open up all networks to competition within three years.
Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece can delay by a further five years if
they choose. The move will allow companies offering telecom services a much
greater choice of network provider and the right to build their own
infrastructures.
The decision fell well short of Commission ambitions to press ahead with
liberalisation of infrastructures next year, however. And at the end of the
meeting advocates of swifter deregulation - Germany, France, the
Netherlands, Sweden, Finland and Britain - issued a statement urging
Brussels to 'come forward as quickly as possible with proposals' to
liberalise the alternative networks such as cable TV, road, rail and energy
networks.
Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, is considering using special
powers that would allow him to force open cable TV networks to competition,
without a vote from the council of ministers.

FT  18 NOV 94 / European monetary union 'feasible by 1997'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European economic and monetary union is 'a definite possibility for 1997',
the earliest date envisaged in the Maastricht treaty, a senior European
Commission official said in London yesterday.
Mr Giovanni Ravasio, the commission's director-general for economic and
financial affairs, said many European Union member states, 'and maybe even a
majority', had the potential to meet the treaty's economic conver-gence
criteria by the end of 1996.
In a speech designed to give impetus to an early move by the European Union
to stage three of Emu with its single currency and central bank, Mr Ravasio
said Emu was 'a feasible option for 1997' provided member states kept up
efforts to consolidate their public finances.
It was perhaps no coincidence that Mr Ravasio chose to deliver his message
to a largely pro-EU audience in London, the home of Euro-scepticism. He
admitted that many people had struck 1997 as a possible date for Emu from
their diaries after the currency turmoil of 1992 and 1993. But at a
conference organised by the Federal Trust and Salomon Brothers
International, he argued that EU countries were already well on the way to
meeting the tough conditions set for Emu in the Maastricht treaty:
On inflation, he said the treaty's criteria 'would already be met today'
because seven member states are expected to have an inflation rate this year
that is no more than 1.5 percentage points higher than the best performing
EU country.
A majority of member states meets the criterion that their nominal long-term
interest rates are no more than 2 percentage points higher than the best
performing countries.
At least half EU members have experienced relatively stable exchange rates
since the crisis surrounding the French franc in August last year.
Although cutting budget deficits and debt to gross domestic product ratios
constituted the 'biggest challenge' ahead, Mr Ravasio said: 'I don't think
it is too optimistic to say that, by the end of 1996, a number of countries
can manage to get rid of their excessive deficits.'
He made clear that countries' budget positions could not be judged simply by
the Maastricht criteria of 3 per cent of GDP for annual deficits and 60 per
cent of GDP for overall government debt levels. The treaty allowed
exceptions which, if applied to the letter, did not amount to a weakening of
the convergence criteria.
For example, the commission had decided Ireland was not infringing the EU's
excessive deficit rules, because its debt to GDP ratio had declined at a
'satisfactory' pace to an expected 93 per cent this year from 116 per cent
in 1987, he said.
Mr Ravasio advocated similar flexibility with regard to the Maastricht rule
that EU countries should only be ripe for Emu if their currencies had
participated without problems in the European Monetary System for two years.
Since last August's widening of the bands of the European exchange rate
mechanism to plus/minus 15 per cent, he said 'the key element' for the
interpretation of the exchange rate criterion was 'de facto stability of
exchange rates'.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Germany's five wise men urge deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German economy is set to grow by 3 per cent in 1995, but any sustained
and export-led recovery must be coupled with more deregulation,
liberalisation, and a more competitive cost structure, the 'Five Wise Men',
an independent panel of experts and economists, warned yesterday.
In their annual report, the wise men estimate that pan-German gross domestic
product will grow by 3 per cent in 1995, the same as the German government's
forecasts but 0.5 per cent more than expected by the Organisation for
European Co-operation and Development. The west German economy will grow by
2.5 per cent while in east Germany GDP will grow by 9 per cent. Recovery in
the eastern states is coming from a very low base, having fallen by 30 per
cent between 1990 and 1992.
The main engine for growth remains exports, which according to the wise men
will increase by 5.5 per cent next year, a considerable increase from 1993,
when exports fell 7 per cent. They suggest that unemployment, which will
fall by 30,000 to 2.53m in west Germany and by 60,000 to 1.09m in the east,
can only be tackled through reforming the wage and social benefit structure.
The wise men propose excluding those with few qualifications from certain
wage negotiations in order to reduce companies' social welfare, unemployment
and health payments. The savings could encourage employers to create more
jobs. Already, some industries are negotiating wage rounds independently of
unions to try to retain competitiveness and save jobs.
The report coincided with the appointment of a new cabinet by Chancellor
Helmut Kohl. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the
economics minister, and Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, all retain
their posts.
Mr Kohl appointed Ms Claudia Nolte, 28, a former engineer, as minister for
family, elderly, women and youth. These were formerly two separate
ministries.
Ms Nolte, a catholic activist in the former east Germany, succeeds Ms Angela
Merkel, another east German, who takes over the environment ministry, while
Mr Klaus Topfer moves to construction and housing. Mr Jurgen Ruttgers, 43,
heads the newly merged ministries of research and development, and science
and education.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Nice keeps a place in its heart for Medecin: The return of
the fugitive former mayor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone walking into the shop-front office of the Moral Support Committee for
Jacques Medecin in Nice might be forgiven for thinking they were in the
headquarters of a political campaign rather than of a group lobbying for the
liberty of the disgraced former mayor of France's fifth largest city.
A flashing pink neon sign outside, the 'Free Jacques Medecin' banners and
smiling photos on the walls and the phones answered by a team of volunteers
belie an organisation supposedly created to uplift the spirits of the
politician who returned from self-imposed exile yesterday.
After more than four years in Uruguay - and most of the last 12 months in a
Montevideo jail - Mr Medecin had no choice but to return to Paris yesterday
in compliance with an extradition order, on his way to interrogation in
Grenoble. He comes back to a country sharply transformed in its attitude to,
and exposure of, allegations of corruption ensnaring political parties,
businesses and a growing network of individuals alike.
While Mr Medecin has already been tried and sentenced in his absence to a
year's imprisonment and also faces large tax bills and demands to repay more
than FFr41m (Pounds 4.9m) to the city's treasury, his reputation in Nice is
far from universally tarnished.
Mr Robert Bagat, who founded the Medecin support committee over the summer,
confidently predicts that a welcoming convoy of 50 cars stuffed with flowers
and fans will be heading to Grenoble this weekend.
The owner of a lighting shop, Mr Bagat says he started the committee because
it was 'unjustifiable' to incarcerate a Frenchman without trial in another
country. He says he has collected some 15,000 signatures of support - albeit
many from foreign visitors.
A second committee of local merchants has dubbed itself the 'Liga Nissarda'
and used the mayor's image to launch a range of publicity stunts in recent
weeks. There is also a ready bandwagon of supporters - including Mr
Medecin's first wife, daughter and sister - ready to speak up for him.
There are regular weekly meetings, a Radio Jacques Medecin provides regular
updates on its subject, and his book, 'An exemplary lynching', published in
April, is turning into a local bestseller. Mr Medecin is threatening to
cause plenty of trouble for his opponents, before running for office again
in Nice - and even for the presidency.
His supporters argue that Mr Medecin had the misfortune to be among the
earliest victims of the intensifying public campaign now gripping the
country against allegations of corruption. They also claim he is the victim
of a plot by Socialist rivals. His book is even sub-titled 'Mitterrand
killed me'.
The list of his alleged activities is impressive. The Cour des Comptes in
Marseilles, which scrutinises public expenditure, has already issued
judgments against him in connection with three 'dossiers' involving the
misuse of public funds totalling over FFr600m. 'This is by a long way the
champion case since the (second world) war,' says Mr Alain Serieyx, the
Cour's head.
The warrants from prosecutors in Nice and Grenoble that led to Mr Medecin's
extradition charge him with corruption and improper receipt of funds in
connection with several 'para-municipal' organisations.
No surprise that the local Communist party demonstrated outside the city
hall earlier this week calling for the courts to make an example of him.
The puzzling question for many observers north of the Mediterranean city is
why there is not more such opposition to the former mayor. One explanation
lies in his ambitious projects for the city: an art museum, a theatre
complex, the Acropolis conference centre. 'He made Nice,' says Mr Bagat
simply.
Like many politicians of the era, Mr Medecin has been able to claim credit
for grand schemes at a time of relative economic prosperity (leaving the
city with debts of FFr4.7bn) while evading responsibility during the more
recent downturn. He was also able to benefit from considerable
decentralisation of power and money that was government policy in the early
1980s.
Another clue comes in the old town of Nice. The narrow, winding streets and
overhanging balconies, reminiscent of the Middle Ages, seem fitting for a
city which treated Mr Medecin more as monarch than mayor.
He and his father Jean, after whom he renamed one of the main streets, ruled
the city in an almost uninterrupted reign since 1928. 'Jacquou' also brought
glamour and charisma to the place. 'If you spent half an hour with him you
would be charmed,' says Genevieve, his sister. His former wife, Claude,
adds: 'Nice was dynamic. Now it is sleeping.'

FT  18 NOV 94 / Swedish Yes vote boosts Norway's pro-EU campaign: The
referendum on entry to the European Union promises to be very close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Anne Enger Lahnstein, the popular leader of Norway's anti-European Union
campaign, makes light of the Swedish 'slip-stream effect' on the referendum
on Norwegian EU membership on November 28.
'I've heard that if Norway stays out, we will be left with Iceland,
Liechtenstein and Lahnstein,' the leader of the main opposition Centre party
told a crowded rally in an Oslo suburb this week.
The embattled Yes camp is hoping that the Swedish vote last Sunday to join
the EU will exert a strong pull, persuading many Norwegians to swing in
favour of membership to avoid the risk of leaving the country isolated
outside the Union.
This much-talked-about pull effect on Norway goes by the somewhat risque
term Svenskesuget, literally 'Swedish suck'.
Beneath the veneer of confidence and the jokes, however, there are now clear
signs that the Norwegian No campaign, which has held a commanding lead in
the opinion polls for the last two years, is nervous that the tide has
indeed begun to turn since the Swedish vote.
In her appeal to 300 No supporters in the working-class district of Romsas,
Ms Lahnstein acknowledged that the No campaign faced a tough battle. 'We
have to mobilise our forces. The Yes side has decided not to lose this time.
It is going to be one hell of a fight,' she said.
Since the Swedish vote on Sunday, the Yes campaign has advanced
significantly in the opinion polls, gaining up to six points to narrow the
gap to around 55-45, with one poll showing the Yes vote rising to as high as
48 per cent.
The No campaign, which fears loss of sovereignty and loss of control over
Norway's oil and fishing resources in the EU, brings together the
rurally-based Centre party, left-wing and environment groups, fishing
communities and farmers.
It hopes that most of the 'Swedish suck' effect has already played itself
out. But the No campaigners recognise that the pro-EU forces, led by Prime
Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland's Labour government, have saved most of their
resources until after the Swedish vote and are now pounding home their
message that Norway must not be left behind as both Sweden and Finland go
into the EU.
'We don't take anything for granted,' said Mr Hallvard Bakke, a dissident
former Labour minister prominent in the No campaign. 'They may still win.'
The government and its allies in the Yes camp - which include the opposition
Conservative party and the vast majority of Norway's business and industrial
leaders - believe the EU debate is shifting at last onto the ground upon
which they all along wanted to fight.
Instead of getting bogged down in detailed arguments about issues such as
the effect of membership on Norway's influential fishing and farming
sectors, increasingly the debate is focusing on Norway's political,
strategic and economic role in Europe, and the potential loss of influence
and investment it faces if it votes to stay outside - as it did in 1972 in
an earlier referendum.
Mr Inge Lonning, leader of Norway's European Movement, says he believes many
Norwegians are uncomfortable with the notion that the country - a founder
member of Nato - might take a clear step away from its central role in
European security issues just as neutral Sweden and Finland move towards
European security co-operation.
'Our task in the last 10 days is to get people to understand the political
consequences of a No vote - Norway will take over a somewhat neutral
position while our Nordic neighbours will move the other way,' he said.
In these 10 days, the Yes campaign will be dominated by senior government
figures such as Mrs Brundtland attempting to use the authority of office to
swing the many undecided voters - just as Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Swedish
prime minister, succeeded in doing in Sweden.
With the rural and remote northern areas clearly set to vote heavily No, the
campaign will be won and lost - as it was in Sweden and Finland - in the
urban areas and among the divided supporters of the Labour party, easily the
country's biggest political movement.
Both Yes and No campaigns are pouring resources into the greater Oslo area,
which has more than one third of the 4.3m population, and the other big
cities of Bergen, Stavanger and Trondheim.
'Both sides are frantic now because they know it is going to be very close,'
said Mr John Harbo, one of Norway's most experienced political commentators.
An against-the-odds victory in the referendum may yet be possible for Mrs
Brundtland. But agonisingly for her, a win on November 28 may not settle the
issue. Ratification of membership requires a three-quarters parliamentary
majority. If the vote is a narrow yes, the Centre party is likely to seek to
block accession.
With 32 MPs of its own, the party could well gather enough support from
leftist and other anti-EU members to win the 42 votes needed for a blocking
minority.
'If we get a narrow Yes vote, the campaign is not over,' said Mr Lonning.
'We will face a tremendous fight to win in parliament.'

FT  18 NOV 94 / France plans initiative on pensions reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, yesterday relaunched
plans to encourage private pension funds in France, announcing that a reform
of the country's pension system should be implemented next year.
'Conditions should be right for an initiative in 1995,' Mr Alphandery said
in a speech to members of the COB, the French stock market regulator.
The development of capitalised pension funds is seen as an important means
of reducing pressure on the existing 'pay-as-you-go' system and curbing the
French welfare deficit. But reforms have been delayed by the political
sensitivity of the issue and the complexity of reform.
The current system, in which pensions are paid from contributions from the
existing workforce, suffered a deficit of more than FFr40bn (Pounds 4.75bn)
last year and faces increased strains because of the country's ageing
population.
Mr Alphandery also regards private pension funds as a way of strengthening
France's financial markets and increasing long-term savings. 'Since this
government took office it has sought to shift short-term savings to the
medium or long term,' he said.
Measures to encourage the formation of private pension funds, originally
slated for this year, have been delayed by several factors. The reform of
the pensions system is politically sensitive and has been opposed by some
trade unions.
'The existing system is a source of solidarity between age groups and social
classes,' said an official at Force Ouvriere, one of France's largest
unions. 'Incentives for private schemes will favour the wealthy and will
harm the economy by reducing consumption.'
Reform has also been complicated by divergences between reform proposals and
disputes between companies seeking to participate in capitalised pension
schemes. The Patronat employers' federation, the Association of French banks
and Mr Jacques Barrot, chairman of the National Assembly's finance
committee, have all drawn up separate projects. Insurance companies and
banks have been at odds over whether retirement payments should be made in
lump sumps, which the banks favour, or in the form of annuities.
Industry observers said yesterday that the political sensitivity and
complexity of the issue meant reform was unlikely before next spring's
presidential election.
'I don't think we will see a text for a reform for the next few months,'
said one French merchant banker.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Ireland in turmoil as Reynolds steps down: High Court
president resigns - Doubts raised over pace of Ulster peace talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ireland was pitched into a fresh political crisis last night after the prime
minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, and his Fianna Fail cabinet colleagues
resigned.
Their decision, which could result in a lengthy phase of political
instability in the republic, raises concerns about the momentum of the
Northern Ireland peace process.
The resignations were followed later in the day by that of Mr Harry Whelehan
as president of the High Court. He said he was quitting because 'the
judiciary must enjoy total and unquestioning public respect'.
Mr Reynolds, in his resignation speech, told the parliament: 'You win some -
and you lose some. But, above all, throughout my life I have been delighted
to have been a risk-taker.'
Former attorney-general Mr Whelehan's judicial appointment triggered the
collapse of the 22-month old coalition on Wednesday. Labour had accused Mr
Reynolds of misleading parliament over the delayed extradition to Northern
Ireland of a Catholic priest, later convicted of child abuse.
Mr Whelehan's resignation introduced an unexpected twist to a day of high
political drama in Dublin, raising the prospect that Mr Reynolds might try
to hang on to the party leadership.
Last night his position as party leader was still unclear after it emerged
that a meeting of the Fianna Fail parliamentary party had not accepted his
resignation. A meeting to resolve the party leadership issue is expected to
be held tomorrow.
Two candidates last night declared their intention to fight for the
leadership. Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, the justice minister, said that she
would be offering her candidacy if Mr Reynolds were to step down.
Mr Bertie Ahern, until yesterday the finance minister, also announced he
planned to stand.
Ireland, for the time being, is in the hands of a caretaker government. With
little prospect of an early resolution to the crisis, there are growing
doubts about the pace of talks between Dublin and London on the vital
framework document for a constitutional settlement to Northern Ireland's
political problems.
In London, Mr John Major, who was informed of Mr Reynolds' resignation
during a morning cabinet meeting, wrote to thank him for his contribution to
the peace process.
Downing Street said the prime minister was sorry that his 'extremely good'
working relationship with his former Irish counterpart was at an end. He
intended to speak to Mr Reynolds before the end of the week.
But as Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army, used a visit to London to accuse Britain of dragging
its feet on efforts to forge a lasting settlement in Ulster, senior UK
ministers insisted that the peace process would continue.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, told parliament the process did not
'depend on any individual'. The government would 'press ahead' with
exploratory talks with Sinn Fein and loyalist representatives next month.
Downing Street said the two governments were 'close to agreement' on the
framework document which would form the basis of future talks involving
Ulster's main political parties.
Mr Adams appeared sceptical. The process of trying to reach agreement had
been going on 'for months and months', he said.
The prospect of a protracted search for a new Irish government - and
possibly an early general election - could dangerously delay the joint
framework document.
In the confusion generated by the day's resignations, however, it was not
clear that a new general election would even be necessary.
Mr Dick Spring, the Labour leader, said he had 'an open mind' on all
possibilities for forming another coalition.

FT  18 NOV 94 / AFG sale severs Botnar's UK motor link: Barclay brothers buy
car retailer for estimated Pounds 200m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Automotive Financial Group Holdings, one of the biggest UK motor retailer
groups, controlled by Mr Octav Botnar, has been sold to the Barclay
brothers, the reclusive UK entrepreneurs, in a deal understood to be worth
about Pounds 200m.
The deal, one of the biggest acquisitions ever made in the UK retail motor
industry, marks the first entry into the sector of the Barclay twins, who
have built a private fortune based on property, shipping and hotels, and who
in 1992 bought The European newspaper from the wreckage of the late Mr
Robert Maxwell's business empire.
The purchase is understood to include all the retail motor network of
Automotive and Financial Group (AFG), comprising more than 70 dealerships,
as well as Automotive Financial Services, AFGH's finance division.
AFG is one of the biggest UK multi-franchise dealer groups representing some
of the world's leading carmakers including Fiat, Citroen, Peugeot, Renault,
Honda and Vauxhall (General Motors).
Mr David and Mr Frederick Barclay, identical twins based in Monaco, face the
immediate task of winning backing for the takeover from these carmakers, of
which at least one is understood to have been considering the withdrawal of
its franchise from AFG because of dissatisfaction over its operating
performance.
The AFGH group achieved an overall pre-tax profit of Pounds 11.05m in the
financial year to the end of July 1993 but only due to a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 27.8m achieved by Automotive Financial Services and a pre-tax profit
of Pounds 4.6m from the group's property division. The AFG motor dealer
operations fell to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 21.2m.
AFG was forced to undertake a drastic restructuring in response to the loss
of the Nissan importer/distributor franchise by its sister company Nissan UK
in 1991.
The sale of the business to the Barclay brothers marks the effective
withdrawal from the UK motor industry of Mr Botnar, one of the sector's most
controversial figures, who has lived in Switzerland since 1992, when a
warrant was issued for his arrest by the Inland Revenue.
In the late 1980s, Mr Botnar, now 81, controlled one of the most lucrative
privately-owned motor businesses in the UK with a pre-tax profit in the 12
months to the end of July 1990 of Pounds 142.6m on a turnover of Pounds
1.76bn.
This included Nissan UK - a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nissan UK Holdings -
which held the importer/distributor franchise for Nissan vehicles in Britain
and controlled 6 per cent of the UK new car market, as well as the AFG
retail motor business, which at its peak had as many as 180 dealerships. Mr
Botnar's operations have been in turmoil, however, since Nissan Motor, the
Japanese carmaker, took away the Nissan franchise amid a legal battle with
effect from the end of 1991. Nissan UK has been at the centre of Britain's
biggest corporation tax fraud.
Last year Mr Michael Hunt, a director of NUK, was sentenced to eight years
in prison for conspiring at NUK to defraud the Inland Revenue of Pounds 55m
in corporation tax. An arrest warrant was issued for Mr Botnar, but he has
never returned to the UK.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Sony to write off Pounds 1.67bn from Hollywood film arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sony, the Japanese consumer electronics company, yesterday counted the cost
of its controversial diversification into the Hollywood film industry by
announcing that it was writing Y265bn (Pounds 1.67bn) off the value of its
US movie subsidiary.
The write-off was the chief cause of Sony's decline in the first half of
this year. It made a consolidated loss of Y279.9bn in the six months to
September 30 against a pre-tax profit of Y56.6bn for the same period last
year.
Sony said that its core consumer electronics business and US music interests
had fared well during the first half. However, it admitted that it would
stay in the red with a pre-tax loss of Y205bn for the full financial year.
Its shares fell in Tokyo and closed Dollars 3 1/2 down in New York at
Dollars 55.
The Sony announcement, following last month's row between Matsushita,
another Japanese electronics group, and the management of MCA, its US
entertainment subsidiary, highlights the problems faced by the Japanese in
adapting to the different culture of their Hollywood subsidiaries.
The Japanese 'invasion' of Hollywood was contentious from the start. It
began in 1989 when Sony paid Dollars 3.4bn for Columbia Pictures and Tristar
Pictures, and formed Sony Pictures Entertainment. It continued in the
following year with Matsushita's Dollars 6.1bn acquisition of MCA. The
Japanese, it was said, had 'gone to Hollywood and been mugged'.
Sony yesterday conceded that 'in light of substantial investment' in SPE
'the business has not provided adequate returns'. It also said that
'additional funding will be needed to attain acceptable levels of
profitability'.
Industry estimates suggest that Sony has already invested Dollars 8bn in SPE
(including the original Dollars 3.4bn offer price). Earlier this year, it
effectively lent Y70bn to SPE through its music subsidiary.
SPE fared relatively well in its first years. Its performance has since
deteriorated, hitting a nadir with last year's Last Action Hero starring
Arnold Schwarzenegger. The Sony studios, which were linked to the Heidi
Fleiss sex scandal, were last month shaken by the resignation of Mr Peter
Guber, their chairman.
The Sony group mustered a 4 per cent increase in overall turnover to
Y1,837bn in the first half from Y1,767bn, despite a 14 per cent fall in
sales from its movie interests.
Sony incurred a Y50bn loss on its movie interests at the operating level,
which covers abandoning some films in development and providing for a number
of outstanding lawsuits.
The core electronics business benefited from cost-cutting and improved
demand. Mr Barry Dargan, industry analyst at SG Warburg in Tokyo, said
Sony's long-term outlook had improved after the writedown as the group had
'cleared the decks'.

FT  18 NOV 94 / Retailers fear tough Christmas as rise in sales slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading conditions for Britain's shops in the crucial pre-Christmas period
will be tough, retailers warned yesterday.
Although official figures showed that retail sales in October were higher
than last year, the rate of growth has slowed in recent months and price
competition remains intense.
The Central Statistical Office said retail sales volumes in October were a
seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent higher than in September. Year on year
growth slowed to 3.1 per cent in October, from 3.5 per cent in September.
On a three-month basis, a more accurate indication of trends, sales volumes
were 0.6 per cent higher than over the three months to July, a slightly
slower rate of growth than in previous months.
Highlighting the fierce price competition in the high street, the value of
retail sales rose only 0.7 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis in the
three months to October, compared with the previous three months.
Adding to the picture of subdued retail activity, Bank of England figures
showed yesterday that the annual growth rate of notes and coins in
circulation in the past week stood at 5.8 per cent, the lowest since
mid-July.
The combination of slack consumer demand and low inflation will be welcomed
by the government as it prepares for the Budget on November 29.
Officials believe economic growth is now 're-balancing' from consumer demand
towards an industry-based recovery.
The figures disappointed retailers. Mr James May, director general of the
British Retail Consortium, said: 'We now expect Christmas trading to be
tough, with consumers spending wisely and carefully, but achieving levels
slightly ahead of last year.'

FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Japanese trading houses forecast
profits growth - Trading companies

Japan's five biggest trading companies, which provide a diversified measure
of the health of the economy at large, yesterday forecast their first
profits rises in four years.
Trading house earnings, sensitive to domestic and foreign demand for goods
and services and to changes in world commodity prices, were down or flat in
the first half of the year, according to financial results released
yesterday.
However, the traders, at the heart of Japan's vast keiretsu corporate
families, forecast that recurring profits - before tax and extraordinary
items - in the full year to next March would, on average, rise 3.5 per cent.
They will be helped by the slow recovery of the Japanese economy and a
reduction in the debts built up to finance takeovers and diversifications in
the 1980s. Yet the revival will be constrained by the strength of the yen,
the main reason why full-year sales are expected to fall by an average of 3
per cent.
All of the top five expect a rise in full-year recurring profits, except for
Marubeni, which nevertheless expects a rise at the net level.
This implies that the second half will show a significant improvement on the
first half, when three out of the five reported a fall in recurring profits
by comparison with the first six months of last year. Mitsubishi, the
strongest of the group, and Itochu, reported only marginal profits
increases.
First-half sales declined by an average of 2.5 per cent across the sector,
except at Marubeni. It managed a 1 per cent sales increase, helped by
exports of industrial plant - worth around 30 per cent of gross profits - to
other Asian countries.
Sumitomo also stood out from the pack for its 16 per cent rise in operating
profit in the first half, forecast to rise to 42 per cent for the year. It
has a higher exposure to metal trading than the others and so has benefited
from the strong rise in copper prices during the period, although sharp cuts
in head office costs also helped.
Sumitomo and and Marubeni have their respective specialities, machinery and
metals, to thank for the fact that they were the only traders to manage a
rise in export sales in the first six months. The rest saw the yen value of
the their foreign sales eroded by the continuing rise in the Japanese
currency, by 6 per cent against the dollar over the period.
Domestic demand for foreign consumer goods started to climb sharply in the
spring, but the overall domestic economy was still sluggish enough to
produce a decline in total sales for most traders' import businesses.
International trade in cars and steel was generally weaker, while food
imports rose, said Mr Kazuhiko Usami, managing director of the Japan Foreign
Trade Council, the trading houses' association. Marubeni was worst hit, with
an 18.9 per cent decline in imports.
Trading companies' profits improvement is expected to lag Japan's general
economic recovery because they continue to be burdened by write-offs on
ill-judged experiments with financial engineering in the 1980s.
The sector's extraordinary losses on the disposal of so-called tokkin,
in-house investment trusts, fell on average and are expected to continue to
decline. At the same time, some of them are still paying start-up costs on
diversifications outside their core trading businesses, like Mitsubishi in
satellite communications and Sumitomo in cable television.

<TEXT>
The succession struggle at Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the French utility,
appears to be over. Next week's board meeting is expected to endorse Mr
Jean-Marie Messier, a 37-year-old Lazard Freres investment banker, as heir
to Mr Guy Dejouany, the 73-year-old chairman.
The only clear dissenter in the 13-man board remains Mr Jacques Calvet, the
head of the Peugeot car group, who at the November 23 board meeting is
expected to carry out his public threat to resign from CGE if Mr Messier is
'parachuted' in at such a high level.
He said he did not doubt Mr Messier's ability nor his character but
complained that the Lazards banker had no industrial experience.
Mr Calvet's reservations were initially shared by a few other CGE board
members. However, they have since decided that to repudiate Mr Dejouany's
strong desire to make Mr Messier his heir would provoke a boardroom row that
the group could ill afford.

FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Morocco completes withdrawal
from SNI

<TEXT>
The Moroccan government yesterday announced the sale for about Dollars 190m
of 51 per cent of Societe Nationale d'Investissement (SNI), the holding
company which has significant interests in a range of big local companies,
to a consortium of local and overseas interests.
International investors have bought 16 per cent of the company's total
equity, although two-thirds of these shares must be sold on the Casablanca
stock exchange within the next three years.
Mr Alex Papadimitriou, associate director of Swiss Bank Corporation, which,
along with Banque Pallas Stern, advised the government, described SNI as
'the jewel of Moroccan state-owned companies'.
The sale, which completes the government's withdrawal from SNI, is the
largest to date in the Moroccan privatisation programme, itself the most
significant in Africa and the Middle East. Banque Commerciale du Maroc led
the consortium which completed the purchase.
The shares were priced at Dh425 (Dollars 48.90).

FT  17 NOV 94 / US cruiser tracks Greek and Turkish contingents: Marine
rights row leads to fear of war between Nato neighbours
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A US Navy cruiser was yesterday monitoring Greek and Turkish naval
activities in the Aegean, where fears of war have been triggered by the
start of a new international law.
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea has been hailed in
Athens as a vindication of its long-standing argument that it has the right
to extend its territorial waters from 6 miles to 12.
Turkey has said that any such move by Athens would turn the Aegean into a
'Greek lake' and would be resisted by force. Greece says it has no plans to
extend its territorial waters, but it will not renounce the right to do so.
An opinion poll published this week showed that 79 per cent of Turks would
support war if Greece declared a 12-mile limit.
The quarrel dates from an offshore oil strike west of the Greek island of
Thasos more than 20 years ago. The Athens government rejects Turkish
proposals for joint oil exploration in the Aegean.
The Cape St George, a US cruiser equipped with the latest electronic
surveillance devices, was yesterday tracking Turkish warships and Greek
aircraft across the Aegean.
President Bill Clinton has written to the leaders of both countries urging
them to show restraint and avoid the risk of clashes.
Mr Mumtaz Soysal, the Turkish foreign minister, said Ankara has assured Mr
Clinton that it had taken all possible measures to avoid a clash. Mr Soysal
met Mr Karolos Papoulis, his Greek counterpart, in The Hague this week, but
there was little sign of a change in positions.
Turkey wants across-the-board negotiations on all the issues which it says
are in dispute. Greece says the only issue that needs discussing is that of
seabed mineral rights, which it wants settled by international arbitration.
Relations between Athens and Ankara have also been worsened by the war in
former Yugoslavia, where Turkey supports the Bosnian Moslems while Greece
has traditional links with the Serbs.
Turkey was the only European member of Nato to support the US withdrawal
from the arms embargo against Bosnia. Recently, Turkey gave a new thrust to
the old antagonisms by accusing Greece of harbouring guerrillas from the
separatist Kurdistan Workers party (PKK) fighting in eastern Turkey.
The US Navy, in this year's annual intelligence report, described the
Greek-Turkish standoff as one of the 'most worrisome situations developing
in Europe and the most dangerous to Nato as an institution'.
The report says tension in the Aegean has also been stoked by supplies to
both countries of new and secondhand ships from other Nato countries.
Diplomats said they were alarmed that a hot-line between the two countries,
set up after they came close to war in 1987, had ceased to function.
Turkey is conducting its manoeuvres this week in international waters in the
northern Aegean. About 100 miles to the south, the Greek navy is in charge
of a Nato exercise held every year involving ships and aircraft from the US,
France, Italy, Spain and the UK.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Norway warned on EU entry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The head of Norway's leading bank warned yesterday that staying outside the
European Union could damage the country's oil and gas industry, the biggest
in western Europe. The anti-EU campaign maintains that membership would
threaten Oslo's control over its North Sea oil and gas production, which
accounts for 16 per cent of gross national product. But Mr Finn Hvistendahl,
president of Den Norske Bank, said Norway's oil production was declining and
that gas, which relies on European markets, would take over as the main
earner from the North Sea. It was vital, therefore, that the EU's long-term
energy policy, currently being formulated, put a heavy emphasis on the use
of natural gas.
'If Norway remains outside the EU, it will reduce our possibility to
influence the increase of gas consumption. There is no guarantee that the EU
will increase its dependence on energy from countries outside the EU while
it can develop nuclear power and maintain coal production,' Mr Hvistendahl
said.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Italy launches Dollars 4.58bn eurobond issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy yesterday launched the largest eurobond issue of the year in order to
complete its international borrowing programme for 1994. The issue takes the
amount the country has borrowed on foreign markets this year to Dollars
11.6bn, making it the world's second-largest borrower on international bond
markets.
The Y450bn (Dollars 4.58bn) issue is the largest offering of yen-denominated
bonds ever offered outside the Japanese government bond market.
It is the high point of a four-year campaign by the Italian treasury to
increase international investors' interest in the country's bond market  -
the world's largest outside the US and Japan.
The strategy has proved a success, with the proportion of Italy's debt held
by outside investors increasing from 4 per cent to 6.9 per cent between 1990
and 1992, and reaching a peak of 14.5 per cent last February.
However, since May this year, international bond and equity investors have
been frightened away from the Italian market by uncertainties about the
future of the rightwing coalition led by Mr Silvio Berlusconi. Italian
treasury officials believe the proportion of foreign investment may have
dropped below 10 per cent.
However, Mr Vincenzo La Via, a director of foreign borrowing at the Italian
treasury, hailed the offering as a success. Bond traders said interest from
European investors was disappointing, but Mr La Via said there had been
strong demand from Japan.
The issue comes amid continued political sparring between government,
opposition and trade unions - and within the coalition itself - over the
1995 budget. Aimed at cutting Italy's large annual deficit, the budget was
at first welcomed as tougher than expected. But analysts now fear it may
have to be toned down to win parliamentary approval by the December 31
deadline.
Mr Berlusconi has used confidence motions this week to force sensitive
elements in the budget through the chamber of deputies.
Italy has turned to the Japanese yen market for all three of its main
foreign borrowing operations this year. In January it borrowed Y300bn, and
in June it borrowed Y175bn as part of a Dollars 4bn multi-currency
transaction.
The bond offering was split into three separate issues, of three, 10 and
20-year bonds, designed to appeal to Japanese and European investors.

FT  17 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: De La Rue hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank note printer De La Rue failed to maintain its sharp rise established
after top of the range figures on Tuesday. Perceptions that the group's
rating was too demanding was compounded by a sober appraisal of the
prospects for the National Lottery.
De La Rue is one of the companies in the Camelot consortium which runs the
Lottery, and one investment institution was believed to have been selling
heavily after deciding its benefits were overvalued.
Once it began, the rest of the market followed, taking the stock down 20 to
1014p with turnover reaching 3.7m, the highest for around four years.
A division of opinion over figures from British Gas ensured that it was one
of the most actively traded stocks in London. The shares closed a penny
firmer at 304 1/2 p with 9.8m changing hands.
British Gas's third-quarter losses, calculated on an historic cost basis,
fell to Pounds 164m, from Pounds 225m previously. The figures were better
than analysts' forecasts of between Pounds 178m and Pounds 232m. But at
least one leading integrated securities house said they masked a one-off
Pounds 40m boost from lower gas prices and the company would suffer from
heavier than expected redundancies.
However, Nomura argued that the benefits of the cost cutting would show
through in 1995 and 1996, while UBS told clients that Gas's three-pronged
strategy to reduce costs, achieve medium growth out of the exploration and
production side and boost long term growth was proceeding faster than hoped.
The Queen's Speech news that Gas's monopoly is to be abolished had long been
discounted and analysts are expected to raise end of year forecasts to above
Pounds 900m.
British Airways made up some of its recent market underperformance, bouncing
12 1/2 to 386p in turnover of 7.1m for a two-day advance of 20.
Dollar recovery and renewed focus on the strength of the airline's core
business helped investors to shrug off more gloomy tidings on the USAir
front. Legendary US investor Mr Warren Buffett announced in an SEC filing
that his Berkshire Hathaway group, which like BA has a big stake in USAir,
could shortly take an earnings charge against the shareholding.
Eurotunnel retreated 12 to 272p, with turnover in Paris running at nearly
five times the level of the 1.2m shares traded in London.
International conglomerate Hanson saw a surge of dealing after traders
suspected that Hoare Govett, the company's broker, had published an
enthusiastic recommendation. Hoare was unavailable for comment. The stock,
restrained by a block of 4.2m shares traded just before the end of dealing
on Tuesday, ended the day marginally firmer at 232 1/2 p with turnover
totalling 12m.
BAT Industries advanced 8 1/2 to 466 1/2 p, with Smith New Court backing the
shares.
Motor industry engineers sprang to life, with GKN up 11 to 642p, T&amp;N gaining
11 at 229p, and BBA adding 9 at 207p in 4.5m turnover, as the engineering
sub-sector attempted to shake off a prolonged period of stock market
weakness.
An 81-page study on the recently integrated FT distributors sector from
NatWest Securities helped to underpin relevant stocks. Inchcape moved ahead
11 to 442p, while Farnell Electronics, the ambitious components distributor,
jumped 17 to 530p.
The prospect of Euro Disney falling off the CAC 40 list of leading French
stocks weakened the shares in London. They declined 4 to 106p.
Institutional buying in Ladbroke brought turnover of 13m. The shares firmed
2 to 157p.
Profit-taking in Boots, which has announced the sale of its pharmaceuticals
division and a Pounds 500m share buy-back, saw the stock give up 8 to 517p.
Hopes of a share buy-back continued to underpin trading in Great Universal
Stores. The shares added 3 at 574p.
Dairy group Unigate firmed 2 to 357p after a 6.8 per cent increase in
interim profits.
Profit-takers moved in on Vodafone, which has been strong ahead of next
week's interim results, pushing the shares down 6 to 215p. There was said to
be heavy switching into BT and Cable and Wireless, both of which benefit
from the upturn in the dollar. C&amp;W rose 5 1/2 to 399p, and was also heavily
traded in the options market.
Merchant bank SG Warburg jumped 24 to 671p as the benefits to the securities
arm from an active market were compounded by resurgent takeover talk.
Financial advice group Towry Law plunged 44 to 86p after warning that it
expected to make a half-year loss of Pounds 1.25m, compared with a previous
Pounds 565,000 profit.

FT  17 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Land Secs warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Land Securities, the UK's largest quoted property group, tumbled 17 to 606p
on turnover of 7.5m - the busiest session for 18 months - after warning
about the second half.
Interim profits of Pounds 118.9m, against Pounds 116m a year earlier, were
in line with market expectations, but Land said higher interest charges
brought about by its increased development programme will make it difficult
for end of year profits to match those of the first half. Sentiment was also
dampened by a slightly lower than expected 6.85p dividend.
Mr Robin White at NatWest Securities said: 'This is confirmation from the
major player in the sector that concerted rental growth has not yet
returned.'
Mr Alan Carter at James Capel, which issued a cautious note on the stock two
weeks ago, said he was not surprised by yesterday's statement and added:
'The profits decline in subsequent years has been anticipated.'
The sharp fall by Land Securities dragged MEPC, another leading property
stock, lower by 8 to 408p.

FT  17 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bid move boost for VSEL
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VSEL was a clear feature among engineering shares, jumping 23 to 1405p
following what was seen by the stock market as a dramatic shortening of the
odds on GEC's bid for the company escaping a monopolies reference.
The catalyst was the interim results statement from defence contractor
Vosper Thornycroft, which disclosed strong profits and dividend growth but -
more importantly for VSEL - made it clear that Vosper was in a position to
provide plenty of competing defence shipbuilding capability.
GEC is bidding 1400p a share cash for VSEL in direct counter to a share
offer worth 1295p from British Aerospace, which put on a penny at 471p. The
stock market has not ruled out a fresh offer from BAe, possibly next week.

FT  17 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures ended the day little changed, but once again trading
volume was far in excess of the recent average, writes Jeffrey Brown.
With two-way business remaining strong, contract numbers during pit trading
hours totalled 16,708, against 19,792 on Tuesday.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3152 at the official 4.10pm close, up
just one point. The premium to the cash market was 3 points, short of fair
value at 4 points.
Propelled by favourable UK inflation data, the market opened strongly and by
mid-morning the December contract was running at a premium to cash equities
in excess of 20 points.
But the general enthusiasm was tempered during the afternoon session when
Wall Street, the immediate key to direction, made a faltering start to the
day.
The December contract managed to edge up a few further points in late,
screen-based trading and traders took distinct encouragement from the level
of volume, which moved above 19,000 contracts.
Stock option volume also powered ahead, rising to 56,430 lots from 44,538 on
Tuesday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE trading exceeded 30,000 lots. Forte was the
most active stock option at 2,450 lots, followed by two major banks, NatWest
(1786) and Barclays (1736).

FT  17 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Economic news drives equity prices
higher - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An impressive set of domestic economic data, which drove UK gilts sharply
better after an uncertain opening, came to the rescue of a London equity
market showing distinct signs of running out of steam early yesterday.
The FT-SE 100-share Index finished another busy session a net 11.1 higher at
3,146.5, but well below the day's best of 3,168.1 reached shortly before
Wall Street opened for business. Demand for equities was not confined to the
leaders; the FT-SE Mid 250 index put on another powerful performance,
closing 22 stronger at 3,582.7.
All the economic details released yesterday pointed to lessening
inflationary pressures in the UK. This news, combined with the minutes of
the recent meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the
exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England, which
revealed that the two agreed there was no need for further increases in UK
interest rates in the short term, gave a strong shot in the arm to gilts and
equities. Before the economic news was announced, London's stock market had
wilted after the late slide on Wall Street following the 75 basis-point rise
in the Federal Funds rate.
The extent of the increase took the US market by surprise; most US analysts
had expected the Federal Reserve to lift rates by 50 points and to warn of
more rises if economic indicators pointed to further inflationary pressure.
But it was believed that yesterday's higher than expected US retail sales
figures and other economic data had tipped the balance in favour of the
larger rise in the US.
Leading dealers said the market had blazed ahead after the inflation news,
with solid institutional demand driving the FT-SE 100 above 3,155, a level
regarded as a major upside break point. 'It was all one-way traffic until we
reached 3,155,' said one, 'but once we got above that level it was all
sellers; we seem to have reached a crucial trading level and we could face a
bout of profit-taking tomorrow.'
On the other hand, the head of marketmaking at one of the UK securities
houses was unequivocally bullish of the London market. 'There was never any
real selling pressure and I feel that we could go further as long as Wall
Street behaves,' he said.
Strategists adopted a positive tone about the market. Mr Ian Harnett at
Strauss Turnbull described yesterday's inflation news as 'the perfect
background for the chancellor to present a positive Budget; fears of an
interest rise in the near term have diminished substantially'. While Mr
Richard Jeffrey, equity market strategist at Charterhouse Tilney, said the
economic statistics were 'a reminder that the UK is still doing very well'.
Another bull point, observers said, was the upsurge in activity in the
market in the past two sessions which have witnessed a series of big
individual trades, via institutional trading programmes, bought deals and
buy-backs. Tuesday's surge of activity included customer business worth an
extremely heavy Pounds 2.62bn, the highest for many weeks and inflated by
Boots' Pounds 500m share buy-back and Goldman Sachs' Pounds 160m trading
programme.
Turnover yesterday totalled 815.2m shares, with non-Footsie stocks
accounting for 58 per cent.
The water and electricity stocks came in for strong support from the
institutions, the latter after the electricity industry regulator indicated
his willingness to see the individual regional electricity companies sell
their holdings in the National Grid. Optimism over dividend prospects helped
drive the water stocks forward.
Hints of imminent moves in the VSEL takeover battle produced keen support
for the group, while dealers reported more murmurings of possible predatory
moves against SG Warburg.

FT  17 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow higher in wake of
inflation figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Leading US stocks posted solid gains yesterday, but the rest of the market
ended mostly flat amid confusion about the implications of a lower than
expected increase in consumer prices and Tuesday's tightening of monetary
policy by the Federal Reserve, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 18.84 up at 3,845.20. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 was 0.57 firmer at 465.60, while the American Stock Exchange
composite eased 0.22 to 448.39 and the Nasdaq composite edged forward 0.63
to 769.65. New York SE volume came to 297m shares.
The Dow rose by more than 10 points in early trading after the Labor
Department reported consumer prices for October, excluding food and energy,
rose by 0.2 per cent, while analysts had expected a 0.3 per cent increase.
Overall, consumer prices were up 0.1 per cent last month, bringing yearly
inflation down to 2.6 per cent, from 3.0 per cent in September. Economists
had forcast a 0.1 per cent increase in overall prices.
Initially neither the stock nor the bond markets were able to sustain the
morning gains, but late in the afternoon the Dow made a strong comeback,
while the other indices remained flat or declined.
Mr Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at securities firm Merrill Lynch,
attributed the volatility to uncertainty about the impact of the Fed's 75
basis-point increase in the Fed Funds rate. Markets had expected a rise of
50 basis points, to 5 1/4 per cent.
'It is sort of a double-edged sword,' he said, adding that it could lead to
a bond market rally that might temporarily lift stocks but in the longer run
shares could be hurt by a slowing of the economy.
In the near term, he said, whatever happened in the markets over the next
few days could determine whether the market staged an end of year rally.
'Whichever way it starts to go, you will get a following and you will see
more money going in that direction,' he added. 'If it does hold up or go up,
maybe it will blossom into a late November-early December rally.'
Still, he foresaw overall weakness in most of the stock averages over the
medium to long term.
Exxon rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 60 5/8 on news that the oil company had
signed a contract with the Indonesian state-owned oil and gas company to
develop a natural gas field in the South China Sea. Mobil, which is also
negotiating for a part of the project, gained Dollars 3/4 at Dollars 84 1/8
.
Interest rate-sensitive banks lost ground in the aftermath of the Fed's rate
increase. Citicorp dipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 45 1/8 , Chase Manhattan
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 36 1/2 , Chemical Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 36 3/8 and
NationsBank Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 47 1/2 .
National Gypsum jumped Dollars 12 to Dollars 45 3/4 after Delcor offered to
buy the company for Dollars 43 1/2 a share, or Dollars 940m cash. News that
the construction materials company would be purchased for what was
considered a premium price pulled its competitor USG up Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 21 1/4 .
General Electric put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 49 1/4 on news that it had
hired Black Rock Financial Management to help its Kidder Peabody affiliate
sell its mortgage-backed securities portfolio. PaineWebber, which last month
bought most of Kidder, did not purchase the mortgage operations.
Canada
The US Federal Reserve's decisive move on short-term interest rates on
Tuesday sparked little enthusiasm in bond or equity markets yesterday, and
Toronto stocks ended on a flat note after low activity.
The TSE 300 index gained just 2.82 points at 4,171.74, while declining
issues outpaced advances by 421 to 322 after volume of 48.9m shares.
Eight of the 14 sub-group indices were higher, led by transportation,
conglomerates, consumer products and pipelines. Real estate, energy and
utility stocks lost ground.
The golds group eased slightly as the New York spot price for gold slipped
60 cents to USDollars 386.45 an ounce.
Brazil
Shares in Sao Paulo rose 0.8 per cent in moderate trade as positive
sentiment after Tuesday's gubernatorial elections triggered buying. The
Bovespa index closed 409 up at 49,896. Turnover amounted to RDollars 240m.
Analysts were optimistic that president-elect Fernando Henrique Cardoso's
economic reforms would receive a boost after exit polls showed that
candidates from the Social Democratic Party had won elections in three major
states.
The elected governors are seen as paving the way for congressional approval
of economic reforms.
Mexico
A last-minute rally sparked by Telefonos de Mexico took Mexican stock prices
to a sharply higher close. Also helping the upward movement was a slight cut
in domestic interest rates.
The IPC index of 37 leading shares ended 51.26 or 2.08 per cent ahead at
2,510.41.
Telmex 'L' shares advanced 2.65 per cent and the 'A' series 2.88 per cent.

Johannesburg picked up modestly, feeling the benefit of a firm London market
and a weaker financial rand, although golds ended little changed on bullion

FT  17 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region mostly hesitant
awaiting US trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Afternoon buying by dealers helped share prices recoup earlier losses
resulting from profit-taking by institutional investors, and arbitrage
unwinding, and the Nikkei 225 average finished with a marginal decline,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index was off 85.02 at 19,306.66 after a day's high of 19,444.29 and low
of 19,252.15. Hedge selling by institutional investors depressed futures,
prompting unwinding of arbitrage positions.
Cross trading, or the selling and buying of shares by investors realising
profits while not altering their stock portfolios, boosted activity. Volume
totalled 240m shares, against 218m. Traders said the amount of 'real' stock
transactions were minimal.
The rise in US interest rates and the subsequent appreciation of the dollar
failed to affect sentiment. 'Investors were using the Federal Open Market
Committee's meeting as an excuse for inactivity,' said a dealer.
The Topix index of all first section stocks dipped 3.14 to 1,525.50 and the
Nikkei 300 lost 0.59 at 280.21, while falls led rises by 502 to 446, with
216 issues unchanged. The ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.27 to 1,260.77.
Earnings related announcements affected share prices. Pioneer Electronic
fell Y150 to Y2,360 on concern over its consolidated earnings. However,
Matsushita Electric Industrial, which saw its consolidated net income for
the first six months jump 49 per cent, gained Y30 at Y1,560.
Nishimatsu Construction, which announced that it was expecting to post a
record high recurring profit for the current business year, moved ahead Y40
to Y1,040. Murata, a machinery maker, put on Y50 at Y3,980 following reports
that its consolidated after-tax profits would surge 40 per cent.
Steel issues were actively traded. NKK, the day's volume leader, firmed Y2
to Y278, but Sumitomo Metal Industries slipped Y5 to Y336.
Profit-taking depressed some high-technology shares. Fujitsu receded Y10 to
Y1,040 and Hitachi softened Y1 to Y973.
Privatisation stocks were firm, with Japan Tobacco up Y5,000 to Y996,000 and
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone adding Y1,000 at Y877,000. East Japan
Railway, however, lost Y3,000 at Y469,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 28.19 to 21,409.28 in volume of 60.2m
shares.
Roundup
Much of the region was in hesitant mood, awaiting further indications of
Wall Street's likely performance in coming sessions.
HONG KONG weathered a near day-long bout of profit-taking, amid
disappointment at Wall Street's overnight fall after the US interest rate
rise, before some late buying tipped the market back into positive
territory. The Hang Seng index, which shed 61 points in morning trade, ended
a net 26.58 higher at 9,592.24.
Improved earnings prospects and foreign buying helped HKR International to
rally 20 cents to HKDollars 7.55, while Seapower Resources added 4 cents at
HKDollars 0.93 on bargain hunting.
SEOUL was lower after a consolidation of financial shares, as institutional
investors became defensive and individual investors began selling. The
composite index dipped 7.05 to 1,118.75.
Unfounded rumours of debt defaults by unlisted construction companies
pressured some banks and securities houses, which have extended or
guaranteed loans. The financial sub-group index fell 12.99 points to 728.76.
SYDNEY ended a touch easier after negative sentiment from the bond and
futures markets spilled over into stocks and pushed the market off its
highs. The All Ordinaries index lost 1.1 at 1,940.3.
Stocks were mixed overall, with resources issues finishing a shade firmer
but industrials closing lower. Western Mining picked up 10 cents to ADollars
7.65 and MIM was 6 cents ahead at ADollars 2.60 as they continued to rebound
after the heavy selling last week.
KUALA LUMPUR saw widespread profit-taking drag equity prices back after
initial gains. The composite index, which had risen by 40 points over the
previous two sessions, declined from a day's best of 1,079.64 to close 6.59
down on the day at 1,063.15.
SINGAPORE held on to small gains at the close and the Straits Times
Industrial index ended 5.32 up at 2,346.50, off an intraday peak of
2,353.92. However, the UOB OTC index, tracking Malaysian stocks, retreated
7.68 to 1,189.79.
BANGKOK was slightly lower on profit-taking in finance stocks as the market
entered a period of consolidation. The SET index eased 7.70 to 1,489.15.
KARACHI sank sharply at the close as local investors and institutions kept
to the sidelines, short of cash and unnerved by political tension. The KSE
100-share index weakened 17.27 to 2,161.64.
TAIPEI remained preoccupied ahead of next month's elections and the weighted
index gave up 35.02 at 6,346.78 as nervous investors continued to drift out
of the market.
BOMBAY rebounded 1.94 per cent on renewed buying by domestic mutual funds
and speculators after the sharp falls of the previous week. The BSE 30-share
index, which lost more than 280 points last week, recouped 78.30 at
4,113.79.

Manila has fallen by 17 per cent in local currency terms since the start of
the year, and by 6.5 per cent in dollar terms, according to IFC data,
although more recently the equity market has found support due to the
strength of the peso against the dollar.
This has proved to be a testing time for companies closely linked to the
dollar, such as PLDT and PNB, which have seen respective 15 per cent and 19
per cent falls in their share prices over the last month.
According to Asia Equity, the appreciation of the peso could well continue
for the rest of the year, possibly ending 1994 at between 23 to 24 pesos to
the dollar. However, a depreciation could well begin early in 1995,
following an expected balance of payments deficit.
Asia Equity forecasts that the index will correct to 2,800 in the short
term, pressured by further weakness in the major blue chips and property
stocks.

FT  17 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Diffident response to Fed rate
increase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Equity markets throughout continental Europe reacted diffidently to the 75
basis-point rise in US short-term interest rates, with many finding it
difficult to make any headway. While the absence of Germany, closed for a
national holiday, may have played a small part in the day's aimless search
for direction, the main cause seemed to be a feeling that the Fed might not
have acted decisively enough.
With fears that the US economy is still expanding more quickly than
desirable, the thought in some quarters is that it might not be too long
before the Fed has to act again.
MILAN was preoccupied by the progress of parliamentary confidence votes on
the pension package, although losses were tempered by some renewed buying by
domestic funds, and hopes for a more buoyant December account, starting
today. The Comit index fell 3.12 to 640.41.
Ferruzzi provided a flurry of excitement, gaining L58 or 4.5 per cent at
L1,347, as speculation resurfaced of a merger with Montedison, its
industrial subsidiary, as part of the group's restructuring. Montedison
reacted negatively to the rumours, declining L17 to L1,237, as analysts
questioned the benefits for the company.
Banks were mostly lower as recent bid fever subsided. BCI shed L11 to L3,557
with the expiry of its unsuccessful bid for Ambroveneto, which gave up L66
to L4,288.
Credito, however, picked up L17 to L1,677 as its bid for control of Credito
Romagnolo remained on the table. Romagnolo dipped L246 to L16,047.
ZURICH was higher as investors switched from financials and insurance issues
and into industrials, which found renewed support in the strength of the
dollar. The SMI index rose 17.5 to 2,609.4.
Nestle was a beneficiary of the strong dollar in the run-up to its financial
year-end, gaining SFr26 at SFr1,221 and reversing the recent downward
pressure.
Holderbank rose SFr19 to SFr1,068, extending a long period of gains on
positive expectations for 1994 results and speculation that a bank would
soon issue covered warrants on the shares.
BBC was SFr10 firmer at SFr1,109 ahead of nine-month figures due tomorrow
which are expected to show double-figure operating earnings growth but flat
sales, compared with a very strong year-earlier performance.
Ciba, which confirmed on Tuesday that it was in talks to acquire a sizeable
minority stake in Chiron, the US biotechnology group, rose SFr18 to SFr771,
with strong demand seen from London investors.
PARIS found the going hard and ended the day with the CAC-40 index off 4.33
at 1,950.20, having traded in a range between 1,964 and 1,929. Turnover
remained moribund at about FFr3.5bn.
Axa, the insurer, went against the trend with an advance of FFr7.30 to
FFr269.00 after announcing a rise in nine-month turnover to FFr73bn from
FFr69bn.
However, this was among the few exceptions to the drift downwards.
Confirmation that the Renault privatisation was only 1.4 times subscribed by
retail investors may also have contributed to weakness - the car maker is
due for listing today. Euro Disney, which could find its place in the CAC-40
threatened by Renault, dropped another 5 per cent to FFr8.80.
AMSTERDAM could also barely bring itself to move and the AEX index slipped
back just 0.11 to 412.10.
The lack of momentum was reflected in the performances of dollar-sensitive
issues such as Royal Dutch and Unilever, both of which fell on the day, by
40 cents and 70 cents respectively to Fl 189.70 and Fl 198.10.
Elsewhere, Philips, which was the day's most active stock, dipped 50 cents
to Fl 54.00, while Polygram added the same amount at Fl 77.00, and announced
that it had acquired a US recording company for Dollars 33m.
MADRID gave up early gains to end lower and the general index finished 2.48
down at 302.76. Repsol receded Pta95 to Pta3,955 after posting lower than
expected nine-month earnings.
OSLO was higher in lively trading on small advances in the opinion polls for
supporters of EU membership ahead of the country's referendum on November
28. The polls, however, still show opponents of EU membership retaining the
upper hand. The All-share index finished 1.66 higher at 605.21.
STOCKHOLM turned back from its best levels on profit-taking, and the
Affarsvarlden index was finally 9.30 ahead at 1,514.50. Volvo 'B' put on
SKr5 at SKr142.50 as investors reassessed the group's nine-month results.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Markets Report: US dollar steady as market sentiment
improves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar yesterday responded cautiously to the larger than expected rise
in US interest rates on Tuesday, writes Philip Gawith.
While most analysts said the 75 basis-point increase in the Federal Funds
rate, to 5.5 per cent, was good news for the dollar, there was little
evidence of this in the market.
Although the dollar managed to reach a high of DM1.56 in Europe, it then
gave back its gains to close in London at DM1.5510, not far above the
DM1.5445 where it stood before the rate rise. Against the yen it ended at
Y98.38, from Y98.225 before the Fed's move. New York trading finished
yesterday with the US currency at DM1.5505 and Y98.355.
One casualty of the firmer dollar has been sterling, which gave up more
ground to finish at Dollars 1.5713, from Dollars 1.5826. At the beginning of
the month it was around Dollars 1.64. The pound also fell to DM2.4371 from
DM2.4456.
Analysts were slightly mystified by sterling's weakness, which comes against
a backdrop of exceptionally good economic news.
UK interest rate markets, however, had a better day, prompted by a benign
set of economic data, and bullish inflation comments from the Treasury and
Bank of England. Volumes were heavy and prices moved sharply, with the March
95 short sterling future trading around 85,000 lots to settle at 92.95, up
16 basis points on the day.
In Europe, the D-Mark was firmer against most currencies. The French franc
ended at FFr3.448/DM, from FFr3.437.
The recent conjuncture of Fed intervention to support the dollar, Republican
gains in the mid-term elections, and higher interest rates, have all
combined to improve short term sentiment towards the dollar.
Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan, commented: 'For
the next couple of months it will be very difficult to sell the dollar for
the reasons people have been selling it this year.' He said the Fed's
aggressive move had laid to rest fears that it was behind the curve in
combatting inflation.
Mr Gunner was cautious, however, about the extent of the dollar's upside. 'I
still get the impression that there are a lot of dollars to sell out there,
particularly from central banks diversifying out of the dollar as a reserve
currency.'
Mr Mark Austin, trader at Midland Global Markets, said the lack of movement
in the dollar reflected market nervousness about the extent of any likely
rally. 'A feature of the dollar throughout the year has been disappointment.
It has tended to give back gains quite quickly,' he added.
The dollar has now risen from a low of around DM1.49 when the Fed intervened
to support it earlier this month. Mr Austin said it was encouraging that it
had held on to these gains, but he was cautious about the medium-term
outlook. 'The structural problems are still there. Is it enough to persuade
foreign companies to buy sufficient US assets to offset the large capital
outflows?' he asked.
Mr Austin said most trade yesterday had appeared to come from US funds, with
little evidence of activity from longer term investors.
Mr Gunner said that while there was room for a short term correction in the
dollar, there was interest to buy it 'on the dips'. He felt higher interest
rates had put a 'very strong floor' under the dollar. He predicted that,
over three months, it could rise as high as DM1.625. On the downside, DM1.51
was a likely floor.
Conceding the shift in sentiment, Swiss Bank Corporation told clients that
the range for the dollar had now moved to DM1.53-59. SBC, which remains a
long term dollar bear, cited the prospect of another cut in German rates as
a further factor supporting the dollar.
A feature of recent dollar gains is that they have been limited mostly to
Europe. The yen has largely stood its ground. Analysts attribute this to
high real interest rates in Japan, with the central bank resisting US
pressure to ease policy, and ongoing trade frictions.
Analysts said the strong rally in short sterling futures had been prompted
by good inflation news; both in the form of a very good underlying retail
inflation figure for October, and bullish inflation signals emerging from
the minutes of the September monthly monetary meeting.
In its daily operations the Bank of England provided Pounds 305m of late
assistance, after forecasting a Pounds 500m shortage.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Accountancy: Step by step on insolvency harmonisation -
Moves to draw a framework for insolvency to facilitate mutual recognition
and co-operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Accountants do not often get shot in the line of business. It took the
Byzantine collapse of Polly Peck to add this particular danger to the many
facing accountants.
The accountant concerned, David Adams of Cooper's &amp; Lybrand, was attacked
while leaving the firm's Istanbul offices in August. He was, apparently,
mistaken for Chris Howell, one of the executives handling the administration
of the now bankrupt fruits-to-electronics conglomerate.
The gunman later claimed he was offered Pounds 5,000 for the shooting.
Meanwhile, the administrators have been subjected to abusive telephone
calls, gun-waving farmers, and super-glued locks.
Both cases of intimidation, while one more extreme than the other, are
depressingly familiar. Two legal systems, two sets of insolvency law, and
the disputed recognition of the status of the administrators and courts
conspiring to keep the creditors waiting.
Chris Barlow, the Coopers' administrator to Polly Peck in London, says that
a range of cross-border issues in insolvency present an 'ever increasing
problem' as the network linking multinational company assets becomes more
complex.
In recent years several major corporate collapses have involved complicated
administrations across several jurisdictions: the Maxwell empire, Lancer
Boss, Leyland Daf, and BCCI, the global ramifications of which cover 69
jurisdictions and are currently holding up the second attempt to reach an
acceptable offer to creditors. One creditor has applied to the London-based
administrators from British Antartica.
One of the organisations trying to solve some of the problems is Insol
International, the London-based organisation which represents accountants,
lawyers, bankers, and government officials involved in cross-border
insolvency and rescue. It has 6,000 members in 56 countries, 1,000 of whom
have joined in the last year.
Founded in 1982 at a conference at Cape Cod, Massachusetts, the organisation
grew through the recession of the late 1980s. Insol is considering
applications for membership from Nigeria, and the recently-formed Russian
insolvency practitioners association.
The expansion of international investment, particularly into the former
Eastern Bloc, has highlighted the need for a framework for insolvency.
Investors are looking for sound insolvency procedures before they move
across borders.
'You will not get inward investment unless you can get an equitable system
for dealing with insolvency. Although laws on cross-border insolvency relate
only to a limited aspect of international trade law, these laws are a
crucial element in developing a legal environment that facilitates
cross-border finance,' says Stephen Adamson, president of Insol.
Earlier this year Insol began working with the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law. Prompted by the failure of efforts to establish
'utopian' international laws, it was decided at a meeting in Vienna to try
and solve some of the problems by step-by-step harmonisation.
'There was a mood among delegates that rather than wait for a world-wide
model to provide the ideal solution, which could take hundreds of years to
achieve, we should take the initiative and progress harmonisation step by
step,' says Mr Adamson, a partner with Ernst &amp; Young.
After the conference Gerold Herrmann, Uncitral secretary, said: 'It is in
every nation's interest to assist in the reconciliation of insolvency law.'
While the delegates backed specific recommendations, such as the
establishment of specialised courts in all countries to deal with
international insolvency, care was taken not to seek a specific framework
for new laws.'
Two initiatives, backed by Uncitral, are under way. A panel of judges
working in insolvency from around the world is to meet in Toronto in March
next year to put together a 'highway code' for the judiciary, to promote
'comity' between jurisdictions - the principal of mutual recognition and
co-operation.
Meanwhile, an Insol working group is preparing a 'menu' of bolt-on
pre-prepared legislative measures that could be added to national law to
improve the procedures for the recognition of administrators and their
access to courts. Adoption of these legal 'kits' would bring about gradual
harmonisation. Both reports will be presented to Uncitral in New York in the
summer of 1995.
But the Insol-Uncitral initiatives face fundamental problems. The insolvency
codes of, for example, the US, Britain and France, all measure success in
insolvency differently: in terms of helping the debtors, the creditors and
the employees. 'No one is wrong,' admits Mr Adamson, 'we just want to
recognise the differences.'
The success of Insol in at least prompting debate can be measured by two
recent requests. Earlier this month the Russian Federal Agency on Insolvency
called on Insol, along with the World Bank and the European Bank of
Reconstruction and Development, to help in the overhaul of inadequate
insolvency laws. And Ellen Seidman, special assistant on economic policy to
US president Bill Clinton, asked Insol to give evidence to the Interagency
Working Group of Bankruptcy Reform. Insol executive members gave their views
on the US bankruptcy code and urged the need to consider multinational
problems in proposed reform.
Mark Homan, senior partner at Price Waterhouse, supports progress towards
harmonisation but questions if such 'soft law' is rigorous enough to cope
with a major corporate collapse.
Christopher Morris, senior liquidation partner at Touche Ross, also asks
whether any agreements can withstand the pressures of 'locals first' when it
comes to a multinational corporate collapse. While some insolvency law,
notably the UK's, does seek to protect the interests of those from other
jurisdictions there are wide international variations.
Mr Homan says Insol should stress the need for a framework within which
investors can measure risk before undertaking a transaction. As part of that
framework he suggests some form of code, preferably consolidated into
international treaty with the force of law, which would make it clear in
which country a company would be wound up in the case of failure.
The legislation could pin-point the 'principal centre of management' of the
company and this could be declared in its accounts. In the case of corporate
failure the administration would take place primarily in the country
indicated. Mr Homan suggests that the country of choice could be changed
only after notification in subsequent annual accounts.
Some critics of Insol take the view that cross-border insolvency problems
only affect the big corporate collapses and therefore, only the big firms.
But increasing numbers of practitioners are becoming enmeshed in work which
takes them into other jurisdictions. Malcolm London, of the UK's Insolvency
Practitioners Association, estimates that about a third of licenced
practitioners are involved in such work. Insol estimates that 30 per cent of
so-called insolvency work across borders is in fact rescue work: involving
restructuring and reorganisation.
Despite the criticisms of Insol's initiatives with the UN, many
professionals will be waiting impatiently for some form of progress on
harmonisation.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU to finance African mining
investment forum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union is financing a forum to take place next month in Lusaka
aimed at increasing European investment and co-operation in the Southern
African mining industry.
About 200 European companies will attend the three-day, by-invitation-only
event where they will be presented with details of nearly 200 projects in 10
of the SADAC (Southern African Development Community) countries: Angola,
Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia
and Zimbabwe.
The EU points out that annual mineral production in the region is worth an
estimated USDollars 4bn and the mining sector's contribution to gross
domestic product is substantial, averaging 11 per cent for the region.
Nevertheless, the potential for developing new small and medium-sized mines
is large but this has not been realised because of lack of investment. The
region also offers great exploration potential.
Two-thirds of the forum time will be given over to private meetings between
European and African company representatives and the EU says a computerised
meeting scheduling system has been set up to facilitate these discussions.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wheat output drive goes into
reverse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saudi Arabia is restricting this year's subsidised wheat crop to 2.8m tonnes
and will reduce its future harvests to no more than 2m tonnes under a strict
regime of subsidy cuts and tight control of wheat farming permits, according
to Mr Abdallah Moammar, the kingdom's deputy minister of agriculture.
The grain harvest will be complete at the end of December, but Mr Moammar
said his ministry and the state Grains and Silos Organisation had issued
permits only for cultivation of 2.8m tonnes of wheat, and 1m tonnes of
barley. 'We know the farmers in these regions will meet these targets,' he
said. 'If farmers produce any more, that's not going to be our
responsibility.'
Mr Moammar said the cash-strapped kingdom had been putting an end to years
of hugely generous subsidies for wheat farming, which had seen annual
harvests hit 4.7m tonnes and at one point made Saudi Arabia the sixth
biggest wheat exporter. 'There will be no more exports of wheat,' the deputy
minister said.
The subsidy programme began in the mid-1970s when Saudi Arabia decided to
plough some of its new oil riches into a strategic bid for food
self-sufficiency. At the time the kingdom produced only 3,000 tonnes of
wheat a year. The policy was prompted partly by fears that the west might
respond to the Arab oil embargo, backed by Saudi Arabia at the time, with a
food embargo of its own.
But Mr Moammar said the overproduction of wheat caused by over-generous
subsidies, had become 'too much to handle . . . it was a waste on both
sides: of water and money.'
The deputy minister said wheat subsidies had been running at Dollars 2.5bn a
year before recent cuts - a sum justified not merely by the aim of food
security but also as sharing some of the kingdom's 1970s and early 1980s oil
bounty across the country while helping prevent a rush from rural to urban
communities. 'It was a high cost, but the eventual results have meant a lot
to the kingdom,' said Mr Moammar.
He would not say how much of Saudi Arabia's limited underground water
supplies wheat farming had consumed - some estimates put it at 90 per cent
of annual use of fossil water - and denied that there was an immediate
threat the kingdom's overall water supplies. 'It has still not reached the
level where there should be major concern,' he said. 'But it should be given
attention from now. Now, with the controls being applied, this will help.'
He said subsidies of SR3.5 (93 US cents) a kilogram had been cut in recent
years to SR2, while licences for wheat cultivation had been strictly
controlled. 'Harvests will continue to go down until we reach 2m tonnes,' he
explained, 'because that will give us what's needed for local consumption
and strategic reserves.'
He said annual domestic consumption of wheat in the kingdom was 1.3m tonnes
and national storage capacity was 2.4m tonnes.
Mr Moammar said some land formerly under wheat had been left fallow since
the cuts in both state subsidies and purchases, while other farmers had
begun planting vegetables on the swathes of pivot-irrigated circles of
reclaimed desert that were once under wheat. 'The whole agricultural
development in the kingdom is such an experiment,' he said. 'And it's time
to sustain this experiment, but you don't need to expand it more.'

FT  17 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Saudis to back oil quota
roll-over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIYADH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Saudi Arabia will back a six-month roll-over of the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries' present output ceiling of 24.52m barrels a
day at the oil cartel's meeting next week in Bali, Saudi officials said
yesterday.
The officials said they believed the proposal would be supported by almost
all other Opec members, with the possible exception of Iran, which appeared
likely to seek a roll-over of the present ceiling only for a further
quarter.
The Saudis believed that a maintained ceiling, which has been rolled over
for more than a year already, would at least support present prices of just
over Dollars 17 a barrel for Brent crude in a market they described as
'balanced, leaning towards tight'.
The officials said crude prices were unlikely to firm significantly unless
there was unexpectedly accelerated growth in Europe, the US and Asia or a
particularly cold winter. They said only unexpected increases in non-Opec
output, particularly from the North Sea, would be likely to soften prices
significantly from their present range. 'The likelihood for a firming of
prices is there - especially if there is a cold wave,' said one official.
Secondary source estimates for actual Opec production in the present quarter
are running in the range of 24.7m b/d to 25.1m b/d, of which Saudi Arabia
says it accounts for marginally under 8m b/d.
Though Saudi officials would not give their estimates for the call on Opec
oil for the next quarters, they appeared comfortable with projections of
demand at between 25.5m b/d and 26.2m b/d, with a stock drawdown of between
500,000 and 1m b/d.
Saudi policy-makers are backing the roll-over having recognised that Opec is
caught between being unable to increase the ceiling without softening the
market and being unable to win agreement among members for any meaningful
cuts in allocations. At best, they have concluded, Opec can at present serve
as a 'very important balancing force' in the oil market, but not a price
setter.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: N American newsprint price
surge continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Connecticut-based Champion International has kicked off this year's fourth
round of newsprint price increases in North America.
Citing unexpectedly strong worldwide demand, Champion said that it planned
to raise prices by about 9 per cent, or USDollars 50 a tonne, on March 1.
Other US and Canadian producers are likely to follow suit.
The increase, a combination of a cut in discounts and an increase in list
prices, would bring the east coast newsprint price to about Dollars 600 a
tonne, compared with Dollars 420 at the beginning of this year.
Buyers are likely to resist the increase. It could prove difficult to
implement if predictions that the recent surge in demand may slacken in the
first quarter of next year are borne out. For the time being however,
producers appear to have the upper hand.
Consumption by US daily newspapers climbed by about 5 per cent in the first
nine months of this year. Stone Container, the Chicago-based company, has
contributed to the scramble by cutting shipments from its Snowflake mill in
Arizona, which is being converted to liner-board production.
The squeeze on supplies in North America has been exacerbated by strong
overseas demand, especially in the UK and south-east Asia. According to the
Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, Canadian newsprint exports rose 15 per
cent in the first nine months.
The short-term outlook hinges on labour developments in British Columbia.
Workers at Fletcher Challenge Canada's three pulp and paper mills earlier
this week voted in favour of a strike if no settlement was reached in
protracted contract negotiations.
Tensions have been further inflamed by a dispute over MacMillan Bloedel's
decision to seek bids from construction companies employing non-union
labour.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Base metals soar in hectic
trading at LME
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In one of the most frenetic days on the London Metal Exchange in living
memory, prices soared yesterday as wave after wave of investment fund and
speculative buying took copper, aluminium and lead to fresh four-year peaks
and nickel and zinc to their highest levels for two years.
Copper started the charge, surging by 3 per cent from its overnight price
level, and this triggered new enthusiasm for other LME metals. 'Everything
went berserk,' said one trader.
There were good fundamental reasons for copper's price rise, analysts
suggested. But they questioned the ability of the other metals to sustain
last night's price levels for long. 'There has been indiscriminate buying by
the funds because metals are supposed to be an attractive investment,' said
Mr Jim Lennon, analyst at Macquarie Equities. He pointed out that only
copper and aluminium stocks on the LME were lower now than at the end of
1993. Lead, nickel, tin and zinc stocks were all 20 per cent higher and
nickel stocks were close to their record.
Questions were also being asked about when the funds might take their
considerable profits on copper and aluminium and possibly send prices
plummeting. Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at Merrill Lynch, said it would be
reasonable to expect a great deal of profit-taking by December 16 so that
the funds could include the benefits in their December-quarter results. 'But
maybe they have protected their profits by option trading and we might go
into the New Year and face an even bigger eventual drop.' Mr Arnold added,
however: 'It takes a brave man to predict when the drop will come and by how
much'.
There were some suggestions that copper's price was being manipulated by an
artificially-created squeeze. There were rumours that a large Japanese
trading house and one or two US financial institutions were involved. The
tightness of supply was indicated by the premium being paid last night for
copper for immediate delivery compared with three months metal - Dollars
71.5 a tonne. Asked if the LME was worried, Mr David King, the chief
executive, said: 'We are always monitoring all markets but we are looking at
copper more closely at the moment'. The exchange has the power to intervene
if it believes a 'disorderly' market is developing.
Nevertheless, most analysts insisted that the copper supply tightness was
genuine. Mr Lennon pointed out that there had been a fall of 336,000 tonnes
in combined LME and New York Commodity Exchange stocks since the start of
the year. 'Stocks could be at their lowest for 30 years in the first half of
1995,' he warned. The squeeze would only ease when new production capacity
came into operation in the second half of next year. In the meantime
copper's price could rise to more than Dollars 1.50 a pound (Dollars 3,306 a
tonne).

sugar regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union's sugar marketing regime is working well and needs only
minor changes to conform with the Uruguay Round accord in the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, agriculture commissioner Rene Steichen said
yesterday, reports Reuters from Strasbourg.
'It's a reform, perhaps a small one, because at the moment we have no
problem with this market,' he explained after the commission adopted a
proposal to modify the regime.
Beet sugar production quotas would be maintained at existing levels for the
next six marketing years until the end of the Gatt accord in 2001. But
quotas, or guaranteed prices, could be changed in view of market
developments, Mr Steichen added.
The EU sugar regime provided a stable price, in contrast to the world
market, and the only budget expenditure was for imports of cane sugar, the
commissioner stated. The EU imports 1.3m tonnes of raw cane sugar at
preferential rates from members' former colonies in the African, Caribbean
and Pacific regions.
The regime is 'self-financed' through production levies paid by farmers and
processors.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Survey of Massachusetts (6): Enjoying one of its best years
 -Tourism and business travel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In tourism and business travel, Massachusetts is a state which makes a
virtue out of its modest proportions and understated charms. It has no
choice.
On their initial trip to the US, few foreigners are drawn to the
cobble-stone streets of Boston's Beacon Hill or to historic Plymouth rock,
where the Puritans landed in 1620. The first time out, only the most
independent spirits venture north to Walden Pond or west to the autumnal
splendor of the Berkshire mountains.
Instead, they gravitate to the bright lights of New York, the glitz of
Hollywood or the sunshine and spectacle of Florida.
'It's very difficult to compete with Mickey Mouse,' says Mr Fred Clifford,
European marketing manager at the state's Office of Travel and Tourism,
referring to the phenomenal appeal of Disney World in Orlando.
Likewise, convention planners most often turn to places such as Chicago or
New York when booking the kind of events which attract tens of thousands of
visitors.
Compact Boston - one of the few American cities which is best enjoyed on
foot - simply lacks sufficient size to accommodate the biggest shows. The
Hynes convention centre, its main venue, has only half the floor space of
the grand exhibition hall recently opened in Philadelphia.
Yet despite these handicaps - if indeed they can be characterised as such -
tourism and business travel are powerful economic engines in Massachusetts,
generating an estimated Dollars 12.5bn in business and Dollars 200m in state
and local taxes a year. In Boston alone, hotels, restaurants and hospitality
businesses employ more than 10 per cent of the workforce.
The travel industry is now enjoying one of its best years since 1986, when
the regional economy was near the peak of an unsustainable boom.
The growth is not nearly as explosive as it had been a decade ago, but the
robust trend is encouraging for a state that is still shaking off the
lingering effects of a severe recession.
By the end of 1994, the Greater Boston Visitors and Convention Bureau
estimates that nearly 10m people will have visited the city, up 16 per cent
from the 1991 trough.
The extra business is especially welcome during a period when some sectors
of the city's economy - particularly healthcare - are just beginning to
undergo a painful contraction.
There is evidence that the state is becoming a destination of choice for
more foreign travellers. An informal survey of London tour operators
conducted by the state shows sales so far this year are 10 to 25 per cent
ahead of 1993. The number of German airline passengers visiting
Massachusetts last year jumped 54 per cent, according to the US Travel Data
Centre, which compiles tourism figures for the federal government.
What explains the state's growing appeal? The price is right, for one thing.
The weak dollar has made travel to the US much cheaper for both Europeans
and Japanese. At the same time, fewer Americans can afford to book holidays
abroad. Instead, they are planning shorter vacations closer to home, a trend
which has benefited Massachusetts - with its wealth of quiet, family
attractions - more than most states.
On the symbolic level, at least, that orientation was underscored by the
decision of America's 'first family' - the Clintons - to spend their summer
holidays on Martha's Vineyard, the exclusive island resort off Cape Cod.
Even though accommodations there are booked solidly, year-in and year-out,
the publicity was priceless for the state's tourism industry as a whole.
But Massachusetts has more going for it than the vagaries of macroeconomics
and a brush with celebrity.
The state has stepped up its overseas marketing programmes in an effort to
attract the growing body of Europeans who have visited the US more than once
and who are now ready to book something more sophisticated than a trip to a
theme park.
In view of this burgeoning potential market, 'Massachusetts is about to
explode as a holiday destination,' predicts Mr Clifford. 'It's a place which
has really come into its own.'
In attracting such visitors, diminutive Massachusetts cannot be viewed in
isolation from its five neighbours in the New England region. Typically,
foreign tourists will fly into Boston, spend a few days sight-seeing and
shopping, and then head north by car to the fishing villages of Cape Ann and
the state of Maine.
The next stops on the circular tour are rugged New Hampshire and rolling
Vermont, before turning south into the Berkshires, world renowned for their
autumn foliage and summer arts festivals. After a brief foray through
Connecticut and Rhode Island, many usually find themselves at the sandy
beaches of Cape Cod, before completing the loop back to Boston.
Foreign travellers going to Massachusetts for business most often stay in
Boston, and their numbers are climbing. About 10 per cent of delegates at
the city's medical conferences and meetings now come from outside the US, up
from 1 per cent a decade ago.
Indeed, medical conferences held in the city often have record attendance.
Celebrity speakers affiliated from the state's prestigious schools and
hospitals are a big draw, but there are other reasons which have nothing to
do with Boston's renowned medical establishment.
'We have all the things that convention delegates tend to like,' says Ms
Leslie Matthieu Hogan, marketing director for the convention bureau.
Many visitors enjoy the fact that the airport is only minutes away from
downtown Boston. First-class hotel rooms are plentiful, the restaurants
sophisticated. Best of all, walking around the city is easy.
Last year, it became even easier with the opening of the Boston Convention
Complex. The project actually involved no significant new construction.
Rather, the 'complex' was formed by unifying the existing Hynes convention
centre, three hotels and some 200 shops and restaurants by means of a
network of glass-enclosed walkways.
In part, the ad hoc complex represents an effort by the city and state to
compensate for its lack of a big exhibition centre. While the Boston
metropolitan area is the country's seventh-largest, the city ranks 41st in
terms of available space for meetings and trade shows. That reality has
forced the city to concentrate on booking smaller events.
A controversial plan to build a gigantic convention centre and stadium,
probably on the southern fringes of downtown Boston, is now working its way
through the Massachusetts Legislature.
But it is a little surprising that the scheme is garnering so much political
and public support, given the success tourism officials have enjoyed in
promoting the city as a leading host of small business meetings.
The number of events booked this year is expected to reach 220, up from just
120 in 1991. Meanwhile, the average number of people attending each function
will have dropped from 5,000 to 1,500, underlining the shift in emphasis.
But for the city's economy, it is a fair trade, considering that the number
of hotel-room nights booked by people attending meetings climbed nearly 40
per cent over the same period.
Indeed, Boston appears to have found a profitable niche, and one that seems
most appropriate to its character as a small, intimate city.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Survey of Massachusetts (9): Foreigners provide impetus -
Boston worked hard for its rejuvenation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past two decades, Boston has metamorphised from a sleepy parochial
town into a fashionable, cosmopolitan centre. Elegant Newbury Street, once a
residential enclave, is now a thriving mecca for designer shops and pavement
cafes. Snatches of French, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, and other languages
now drown out the once-dominant Bostonian dropped 'R'.
A flood of foreigners into New England's largest city has provided the
impetus for change. To diversify their student base and replenish their
coffers, Boston's universities have recruited surging numbers of candidates
from abroad, and foreigners have flocked to study at world-renowned
institutions such as Harvard, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and
Tufts.
A large and growing immigrant community has added diversity. Brazilians,
Irish, Haitians and others have decided to try their luck in Boston and the
area's high-technology companies have been a magnet for foreign scientists,
many of whom are alumni from the city's universities.
Tourism is also booming. Hotel occupancy for the month of August in Boston
was an impressive 89.9 per cent. Foreign visitors are increasingly drawn to
Boston's thriving arts scene, world-class restaurants, and well-preserved
red brick ambiance.
Boston has worked hard for its rejuvenation, although the results have not
always been desirable.
The city kicked off urban renewal in the 1960s with a still-mourned
destruction of the West End and the construction of a much-criticised
Government Centre.
In the 1970s, planners redeemed themselves with the successful renovation of
the old Faneuil Hall marketplace, which served as a prototype for similar
developments around the country, including the South Street Seaport in New
York.
Boston, now recovering from a devastating recession which sapped much of the
city's vitality, is tackling urban projects with renewed vigour. A new
sports centre for basketball and hockey is set to open early next year and
the North Station rail terminal is undergoing a major renovation. The city
is also in the middle of an Dollars 8bn project to put the city's elevated
Central Artery highway underground, in what is billed as the biggest urban
highway project in the country.
Boston's vision of its future is ambitious. Developers are pushing for the
construction of a new Megaplex, a combination sports stadium and conference
centre which would allow the city to host important conferences. Public
transportation should get an important boost from plans for new commuter
rail lines and an extension of Boston's already efficient subway system. The
city also hopes to host the Olympic Games in 2008.
To shore up its tourism market and renowned quality of life, Boston is
spending billions of dollars on the environment. Environmental measures have
at times caused resentment among the city's residents. A Dollars 4bn harbour
clean-up has been largely financed with local water tariffs, making the
area's water rates the highest in the country.
Owning a car in the city can be a nightmare. Boston discourages driving in
an attempt to control air pollution, and a freeze on the number of parking
spaces available has made the city one of the most difficult places to park
in the world.
On the whole, however, residents seem happy with the way things are going.
The downtown exudes an air of quiet self-confidence which the statistics
seem to justify. The city is one of the best educated in the country, with
some 46.7 per cent of residents over 25 in the metropolitan area having
completed a college degree. It is also one of the safest big cities, in
terms of violent crime, in the US.
Widespread satisfaction with the status quo led to a victory last year for
Thomas Menino, former Mayor Flynn's hand-picked successor.
The city's economy is also picking up, fortified by new sectors such as
biotechnology and enviro-technology. Those sectors feed on the brain power
of Boston's universities, which themselves provide an important economic
impetus. Alumni and professors from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology alone started more than 600 companies in the state, and students
are big spenders in the local economy. Harvard University is one of the
largest employers in Massachusetts.
Although the city has moved forward, remnants of a sleepier past are
evident. At times the city appears too staid. Boston has never had a black
mayor, for example, and Menino is the first non-Irish mayor to be elected in
decades. For a town with so many students - they account for about 17 per
cent of the population - Boston also goes to bed surprisingly early. It can
be difficult to get a meal in the city after 10pm.
Boston suffers from more serious blemishes as well. Despite its left-wing
traditions, the city has been unable to shake the image of racism earned
when it pioneered 'busing' in the 1970s. The practice, which sought to
provide a better racial mix in schools by transporting black children to
white neighbourhoods and vice versa, sparked off a series of riots and
deepened racial divisions.
In fact, critics say one reason Boston is relatively safe is because
residents tend to stay in their own neighbourhoods, exacerbating
segregation. They also complain that most of the urban renewal money has
been invested in the downtown and up-market residential areas, and has done
little to help poor enclaves such as Dorchester, Roxbury and Hyde Park.
Still, as so many US cities confront devastating crime, worsening pollution
and crumbling infrastructure, Mayor Menino feels he is in an enviable
position.
'I feel lucky sometimes, because Boston is still a city that works,' he
said. But the city wants to be more than just a nice place to live. Time
will tell if its ambitious plans for the future will be realised.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Survey of Massachusetts (8): Sacred cod no longer works its
miracle - The Fishing Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not many states think enough of fish to build a statue of one, but
Massachusetts does. The 'sacred cod' a wooden effigy of a fish, was hung in
the state's House of Representatives two centuries ago to symbolise its
importance to the Massachusetts economy and is still a big tourist
attraction today.
The fishing industry itself has had less staying power. Stocks of cod and
other key commercial species have dwindled to dangerously low levels, and
fishermen have seen their daily catches fall to just a fraction of what they
once were.
Faced with a desperate situation, the State Division of Marine Fisheries,
which oversees fishing regulation, put in place in May a number of rules
which limit days at sea and the hole size in fishing nets. The agency now
says that those regulations are insufficient and wants to have important
fishing areas declared off limits.
The latest moves, fishermen say, will mean devastating unemployment for many
coastal towns which still depend on the industry. The Gloucester Fisheries
Commission, which represents fishermen, predicts that half the people
employed in the sector today will lose their jobs.
Although fishermen say pollution is partly to blame for the decline in fish
stocks, environmentalists and the Division of Marine Fisheries say the real
problem is overfishing.
'This area has been overfished for years, and if we don't do something about
it now, stocks of cod and other fish could completely disappear,' said Mr
Philip Coates, director of the Division.
Local congressmen have succeeded in winning some federal support for the
fishermen. About Dollars 30m in aid is being directed to re-training
programmes and other initiatives. But fishing activists say while young
fishermen may be able to learn other skills, older fishermen will have a
hard time changing professions.
'A lot of the fishermen in Massachusetts immigrated from Sicily and Portugal
and may not have got past a fourth grade education,' said Mr Howard
Nickerson, director of the Offshore Mariners Association in New Bedford.
'This is all they've ever done and all they've ever wanted to do. I don't
think they'll be getting into computer programming.'
For those who remain in the business, times will be tough. Some of the
federal aid money may go towards promoting species such as mackerel and
dogfish, which traditionally have not sold well. But the fishermen say
marketing can only do so much. 'Housewives just don't like to prepare
mackerel,' said Mr Anthony Verga, executive director of the Gloucester
Fisheries Commission. 'They think it's too oily and smelly.'
Fishermen and environmentalists are looking to the Canadian model of fish
stock management. Canadians have used generous benefit packages, which
include buying fishermen's boats and settling their debts, to reduce the
number of people in the industry.
Because fishing stocks are near collapse, environmentalists say strict rules
must be enacted now, and fishermen themselves agree that something drastic
must be done to turn fish populations around.
It will probably take many years for the regulations to make a difference to
fish stocks. In the meantime, many fishermen will be forced out of business,
and towns built on the fishing industry will probably suffer profoundly. The
sacred cod no longer works its miracle on the Massachusetts economy.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Survey of Massachusetts (7): Success harks back to the
city's origins - Fund Management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever else may have gone wrong with the Massachusetts economy in the late
1980s, Boston's fund management industry never missed a beat.
At the tail-end of the boom in 1989, Boston-based Fidelity, America's
biggest fund manager, had Dollars 109bn under management and 6,500
employees. It now manages Dollars 295bn and employs 14,100.
Bostonians have a sense of history, and explanations of their success in
fund management tend to hark back to the city's origins.
Mr Daniel Pierce, chairman of Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark (funds under
management: Dollars 90bn-plus) says: 'In many ways, Boston is the cradle of
investment management. It probably goes back to the point where wealth was
created in this country on the east coast rather than the west coast.
'The legal concept of the prudent man came up through the courts here in
Massachusetts, and people became trustees here in the days when you managed
money out of your hip pocket.'
Professor Michael Porter, of the Harvard Business School, agrees:
'Massachusetts always had a financial centre: it's where the industrial
revolution really started. When you get critical mass, you start a chain
reaction.
'Every company that makes a presentation to analysts comes to Boston - you
can hit 100 institutions here. The State Street Bank and the Bank of Boston
are among the country's biggest custodians. And talented people in the
financial community like living in Boston - it's an intellectual community
and a nice place to live.'
Scudder, according to Mr Pierce, can claim to have been America's first pure
investment manager, having been formed in 1919.
Scudder, Stevens and Clark were Harvard graduates who started out in broking
as bond salesmen.
'One of their clients was the head of the Boston Fed,' Mr Pierce says. 'They
came up with a service for him based on a fee for assets under management.
So they came up with the investment counsel concept.'
The success of up-market Boston firms such as Scudder is partly based on an
adroit combination of professionalism and genteel discretion. Private
clients with a net worth of Dollars 1m-Dollars 2m, Mr Pierce remarks, are
Scudder's bread and butter.
Many of them are not from Boston. 'I've had a lot of good clients from New
Orleans. That's an even tinier place than Boston, so perhaps privacy is an
element there.'
Another part of Boston's success is based precisely on its distance from New
York. There is an intriguing British parallel in the investment centre of
Edinburgh, where fund managers like to argue that they gain in objectivity
by viewing the London market from afar.
'With modern communications you can have analysts anywhere,' Mr Pierce says.
'But in New York, you can get quite swept up by the emotions of the market.
People get quite hysterical down there.
'Part of our job is to be a stabilising influence, and that's easier when
you're away from the screaming and yelling.'
Nevertheless, he concedes, New York tends to have the more international
outlook. That is important to Scudder, which is quite unusual among US firms
in its international exposure.
Against a US industry average of 7-9 per cent of assets invested abroad,
Scudder has 30-35 per cent.
In equities, it has more money invested abroad than at home; and while the
bulk of its bond business is handled out of Boston, most of its global
equity funds are run out of New York.
But the mutual fund industry continues to increase its employment in
Massachusetts.
According to Fidelity, its US employment has risen 33 per cent since August
1993 to 13,900: its Massachusetts employment has risen 24 per cent to 6,700.
Thus, Ms Connie Hubble, of Fidelity, points out, while the firm's 7m
customers are spread across the US, half its employees are still in
Massachusetts. 'This is our home and our heritage, and it will remain that
way,' she says.
This fact has been a godsend to the local real-estate market, which has
never really recovered its nerve since the crash of 1989.
Scudder has just started building a 110,000 sq ft office building 15 miles
to the south of Boston - the first such new building in the area for years.
According to an estimate quoted recently in the New York Times, the
mutual-fund industry now occupies 8.5m sq ft in the Boston metropolitan
area, compared with 3m in 1989.
Looking forward, the Boston fund management community may find it hard to
combine explosive growth with regional loyalty. However, it seems committed
to trying.
'Our objective,' says Mr Pierce, 'is to be a pre-eminent global investment
firm. I don't think you have to give up your heritage to do that.'

FT  17 NOV 94 / Survey of Massachusetts (3): Image has taken a battering -
Technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The image of Massachusetts as a hotbed of high technology has taken
something of a battering in recent years, writes Tony Jackson.
In the 1980s, the Route 128 corridor around Boston was trumpeted as the east
coast's answer to Silicon Valley. Now, say the critics, look at the
contrast. Silicon Valley has wonderful high-tech companies such as Intel and
Hewlett-Packard: Massachusetts has disasters such as Digital Equipment and
Wang.
In fact, the comparison is skewed by one simple fact. Wang and Digital were
among a handful of big, well-established Massachusetts companies which
concentrated on mini-computers, which turned out to be a blind alley in the
era of the networked personal computer.
Forget the headlines, say the state's defenders. A pool of highly talented
workers, backed by a well-developed venture capital industry and the
enormous resources of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and
Harvard, make Massachusetts as much a hotbed as ever it was.
Professor Michael Porter of the Harvard Business School goes further. 'I
think we have now eclipsed Silicon Valley,' he says.
'The latest Inc. 500 report (on the 500 fastest growing private companies in
America) showed that Massachusetts had 33 companies on the list, and
California had 71. California is around 14 per cent of the nation's economy
and Massachusetts is 2.5 per cent. Do your sums, and Massachusetts is much
the more exciting.'
Part of this, he says, has to do with developments in technology.
'California hit on the PC and the workstation while we had the
mini-computer,' he says.
'So we had a pause while they charged ahead. But the wave of the future now
is networking, and we have company after company in the telecoms networking
business. And while the west coast may have the consumer software, we have
the sophisticated business software. The Massachusetts cluster is better
positioned to ride the wave in the next phase.'
In addition, he argues, Massachusetts now enjoys a much better relationship
between government and business. 'One reason this area was down in the mouth
in the late 1980s was the anti-business attitude: high taxes, and incredibly
liberal regulatory plans.'
Under Governor William Weld, this has changed. 'California has replaced us
as the anti-business state. It was so prosperous that people got to feel
that any amount of social activism could be afforded. It will take longer to
turn California around than it did Massachusetts, because it's such a big
state.'
Another fundamental reason advanced for Massachusetts' strength in high-tech
is its universities, in particular MIT. The links here are all-pervasive and
date back more than a century.
Professor Merton Flemings, head of the department of materials science and
engineering, chairs a task force on links between MIT and industry. 'From
its earliest days, MIT had an intimate association with industry in
Massachusetts and New England,' he says. 'Alexander Graham Bell spent time
studying at MIT, and the telephone was invented in the Boston area.'
The defence giant Raytheon was founded by MIT graduates just before the war,
Digital Equipment just after.
EG&amp;G, a local specialist in nuclear weapons and power plants with sales of
Dollars 2.7bn, was founded by an MIT professor and two of his students.
The main areas of commercial promise, in Professor Flemings' view, are
information technology, materials science and engineering, manufacturing
technology in general and healthcare. 'Information technology remains a very
strong area,' he says. 'In the development of small companies, we may even
lead in this field.'
And then, of course, there is biotechnology. In Massachusetts as elsewhere,
this has a poor image at present.
A string of biotech companies, most recently Biogen, of Cambridge, Mass.,
has wrought havoc in the stock market by revealing that some of their
much-hyped new pharmaceutical products have turned out to be duds.
Professor Flemings takes the long view. 'The biotech industry here remains
strong, and new companies continue to be formed. The stock market may have
taken a bath, but I think we'll see continuing and growing strength in the
Massachusetts region.'
This is warmly seconded by Mr Henri Termeer, head of Genzyme, the
third-biggest US biotech company, also based in Cambridge.
New England, he points out, has the second-largest concentration of biotech
companies in the US, after the Bay area around San Francisco. Massachusetts,
he says, has some 140 biotech companies - 'around the same number as in the
whole of western Europe.'
In the industry's last big bout of fund-raising, in 1991 and the first
quarter of 1992, Massachusetts companies raised 20 per cent of the Dollars
6bn total. Genzyme's own commitment to the area seems beyond dispute. In
round terms, the company has 1,000 employees in Massachusetts, 500 elsewhere
in the US and 400 abroad. It has also just spent Dollars 100m on a new plant
next door to the Harvard Business School on the Charles river.
When considering where to put the plant, Mr Termeer says, he also looked
closely at a site in North Carolina. 'At one point I was reported (in a
local Boston paper) as saying we were about to choose between the two. The
governor was in my office the next day, asking what he could do to help.'
The decision in favour of Massachusetts, he claims, was based less on
financial incentives than on the state's determination to make the company
feel welcome and to smooth the way to the early commissioning of the plant.
In fact, he says, Massachusetts is not a friendly environment for a
manufacturer in his industry; labour costs are high, regulations are
burdensome and there is no tradition of pharmaceutical manufacture as there
is in North Carolina or New Jersey. However, he says, 'I gambled on the
notion that the goodwill I saw, and the tremendous technological backbone of
Harvard and MIT, would allow the beginning of a manufacturing cluster in
Harvard.'
Whether this will work remains to be seen. Meanwhile, he argues,
Massachusetts has a further important advantage in his industry: the
availability of committed and knowledgeable investors.
On the one hand, he says, there are a large number of venture capital funds
in the area, always on the look-out for opportunities. In addition, there
are the big fund management houses.
'They have healthcare analysts who become much more familiar with what's
happening here because of their proximity. As a result, Massachusetts
companies have a disproportionate amount of local funding. Fidelity is a big
investor in Genzyme: we have done eight financings, and Fidelity has taken
around 5-10 per cent of the initial offering in well over half of them.'

FT  17 NOV 94 / Survey of Massachusetts (4): A burden and a blessing - Frank
McGurty examines the healthcare sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By all accounts, Massachusetts has one of the finest healthcare systems in
the US, indeed the world. Its 150 hospitals are renowned for their technical
excellence. Harvard leads a list of prestigious medical schools which assure
the state has a pool of highly skilled doctors.
A dense concentration of research laboratories gives patients access to the
latest innovations in treatment and technology.
Yet this seemingly enviable position is as much a burden for the
commonwealth as a blessing. As the healthcare industry struggles to adapt to
mounting pressures to control medical inflation, it has become evident that
the elite nature of the system is itself at least partly to blame for the
high costs.
For hospitals and clinics around the state, the tension between survival and
maintaining the highest quality care has become painfully apparent over the
past two years.
Big purchasers of healthcare - including employers, insurers and the
government - are forcing providers to become more efficient. A sweeping
restructuring of the industry, which employs about 10.5 per cent of the
state's workforce, is all but inevitable.
The consequences of this shake-out will extend well beyond the sector, with
hospital closures and consolidations likely to impede the economy in its
tentative recovery from recession. Estimates of the number of healthcare job
losses range up to 30,000, with most of them pruned from hospital staffs.
That represents a stunning reversal for the industry, which was one of the
few sources of new employment in Massachusetts between 1988 and 1993, when
the state's economy suffered a net loss of 400,000 jobs.
The market forces driving the industry to restructure have gathered momentum
independently of the sputtering efforts in Congress to enact healthcare
reform legislation.
In the commonwealth, the consolidation is well under way.
'In Massachusetts, healthcare reform is now an auto-catalytic process,' says
Mr Ron Hollander, vice-president of the Massachusetts Hospital Association.
'The faster it goes, the faster it will go.'
The most important development so far was the merger of Massachusetts
General and Brigham &amp; Women's, two of most prestigious hospitals in the
state.
The goal of the affiliation, announced last March, is to reduce their
combined operating budgets by at least 20 per cent over three years,
initially through administrative and supply savings, and later by
eliminating duplicative medical services.
Their union carries symbolic and practical implications for the state's
entire healthcare delivery system. It has already triggered a flurry of new
alliances between providers seeking to assure themselves of a big enough
piece of a shrinking pie to survive into the next century.
'If hospitals with the reputation, clinical strength and financial strength
of Mass General and Brigham &amp; Women's see the need to combine forces, what
institution can believe it can go it alone?' asks Mr Hollander.
Most of the restructuring activity is aimed at creating efficiencies through
'downsizing' and outright closures of hospitals and other facilities.
In mid-sized cities such as Worcester and New Bedford, hospitals have either
banded together into two or three competing groups in each market, or are
discussing such a move.
Some big city hospitals are striking deals to divide up the available
business. In June, Deaconess Hospital and New England Baptist forged a pact
under which the former would focus on adult tertiary medicine and surgery,
while the latter would concentrate on muscular-skeletal disorders.
Meanwhile, new affiliations between different types of providers - such as
teaching hospitals, community hospitals and physician groups - are being
constructed, especially in and around the state capital. Such hierarchal
networks are intended to ensure that patients are treated in the most
appropriate - and cost-efficient - setting.
Carney Hospital, to name just one, is negotiating with the fledgling Mass
General-Brigham organisation. An affiliation with the 289-bed community
hospital, serving neighbourhoods south of downtown Boston, could give the
partners access to a sizeable base of new patients for their specialised
units. For Carney, which has lost about 8 per cent of its in-hospital volume
in the past three years, the deal may represent a financial lifeline.
'The process is not just about cutting a housekeeper here or clerk there,'
says Mr Hollander. 'It's about fundamentally rethinking what we do in order
to devise more efficient and effective ways of delivering care.'
Analysts point out that the commonwealth spends more per person for
healthcare than any other state. Average payments for services and
prescriptions are about 20 per cent higher than the US average, according to
the Families USA Foundation, an advocacy group.
The reasons are not entirely clear, but the evidence suggests that the state
has too much of several good things. High personal income and generous
benefit packages from Massachusetts employers seem to play a role. More
importantly perhaps, a recent study conducted by a group of industry leaders
and healthcare professionals suggests the state simply has too many doctors
and hospitals.
That would not appear to be a problem. However, in apparent defiance of the
law of supply and demand, 'healthcare spending has been observed to increase
with the size of a state's healthcare infrastructure', the group says in its
report, released last spring.
The anomaly is explained by the emphasis on in-hospital treatment which
results from the sheer number of providers, particularly expensive urban
medical centres and teaching hospitals, such as Mass General and Brigham &amp;
Women's.
'While Massachusetts teaching hospitals are a vital resource, contributing
to the state's prestigious reputation. . . care in teaching settings is
known to be more costly,' according to the study, conducted for the
Governor's Council on Economic Growth and Technology.
Ironically, the pressure to control healthcare inflation arguably is now
more intense in Massachusetts than anywhere else. This is largely because
the state has a greater proportion of its population - about 40 per cent -
enrolled in so-called health maintenance organisations (HMOs).
In contrast to traditional indemnity insurers, which pay a percentage of
their policyholders' healthcare fees on a service-by-service basis, HMOs
offer subscribers a full range of services for a fixed price. They are
forcing doctors and hospitals under contract with them to keep expensive
services, such as hospital admissions, to a bare minimum.
If anything, their clout to bargain for lower rates will probably increase,
as HMOs begin a consolidation of their own. Harvard Community Health Plan,
the commonwealth's biggest HMO, is awaiting regulatory approval for its
agreed merger with Matthew Thorton, a New Hampshire-based group, and Pilgrim
Health Care of Massachusetts. The combined organisation would have about 1m
members in four New England states.
In the face of such pressure, and the development of technology that
facilitates out-patient care, hospitals are finding themselves with too many
empty beds. Industry observers estimate that the number of patient-days in
hospital will shrink by 30 to 50 per cent from the peak years in the
mid-1980s. That precludes a drastic reduction in the number of available
beds, and a subsequent cut in hospital staff throughout the state.
In the end, employers who now must foot the bill for the country's most
expensive healthcare system are likely to benefit. The big losers, at least
temporarily, are sure to be the thousands who will lose their jobs.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Survey of Massachusetts (5): Budget cuts put 10,000 out of
work - Defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Massachusetts economy has relied heavily on defence spending for 50
years, and is now paying the price. The starkest illustration comes from
Raytheon, maker of the Patriot missile and the state's biggest
private-sector employer.
Since 1990, the federal defence procurement budget has halved. In the same
period Raytheon has cut its Massachusetts workforce by a third, or 10,000
people. At the start of this year it had four missile plants in the state:
it now has one. According to Mr Dennis Picard, Raytheon's chairman: 'Our
employment will stabilise when the defence budget does.'
Like so much else in the Massachusetts economy, the defence industry is
intimately connected with the state's universities. Raytheon was born out of
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology: one of the company's founders in
1922, Vannevar Bush, later became MIT's dean of engineering.
Professor Merton Flemings, the present head of MIT's department of materials
science and engineering, takes up the story. 'During World War Two, MIT and
its research were turned entirely to the war effort. MIT was central to the
atom bomb and the development of radar. The inertial guidance system for
ballistic missiles was developed by faculty members here.
'From then until this year, there was a partnership between MIT and the
federal government. Their largesse has allowed us buildings and equipment,
and we have contributed especially to national security.'
Much of the government's spending has been concentrated on the Lincoln
Laboratory, a defence-centred establishment controlled by the government but
operated by MIT. On top of that comes MIT's own research budget, now running
at Dollars 360m a year. A large part of that, says Professor Flemings, has
historically been defence-related. 'That's going down rapidly now. The
so-called partnership with government over the past 50 years is changing,
and should do. The national needs are changing, and MIT's as well.'
This raises the central question of how far defence-related research and
manufacture can be converted to civilian use. In general terms, Professor
Flemings is not sanguine. 'In the period to around 1975, I think the
research sponsored by the Department of Defence was a significant
contributor to the industrial sector. It produced some very important
information technologies and new materials.
'After that, the technological advances needed for military systems moved
further and further from things of commercial value and significance. There
was more and more emphasis on performance regardless of cost. It's been very
difficult to translate much of that to the commercial sector, where the
emphasis is on high volume and low cost.'
Mr Picard of Raytheon agrees with much of this. Cost is obviously a problem,
he says, and neither defence products nor defence plants can readily be
switched to commercial use. 'There is no commercial use for a guided missile
or a warhead, and we build a lot of missiles.'
As for converting plants, 'I have a refrigeration plant in Iowa. Suppose I
tried to move it to one of our plants here. Besides the fact that the
politicians would object, trying to build that kind of product in a missile
plant doesn't work. The workforce isn't trained for it, and the rules are
different.'
He is more optimistic about conversion to civil use on other grounds.
Granted, the product may be uncommercial. 'That's not to say you can't use
the technology, or the concept, or the systems engineering. Radar is a good
example. In a military context, you work to very high specifications and
expense, and put in special features to stop jamming and so forth. But it's
not too hard to commercialise the components: you just don't test them to
the same levels. As for the special counter-measures, you just take them
out.'
He cites the high-tech electronic medium of gallium arsenide as another
example. 'We developed that for monolithic integrated circuits used in
ground-based radar to detect things like Scud missiles. Now, you can still
grow chips and circuits on gallium arsenide, but you do it much more
efficiently by sample testing at the end of the line rather than testing
individually'.
Nevertheless, he remains gloomy about defence employment overall. 'I'd love
to be able to say to our people that we'll stabilise tomorrow. The problem
is that the defence budget is coming down as a step function, otherwise
known as a cliff. We have to hope that it will turn into a slope. It would
be absolutely wonderful to build our defence business back up, and re-employ
those skilled and talented people we've laid off. But I don't think it's
going to happen.'
Despite all that, Raytheon is an encouraging symbol of Massachusetts
resilience. It remains an immensely strong company, with good cash flow and
a strong balance sheet. Year by year, its profits have increased, and its
latest quarter was an all-time record. This results partly from brutal
cost-saving, partly from a heroic and singularly successful effort to
diversify.
In 1990, when the cuts began to bite, defence accounted for 53 per cent of
Raytheon's turnover. The figure this year will be around 35 per cent. Part
of this is due to plunging defence revenues, but the company has also been
active in finding business elsewhere.
Last year, it bought the corporate jet business of British Aerospace,
causing a local commotion when it shut down UK production.
More recently, it paid Dollars 172m for Xyplex, a US manufacturer of
products linking desk-top computers.
In a classic instance of turning swords into ploughshares, it has just
landed a hotly-contested Dollars 1bn-plus contract to supply environmental
monitoring for the Amazon basin.
From a Massachusetts viewpoint, the big remaining question is whether
Raytheon will follow the route of other US defence giants such as Lockheed
and Martin Marietta, and combine forces with a rival to cut costs and reduce
jobs further. Mr Picard's answer is encouraging.
'I've got a five-year programme which is on plan, and a very strong company.
I do have a problem with the order book. If we could acquire a defence
company which wouldn't dilute earnings, had synergy and would help protect
jobs, then we'd do it. But I'm not interested in buying lay-offs. We've done
10,000 already, and we're getting to some very talented people. You have an
obligation to the stockholders, but also to our people.'

FT  17 NOV 94 / Survey of Massachusetts (2): Affair with Democratic party
may be cooling - Victoria Griffith examines Massachusetts politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Massachusetts voters seemed to have a split political personality during the
mid-term elections last week. While they delivered Edward Kennedy, one of
the last liberal hold-outs in the US, back to the Senate, they also handed
Republican Governor William Weld a landslide victory.
With 71 per cent of Massachusetts voters supporting Weld, pundits began to
ask whether the political tide was changing in the state.
Massachusetts has long been known as the Democratic Party's paradise.
Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans in the state by three
to one. The state handed Bill Clinton one of his biggest victories in the
election two years ago, and residents still give the president his strongest
approval ratings in the nation. 'Massachusetts Liberals' has been a label
residents of the state have carried, sometimes proudly, for decades.
Nearly all the famous politicians Massachusetts has produced over the years
have been Democrats. The Kennedys built their political legend from a Boston
base, and Tip O'Neill, former speaker of the House of Representatives,
hailed from Massachusetts.
The Massachusetts Democratic party has also produced some famous failed
contenders. Mike Dukakis, Bush's ill-fated opponent in 1988, was a former
governor of the state; and Paul Tsongas, whom Clinton defeated for the
Democratic nomination two years ago, was a Massachusetts senator.
But there are signs that the state's love affair with the Democratic party
is cooling. Edward Kennedy won a comfortable victory over challenger Mitt
Romney, but only after facing the toughest election battle of his 32-year
senate career. Just weeks before the election, polls showed the two
candidates in a dead-heat.
'The time when people in Massachusetts roll over and play dead for the
Democrats is over,' said Mr Weld. The Republican governor's popularity is
one reason the GOP has been gaining ground in the state. With his pro-choice
stance and strong support for women and gay rights, Mr Weld has helped to
forge a new brand of Republicanism which has made the party more acceptable
in socially liberal Massachusetts. Still, political analysts accustomed to
the state's left-wing image were shocked when the governor succeeded in
pushing privatisation and hefty spending cuts through the overwhelmingly
Democratic state congress over the past four years.
And the private sector was relieved when it saw Massachusetts taking a more
aggressively pro-business stance, encouraging companies to stay in the state
by cutting taxes and helping them through the permitting bureaucracy.
Fortune magazine now rates Boston one of the best cities in the country to
do business.
The Republicans have benefited from demographic changes in the state as
well. The Massachusetts economy was once based on manufacturing, and
unionised factory workers showed a strong preference for Democratic
candidates.
But the state now relies on high technology and service industries such as
fund management and biotechnology, whose employees tend to be wealthier and
more concerned about high taxes and government spending. Because urban
dwellers are much more likely to vote Democratic than suburbanites, an
exodus of residents from Massachusetts' cities to suburbia has also helped
the Republicans.
Even traditional Democratic candidates had to make concessions to these
shifts in their campaigns this year. Mark Roosevelt presented himself as a
fiscal conservative, and Kennedy began to sound like a Republican when he
talked about getting tough on crime, rhetoric that goes down well with
suburban voters.
In spite of the changes, Massachusetts is far from becoming a Republican
stronghold. In the end, Kennedy won the election by 17 points. Joe Kennedy,
Edward's nephew, ran unopposed for his own Democratic seat in the US House
of Representatives, and the state's Washington delegation is still
overwhelmingly Democratic. The mayorship of the city of Boston, now in the
hands of Thomas Menino, is also considered safely in Democratic hands.
Yet the days when Democratic candidates were almost assured of victory
against Republican opponents are now over, and the state has taken a
definite turn to the right. Massachusetts is still a receptive place for
Democrats, but it is no longer the Democratic heaven it once was.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Survey of Massachusetts (1): Strengths reassert themselves -
The state may have started to take its prosperity for granted, says Tony
Jackson. In which case, the downturn will have had a salutary effect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON

<TEXT>
It has been a tough six years for the state of Massachusetts. Between 1988
and 1992, it suffered more job losses in proportion to its size than any US
state since the great depression.
For the home of the so-called high-tech Massachusetts Miracle - and the seat
of Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)  - the blow
to morale was profound. Now, however, the state's defenders claim that its
native strengths are reasserting themselves: Massachusetts, they say, is
climbing back.
To appreciate their case, it helps to recall what went wrong in the first
place. Mr Wayne Ayers, chief economist of the Bank of Boston, says: 'The
years of the so-called Massachusetts Miracle (in the 1980s) were an
aberration. It was a confluence of one-off factors.'
Chief of those was the build-up of defence spending under President Ronald
Reagan. Although Massachusetts' technological base is impressive in breadth
as well as depth, by the start of the 1980s the defence industry had come to
assume an unhealthy dominance. For decades, MIT's research activities were
skewed by government defence funding. Raytheon, the defence giant which
makes the Patriot missile, is the state's biggest private-sector employer.
When defence spending passed its peak in 1987, trouble was inevitable.
It did not help that another integral part of the so-called miracle,
Massachusett's computer industry, was in the wrong part of the market. Its
biggest companies, Digital Equipment and Wang, were concentrating on the
mini-computer just as the personal computer revolution was getting under
way. While the state was, and remains, a seedbed for small-company
innovation in information technology, by the end of the 1980s it was better
known for its stumbling giants.
The prosperous years had one further malign effect: in a small, compact
state like Massachusetts, property prices went through the roof. By 1987 all
the warning signs were there: the proportion of the Massachusetts workforce
employed in construction, for instance, was among the highest in the
country. The result, in 1989, was a property collapse.
All this led to a period of serious introspection. Professor Michael Porter,
of the Harvard Business School, says: 'There were grave doubts about the
future of the Massachusetts economy. We had the lowest credit rating of any
state. It was felt there was something deeply wrong in a structural sense,
analogous to the loss of the textile industry in the past.'
A recent document * bearing the imprint of Massachusetts Governor William
Weld - in which Professor Porter also had a hand - develops the point. In
the late 18th century, it observes, Massachusetts enjoyed a burst of
prosperity through Boston's dominance of American shipping; then, in the
early 19th century, it was overhauled by the Port of New York. Again, it
gained a commanding lead in a wide range of manufacturing in the late 19th
century, only to lose its competitive edge to cheap southern labour by the
1920s.
In that context, the loss of momentum in the late 1980s could be seen as
deeply serious. The high-tech boom, which had its origins in the start-up
companies around Boston's Route 128, represented a third wave of prosperity
for Massachusetts. In other words, the normal pattern of recession and
recovery may not apply. 'A more relevant consideration,' says the document,
'is whether the high-tech boom has ended in Massachusetts, or merely
stumbled badly.'
In Prof Porter's own view, the latter is true. 'What is unique about this
state is that it's a remarkable engine for new business creation. New
companies emerge with enormous frequency, not just in new industries but in
textiles and apparels. In fact, this is an economy with enormous strength
which has been weighed down by public policy.' This is an important point
for advocates of the Massachusetts economy. In effect, they say, the state
started to take its prosperity for granted. The downturn has thus had a
salutary effect, especially in prompting its various constituencies -
business, government, the universities - to co-ordinate a 1990s-style
industrial policy.
'This state is a very interesting story which gets repeated around the
world,' Prof Porter says. 'It starts from strength: we inherited Harvard and
MIT and a pool of capital and financial institutions, and when the high-tech
revolution started in the late 1960s and early 1970s, this state was in the
right position. But as wealth was created, forces were triggered which
started to erode that environment: regulation, taxes, anti-business
sentiment.'
However, he argues, Massachusetts was paradoxically lucky in being very
early into recession.
'Texas came first with the downturn in oil, then us with real estate. A
number of dominoes then started falling into place. A lot of the state's
political leaders understood that we couldn't deal with our social problems
if we weren't making money. So we got a pro-business governor and state
legislature; and since this is a small state, we were able to make big
headway in a relatively short time.' Much of this has involved the state
government's working closely with business leaders. Prof Porter, who chairs
a body called the Governor's Council on Economic Growth, says: 'We've gone
one by one through industry clusters, saying 'Let's find out what government
is doing to make life difficult, and let's change it.''
At the same time, Massachusetts has benefited from cyclical recovery in the
US economy, and particularly from a prolonged period of low interest rates.
The combined result, says Mr Ayers, of the Bank of Boston, is that the
economy is now in better shape than anyone would have thought possible a
couple of years ago.
In the period 1988-92, Massachusetts lost 600,000 jobs. 'Two years ago,
people were saying it would take until the turn of the century to get those
jobs back. But just over a third of them have come back already. In
percentage terms, Massachusetts is now slightly better than average:
unemployment in the country is 6 per cent, and we're below that.'
Partly, he admits, that is because many people lost heart in the depths of
the downturn and migrated out of the state. 'But still, nobody would have
believed two years ago that we'd be close to the national average, let alone
below it.'
There is still one cloud on the horizon. The healthcare industry employs
even more people in the state than the defence industry. Through the late
1980s, this was one sector which remained robust. Now, healthcare spending
is under fire throughout the US.
Mr Ayers is fairly sanguine about this. 'Healthcare won't be the prop that
it was, but it shouldn't be a drag either.' A recent study from the Federal
Reserve Bank of Boston partly bears him out: granted that the healthcare
industry will have to cut costs, it says that represents a saving for local
employees and individuals.
Above all, Mr Ayers agrees with Prof Porter on the importance of small
companies in the Massachusetts economy. 'The concentration of higher
education means this place is still an incubator of small high-tech firms.
Many of these were growing throughout the downturn, though not by enough to
offset the big hits in defence and computers.'
Nevertheless, the revival of Massachusetts as a manufacturing centre seems
to have been relatively short-lived. 'Virtually all the job growth we've
seen here has been in services,' Mr Ayers says. 'These jobs are not flipping
hamburgers or taking in each other's laundry. But we have continued to lose
jobs in manufacturing since a decade ago.'
There are signs that this may be bottoming out, he says. 'But this is still
a high-cost place to manufacture. And software and biotech companies tend to
be small, cerebral outfits which will never be big manufacturing employers
in the way the mini-computer industry was.'
Perhaps, though, the last word should go to one of the academics who provide
the backbone for Massachusetts' high-tech industry. Professor Merton
Flemings, head of materials science and engineering at MIT, says simply:
'Whatever effect the drop in the economy had is long gone in my memory. We
see great strength here, and growing strength.'

FT  17 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries fall as data-fuelled rally runs
out of steam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury prices fell sharply yesterday as they failed to hold on to
early-morning gains in the wake of positive news on inflation.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 5/8 at
93 11/32 , yielding 8.088 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note declined  1/16 at 99 17/32 to yield 7.116 per cent.
Treasuries across the maturity spectrum were unable to sustain an
early-morning rally spurred by reports that consumer prices increased less
than economists had projected. The Labour department reported that consumer
prices, excluding food and energy, increased only 0.2 per cent in October.
Analysts had expected a 0.3 per cent rise.
Overall, consumer prices grew 0.1 per cent - the smallest increase since
April - bringing the yearly inflation rate down to 2.5 per cent in October
from 3 per cent in September.
However, neither the positive inflationary news nor Tuesday afternoon's move
by the Federal Reserve to boost the Federal funds rate 75 basis points to 5
1/2 per cent calmed the skittish market.
Although the interest rate increase was larger than expected, the market was
expecting a rise of at least 50 basis points, giving the Fed move little
impact after an initial rally on Tuesday, just after the announcement.
Also, in its announcement on the rate increase, the Fed clearly left the
door open for a another rise if it continues to see signs of inflation. Such
uncertainty about interest rates may keep some investors out of the market
for fear that interest instability could undermine prices.
Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities, believes the market
is unsatisfied with the interest rate increase, although he does not see
signs of inflation. 'The bond market loves it when bad things happen,' he
said.
UK government bonds were buoyed by favourable inflation data yesterday, but
other European government bond markets dipped, following US Treasuries down
in the absence of a lead from German bunds due to a national holiday.
Gilts rose  5/32 of a point and the December long gilt future closed around
102 3/16 as investors reacted to figures which showed year-on-year
underlying retail price inflation unchanged at 2 per cent, and a fall in the
public sector borrowing requirement.
Mr Michael Saunders, economist at Salomon Brothers, said: 'The inflation
figure was better than everybody had been hoping for.'
The March short sterling future rose 19 basis points on the day to 92.95,
suggesting that investors now believe there is less likelihood of a rise in
UK base rates from the current 5.75 per cent. Mr Saunders said: 'Short
sterling is moving to price in unchanged base rates. I would say it looks as
if rates are on hold until next year now.'
However, this view was not shared by Mr Nigel Richardson at Yamaichi, who
believes there may be a base rate rise before Christmas. He said: 'The
authorities will have to play it safe, and that means raising base rates.
Everyone seems to accept that base rates will have to go up further, and if
you are going to do it you might as well do it early.'
However, he remains bullish on gilts. 'Base rate rises don't have to be bad
for gilts. In the international context gilts are looking a very attractive
proposition,' he said.
Yields on the 10-year benchmark Italian government bond rose yesterday as
prices fell on political worries. The yield rose 14 basis points to 12.05
per cent from 11.91 per cent. Mr Graham McDevitt of Paribas Capital Markets
said: 'The same old theme of politics and the budget has come back. The
government has called a confidence vote. This is a brutal way of passing the
budget, because if things go wrong it could cause the government to fall.'
Swedish government bond prices also fell yesterday, with the yield on the
11-year benchmark bond rising 17 basis points to 11.01 per cent. Mr McDevitt
of Paribas pointed out that the yield on Friday, before the 'yes' result on
the referendum on Swedish membership of the European Union, was 11.11 per
cent.

FT  17 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: China turning to US for
financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China is likely to turn increasingly to the US bond market for external
financing of its ambitious infrastructure programme, according to an
International Monetary Fund survey.
The IMF, in its report* on trends in international capital markets, reports
that China will 'place more emphasis on bond financing relative to bank
financing in view of the lower interest rates on bonds and the availability
of longer maturities'.
This view is consistent with recent statements by a senior Ministry of
Finance official, who said China planned to borrow some Dollars 10bn in the
next five years in international capital markets.
The IMF report says the Chinese authorities have targeted the US, which they
view as the 'deepest market' and the one most likely to produce the longest
maturities.
This has been borne out, the report said, by the 'recent elongation' of
maturities in the dollar market to seven years in November 1992 for the
People's Construction Bank of China, and to 10 years in July 1993 for the
China International Trust and Investment Corporation.
The survey says China was 'quite active' in international markets between
1982, when it resumed bond issues, and 1989, when capital-raising abroad
slowed. The pace picked up again in 1991 and accelerated in 1993.
International bond placements at the end of last year stood at Dollars 9bn.
The IMF is critical of China's '10 windows' monopoly on international bond
issues. This restricts organisations authorised to borrow abroad to some 10
financial institutions.
However, it notes that the authorities are experimenting with 'necessary
first steps' to give enterprises independent access to international bond
markets.

Trifutures, the French trading house, has become the second Paris-based
participant in the joint venture between the futures and options exchanges
of France and Germany.
Another French company, Compagnie Parisienne de Reescompte, will start
operating directly from Paris later this month. By February 1995, the DTB,
the German futures exchange, expects to have 12 Paris-based members.
Germany's screen-based DTB and France's open-outcry exchange, Matif, last
year agreed to set up a co-operation programme, called Tradeus, which took
effect this summer.
The first phase of the co-operation involved the installation of DTB trading
screens in the offices of Matif members. The second phase, which allows for
two Matif products to be listed on the DTB, is expected to begin at the end
of next year.

FT  17 NOV 94 / International Bonds: Mixed demand for Italy's Y450bn
multi-tranche deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The eurobond market sprang back to life yesterday, revived by Tuesday's
increase in US interest rates. The dollar sector led the way, with several
issuers capitalising on the recent resurgence in investor demand for
short-dated US dollar paper.
The biggest deal of the day, however, was Republic of Italy's long-awaited
multi-tranche Y450bn offering consisting of Y125bn of 3.9 per cent
three-year bonds, Y200bn of 5 per cent 10-year bonds and Y125bn of 5.5 per
cent 20-year bonds. The three and 20-year portions were lead-managed by
Daiwa and Nomura, while the 10-year tranche was led by Daiwa alone.
Dealers reported healthy demand from Japanese retail investors for the
three-year tranche and from Japanese institutions and insurers for the
20-year tranche. However, most said the performance of the 10-year tranche
was disappointing, undermined in part by the large syndicate group for this
tranche, which contained a number of non-Japanese houses who sold their
allotments back to the lead manager soon after the syndicate broke.
In the dollar sector, the Hellenic Republic launched a Dollars 500m
five-year global bond via joint leads CS First Boston and Salomon Brothers.
The deal is due to be priced today, with an indicated yield spread of
190-200 basis points over Treasuries. While some dealers were sceptical that
Greece, with its BBB-/Baa3 credit rating (the lowest of the investment-grade
ratings), would entice investors, others said the deal's generous pricing
would attract decent demand.
'The main aim of this issue is to penetrate the US capital market,' said Mr
Spyros Papanicolaou, head of the international banking department at the
Bank of Greece. 'It is important for us to offer a good deal and get good
placement, even if it costs us a little more.'
Also tapping demand for short dollar paper, Landwirtschaftliche Rentenbank,
the Triple A rated German agricultural bank, made its eurodollar debut with
Dollars 250m of 7 5/8 per cent three-year bonds via Nomura, priced to yield
15 basis points over Treasuries.
Ontario Hydro also came to the three-year sector with Dollars 350m of 7 3/4
per cent bonds via CS First Boston, priced to yield 30 basis points over
Treasuries. Although some traders felt the pricing was aggressive, others
reported strong demand for the paper from European retail investors.
Dealers expect more short to medium-dated US dollar issuance in the near
term, including a Dollars 300m five-year deal today for the Japanese
government-guaranteed Electric Power Development Company, with IBJ tipped as
lead manager.

FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Six-month setback for East Japan
Railway

<TEXT>
East Japan Railway (JR East), the railway network serving eastern Japan
whose shares were listed just over a year ago, yesterday reported a decline
in profits for the six months to the end of September.
The company said the weakness of the economy had cut demand for rail travel
from both business and leisure travellers.
Recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - fell by 1.9 per
cent to Y72.2bn (Dollars 735m), on turnover down by 0.7 per cent at
Y988.7bn.
Net profits fell by 1 per cent to Y37.8bn.
Revenues from sales of commuter season tickets were almost unchanged at
Y253.3bn, with an increase in income from passes for the Shinkansen - the
'bullet train' - offsetting a slight fall in sales of other season tickets.
Non-season ticket sales fell by 1.2 per cent to Y615bn.
Property rental revenues rose 7.1 per cent to Y14.8bn, while train station
retail outlet sales were up 0.4 per cent to Y23.5bn.
Expenditures were heavily affected again by interest costs. The company
reported a slight fall in outstanding debt to Y5,010bn as of March 31 1994.
The company's debts are mostly those incurred during a period of heavy
losses when it was part of the nationalised Japan National Railways in the
1980s.
Even poorer prospects for the second half of the year forced JR East to
revise downwards its forecasts for the full year to March 1995.
The company now expects pre-tax profits of Y101.5bn, compared with an
earlier forecast of Y112bn and last year's actual pre-tax profits of
Y114.9bn.
Turnover is expected to be around Y1,964.4bn, against an earlier forecast of
Y1,968.2bn.

FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Regulator says no to BA-Qantas
co-operation

The Australian Trade Practices Commission, the country's competition
watchdog, has barred British Airways and Qantas, the Australian carrier,
from pooling resources on their Australia-to-Europe routes.
In a draft ruling, the TPC said that the carriers were seeking authorisation
of a wide-ranging open-ended agreement with detrimental anti-competitive
effects, given that their combined market share on the routes was around 50
per cent.
The two carriers announced earlier this year that they wanted to co-operate
on the so-called 'Kangaroo' routes, but the move brought strong protests
from consumer organisations and some rival airlines. They feared that a
BA-Qantas agreement could herald higher prices and less competition.
The move would have been the first significant operational change since
British Airways became a minority shareholder in Qantas last year, acquiring
a 25 per cent interest in the government-owned airline for ADollars 665m
(USDollars 500m). It would have meant the end to around 50 years of
competition on the Kangaroo routes, and the pooling of more than ADollars
1bn of annual revenues.
Qantas argued that the move would allow cost savings estimated to be worth
tens of millions of dollars. The routes, although a significant part of
Qantas' business accounting for about 25 per cent of its international
capacity, have not been a big money-earner.
Under the proposals, the two carriers would have split profits and revenue
on the route from Australia through Singapore or Bangkok to Europe. Qantas
would have cut services between Perth and Singapore from twice daily to
once. BA would have made up this capacity loss, but would have pulled out of
services to Adelaide.
The TPC ruling has important political implications, given the Australian
government's decision to float its remaining 75 per cent stake in Qantas
early next year.
The government has already shown it is willing to protect Qantas' short-term
profitability, by rescinding an agreement with New Zealand that would have
allowed Air New Zealand to fly Australian domestic routes. That decision
caused a political row between the two countries.
Legislation which could give more time for the flotation of the state's 75
per cent stake in Qantas was introduced yesterday. The bill extends a
deadline of June 30 next year for the share offering, to the end of August.

FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Fairfax posts strong advance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
John Fairfax, the Australian newspaper publishing group which now has about
43 per cent of its shares in the hands of Mr Rupert Murdoch, Mr Kerry Packer
and Mr Conrad Black, yesterday announced a 55 per cent increase in
first-quarter profits, to ADollars 39.4m (USDollars 29.68m) after tax but
before abnormals.
The improvement translated into a 40 per cent improvement in earnings per
share, at 5 cents. There was a small ADollars 2.5m abnormal gain from the
transfer of some magazine titles to a publishing joint venture, leaving
bottom line profits at ADollars 41.9m, against ADollars 25.4m last time.
Sales in the three months to end-September were up by 14.2 per cent to
ADollars 239m, while operating costs rose by 6.7 per cent to ADollars 74.3m.
Interest charges also fell by almost ADollars 2m to ADollars 8.85m. This
left operating profits 52.3 per cent higher at ADollars 59.2m.
Mr Stephen Mulholland, Fairfax chief executive, said advertising volumes had
been 'well above last year for all publications,' although he also
acknowledged that there was 'some softness' in some circulation figures
during the half-year to September. Advertising volumes at the Sydney Morning
Herald and the Melbourne Age were ahead of last year.
Mr Mulholland said trading results since September had 'continued to be
favourable'.
Release of the figures came ahead of today's annual meeting in Melbourne,
and amid continued speculation over the implications of Fairfax's unstable
share register.
Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian media tycoon, now holds almost 25 per cent of
the shares, and cannot go further under Australian foreign investment rules.
Mr Packer, the Australian businessman, is pegged at 15 per cent under media
cross-ownership regulations.
Mr Murdoch, who first acquired shares in June, is said to hold around 3 per
cent of the equity, although Mr Doug Halley, Fairfax finance director, said
the company was not currently sending out notices allowing it to identify
share purchases, and could not verify reports of recent purchases. In
August, Mr Murdoch's stake was around 2 per cent.

FT  17 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Study calls for exchange to
clear OTC contracts - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A self-regulating exchange should be set up to clear many over-the-counter
(OTC) derivatives contracts, recommends the winning entry in this year's
Amex Bank essay competition.
The authors, Mr David Folkerts-Landau and Mr Alfred Steinherr, say an
exchange or clearing house would help reduce credit risk and ensure
liquidity in the OTC market, where two-thirds of transactions are conducted.
They point to the success of clearing mechanisms at exchanges such as Liffe
and the Chicago Board of Trade.
The essay, 'The wild beast of derivatives: to be chained up, fenced in or
tamed?' is one of two concerning derivatives among the eight prize essays
published by Amex*, which announced details of the prize yesterday.
Both authors work with supra-national banks: Mr Folkerts-Landau is chief of
capital markets and financial studies division at the International Monetary
Fund; Mr Steinherr is director of the financial research department at the
European Investment Bank.
They argue the development of derivatives has been 'one of the most profound
structural developments in financial markets since the organisation of
limited-liability equity markets early last century'.
Advances in data processing and communications technology, combined with
developments in statistical and financial techniques, such as options
pricing, have made possible the developments of a range of liquid
derivatives markets. These have brought a range of long-term economic
benefits, such as better pricing of financial risk.
However, they also point to shortcomings in the present regulatory,
accounting and legal framework 'that was designed for on-balance sheet
finance'.
Periodic balance sheet examinations - often the focus of the traditional
supervisory structure for banks - are ill-suited to deal with the speed with
which both on and off balance sheet positions can change.
Recent efforts to improve regulation have focused on refining capital
requirements, increased disclosure and more effective supervision. This
approach - although a step in the right direction - does not come to terms
with the basic issue - 'namely that derivative finance . . . has
fundamentally changed the relationship between regulators and institutions
in favour of the industry,' say the authors.
They argue that broader industry should learn from the way that clearing
houses act as counterparties to trades in listed contracts, thereby ensuring
their financial integrity.
On the exchanges, credit risk is managed by marking positions to market and
by effecting settlements through the payment of margin and netting
arrangements.
By contrast, counterparties in OTC deals need not generally finance margin
payments, so that banks and other intermediaries selling OTC products can be
exposed to credit risk off their balance sheets.
At the same time the systems used by banks to measure their credit risks are
sometimes opaque and difficult for regulators to police.
This lack of transparency raises the spectre of 'precautionary withdrawals
of funding from intermediaries that are perceived to be experiencing
difficulties,' and the disappearance of liquidity.
The development of the derivatives market also means market disturbances can
be transmitted quickly to, and magnified in, other markets.
The authors argue that a clearing house arrangement for the bulk of OTC
transactions - involving probably fewer than 20 contracts - would be
feasible.
Although OTC products are typically regarded as offering customers greater
choice and flexibility - with features such as strike price varying
according to particular needs - the authors claim that three-quarters of the
OTC market is made up of relatively simple 'plain vanilla' contracts, such
as interest rate swaps.
They estimate that if two-thirds of OTC transactions were routed through a
clearing house, a maximum of Dollars 80bn of margin requirements would need
to be financed.
'Most of this credit would end up on the balance sheets of the clearing
banks so that off-balance sheet credit positions would become on-balance
sheet credits.' Moving derivative trading to an exchange would greatly
improve market transparency and solve some financial disclosure issues.
Mr Andrew Freeman, whose essay 'The future of finance: capitalism without
owners' was awarded joint second prize, argues that 'the coincidence of the
globalisation of capital flows and the development of derivative instruments
is undermining not only the basis of traditional financing regulation, but
also of corporate capitalism.'
Mr Freeman, a former Financial Times journalist now with The Economist,
predicts that companies will issue new forms of financial securities -
so-called 'risk participations' - which will undermine the rationale of the
joint-stock company.

<TEXT>
Bangkok Land, Thailand's second biggest property company, has reported a
worse-than-expected 83 per cent drop in half-year net profits to Bt497m
(Dollars 19.86m), compared with Bt2.9bn a year ago. Earnings per share
dropped to Bt0.83 from Bt4.85. In the second quarter alone, to
end-September, profits fell 89 per cent to Bt164m from Bt1.5bn in the same
period last year.
Bangkok Land said the unusually long rainy season had delayed its
construction schedule. It also made a Bt350m foreign exchange loss in the
first quarter.
The company's ambitious 640 hectare new town, Muang Tong Thani, on the
northern outskirts of Bangkok, so far appears to be a poor seller and a
drain on resources.
Earlier profits are thought to have been boosted by the sale of development
land. This can be booked as a profit when only a down-payment is made,
because land counts as a finished product even under stricter new Thai
accounting rules.
However, property companies are no longer allowed to book full profits on
partially-paid property, which previously has been used by some developers
to prop up results.
In the full year to March 1994, Bangkok Land reported net profits of
Bt5.02bn.

The forecast came as the company announced a 12.5 per cent rise in earnings
per share to 106 cents for the past year, and raised its dividend to 36.8
cents from 32.7 cents.
Attributable profit rose to R499.3m (Dollars 141.81m) from R443.3m.
C. G. Smith said significant progress had been made in repositioning the

<TEXT>
Yamaha Motor said aggressive cost-cutting was behind a 94 per cent jump in
recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - for the first six
months to September, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Yamaha, the world's second largest motorcycle maker, said parent recurring
profits soared to Y3.01bn (Dollars 30.6m) from Y1.55bn a year earlier, even
though sales were flat at Y223.09bn, compared with Y223.65bn a year ago.
Cost-cutting measures, such as using more interchangeable parts, saved the
company Y5.8bn in the first half, said Mr Takehiko Hasegawa, Yamaha Motor
president. Strong exports of components to China and other Asian nations
also helped, he said.
The company forecast parent recurring profits of Y4bn for the full year to
March 31, up 9.4 per cent from a year ago. It would be Yamaha's first rise
in annual profit in four years.
But Mr Hasegawa said the company believed there was only limited room to
boost profits further, due to the yen's strength against the dollar and an
uncertain outlook for the Japanese and overseas economies.
'We were able to increase our sales prices in the first half, but it will be
hard to do this in the second half because of the strong yen,' he said.
Because of the yen's strength the company has lowered its forecast of
motorcycle exports to 330,000 units in the year to next March from a May
forecast of 375,000. Exports totalled 388,000 units last year.

Casio, the Japanese manu-facturer of watches and calculators, reported a
strong jump in non-consolidated recurring profits - before extraordinary
items and tax - in the first half, helped by buoyant demand for its
electronic terminals and cost-cutting measures.
Recurring profits increased 63 per cent to Y4.6bn (Dollars 46.83m) from
Y2.8bn, while sales rose 5 per cent to Y166.6bn from Y158.5bn. Net profit
rose 122 per cent to Y3.4bn, against Y1.6bn a year ago, and the company
raised its interim dividend to Y12.5 from Y5.82.
Casio said exports suffered from the high yen while domestic demand remained
weak due to the continuing sluggishness of private capital spending.
However, Casio had a number of successful products which helped it to avoid
the worst effects of a difficult trading environment.
Children's calculators, which incorporate a simple message transmission
function and a function allowing users to draw pictures, were extremely
popular. Growth in these products was nonetheless insufficient to make up
for a fall in ordinary calculators.
The watch division was also depressed by price competition in the market for
basic watches, which overshadowed strong demand for telephone pagers.
Data processing systems, such as liquid crystal display panels and products
using LCDs, saw a sharp rise in demand which took sales for the division up
28 per cent.
The business outlook remains uncertain as a result of the strong yen, and a
recovery in the domestic market is expected to be moderate.
Casio is forecasting a 6 per cent rise in sales for the full year to Y340bn
from the previous Y322.2bn, a 63 per cent increase in recurring profits to
Y12bn from Y7.4bn and a 42 per cent rise in net profits to Y7bn from Y4.9bn.

<TEXT>
Foreign brokers operating in Japan saw a rise in revenue in the six months
to September due to a sharp rise in trading profits, in contrast to their
Japanese counterparts, who suffered declines in stock commissions.
The Japan Securities Dealers' Association said the 48 foreign brokerage
houses posted combined operating revenue of Y274bn (Dollars 2.78bn), up 18
per cent from a year earlier. The 215 domestic houses posted a 18 per cent
fall in operating revenues to Y1,012.8bn.
Foreign brokers derive the bulk of their profits from derivatives trading,
and rely less on stock commissions than the Japanese houses. The foreign
houses posted a 31 per cent fall in combined recurring profits to Y23.8bn
while operating profits fell 23 per cent to Y24.6bn. The Japanese brokerage
houses posted combined recurring losses of Y85.2bn while operating losses
totalled Y90.7bn.
Commission income at the foreign houses remained flat at Y128.9bn, while the
domestic companies fell 11 per cent to Y806.4bn. Trading profits totalled
Y53.2bn at the Japanese houses, down 62 per cent, while the foreign houses
saw a 36 per cent rise in profits to Y101.2bn.
Meanwhile, Nomura Securities saw interim consolidated pre-tax profits plunge
84 per cent due to weak profits on bond trading at its overseas
subsidiaries. The figure, based on US accounting standards, totalled Y8.7bn,
while revenue declined 14 per cent to Y291.1bn. After-tax profits plunged 94
per cent to Y1.6bn.
Consolidated revenue from commissions fell 12 per cent to Y100.8bn,
reflecting lower trading volume on the domestic stock market. Higher
interest rates in the US hurt net gains on trading, which declined 39 per
cent to Y21.3bn. Underwriting and distribution revenues rose 39 per cent to
Y57.5bn.
Costs excluding interest expenses for the first half rose 2 per cent to
Y211bn while interest expenses fell 8 per cent to Y71bn.

Zim, a new closed-end China fund, has joined Sicpa of Switzerland in taking
a majority Dollars 16m share of the Shanghai Printing Ink Factory, China's
largest ink manufacturer. The investment gives the foreign partners 70 per
cent of the joint venture.
Zhonghua Investment Management, a partnership which includes Kamsky and
Associates and Oppenheimer of the US and Electra Trust of the UK, is
targeting companies in high-growth consumer industries for investment.
Sicpa, which is helping to upgrade the Shanghai plant's technology, is the
world's largest privately-owned ink manufacturer.
Mr Wing Keong Siew, president of Zim, said the company had assembled a
Dollars 50m fund for investment in the consumer sector, but expected to
increase the fund to some Dollars 200m.
Zim's strategy, Mr Wing said, was to invest in unlisted Chinese companies
and joint ventures. In the case of the Shanghai venture it had identified an
opportunity, introduced foreign expertise and was helping fund technological
improvements with the fast-growing packaging industry in mind.
Zim is one of some 25 China funds that have developed over the past several
years with an estimated Dollars 1bn under management. These funds have
tended to invest either in the B-share market or in China-related stocks on
the Hong Kong exchange.
But in a strengthening trend funds are seeking opportunities for investment
in unlisted companies that are becoming more freely available as a
consequence of China's drive to restructure its economy. Struggling
state-owned companies are turning to foreign partners for assistance with
technological upgrading and investment.

finalising debt plan

<TEXT>
Olympia &amp; York USA, New York-based subsidiary of the failed Canadian
property developer, has taken an important step towards finalising a
debt-restructuring plan by handing over its interests in two Manhattan
office towers to one of its biggest creditors.
A 40-storey property at 125 Broad Street will be turned over to Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce and the building's two biggest tenants. In
addition, CIBC will take over O&amp;Y's 49 per cent partnership interest in a
39-storey building at 1250 Broadway.
In return, the bank will release O&amp;Y from about Dollars 325m of mortgage
obligations.
The mortgage on the Broad Street property fell due some time ago.
Negotiations with the bank were complicated by O&amp;Y's inability to honour a
guarantee which it had provided on the loan.
A person familiar with the deal said that O&amp;Y turned over its interest in
the Broadway building in exchange for being released from the guarantee.
O&amp;Y said it considered neither building to be part of its core portfolio,
which includes the World Financial Centre and other office blocks in New
York, as well as buildings in Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles.
CIBC holds a mortgage on One Liberty Plaza, which is part of O&amp;Y's core
holdings. The bank was the second biggest lender to Olympia &amp; York
Developments (OYDL), the Canadian parent which collapsed in 1992, but whose
creditors retain an 80 per cent stake in the US company.
O&amp;Y USA, led by Mr John Zuccotti, a former deputy mayor of New York, has so
far been spared OYDL's fate. It has turned over several distressed buildings
to mortgage holders, and has managed to convince other creditors that it
would not be in their interests to push it into bankruptcy.
The mortgage and guarantee on 125 Broad Street were the thorniest remaining
problem among O&amp;Y's non-core properties.
Bankers expect that the resolution of this issue will accelerate talks with
creditors on the rest of the restructuring plan.
O&amp;Y said yesterday that these negotiations were continuing.

FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley profits drop 35%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Morgan Stanley yesterday announced a 35 per cent drop in third-quarter
profits to Dollars 118m, or Dollars 1.30 a share, as the Wall Street firm
followed the rest of the US securities industry in reporting sharply weaker
earnings for the latest period.
Like the rest of Wall Street, Morgan Stanley's revenues from its investment
banking and trading businesses have been weak this year because of rising
interest rates and a severe downturn in the US bond market.
Mr Richard Fisher, Morgan Stanley's chairman, said yesterday business
conditions remained difficult, although he expressed confidence in the
outlook for the firm's overseas businesses.
Net revenues totalled Dollars 910m in the quarter, down from the Dollars
1.03bn recorded a year earlier. The bulk of that decline was attributable to
a 36 per cent drop in revenues from Morgan Stanley's investment banking
operations, which have been hard hit by the sharp drop in demand from
corporations for securities underwriting services.
The fall in investment banking revenues would have been worse, however, but
for another strong showing from the firm's mergers and acquisitions
department, which continues to benefit from the recent series of big deals
among US and international corporations.
On the trading side, Morgan Stanley posted a 4 per cent rise in revenues to
Dollars 297m, but the performance was not particularly impressive because
trading in the same quarter of 1993 was hit by losses on mortgage-backed
securities. In the second quarter a year ago, for example, the firm earned
Dollars 517m from its trading business.
Revenues from trading in the latest quarter were also hurt by a rise in the
cost of financing the inventory of bonds Morgan Stanley uses for its
customer and proprietary trading business. This rise was evident in the 14
per cent increase in interest expenses during the quarter.
Among its other revenues streams, earnings from commissions were essentially
flat at Dollars 104m, interest and dividend income was up 9 per cent at
Dollars 1.7bn, while fees from asset management and administration services
climbed 42 per cent to Dollars 95m.
The slide in overall revenues helped reduce Morgan Stanley's compensation
costs, which fell 12 per cent to Dollars 460m in the quarter. Other costs
categories were mostly little changed in the period.
Although the profits fall was expected, Morgan Stanley's share prices fell
on the New York Stock Exchange, closing Dollars 1 lower at Dollars 61 7/8 .

General Motors said yesterday it had reached an agreement with General

Reuter reports from Detroit.
Earlier, the Detroit Free Press newspaper had reported that GM had
threatened to stop buying material if GE insisted on higher resin prices. Ms
Linda Cook, a GM spokeswoman, declined to discuss details of the agreement
but she said the company would work with GE to help reduce costs. 'We
believe we've reached an amenable agreement with GE that benefits their
business as well as ours,' Ms Cook said.

Fuji Electric, a leading Japanese maker of electric machinery, yesterday
announced a steep decline in its consolidated recurring profits - before
extraordinary items and tax - for the first six months to end-September, and
a downward revision in its forecast for the full fiscal year, AP-DJ reports

Y1.25bn from Y2.61bn and sales were 2.7 per cent lower at Y384.4bn against
Y374.37bn.
For the full year, Fuji Electric has lowered its forecasts for consolidated
earnings by about 10 per cent. Recurring profits are forecast to be Y13bn
against an earlier forecast of Y14.5bn and last year's actual Y14.13bn; net
profits are expected to be Y3.4bn (Y4bn and Y3.65bn); and sales are forecast
at Y860bn (Y870bn and Y834bn). On the Tokyo Stock Exchange yesterday, Fuji

The deal involved Richbell's subsidiary Harpur Group, an operator of

Payment Systems for Dollars 65m. The transaction values the combined group,
whose shareholders include the quoted investment trust RIT Capital Partners,
at Dollars 223m.
Harpur operates corporate fuel cards under the Overdrive and Dialcard names,
while Gelco's services include the outsourcing of accounting and employee
expense claims in the US and Canada. The companies initially plan to expand

<TEXT>
American General Hospitality, a privately-held US company, has won an
international tender for a 51 per cent stake in HungarHotels, Hungary's last
state-owned hotel chain to be privatised, writes Virginia Marsh in Budapest.
It outbid Intercontinental, the Japanese-owned international hotel group.
The State Property Agency, Hungary's privatisation body, said it hoped to
close the deal for HungarHotels, which owned 15 hotels in Hungary, by the
end of this month. American General is believed to be paying between Dollars
50m-60m for the stake.
The decision is a major blow for Intercontinental which now faces the
possibility of having no presence in Budapest, one of central Europe's most
visited tourist and business locations. It operates HungarHotels' flagship
Hotel Forum through a local franchiser. Last year it lost the Duna
Intercontinental, another top Budapest hotel to the Marriott group of the
US.
American General operates its hotels through franchisers rather than under
its own name. In the US it works with chains such as Marriott, Sheraton,
Hilton and Holiday Inn.
The SPA said two fifths of the purchase price would be used for modernising
HungarHotels' properties. A condition of the privatisation is that the new
owner would not be allowed to sell any of the hotels for three years.
The SPA was advised by Credit Suisse First Boston, and American General was
advised by Creditanstalt Securities.

The Hungarian unit of Philips Electronics plans to invest Dollars 45m in
Hungary over the next two years, mainly to boost its production capacity,
Reuter reports from Budapest. Some of the funds will be used to establish a
factory manufacturing monitors for personal computers in Szombathely in
western Hungary, Philips Kft general manager Williem van der Viegt said.
Another part of the investment would go toward producing combination video
recorder-televisions in Philips' video recorder plant in Szekesfehervar,
central Hungary, he said.
Philips plans to manufacture 800,000 units of 14 and 15 inch screens by the
end of 1996, Mr van der Viegt said. Increasing transport costs and the
flexibility required by customers in western Europe made it necessary to
move production from east Asia to central Europe.

<TEXT>
Mr Antonio Champalimaud yesterday regained control of Banco Pinto e Sotto
Mayor (BPSM), paying Es37.28bn (Dollars 289.9m) for 80 per cent of
Portugal's sixth-largest bank 19 years after it was seized from his family
in a wave of Communist-led nationalisations, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon.
The Champalimaud group bid Es1,528 a share for the 24.4m shares on offer in
a privatisation operation on the Lisbon stock exchange. This was Es228 more
than the only rival bid, from a consortium led by Banco Finantia, a
Portuguese investment bank, and 45.5 per cent higher than the reserve price
of Es1,050.
Mr Champalimaud, 76, said to be the wealthiest man in Portugal, acquired
BPSM through Mundial Confianca, the insurance company that he also bought
back after its nationalisation in 1975.
He fled Portugal after the 1974 revolution and rebuilt his business group in
Brazil before returning to begin repurchasing his expropriated assets.
In January, the government rejected as too low an offer from Banco Comercial
Portugues of almost Es14bn for 80 per cent of BPSM, in addition to
guarantees of further investment. BCP said it might have increased its bid
if it had been allowed to make a more detailed examination of the bank's
liabilities.
The remaining 20 per cent of BPSM is to be sold later to employees and small
investors.

<TEXT>
Repsol, the Spanish state-controlled oil, gas and chemicals group which
recently postponed a global offering planned for this year, lifted pre-tax
profits for the first nine months by 16.6 per cent to Pta113.2bn (Dollars
88m) from the Pta94.5bn in the same period of 1993.
The company said its results reflected the domestic economic recovery as
well as an improvement in its chemical division, an increased contribution
from its gas division and better productivity. It added that the improvement
in margins accelerated in the third quarter.
It said the strong performance in the chemical and gas units compensated for
the downturn in the oil business.
Income from chemicals was up from Pta3.7bn to Pta10.7bn and by 23.1 per cent
to Pta33bn in the gas division. Profits in Repsol refining and oil marketing
division, however, fell by 3 per cent to Pta72bn and dropped by 29 per cent
to Pta11.7bn in the exploration and production division.
Repsol lifted its gas profile earlier this year when Gas Natural, the
dominant domestic gas distributor which is 45 per cent owned by Repsol,
acquired Enagas, the big state-owned importer of natural gas.
Gas Natural has, as result, become the third biggest gas company in Europe
and the virtual monopoly gas importer and distributor in the fast growing
domestic market.
Government plans to reduce its 41 per cent stake in Repsol by as much as
half towards the end of this year through a global offering were delayed
because of the instability of the markets. The offering, however, remains
first on the list of the Spanish state disposals planned for next year.

Electricite de France (EdF), the French state-owned electric utility, plans
to invest up to FFr2bn (Dollars 377m) a year in power projects in Asia and
is looking for partners, Reuter reports from Singapore.
'Our aim in the next few years is to be spending around FFr2bn each year in
acquiring equity in power projects in Asia,' said Mr Pierre Moriette,
managing director at EdF's new representative office in Singapore.
'Our policy is to get a 20 to 40 per cent equity stake and a role in the
operation of the power plant,' Mr Moriette said. 'We're not looking to make
a fast buck. We want a reasonable return over the long term,' he said.
EdF aims to build some 2,000MW a year of new power generation capability in
Asia over the next 10 years, and already has projects in China, India,
Indonesia, Thailand and Laos.
The group plans to open an office in Beijing by the end of the year, in
addition to the Singapore office which will be formally opened next month.
EdF already has offices in Jakarta and Hong Kong.
In 1993, EdF earned FFr3.1bn in net income, up from FFr2.5bn in the previous
year.

FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Polygram kicks into rap groove
with RAL/Def Jam stake move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Polygram, the London-based entertainment group, is expanding its US music
interests by buying 50 per cent of RAL/Def Jam, the leading rap record
label, for Dollars 33m.
The acquisition of Def Jam - which numbers some the world's most successful
rap acts on its roster including Warren G, Public Enemy and the Beastie Boys
 -forms part of PolyGram's long-term strategy of increasing its music
business in the US.
The Def Jam deal follows last year's Dollars 325m acquisition of Motown
Records, the famous soul label. PolyGram, which is also one of the world's
largest classical music record companies as the owner of Deutsche Grammophon
and Philips Classics, has been steadily expanding its US interests since its
1989 deals to buy the Island and A&amp;M record companies.
Its expansion in the US has helped PolyGram, which also has extensive film
interests and produced this year's runaway hit, Four Weddings and a Funeral,
to sign up some of its successful European artists on a worldwide basis.
The Def Jam investment will enable PolyGram to become a force in rap, which
has in the early 1990s been one of the most dynamic areas of contemporary
music.
Rap started off in the mid-1980s as a cult phenomenon among young black
Americans. In the early days it was dominated by small, independent record
labels, including Def Jam which was founded in 1983 by Mr Russell Simmons in
New York.
Def Jam is now one of the most commercially successful rap labels and Mr
Simmons is regarded as a role model for the new breed of young black
entrepreneurs.
PolyGram first forged links with Def Jam in June when its became the
latter's US distributor and its licensee in other countries.
PolyGram has traditionally pursued a policy with its music acquisitions of
assuming responsibility for issues such as marketing and distribution,
thereby leaving the original executives to concentrate on working with
existing artists and nurturing new talent.
Mr Simmons has signed a long term contract with PolyGram as has Mr Lyor
Cohen, Def Jam's president and chief operating officer.
Mr Cohen yesterday said: 'All we ever needed was a company to nurture us,'
adding that with PolyGram 'finance, promotion, legal and distribution are
covered and covered tight'.

Tele-Communications Inc, the biggest US cable TV operator, moved back into
profit in the third quarter, helped by a contribution from Liberty Media,
with which it merged in August, writes Tony Jackson in New York.
On sales up 23 per cent at Dollars 1.29bn, TCI suffered a 21 per cent fall
in operating profit to Dollars 186m.
However, after a Dollars 101m contribution from Liberty and sharply lower
tax, it made a net profit of 4 cents a share, compared with a 14 cents loss.
TCI said basic service customers had risen by 5.1 per cent over the past 12
months to 11.3m. However, cable companies' profits have been hit this year
by government-imposed reductions in cable rates.
TCI is withdrawing a planned Dollars 500m offering of preferred stock, due
to difficult equity market conditions.

AT&amp;T, the US telecoms group, is to acquire The ImagiNation Network, an
on-line computer service offering games and entertainment, in a move to
expand its involvement in the emerging market for interactive multimedia
services.
The move follows this week's announcement by Microsoft, the world's largest
software company, that it plans a worldwide on-line services network
offering information, communications and entertainment features.
AT&amp;T, which previously held a 20 per cent stake in the ImagiNation Network,
will pay about Dollars 40m for the remaining equity. The network is a
fledgling California venture formed by Sierra On-Line, a computer games
software developer, and General Atlantic Partners, a venture capital firm.
Sierra On-Line will continue to provide interactive games for the network as
part of the sale agreement with AT&amp;T.

<TEXT>
Kidder Peabody, the US investment bank, has disposed of a large part of its
portfolio of complex mortgage-backed bonds. It has hired an outside firm to
advise on the 'management and orderly disposition' of the rest.
The bond sales mark a reversal of a plan announced in early October to
transfer the bond holdings to GE Capital, another part of the General
Electric group. Since then, General Electric has agreed to sell the bulk of
Kidder's operations to another broking firm, PaineWebber.
Kidder's said its holdings of the securities, known as collateralised
mortgage obligations (CMOs), now stood at Dollars 4bn, down from Dollars
6.7bn at the end of October. In March, before the company began its sales,
the portfolio was valued at Dollars 16bn.
CMOs are complex derivative-type securities created from pools of
mortgage-backed bonds. They have generally performed worse than other bonds
as fixed-income markets have retreated this year.
Kidder, has hired New York-based investment firm BlackRock Financial
Management to advise on the remainder of the portfolio, but said it 'plans
to continue to own and manage the portfolio for the foreseeable future'.

FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Tough times for Telmex as Mexico
prepares to open market - Dominant position threatened as telecoms company
faces increasing competition without a big partner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Telmex, the Mexican telecommunications monopoly, faces some big questions
about its competitive position following last week's announcement by AT&amp;T,
the US long-distance communications group, that it would form a joint
venture in Mexico with the industrial conglomerate Grupo Alfa.
The AT&amp;T-Alfa venture will offer telecommunications services when the
Mexican market is opened to full competition in 1997.
AT&amp;T, the largest US long-distance carrier, had been widely expected to form
an alliance with Telmex, creating an extremely powerful team. Instead, the
Alfa deal leaves Telmex without a big international long-distance partner.
The two other leading US long-distance carriers - MCI and Sprint - already
have Mexican partners: MCI has a deal with Mexico's largest bank, Banamex,
and Sprint is allied to the cellular telephone group Iusacell.
Telmex's dominant position in Mexico - where the long-distance market is
expected to produce revenues of Dollars 20bn by the end of the decade -
means its ability to generate profits in future years is not in doubt.
Yet analysts believe competition will cut Telmex's market share and
operating margins.
The group's profits are almost entirely derived from long-distance charges,
which are among the highest in the world. Its loss-making local service is
subsidised by the long-distance side - even though Telmex has made great
strides since its late-1990 privatisation to rebalance rates.
Competition will cut into Telmex's long-distance market share - by as much
as 20 per cent in the first year alone, according to Baring Securities.
The impact of that loss will be softened by the growth of the long-distance
market, which is expected to expand by at least 12 per cent and perhaps as
much as 22 per cent annually for several years.
In addition, Telmex should be helped by a gateway agreement between Mexico
and the US, its biggest international calling destination, governing the
distribution of calls among carriers. Under the agreement, if Telmex is able
to retain 75 per cent of northbound traffic it will be guaranteed 75 per
cent of southbound traffic as well, no matter which carrier generates the
call in the US.
Of more concern to Telmex is the expected fall in long-distance rates that
competition will bring. Rates in the US have fallen by about 50 per cent
since competition was introduced over a decade ago and many are predicting a
similar drop in Mexico.
Mitigating this loss will be revenues Telmex will be able generate from
charging third-party long-distance companies a fee for connecting their
traffic with the basic local telephone network.
The details of the fee schedule governing interconnection are still being
debated by the Mexican government and are unlikely to be announced until
next year, making it impossible to estimate the earnings impact of increased
competition.
'The regulatory scheme will resubsidise Telmex to some extent . . . probably
through an interconnection or access charge,' says Ms Bette Massick, a
telecommunications analyst at SG Warburg. 'We just don't know how big that
subsidy will be, which adds to the uncertainty about exactly how profitable
the company will be.'
Ms Massick predicts that, unless there is some big regulatory surprise,
Telmex's operating margin will fall from the high 40s to somewhere between
the low teens to the low 30s.
This prospect scares some Mexican officials who worry that a fall in
Telmex's share price could depress the Mexican stock market as a whole.
Telmex accounts for approximately half of the Mexican market's entire
capitalisation.
Telmex's new long-distance rivals are likely to focus much of their
attention on developing customised services for both business and
residential users. Sprint-Iusacell and AT&amp;T-Alfa are expected to target
residential customers, while MCI-Banamex and a fourth big alliance, GTE-GF
Bancomer, will initially focus on high-volume business customers.
It is in these specialised services where Telmex stands to lose by failing
to link with a big long-distance partner. Neither Telmex nor its two
existing international partners, Southwestern Bell of the US and France
Telecom, have much experience in developing the sophisticated software
platforms that support the customised billing services which help boost
market share.
Indeed, analysts say that Telmex failed to strike a deal with AT&amp;T because
the US company felt Telmex was not well equipped to to deal effectively with
the rash of new competition.
AT&amp;T would have found it difficult to be in charge of a joint venture with a
company as entrenched at Telmex, but it is expected to run the alliance with
Alfa, a company that has numerous ventures with other foreign companies,
including Du Pont, Ford, BASF and Kawasaki.
Nevertheless, once the Mexican government defines the rules of
telecommunications competition, Telmex will have considerable time to gear
up for the challenge ahead.
If Telmex decides that it still needs to move defensively, it could make a
takeover run at Alfa. GF Inbursa, the financial group of Telmex's
controlling shareholder Mr Carlos Slim, has become Alfa's largest minority
shareholder, collecting at least 15 per cent of Alfa stock over the past two
years.

FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Thomson expands in electronic

<TEXT>
Canada's Thomson Corporation is further expanding its electronic publishing
business by offering to pay USDollars 339m for Medstat, a Michigan-based
group which collects and analyses medical claims data.
The Medstat purchase follows Thomson's Dollars 465m acquisition of
Information Access Company from Ziff Communications of California.
Electronic publishing is one of the fastest-growing areas of the publishing
business. 'Demand is ahead of the market's ability to supply,' one Toronto
analyst said yesterday.
Medstat, which is listed on Nasdaq, earned Dollars 7.4m in the year to
September 30 on revenues of Dollars 64.9m, making the purchase price equal
to more than five times revenues.
Some observers earlier expressed concern at the high multiple, about 3.5
times annual revenues, which Thomson paid for IAC.
Company officials told analysts earlier this week that they expected the IAC
acquisition to pay for itself within 11 years, and to be worth at least two
or three times the purchase price by then.
Medstat provides a number of services based on health-care data. They
include databases supplied to government agencies and research groups, and
claims information to large employers, insurance companies and others with
an interest in holding down healthcare costs.
Thomson plans to make a cash tender offer for all outstanding Medstat common
shares at Dollars 27 a share. Medstat's chief executive, Mr Ernest Ludy, who
founded the company in 1981 and owns about 11 per cent of the stock, has
agreed to tender his shares.
Medstat's senior managers have agreed to stay on after the acquisition.
Thomson was able to use cash on hand to pay for IAC. The Medstat purchase
may require it to raise some debt, but the analyst said that 'their
debt-to-equity is not out of line, and they have to take advantage of the
opportunities'.

<TEXT>
Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, yesterday said it was
raising the prices of some of its tissue products in the US by up to 8 per
cent because of higher pulp prices, but simultaneously announced an 11 per
cent cut in the price of its Luvs disposable nappies.
The company also said it was turning Luvs into a unisex product instead of
having different types of nappy for each sex. It said the resulting cost
savings, combined with higher volumes flowing from the price cut, should
have a positive effect on profits.
Analysts say Luvs has about 13 per cent of the US disposable nappy market.
Pampers, another Procter &amp; Gamble product, has 26 per cent, Kimberly-Clark's
Huggies 30 per cent, and the rest is taken by private label products.

FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Exxon signs Indonesian natural
gas field accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Exxon, the US energy group, announced yesterday it had finally reached
agreement with the Indonesian government to develop the largest natural gas
field in south-east Asia, the Natuna field in the South China Sea.
Exxon will share the development costs with Pertamina, the state-owned
Indonesian oil and gas company.
Natuna will be the largest natural gas development project undertaken by
Exxon.
If demand for gas in the Asia-Pacific region is strong enough, it could
involve the group spending as much as Dollars 40bn over the next 30 years.
However, analysts believe the cash-strapped Pertamina will be unable to fund
its share of the development costs, and that a third partner - possibly
Mobil of the US - will be asked to join the project.
Mobil said yesterday that it would be pleased to be invited to join the the
Natuna development, but it had not been approached by either Pertamina or
Exxon.
Before construction and engineering work begins, Exxon must secure market
outlets for the gas product. It will immediately start marketing the gas to
Japan, North and South Korea, Taiwan and other countries in the region.
The level of demand will determine the scale of the development, said Exxon,
which estimates that production will not begin until after 2000.
For Indonesia, the signing of the contract between Pertamina and Exxon
should ensure that the country remains the world's largest exporter of
liquefied natural gas over the next few decades.
In recent years, production at other Indonesian gas fields has begun to
decline, and a report by the World Bank last year attached 'critical
importance' to the development of the Natuna field for the future of the
country's natural gas industry.

FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Mixed reaction to Renault offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The partial privatisation of Renault, the French motor group, enjoyed strong
demand from the company's workforce and institutional investors, but was
less enthusiastically received by the public.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, announced yesterday that the
public offer drew 1.09m private investors and was 1.4 times subscribed. The
number of investors was less than previous issues in the French government's
privatisation programme, which have attracted between 1.9m and 3m
subscribers.
The partial privatisation is part of the government's plan to sell 21
publicly-owned companies. Renault's flotation will bring in just under
FFr8bn (Dollars 1.5bn), taking proceeds from the sale of public sector
assets to FFr60bn for the year, compared with a target of FFr55bn. 'Our
mission is accomplished,' said Mr Alphandery.
Mr Alphandery said comparisons with previous issues were misleading because
the state was retaining control of Renault with a stake of just over 50 per
cent. 'It was a partial privatisation, which tends to limit investors'
interest,' he said. Industry analysts added that demand from private
investors was limited by the weakness of the Paris stock market and the fact
that most privatisation stocks have fallen below their issue price.
Given such considerations, Mr Alphandery said that the operation was
'particularly satisfying'.
He said the institutional tranche of the issue was 15.5 times subscribed and
Renault's employees had shown strong demand for shares. The offer for
employees closed last night, but about 60 per cent of the workforce have
applied for shares.
Mr Alphandery declined to be drawn on whether there would be more asset
sales this year. Assurances Generales de France, the insurer, is prepared
for privatisation, but the operation is awaiting improved stock market
conditions. The government is to invite offers from industrial groups
seeking to participate in the privatisation of Groupe Bull, the loss-making
computer manufacturer.
Renault shares, which will be listed on the Paris stock market today, saw
healthy demand on the grey market yesterday, trading at more than FFr10
above the FFr165 paid by private investors.

FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: AssiDoman lifts profits forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AssiDoman, the Swedish pulp and paper group, has raised its forecast for
full-year profits for the second time this year, citing larger-than-expected
price rises for many of its products.
The company, which ranks as one of Europe's top 10 forestry groups, says it
expects 1994 profits to be between SKr1.8bn and SKr1.9bn (Dollars
248m-Dollars 262m), more than double last year's SKr876m level.
The latest upgrade came after profits at the nine-month stage reached
SKr1.28bn, up 126 per cent from SKr568m a year ago.
Average selling prices for sawn timber, sawn timber products, kraftliner and
pulp were all higher than during the same 1993 period. The increases reflect
the recovery in the pulp and paper sector where demand is recovering sharply
after a deep recession between 1991 and 1993.
The increase in demand for timber and pulpwood has had a beneficial impact
on AssiDoman, which is the biggest private forestry owner in the northern
hemisphere. Its forestry and timber division lifted operating profits 67 per
cent to SKr939m as sales climbed 26 per cent to SKr3.7bn.
There was a strong performance from the Kraft products division, which swung
to a SKr131m operating profit from a SKr70m loss. The packaging and carton
divisions fared worse than last year.
Overall operating profits were 81 per cent higher at SKr1.44bn on a 13 per
cent rise in sales to SKr12.3bn. The bottom line figure was influenced by
lower financial charges to SKr159m from SKr232m.

940m bid

<TEXT>
National Gypsum, the second largest US maker of plasterboard, has received a
Dollars 940m bid from a North Carolina-based investor group led by Golden
Eagle Industries, an investment company.
The head of Golden Eagle, Mr C. D. Spangler, has been non-executive chairman
of National Gypsum since February.
National Gypsum said the offer had come as a surprise, and the board had not
yet had time to consider it. Golden Eagle first bought into the company on
its emergence from bankruptcy last October, in conjunction with Lafarge
Coppee, the French building materials group.
Both took a 10 per cent stake, with Golden Eagle's holding rising to 19 per
cent and Lafarge Coppee's remaining unchanged.
Golden Eagle said yesterday it had offered Lafarge Coppee the opportunity to
participate in the takeover, under the terms of an agreement struck at the
time of the initial investment. Lafarge Coppee, which also expressed
surprise at the announcement, has yet to respond.
Golden Eagle said it would have as equity partners in the bid, First Union
and NationsBank both of North Carolina. The offer price of Dollars 43.50 per
share is 33 per cent above the previous day's close. National Gypsum's
shares rose Dollars 12.25 to Dollars 45 in early trading on Wall Street.
The offer is the second attempt to take National Gypsum private in recent
years. The first, a Dollars 1.6bn management-led buy-out, ended in collapse
in 1990 as a result of recession in the US construction industry.
Since emerging from Chapter 11 a year ago the company has traded profitably,
with net earnings of Dollars 56.5m on sales of Dollars 463m in the first
nine months of this year.
It has 24 per cent of the US plasterboard market, compared with 33 per cent
at USG, its larger rival.

 -Smooth journey to market, but challenges remain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Renault, the French motor group, will today end its journey to the Paris
stock market. Its flotation has been a smooth ride, in spite of a cautious
response from the general public, the principal target of the company's
state shareholder.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, said retail demand for the shares,
which saw the public offer 1.4 times subscribed, was a good performance
given the state keeps control of the group - a factor which he believes had
dampened investor enthusiasm.
Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault's chairman, expressed satisfaction with the
operation, citing strong demand for shares from Renault's workers and from
international institutional investors.
However, Renault is left facing some important challenges. In particular, Mr
Schweitzer must develop the company's strategy, which was derailed by the
collapse of plans to merge with Volvo at the end of last year. The question
of the future shareholding structure of the motor group remains a point of
uncertainty.
According to Mr Schweitzer, the flotation, and the fact that it has been
accompanied with a FFr2bn (Dollars 381m) capital increase, will strengthen
Renault's position in the international car industry.
Its financial position is healthy. The company was one of the few motor
groups to endure the sharp recession in 1992 and 1993 without falling into
loss. Mr Schweitzer confirmed yesterday that results this year should see a
strong improvement over the FFr1.07bn in 1993.
The collapse of merger plans with Volvo has left a question mark above the
company's industrial strategy. 'For several years, this was the centre piece
of Renault's thinking. The two companies were well matched in terms of
geographical markets and in terms of products,' says an industry analyst in
Paris. 'In particular, Volvo would have given Renault a strong partner in
trucks.'
For Mr Schweitzer the answer to the strategic question does not lie in
another grand alliance. 'We are not seeking a big marriage,' he said
yesterday. Instead, the Renault chairman favours case-by-case alliances,
aimed at increasing geographical penetration and reducing costs in the joint
production and development of components.
Renault already has such partnerships. It co-operates with Peugeot, its
domestic rival, in the development of V6 engines. In July, Renault concluded
an agreement with Iveco, the truck-making division of Fiat of Italy, for the
joint development of cabs. A project to develop gear boxes with Volkswagen
of Germany is under way.
Mr Schweitzer has a free hand to pursue further agreements. 'We could not do
this while we were in the process of the flotation . . . but within the next
few months we will start negotiations,' he said.
The Renault chairman does not go into details. But there has been much
flirtation with Mercedes-Benz of Germany. Mr Gerard Longuet, the former
industry minister, made no secret of his desire for co-operative ventures
between the two companies, while Mr Helmut Werner, chairman of Mercedes,
described Renault as 'a very attractive partner'.
Partnerships are important, not just to strengthen Renault's position in a
consolidating and fiercely competitive industry. The French government has
described industrial alliances as a necessary condition for the full
privatisation of the motor group, although Mr Jose Rossi, the new industry
minister, has indicated this need not take the form of a grand alliance.
Few doubt that yesterday's flotation is simply a step in Renault's eventual
privatisation. Mr Alphandery said yesterday such an operation was 'not on
the agenda'. But once presidential elections are out of the way next spring,
the government may be encouraged to review a dossier rendered politically
sensitive by Renault's status as a former trade union stronghold.
The centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur will also be encouraged
by certain aspects of the partial privatisation. In particular, the healthy
demand from Renault workers, 60 per cent of whom subscribed for shares,
reduces the threat from trade unions which sought to block the flotation.
International demand was strong, resulting in a subscription of more than 15
times the available shares for the institutional tranche.
'The international demand showed that France is seen as attractive as a
manufacturing base and that Renault is viewed as an attractive company,'
said Mr Schweitzer. His ability to forge alliances with international
partners will help determine whether it remains so.

FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sandvik surges to SKr2.46bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Sandvik, the Swedish cemented carbide and speciality steel group, doubled
profits in the first nine months due to strong economic conditions in most
markets.
The figures, which jumped to SKr2.46bn (Dollars 339m) from SKr1.21bn, were
helped by a lower depreciation charge and increased income from associate
companies. The better-than-expected result, after an excellent third
quarter, helped lift the group's B share by SKr5, or 4 per cent, to SKr127.
Mr Clas Ake Hedstrom, chief executive, said demand in North America, Latin
America and south-east Asia 'continued to be high' while 'order bookings in
western Europe have picked up substantially following the turnround in
Germany at the beginning of the year'.
He expected continuing strong demand in the fourth quarter and higher
full-year profits than 1993's SKr1.76bn.
Demand has been driven by the recovery in the automotive sector and the
chemical and energy sectors have improved, said Mr Gunnar Batelsson, group
treasurer.
He attributed the company's strong third quarter, when profits jumped to
SKr986m from SKr245m, to demand and reduced holiday shutdowns at its main
Swedish plant. The 1993 figures were hit by SKr200m in one-off costs.
Underlying nine-month sales were 13 per cent higher at SKr18.09bn, while new
orders surged 19 per cent to SKr19.7bn.
The group's four main divisions all benefited from higher sales and
earnings. High volumes and good productivity enabled the biggest unit,
cemented carbide, to lift earnings sharply to SKr1.56bn from SKr935m on a 13
per cent jump in sales to SKr9.8bn.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Net asset value at Finsbury Growth Trust expanded from 112.9p to 118.9p per
share in the year to September 30.
The 5.3 per cent rise compared with a modest gain over the same period of
0.3 per cent in the FT-SE-A All-Share Index and a fall of 0.4 per cent in
the FT-SE 100.
Net revenue dipped to Pounds 1.07m (Pounds 1.37m), reflecting exceptional
dividend income last time, a changed ACT rate, higher management fees and
the absence this time of underwriting and dealing income.
Earnings per share were 2.3p (2.94p). The proposed final is held at 2p,
maintaining the total at 2.9p and requiring a transfer of Pounds 278,000
from revenue reserves.

FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Boots used CSFB for drugs disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boots passed over SG Warburg, its officially listed financial adviser, and
turned to CS First Boston to handle the Pounds 850m sale, announced this
week, of its drugs business to BASF of Germany.
'We wanted somebody with a dispassionate view of the market,' the retail
group said. 'The reason we chose CSFB was that they had broad international
experience of the healthcare market.'
None of the parties would confirm whether Warburg had bid for the mandate on
the sale of the pharmaceutical business but Boots did say that it had been
prepared to listen to what anyone would say.
Despite its absence on the deal with BASF, Warburg nevertheless managed
Boots's Pounds 508m share buy-back, the largest ever on the London market, a
role which played to its strengths in distribution.
On Boots' choice of adviser Warburg said: 'Big companies like Boots are very
sophisticated users of investment banking services. They don't just buy from
one particular source.'
In a similar recent case, Reckitt &amp; Colman used Goldman Sachs of the US to
sell the Colman mustard business while retaining established adviser Warburg
to handle a US acquisition.
US companies also look more broadly for advice and Warburg stands to benefit
from that. The UK house pointed at its work last year restructuring
Marriott, the US hotel group.
Large UK companies have become steadily less attached to their established
financial advisers named in the Crawford's directory of city connections.
Boots said CSFB had been hired over Warburg precisely 'because they weren't
our traditional advisers'.
CSFB, while bringing what Boots hoped was a fresher perspective to the sale,
has previously worked with Boots on disposals in the US in 1989-90.

FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Vosper advances 13% as orders top Pounds
600m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vosper Thornycroft Holdings, the Southampton-based warship builder and
engineering group, increased pre-tax profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 10.3m
in the six months to September 30.
Sales grew by 12 per cent to Pounds 129m, with 82 per cent coming from
exports. The group said more than 20 per cent of turnover now came from
activities independent of warship contracts.
The current order book is worth in excess of Pounds 600m, 70 per cent of
which is for exp-ort.
Mr Peter Usher, chairman, said it was particularly satisfying that the group
had won the competition for Sandown Class minehunters for the Royal Navy in
July, and that the Ministry of Defence had placed an order for seven ships.
He said: 'This will provide a base load of about one ship per year until
2001, and will enhance our position in overseas markets.'
Mr Usher said this was a turbulent period in the history of the defence
industry, with the ongoing bids for VSEL, the Cumbrian-based submarine
maker, the recent sale of assets at Swan Hunter and the forthcoming sale of
Devonport and Rosyth dockyards.
The chairman said that if either British Aerospace or GEC won control of
VSEL, Vosper would be in a 'David and Goliath' situation, but insisted: 'We
are sufficiently well managed to be sprightly on our feet, to take on the
competition.'
Vosper has net cash of Pounds 134m, compared with Pounds 116m at the
year-end. The group said this gave it the financial capacity to bond large
contracts - such as the next batch of Type 23 warships, which it will bid
for.
Earnings per share increased 10 per cent to 21.6p (19.6p) and the interim
dividend is lifted by 15 per cent to 6.1p (5.3p).
COMMENT
Vosper is determined not to be written off as a small boatbuilder on the
south coast, hence its emphasis yesterday on being able to build warships as
big as the Type 23 at Southampton. For bigger vessels, such as new Royal
Navy landing platform dock assault ship, the group says it could still act
as prime contractor, but have the construction done elsewhere. Forecast
full-year profits of Pounds 24.3m put the shares, unchanged yesterday at
743p, on a prospective multiple of 14.6 - a small premium to the market. The
shares are underpinned at this level by the solid order book, but could
advance further on news of gaining further significant contracts.

FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Towry Law shares tumble 44p following loss
warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Towry Law dropped 44p to 86p yesterday after the independent
financial advice group warned that it expected losses of Pounds 1.25m at the
half year, compared with pre-tax profits of Pounds 565,000.
Mr Alan Wesley, chief executive, said poor stock market conditions had made
investors nervous about making new commitments. The company has also been
affected by the public's loss of confidence in financial advice following
adverse publicity.
However, Mr Wesley said that provisions made at the full year to cover the
extra costs of complying with SIB requirements on the review of pension
transfer business would not be needed. The company now expects to review 500
cases rather than the previous estimate of 1,600, and it does not expect the
impact of the review to be material.
Trading income in the first four months of the year was down 10 per cent,
with the biggest decline in investment products. Pension income has remained
steady, while general insurance business is 10 per cent lower.
The company has accelerated a cost-cutting programme which had already been
planned; it warned in September that it would affect profitability in the
first half. Staff numbers are to be reduced by 15 per cent in the 12 months
to July 1 1995, through compulsory redundancies and natural wastage. About
half that target has already been met.
The cost-cutting programme is also intended to cope with the effect of
higher compliance and disclosure standards from the new year. Mr Cecil Law,
chairman, said it was intended to maintain the interim dividend due in April
1995.
There are few other quoted IFAs, but the impact of industry-wide poor market
conditions, adverse public perceptions and regulatory changes is likely be
even more severe on smaller firms.

FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: GWR acquisition plan is blocked by Radio
Authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GWR, the expanding Bristol-based commercial radio group, has had an
acquisition plan blocked by the Radio Authority, even though a similar
scheme involving Emap and Trans World Communications was accepted.
The GWR plan, like the Emap deal, sought to use a loophole in the 1990
Broadcasting Act to own more radio licences than the Act allowed.
The Emap scheme involved setting up a 'deadlocked' company between the media
group and Schroders, its merchant bank. Each owned 50 per cent of the share
capital of the new company, which was designed to hold two Trans World radio
licences.
By excluding the two Radio City licences from Emap's total, the group was
able to push ahead with a bid for Trans World.
The Radio Authority view was that the device was legal, a view that survived
a judicial review granted to the Guardian Media group, which owned 20 per
cent of Trans World.
The High Court ruled that the Radio Authority had not acted outside its
powers.
After the judicial review, which appeared to clear the way for a
rationalisation of the industry, GWR applied to the authority for permission
to push ahead with a takeover on a similar basis. This was rejected.
The Radio Authority view is that it will not authorise any further
'deadlocked' company deals as a way around the concentration of ownership
rules until the government makes its legislative intentions clear.
It is believed the authority has been unable to get any view of what the
government has in mind from Mr Stephen Dorrell, the National Heritage
secretary.
The government is planning either a green or a white paper on the media some
time next year, with the possibility of changing the rules on cross-media
ownership in the 1995-96 parliamentary session.
GWR declined to comment last night.

charge by Pounds 102,038.
Earnings per share increased from 7.3p to 10.5p, while a final dividend of

FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Unigate warns of dairy closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unigate, the food and distribution group, warned yesterday that it would
have to close more dairies to help it adjust to sharp price increases by
Milk Marque, successor to the Milk Marketing Board.
Announcing yesterday a rise in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 50.3m to
Pounds 53.7m, Mr Ross Buckland, chairman, said the restructuring cost and
job losses were still being calculated. Turnover was Pounds 892.3m, against
Pounds 1.01bn, which included Pounds 141.4m from discontinued activities.
Milk Marque's price increases were 'a clear abuse . . . of its dominant
supply position', he said. But he hoped to see some roll-back in prices
after the dairy industry had sought redress through the government and the
courts.
The increases lifted Unigate's costs this year by Pounds 40m, with rise of
between 4 and 19 per cent depending on the product, giving an average of 11
per cent. Unigate reiterated its earlier warning that trading profits would
be reduced by Pounds 10m in the full year.
It was recovering some of the costs after increasing the price of
doorstep-delivered milk by 2p to 41p a pint in London and 40p outside and
supermarkets had passed on most of the increase. It had also closed its
Worthing dairy.
Unigate has signed up farmers to supply directly more than half its milk
needs. It pays a small premium over the Milk Marque price but achieves
benefits such as lower transport costs and the ability to work with farmers
to tailor their supplies to Unigate's needs, Mr Buckland said.
He declined to comment on speculation that Unigate might bid for Dairy
Crest, the manufacturing arm of the old MMB.
In the six months to September 30, Unigate Dairies' operating profits rose
Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 18.7m on sales of Pounds 229.8m (Pounds 227.5m).
Milk volumes, including acquisitions, rose 3 per cent but underlying sales
were down slightly. Doorstep sales were down 12 per cent at an annual rate
while supermarket sales rose.
Fresh foods, including the St Ivel and Malton brands, lifted operating
profits by Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 14.7m on sales of Pounds 382.3m (Pounds
362.9m).
Profits at Wincanton, the distribution business, rose Pounds 100,000 to
Pounds 10.7m on sales of Pounds 160m (Pounds 146m). It won new contracts but
competitive pressures affected rates.
Profits from US restaurants fell by Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 6.1m as sales at
its Black-eyed Pea chain fell by 5 per cent on a comparable restaurant
basis. The chain, which Unigate still hopes to sell, is spending Pounds 10m
by the end of 1995 on refurbishment.
The interim dividend is increased by 0.3p to 6.3p, payable from earnings per
share up from 15.2p to 16.4p.

FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: WMI hopes to buy Attwoods' UK side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Waste Management Inter-national, the London-quoted arm of WMX of the US,
yesterday confirmed it hoped to buy Attwoods' UK businesses if shareholders
rejected the hostile Pounds 364m bid from Browning'Ferris Industries in
favour of a break-up plan.
WMI said it would be likely to offer more than Pounds 100m for the UK
operations, based on publicly available information. Recently an independent
surveyors' report published as part of Attwoods' defence revalued the UK
business from Pounds 97m to Pounds 130.6m.
WMI's interest comes as BFI is today expected to announce the terms of its
final offer for the UK waste services group. Shareholders will have to
balance what is widely expected to be a restructured offer from BFI with
Attwoods' last ditch attempt to fend off the bid.
Attwoods has promised to pay shareholders a cash sum upon the sale of the UK
and European businesses. It then plans to seek a potential purchaser or
merger partner for its US operations.
These actions would deliver substantially more value than the current 109p
per share offer from BFI, Attwoods argues.
The break-up plan has been criticised by BFI for failing to produce the
names of potential buyers or offers for the businesses.
WMI said yesterday it could not provide a firm value for the UK operations
until it had done due diligence.
BFI said yesterday WMI's comments 'showed up the weaknesses of the break-up
plan'.
Mr Philip Angell of BFI said his company was offering 1.5 times revenue for
the whole of Attwoods.
WMI was suggesting, with an offer of Pounds 100m, a similar multiple for
Attwoods best assets alone. 'It shows the bankruptcy of the break-up
strategy,' he said, 'because the other assets will come in less than that.'

FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Everest Foods shares up 13p after AGM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Everest Foods rose 13p to 69p after the annual meeting was told
that the potato chip producer would return to previous levels of
profitability.
Mr Bob Gilbert, chairman, announced that strong demand for an expanded
product range had led to increased sales and 'acceptable margins' in the
core business.
Everest, which also owns Ashfords, the food distributor, reported a 47 per
cent decrease in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.09m to Pounds 1.1m in the
year ending May 31.
The dividend for the year was cut to 2.5p (3.7p). A move to low-cost economy
products by supermarkets had affected margins in the frozen chips business.
Mr Gilbert said the group was currently realising the effect of efficiencies
introduced in the manufacturing processes. This would improve profitability
despite the rise in potato prices which had resulted from a potato shortage.

FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Asprey statement seeks to reassure
investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asprey, the Queen's jeweller, is today expected to issue a joint statement
with its bankers, the Bank of Scotland, in an attempt to reassure investors
that its financial health is not in jeopardy.
It also emerged last night that the Stock Exchange's surveillance
department, which investigates possible wrongdoing in share dealings, has
been examining events at Asprey.
In its statement today, the bank will confirm that the contents of a leaked
memorandum from its UK banking division, which expresses concern about
Asprey's financial condition, is genuine.
But it will say that the date of the memorandum, which was first disclosed
in last weekend's Mail on Sunday, was September - and not October 28, as
appears on the leaked copies.
A banker said last night that he regarded it as 'highly significant' that
the date had been altered on the leaked memorandum.
Since the memorandum was drafted by Mr Richard Ramsey, the bank's director
of structured finance, the bank has satisfied itself that Asprey is trading
in accordance with the terms of the Pounds 20m banking facility, which it
provided to the group on June 29.
Asprey's shares have plunged to 148p from a year's high of 357p.
Most of the price collapse came in September, when the group announced that
it would be only 'marginally profitable' in the first half of the financial
year and that profits in the full year would be 'well below current market
expectations'.
In the memorandum, Mr Ramsey says: 'It is possible that the directors (of
Asprey) were not wholly open with us at the time of signing (of the loan
facility) with regard to the achievement of the budgeted level of profit'.
However, a banker said this was a view intended for discussion by internal
executives only and did not represent the board's opinion.
In the previous year, Asprey made pre-tax profits of Pounds 25.4m. Its
accounts for this year were signed and approved by directors and auditors on
July 6.
In the preface to the accounts, Mr John Asprey, the group's chairman, says:
'After a world recession . . . we are encouraged by signs of improvement . .
. We expect to benefit from a recovery in the economic climate, although the
rate of that recovery remains uncertain.'
On July 8, Namara, a company in which Mr Naim Attallah, Asprey's chief
executive, has a controlling interest, sold its holding of 415,375 Asprey
shares at a price of 306p.
Namara had bought 250,000 of these from Mr Attallah the previous September,
at a price of 317.5p.
On July 14, Mr Attallah and another Asprey director, Mr Nicholas Harrington,
sold a further 54,127 shares and 30,836 shares respectively, at a price of
310p.
These shares had been acquired three days earlier following the exercise of
share options at a price of 268p.
At around the same time, Asprey's employee benefit fund spent Pounds 774,110
on purchases of Asprey shares. On July 8, it bought 40,375 shares at 306p
and on July 14 it bought 209,859 shares.
Asprey has indicated that the collapse in profits was due to a large extent
to the loss of sales to a particular middle eastern client, believed to be
the Sultan of Oman. However, a sharp fall in profits of its main Bond Street
showroom in London, responsible for most business with such clients, was
already discounted in its budget for the current year.
There was a bigger drop compared with budget in the profits expected to be
earned by a series of subsidiaries, Watches of Switzerland, Garrard and Les
Ambassadeurs.

FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Channel shares fall as profits climb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATRINA LOWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Channel Holdings, the security components group, yesterday fell 6p
to 46p despite a 12 per cent rise in interim profits.
Mr Philip Ling, chairman, said the short-term outlook for the CQR subsidiary
was 'constrained by the uncertain level of overall demand in the UK intruder
alarm industry.'
Mr Patrick Rogers, chief executive, said he thought that the market had
hoped for a larger profits rise and also that it had focused too much on the
slowdown in the UK intruder alarm market.
CQR's profits in the first half were unchanged from a year ago and a similar
performance was expected in the second half, Mr Rogers said.
Group pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 808,000 to Pounds 902,000 in the six
months to September 30. Shawley Antony, acquired in July, contributed
operating profits of Pounds 35,000. Turnover amounted to Pounds 8.67m
(Pounds 7.66m).
The interim dividend is increased to 0.55p (0.5p), payable from earnings per
share of 1.8p (1.7p).

FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: 'Generally buoyant' markets help push Volex
to Pounds 5.85m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a year when markets for its electrical interconnection products and cable
assemblies were 'generally buoyant', Volex Group reported a 22 per cent rise
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.8m to Pounds 5.85m.
However, stripping out an exceptional Pounds 662,000 profit from the sale of
surplus land, the pre-tax figure rose a more modest 8 per cent.
Although the data processing market had been expanding and was projected to
grow at 15 per cent a year, the group drew attention to strong price
competition in some of its markets and rising commodity prices in its main
raw materials - polymer and copper.
Mr Oliver Chapple, chief executive since October 1993, said copper prices
had risen 50 per cent and polymer 30 per cent in the past 12 months.
However, through efficiencies in manufacturing and purchasing, the group
managed to raise operating margins. Operating profits grew 13 per cent to
Pounds 5.45m (Pounds 4.83m).
Net interest payable was Pounds 263,000, against Pounds 30,000, as
borrowings at the half-way stage jumped to Pounds 8.5m (Pounds 800,000) for
gearing of 20.6 per cent.
Most of the rise derived from Pounds 2.7m of deferred consideration for
Cable Products, bought in early 1992, and the Pounds 3.2m cost of increasing
the group's stake in Mayor, the Singapore-based maker of data and power cord
assemblies, from 60 to 75 per cent. Mr Chapple said Volex had the option to
lift its stake to 100 per cent.
In wiring systems, the rise in business from Rover 'more than compensated
for' the expected phasing-out of the Jaguar business, while the customer
base was spreading to commercial, agricultural and off-road vehicles.
Sales at Pencon, the UK power cords maker, were 'disappointing', in spite of
moulded plug fitting legislation due to come into effect next February.
Earnings per share rose 34 per cent to 14.1p (10.5p) and the interim
dividend is lifted to 6.7p (6.5p).

FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Cheap imports blamed for Youngs fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Young &amp; Co's Brewery yesterday blamed cheap cross-Channel imports for a 13
per cent decline in interim profits.
The south London-based company, which has a tied estate of about 180 pubs in
the south-east, complained that illegal sales of continental beers had
accelerated the trend away from pub drinking.
Mr John Young, chairman, called on the government to lower beer duty to the
levels in other EU countries. 'This is supposed to be a truly Common Market
but British brewers - and therefore their customers - have to pay duty seven
times higher than in France.'
Pre-tax profits in the six months to October 1 fell to Pounds 2.24m (Pounds
2.58m) on flat turnover of Pounds 36.4m (Pounds 36.1m). Beer volumes are
thought to have dropped by 5 per cent in the first half.
Sales to non-Young outlets remained static, despite a 30 per cent rise in
the number of free houses taking Young's beers. Supermarkets and off-
licence sales represent less than 1 per cent of turnover.
Operating margins slipped from 10.8 to 9.3 per cent as Young's lagers lost
sales to other brands over the summer. The brewer said it would be training
staff to encourage drinkers to try its lager.
Exports, which represent 2.5 per cent of turnover, rose 35 per cent in North
America. The company said it was making good progress with a new export
drive to Hong Kong and China.
Profits were depressed by refurbishment costs, which rose 67 per cent to
more than Pounds 700,000, but are expected to revert to about Pounds 400,000
next year.
Interest costs remained at Pounds 1.35m, and gearing stayed at about 30 per
cent.
Earnings per ordinary share fell to 11.34p (12.52p); the interim dividend is
maintained at 7.25p.

FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Eurocamp's dash for cover - The offer of an
alternative to canvas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was raining on the Cote d'Azur as Mr Richard Atkinson, managing director
of Eurocamp, showed visitors around the 1,400-apartment complex he is
offering in his brochures.
The surrounding sea and mountains did little to lift the gloom, but there
was one comforting thought: at least we were not sheltering in tents.
Mr Atkinson, who joined Eurocamp in 1976 as a campsite attendant and led a
management buy-out in 1988, realises that not all holidaymakers share his
enthusiasm for canvas. 'Let's face it, not everybody fancies going camping,'
he says.
Eurocamp, Europe's leading self-drive camping operator, is increasingly
promoting alternatives to tent holidays. It is attempting to raise sales of
mobile home packages and last month launched a new brand, EuroVillages,
which offers holidays in 20 French apartment and studio resorts.
The strategy follows a sharp fall in profits and margins in 1993 - a shock
for a company which had enjoyed four years of impressive growth.
In 1989, the first year after the buy-out, pre-tax profits were Pounds 3.6m.
By 1992, the year after Eurocamp's flotation, profits had reached Pounds
9.4m. Last year they fell to Pounds 6.3m. Pre-tax profits represented 11 per
cent of turnover in 1993, compared with 15 per cent in 1992.
Mr Atkinson says a principal cause of the decline was sterling's fall
against the French franc. About 80 per cent of the campsites which Eurocamp
uses are in France.
Sterling's fall did not affect the price of holidays last year as the
company had bought its currency requirements forward, but it did adversely
affect consumer attitudes to France. The poor continental summer in 1992 and
the French lorry drivers' dispute also depressed last year's bookings.
Mr Atkinson says his company was also being damaged by longer-term trends.
The first was that mobile home holidays were growing faster than the camping
packages that were Eurocamp's staple.
The market for self-drive camping and mobile home holidays grew by 65 per
cent between 1989 and 1994. Over the same period, however, the mobile home
share of that market almost doubled from 18 to 34 per cent.
Mr Atkinson attributes the growth of mobile home packages to the fact that
they appeal to less experienced holidaymakers. 'The more the holiday market
becomes a mass market, the more conservative customers are going to be: less
confident and more likely to want basic comforts.'
Along with a greater emphasis on mobile Homes, Eurocamp is trying to raise
quality of service. Its customer surveys found that service had slipped in
1992. Campsite staff now receive two bonuses: one based on profits and one
on customer satisfaction surveys.
Throughout its travails, Eurocamp has had a cushion available to few other
UK tour operators: an international customer base.
This year, 45 per cent of bookings will be from abroad. The company's
largest overseas markets are Germany and the Netherlands, where bookings
have held up well. Overall, bookings are up 20 per cent this year and the
company is confident of improved profits.
Moving into holidays in apartments is essential to maintain growth, Eurocamp
believes. It aims to capture families who grow out of camping and parents
with children too young to camp or with teenagers who find it boring.
The EuroVillages programme, however, takes Eurocamp's offering closer to
that of giants such as Thomson and Airtours, where competition is fierce.
And while the Cote d'Azur resort, which is owned by the French group Pierre
&amp; Vacances, has impressive sporting facilities, the rooms seem cramped. It
probably all looks better in the sunshine.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Boscombe Property is to become mainly a residential property management
company through the acquisition of Newcrest Management Services.
Consideration is Pounds 3m, satisfied by Pounds 1.88m cash and the issue of
1.13m shares at 100p.
Boscombe has applied to join the Official List and, following the reverse
flotation, plans to change its name to Residential Property Trust.
It is also proposing to subdivide and convert every two existing ordinary
shares into 85 new ordinary and 15 deferred shares. The preference will be
subdivided and converted into one new ordinary and 49 deferred shares. Hill
Samuel Bank will place 2.02m ordinaries at 100p each.
Boscombe also announced a drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 320,903 to
Pounds 93,871 for the half year to September 30.
Mr Stuart McDonald, chairman, said the results were the first interims
following the disposal of San Remo Towers in August 1993 and as such
represented 'a satisfactory return from the investment properties retained'.
Gross rental income was Pounds 80,058, against Pounds 358,259 which included
Pounds 279,215 from discontinued operations. Earnings per share were 47.6p
(219.2p).
Newcrest made pre-tax profits of Pounds 309,678 in the half year to
end-September and had net assets at that date of Pounds 230,794.

of Pounds 5.22m, including Pounds 414,000 from discontinued operations which
contributed Pounds 159,000 to operating profits.
The company said that business was buoyant in all sectors and all group
companies were experiencing an encouraging increase in new business.
Earnings per share, allowing for the June placing and open offer, fell from
0.46p to 0.36p. A special interim dividend of 0.5p has already been paid.

FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Lynx leap to Pounds 2m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A substantial contribution from acquisitions helped Lynx Holdings, the
acquisitive computer services and leisure products company, to raise annual
pre-tax profits from Pounds 619,000 to Pounds 2.01m.
Lynx said that companies acquired during the year to September 30 had
performed ahead of expectations, and had produced Pounds 1.44m of group
operating profits of Pounds 2m (Pounds 619,000).
Overall sales of Pounds 21.5m (Pounds 10.8m) included Pounds 11.8m (Pounds
9.03m) from continuing operations, Pounds 8.32m from acquisitions and Pounds
1.4m (Pounds 1.78m) from discontinued activities.
The dividend for the year is raised 12 per cent to 1.4p (1.25p) via a final
of 1.04p. Earnings per share came through at 4.5p (4.27p).

FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: CSI plans relaunch as Saltire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cannon Street Investments, a name synonymous with the acquisitions fervour
of the late 1980s, is to disappear from the Stock Exchange lists after a
name change that accompanies a substantial acquisition and a financial
restructuring.
Yesterday's announcement represents a relaunch of the mini-conglomerate,
whose share price has fallen from a peak of 405p in 1987 to yesterday's 13p,
following a disastrous expansion policy.
The company is to change its name to Saltire, to reflect the change.
CSI is launching a 1-for-1 rights issue at 12p per share, raising Pounds
10.8m to fund the cash element of the Pounds 16m acquisition of Maplin
Electronics, a consumer electronics distributor and retailer.
CSI's existing Pounds 25.8m convertible preference shares are also being
restructured, with a substantially reduced coupon. This will cut the
preference dividend burden from Pounds 2.5m a year to a peak of Pounds
1.13m.
Deferred preference dividends of Pounds 5m will be cancelled, although
holders, primarily the Bank of Scotland, are rewarded with 20.5m new bonus
shares. This enables CSI to resume ordinary dividends, and Mr Tom Long,
chairman, was 'hopeful that we will pay a dividend from the 1995 results'.
Maplin represents a neat fit with CSI's Altai. They source similar products,
but serve a different customer base.
With the combined buying power of the two companies, cost benefits should
accrue immediately.
Maplin is expected to make profits of Pounds 2.8m in the year to June 1995,
which would put the acquisition on a prospective p/e of 9.
CSI is paying Pounds 9.85m cash, Pounds 2.6m in new shares and a further
Pounds 3.55m earn out, assuming Maplin hits the profit target.
The enlarged group will have Pounds 27.5m of debt, representing gearing of
114 per cent, but the sale of non-core businesses would substantially reduce
the figure.
Maplin was 44 per cent owned by Brown Shipley Venture Capital, with the
remainder held by senior management.
COMMENT
CSI's management is adamant that there are no more skeletons amid its
residual non-core subsidiaries, and the rationale for its acquisition looks
sound. Robert Fleming expects the enlarged group to make a Pounds 7.5m
pre-exceptional profit in 1995, putting the shares on a p/e of 6.5. At this
level, the shares look attractive, although it will take time for the
management to rebuild the group's tarnished image.

FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: RJB confident of clearing debts incurred in
British Coal offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RJB Mining expects to have cleared all debts incurred in its bid for the
English regions of British Coal by the end of 1998, and is looking for
pre-tax profit margins of about 18 per cent in 1999.
The forecasts form part of presentations to City institutions which the
company and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, its adviser, have started in the last
few days.
Some of the figures in the presentation are expected to be altered before
the company issues its prospectus for the issue of shares, which is likely
to be next month.
In particular, the Pounds 914m tender which secured the government's backing
for RJB as preferred bidder for the three English coal regions, may be
revised downwards when the company completes its 'due diligence' of its
proposed acquisition.
However, RJB and BZW are telling potential investors they are not expecting
material changes. They say that even if Pounds 914m is the final price, the
company is making significant profits.
Profit before interest and taxation of the regions being acquired is
forecast at Pounds 171m in calendar 1995, followed by Pounds 224m, Pounds
229m, Pounds 185m and Pounds 207m in subsequent years, giving a total of
Pounds 1.016bn.
Pro-forma net interest payments in the first three years are Pounds 55m,
Pounds 36m and Pounds 18m, but then the company expects to receive Pounds 1m
in interest in 1998 and Pounds 13m in 1999.
Cumulative cash flow over the five years is Pounds 1.36bn, starting with
Pounds 255m in the first year.
RJB says it intends to appoint further non-executive directors. It aims to
'retain and integrate' senior managers inherited from British Coal and
devolve operational responsibility to colliery management.
It says there will be no significant change to pay and conditions of the
7,000 employees it takes on from British Coal.
Employees will be offered up to 2.5 per cent of the shares being issued. RJB
has used Caminus Energy, which was employed by the government last year in
its coal review, to make forecasts for the coal market.
These show that the worst possibility is that the English generators will
buy only 27m tonnes of coal in the year 2000.
This assumes that 8m tonnes of orimulsion will be burnt and 18 giagwatts of
electricity generated by gas-fired generators. RJB's key assumptions,
however, are that the electricity market will be larger than this. Its key
assumption is that it will be able to sell 34m tonnes in 1999 to all
markets. Average cost per tonne in that year is forecast at Pounds 30.50.

FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Land Securities' shares fall 2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Land Securities fell 2 per cent yesterday to 606p as the UK's
largest property company said that it was increasing development activity
and warned of lower profits as a result.
The company plans to spend up to Pounds 350m over the next two to three
years, the first boost to its development programme since the late 1980s.
Land Securities does not capitalise interest on developments, so profits
will be reduced by higher interest charges until the new buildings are
occupied.
In the six months to September 30, Land Securities made an unchanged pre-tax
profit of Pounds 118.9m. After stripping out property trading profits, the
figure increased by Pounds 2.9m.
Mr Peter Hunt, chairman, said that interest charges arising on development
would make it difficult to match this result in the second half.
He added that demand for business space was still patchy with no general
increase in rental levels, although modern office buildings in good central
London locations were already achieving higher rents, as were prime retail
buildings.
The interim dividend is increased by 3.8 per cent to 6.85p.
Analysts said this was disappointing, set against growth prospects available
elsewhere in the sector, even allowing that Land Securities did not cut its
dividend during the downturn.
Acquisitions in the period amounted to Pounds 75m, mainly in the retail and
industrial sectors. Mr Hunt said that scope for further acquisitions was now
limited.
Land Securities' development programme includes the construction or
refurbishment of 600,000 sq ft of offices in central London, of which 45 per
cent has been pre-let to tenants.
The company is also proceeding with the 600,000 sq ft White Rose Shopping
Centre outside Leeds, which is being jointly developed with Evans of Leeds
and Yorkshire Water.
The project will cost about Pounds 100m and three quarters of the rental
income from the finished scheme will accrue to the company.
Net rental income for the half-year increased from Pounds 192m to Pounds
198.5m.
Adjusted earnings per share advanced from 16.64p to 16.81p.

FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: To buy back or pay out - David Wighton
examines the distribution of cash piles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boots' decision to spend more than Pounds 500m buying in its shares has
fuelled a fierce, if arcane, debate about the best way for companies to
reduce excess cash holdings.
Boots is following a trail blazed by the regional electricity companies
which have spent more than Pounds 750m buying back their shares over the
last year. Last month East Midlands Electricity took a different tack by
paying out Pounds 186.5m as a special dividend.
Both methods have their pros and cons, most of which relate to tax.
One advantage of the special dividend is that its tax treatment is certain.
East Midlands obtained prior clearance from the Inland Revenue, which said
the payment would be treated like an ordinary dividend - having a tax credit
attached worth 25 per cent of the payment. Tax exempt shareholders,
including pension funds, can reclaim the tax credit from the Inland Revenue.
The company pays the same sum to the Revenue in advance corporation tax
which it can then set against its mainstream corporation tax bill.
In theory, if a company buys back its shares directly from investors most of
the sum received is treated in the same way. But this only applies if the
company buys the shares in the market or through a stockbroker acting purely
as an agent. If it merely buys them from a market maker, as some of the
electricity companies did, there is no tax benefit for the shareholders.
There is another potential snag. The Revenue has given no commitment that
shareholders accepting repayment will get their tax credit and it can refuse
to pay if the investor sold for tax reasons.
Tax experts believe it is likely that a few institutions who took advantage
of electricity buy-backs may fall foul of this rule. Those who sold shares
to the company only to buy them back in the market are particularly
vulnerable. The Revenue could easily argue that the institution acted purely
to get the tax credit.
But buy-backs are more tax efficient, assuming institutions get their tax
credits.
In most recent examples the companies' brokers merely stood in the market
buying shares until the money had been spent. Since the tax credit is only
available to non-taxpayers, they buy most of the shares. The total amount
claimable from the Revenue will therefore be almost 25 per cent of the
purchase price.
Yet a special dividend goes to all shareholders. Basic rate taxpayers get no
credit, while top rate taxpayers face a bill of 20 per cent of the dividend.
So the total net flow from the Revenue to shareholders is likely to be less.
Supporters of special dividends counter that they are more equitable than
buy-backs where only institutions are offered the chance to sell. But
because of their different tax statuses shareholders do not receive equal
value from dividends, while under a buy-back all shareholders receive the
benefit of the changed capital structure. For example, because of the
different tax treatment of interest and dividends, analysts calculate that
by switching Pounds 500m of its capital from equity to debt Boots will boost
its post-tax profits by more than Pounds 10m a year.
Most observers agree that Reuters adopted the ideal solution last year. It
distributed Pounds 350m to shareholders by offering all of them the
opportunity to sell part of their holding. Not only did the company treat
shareholders equally, it gave them the option of receiving cash or enhancing
their investment. It also gave investors time to decide in contrast to what
has been described as the 'unseemly scramble' over Boots' buy-back.
Unfortunately the Revenue has since refused to give any other company
clearance for such a scheme. If there is an interval between the
announcement of the buy-back and the closing date, the market price could
rise above the offer price. So shareholders who accept the company's offer,
rather than sell in the market, are clearly doing so for tax reasons. A way
around this is unlikely to be found before the Budget, which is expected to
change the taxation of dividends.

Adam &amp; Harvey, the international distribution and steel stockholding group,
lifted pre-tax profits by 11 per cent from Pounds 2.55m to Pounds 2.82m in
the six months to September 30.
Turnover rose from Pounds 21.3m to Pounds 23.8m. Earnings per share improved
from 34.5p to 39.6p.
Mr Gerald Stuart-Lee, chairman, said the profit increase resulted from a
strong performance in steel stockholding. 'As a whole the group continues to
trade profitably.' The group had benefited from moves towards free market
economies in Africa, he added.
The interim distribution, which will be paid as a foreign income dividend,
is up from 6p to 8.5p.

FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Tax concession for 'Dutch mixers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK multinationals with subsidiaries in the Netherlands through which they
channel US dividends appear to have won a vital concession over their status
ahead of a new income tax treaty.
Ernst &amp; Young, the accountants, said an announcement by the US Internal
Revenue Service at a conference of the American Tax Institute could
radically reduce the treaty's impact on UK companies with so-called 'Dutch
mixers'.
The number of multinationals using Dutch mixers is unknown, but Ernst &amp;
Young said it had notified 100 of the IRS statement and was urging them to
apply for tax relief. The accountants estimate that without the IRS
concessions, UK multinationals could have faced doubled tax bills on
dividends from US subsidiaries.
Mr Chuck Merriman, internal tax partner with Ernst &amp; Young, said: 'Although
no blanket relief will be granted by the IRS for all UK mixer companies,
this is certainly a positive indication from the IRS that ruling requests
will be seriously considered.'
The US-Netherlands income tax treaty comes into force on January 1 and is in
part designed to stop 'treaty shopping' by excluding some multinationals
from reaping the benefits of tax concessions.
UK multinationals use Dutch mixers to maximize their UK tax credits by
blending the flow of dividends from overseas subsidiaries which carry
differing levels of tax at source.
Several applications for discretionary relief have been made under Article
26 (7) of the treaty. Mr Merriman said the IRS had indicated that the
results of two cases were near and that they would be favourable to the
applicants.

FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Capital may seek all four regional licences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Capital Radio, the largest company in the commercial radio sector, said
yesterday that it might apply for all four of the regional licences to be
advertised by the Radio Authority.
The suggestion came from Mr Richard Eyre, Capital's managing director, as he
announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 22.2m (Pounds 11.7m), including Pounds
4.23m from the disposal of operations, for the year to September 30.
Capital would be unlikely to win all of the new licences covering 7m people
in the Yorkshire area, East Anglia, the east Midlands and the Solent, but
its interest shows a determination to expand.
Capital,which has stations in Birmingham and the south of England as well as
London, also made it clear yesterday that it was interested in major
conurbations and that new licences were unlikely to satisfy its ambitions.
Under the points system for limiting the concentration of station ownership,
Capital has the leeway to buy a number of new licences or even a national
commercial station in the unlikely event that one became available.
Mr Eyre ruled out diversification outside the radio industry.
Capital, which said its stations were now all number one in their markets,
increased annual turnover by 44 per cent to Pounds 51.7m (Pounds 36m). The
increase included the effect of acquisitions and disposals.
Earnings per share more than doubled to 22.8p (11.3p). The final dividend of
5p makes a total of 7.25p (5.75p) for the year.
Mr Ian Irvine, chairman, said yesterday the new financial year had begun
well. He conceded, however, that staff costs had risen as more people had
been taken on for the sales organisation, Media Sales &amp; Marketing.

FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Hambros halved after Pounds 23m rise in
costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hambros, the merchant bank and financial services group, said it had no
plans to lay off staff despite a Pounds 23m increase in costs which
contributed to a near-50 per cent fall in interim profits.
The company, which warned last month that the outcome would fall below
expectations, announced a drop from Pounds 39.5m to Pounds 21.5m in pre-tax
profits for the six months to September 30.
Dealing profits fell Pounds 5m to Pounds 18.1m, but operating income rose
from Pounds 200m to Pounds 210m despite market turmoil.
Expenses rose from Pounds 145.7m to Pounds 168.4m, but the company said that
more than half that amount was accounted for by new activities and
acquisitions. All costs were being examined 'with the thoroughness that
market conditions demand'.
Sir Chips Keswick, joint deputy chairman, said expenses had risen by Pounds
15m in the merchant bank, where profits fell from Pounds 38.5m to Pounds
22.6m. However, Pounds 8m of this rise came from investment in new
businesses such as a private bank in Zurich.
The remaining sum was largely because of a 6 per cent pay rise in April.
'You could say that was a misjudgment, but at the time it looked rather
reasonable,' said Sir Chips, who said there were no plans for cuts among the
4,500 staff.
Provisions for bad debts rose from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 7.3m while profits
from direct investments rose to Pounds 7.1m (Pounds 4.1m), mainly because of
a sale of Scotia shares.
The interim dividend is held at 4.5p, payable on earnings per share down
from 11.7p to 4.8p.
The shares closed 13p up at 235p, partly because pre-tax profits were at the
upper end of last month's estimate of between Pounds 18m and Pounds 23m.
As disclosed in August, Hambro Countrywide, the estate agency chain,
incurred a Pounds 750,000 loss compared with a Pounds 1.3m profit.
The chain has grown to 750 branches - or 6 per cent of the market - after
acquiring Nationwide Estate Agents.
Mr Christopher Sporborg, deputy chairman, said the chain aimed for a 10 per
cent market share. That would be an 'extremely profitable' business if the
housing market recovered to an average level of more than 1.3m transactions
a year. The bank said the increase in the estate agency network should
increase the number of insurance policies underwritten by Hambro Guardian,
its insurance arm.

FT  17 NOV 94 / BSkyB tells of damage by pirates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, has spelled out
for the first time its estimated losses from pirate card devices. In less
than five months between the start of this year and May 18 when all BSkyB
cards were changed at a cost of millions of pounds, the company believes it
lost around 50,000 existing and potential new customers through pirate
devices.
A BSkyB affidavit submitted to the High Court earlier this month estimated
that total losses to the company during the period was an estimated Pounds
2.25m.
The satellite company was successful in its request for an injunction to
stop BSB Electronics selling devices known as Genesis, which it is claimed
can switch on deactivated 'smart cards' thereby defrauding BSkyB of revenue.
The heart of the business of BSkyB, which intends to float in London and New
York, is subscription television. The channels are scrambled so that only
those who pay can watch.
The evidence in the BSkyB affidavit would appear to conflict with its
pathfinder prospectus published on Monday. That document, which says that
the flotation will value BSkyB, at between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 4.6bn, sets
out how the company has a policy of refining and updating its scrambling
technology.
The prospectus then says: 'Although there have been instances of piracy, the
directors believe there has been no material loss of revenue over the past
fiscal year as a consequence.'
The affidavit says that in the period before the new cards were introduced,
subscribers were cancelling their current subscriptions and reactivating
switched-off cards through BSB Electronics and their agents.
'For the first time in the history of BSkyB it was experiencing a situation
where cancellations were outnumbering term-inations,' the document says.
Termination happens when BSkyB switches off subscriptions for non-payment.
BSkyB, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, holds a 17.5 per cent
stake, said it had been advised that a loss should only be considered
material if was 5 per cent instead of the 0.5 per cent loss over the period.
BSkyB has a total of 3.65m subscribers and subscription revenue in the year
to September of Pounds 455m.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Markets cautious after Fed rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
World financial markets reacted cautiously yesterday to Tuesday's interest
rate increase by the US Federal Reserve.
While a rise in US rates was no surprise, the increase of three-quarters of
a percentage point was larger than had been expected. Markets appeared to be
divided between those investors who took heart from the US central bank's
firm line on inflation and those who feared that further rate increases
would follow.
'The rhetoric in the Fed statement had a clear-cut message that Mr Greenspan
(the Fed chairman) is worried about economic strength and that interest
rates must rise if inflation is to be contained,' said Mr Keith Skeoch,
chief economist at broker James Capel. 'Greenspan's not ahead of the curve
but he's catching up with the game.'
Hopes that the rate rise would lead to a favourable reappraisal of US
financial assets were largely disappointed. The dollar, which had rallied a
pfennig against the D-Mark on Tuesday, failed to make further progress in
European trading yesterday.
In New York, even news of a lower than expected rise in consumer inflation
in October gave scant boost to equities or bonds in early trading. The
benchmark 30 year Treasury bond fell nearly two thirds of point by 4pm New
York time, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which rallied late in the
afternoon, closed up 18.84 points at 3845.
While markets welcome the Fed's anti-inflationary stance, there is also
concern that the six rises in interest rates this year will eventually slow
the pace of corporate earnings growth.
European equity markets were weaker but held on to most of Tuesday's gains,
made before news of the rate rise. In London, the FT-SE 100 Index rose 11.1
points to 3,146.5, helped by news of lower than expected underlying
inflation and a public sector surplus in October.
Gilts also moved ahead as heavy volume in short sterling futures indicated
that markets had reduced their expectations of the extent of future UK
interest rate rises.
In Paris, the CAC-40 fell just over 0.2 per cent, while in Milan, the Comit
index dropped by around 0.5 per cent. The German market was closed.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Games junkies hold out for a more powerful hit: A new format
is set to revive the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's computer games junkies have for months been awaiting the launch of
two products - the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation - which are about to
arrive in the shops as the first of the new generation of games.
The Saturn and PlayStation are examples of the 32-bit, compact disc-based
machines that the industry hopes will revitalise the Pounds 14bn video and
computer games market by replacing the 16-bit cartridge consoles that have
dominated for the past decade.
The games market, one of the fastest-growing consumer sectors of the late
1980s and early 1990s, has slowed sharply over the past year.
Sega, the Japanese company behind Sonic the Hedgehog and which vies with
Nintendo for leadership of the global games market, last week announced a
steep fall in interim profits. The industry is now waiting to see whether
the new 32-bit machines will reverse the decline and stimulate sales again.
Until last autumn the games industry had known nothing but growth. Sales of
games software rose rapidly from Pounds 4.5bn in 1989 to Pounds 13.2bn in
1993, according to Durlacher, the London securities house. Sega and Nintendo
saw their profits - and share prices - soar despite economic recession.
The industry's difficulties began last autumn when news broke that the
leading games makers were developing 32-bit and 64-bit hardware to deliver
more sophisticated sound and images than their old 16-bit cartridge
consoles.
Only one company, Atari of the US, was ready to launch the new format and it
did not have enough capital to market the machines effectively. Sega,
Nintendo and Sony admitted last autumn that their products would not be
ready for at least another year. The industry was left in limbo as games
enthusiasts were reluctant to buy new software for the 16-bit consoles that
they already considered obsolete.
Meanwhile, the rise of the yen against other currencies imposed intense
financial pressure on the Japanese games companies in their export markets,
notably in North America and Europe. Mr Frank Herman, deputy chairman of
Sega Europe, estimated that western European games sales have fallen 25 per
cent over the past year.
Sega and Nintendo both reported reduced net profits for their last full
financial years. Sega last week confirmed that it was on course for a
further profits fall this year after a 43 per cent decline to Y16.3bn for
the first half of 1994.
All the big games companies stepped up their product development plans to
try to rush out the new machines. Sega and Sony are now shipping the Saturn
and PlayStation to stores in Japan in time for Christmas. Neither product
will be available elsewhere until next year.
Nintendo this week unveiled the Virtual Boy, a 32-bit portable virtual
reality machine. It will be introduced to other countries next year.
Nintendo's most ambitious new product, the Ultra 64, a 64-bit machine, will
be launched next autumn.
Mr David Tabizel, multimedia analyst at Durlacher, is confident that the new
products will regenerate the market. He forecasts a modest increase in
software sales from Pounds 13.2m in 1993 to Pounds 13.5bn in 1994, with more
robust growth over the next few years to Pounds 20bn by 1998.
This rosy outlook has already attracted an influx of investment. Sega
earlier this autumn sought to strengthen its position by acquiring a
minority stake in Atari. Investors from other industries are also expanding
their games interests, notably Sony and Philips, the electronics groups.
The emergence of a new games format will herald a dramatic change in the
industry's finances. The new disc-based games will be much cheaper to
produce. It costs roughly 32p to manufacture a CD, against Pounds 10 for a
cartridge.
Conversely, development costs are soaring as games players become more
discerning and technology more complex. The first wave of 16-bit games were
developed in the early 1980s by amateur technology buffs. By contrast Rare,
the UK software house, employed a team of 48 graphic designers for 14 months
to develop Donkey Kong Country, Nintendo's new 16-bit game.
This means that publishing (or the development and ownership of games
software) has become an increasingly profitable part of the industry.
Durlacher estimates that publishing absorbs 37 per cent of the retail price
of a CD game, against 10 per cent for cartridges.
The increased importance, and profitability, of games publishing has already
triggered acquisitions including Sony's purchase of Psygnosis; the takeover
of Renegade by Time Warner, the US entertainment company; and the recent
deal whereby Pearson, the UK media group that owns the Financial Times, paid
Pounds 312m for Software Toolworks.
More acquisitions are in the pipeline as other companies position themselves
to take advantage of the anticipated revival in the games market.
Mr Tabizel suspects that 'the real beneficiaries of the new games boom will
be the publishers. Some of these guys are millionaires already, but there's
no shortage of suitors waiting to make them even richer.'

FT  17 NOV 94 / British Gas to lift domestic prices: Lower than expected
losses in the third quarter please as restructuring speeds up ahead of
market competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas is expected to announce its first price increases for domestic
customers since 1991 today, in line with the current rate of inflation. The
company is also expected to increase standing charges which have not gone up
since 1990.
The move came after the company yesterday turned in a better than expected
third-quarter performance as its corporate restructuring programme gathered
pace.
The third-quarter after-tax loss of Pounds 164m on an historical cost basis
was well below the Pounds 180m-Pounds 240m range predicted by analysts. It
was also well below last year's third-quarter loss of Pounds 225m.
British Gas usually reports a loss in the third quarter, the period of
lowest demand for natural gas in its main UK market.
The price rises are likely to provoke some controversy after the government
yesterday signalled the introduction of legislation to open up the household
market to competition by 1998. British Gas has often warned that the removal
of its monopoly of supply to 18m households could lead to higher prices for
some customers.
The new price package is expected to include a system of discounts for
customers who pay by direct debit. These form the most profitable part of
British Gas's domestic business. Mr Richard Giordano, British Gas's
chairman, recently said he hoped to double the 3m users paying by direct
debit.
He said the massive corporate restructuring exercise to prepare the company
for competition was ahead of schedule.
About 7,000 jobs were eliminated in the first nine months this year, he
said. A total of 25,000 jobs will be shed over the next few years.
He said growing competition in those markets already liberalised and
regulatory pressures continued to hamper earnings. But the results so far
this year have benefited from colder weather and a drop in interest charges.
Operating profits for the nine months were Pounds 897m (Pounds 845m) on
turnover of Pounds 7.06bn (Pounds 7.08bn). UK gas supply profits rose to
Pounds 594m (Pounds 515m).
The sale earlier this year of Bow Valley, the Canadian oil and gas
exploration and production company, helped cut the nine-month net interest
charge by Pounds 70m to Pounds 197m.
The disposal of Bow Valley contributed to the fall of turnover in the
exploration and production division from Pounds 771m to Pounds 742m. But
operating profits of Pounds 143m (Pounds 146m) were hit only slightly.
Analysts said this reflected the relatively high cost of Bow Valley's
production. The division's remaining assets in the division were lower cost
and therefore more profitable.
Attributable profits for the nine months were Pounds 466m (Pounds 409m).
Earnings per share were 10.7p (9.5p).

FT  17 NOV 94 / Union Carbide and Mitsubishi sell joint venture for Dollars
1.1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON

   NEW YORK

<TEXT>
Union Carbide of the US and Mitsubishi of Japan are to sell UCAR, their
jointly-owned graphite electrodes business, to the New York investment group
Blackstone in a deal valuing it at Dollars 1.1bn. Union Carbide will retain
a 25 per cent holding.
UCAR is the world's biggest maker of graphite and carbon electrodes, used in
steelmaking. Sales last year were Dollars 770m.
The deal values UCAR's equity at Dollars 820m, and Blackstone will also
assume debt of around Dollars 190m. This replaces the planned flotation of
around 44 per cent of UCAR announced last month.
Union Carbide will receive Dollars 347m, resulting in a significant capital
gain, the company said. Mitsubishi, which bought a half share in UCAR in
1991, will receive Dollars 406m for its entire holding. Mitsubishi said this
would result in a profit of Y17.6bn (Pounds 113m) over book value.
Union Carbide said the sale effectively completed a programme of disposals
begun in 1991, designed to return the group to its core activities in
chemicals and plastics.
At the time, the group said it aimed to realise Dollars 500m from the sale
of non-strategic assets. The target was reached last year with the Dollars
300m disposal of its organosilicon business, OSI Specialties. The company
has also spun off its industrial gases subsidiary.
It is understood that the flotation plan was shelved because Blackstone
offered a higher price. It is also believed that Mitsubishi decided to sell
out because it was reluctant to hold a minority position. The company was
not available for comment.
Mr Stephen Schwarzman, president and chief executive of Blackstone, said the
equity investment in the buy-out would be Dollars 250m, with 75 per cent
supplied by his firm and 25 per cent by Union Carbide.
A particular attraction of the deal, he said, was that UCAR's products are
used particularly in the fast-growing mini-mill sector of the steel
industry, which is little affected by recession.
The total cost of the transaction, including fees and overseas taxes, would
be approximately Dollars 1.2bn, Mr Schwarzman said. Of that, Dollars 950m
would be funded by debt and Dollars 250m by equity. Close to Dollars 200m of
the equity would be put in by Blackstone with the remainder coming from
Union Carbide.
In addition, he said, two-thirds of UCAR's sales are outside the US.
'We think that as Europe comes out of recession, we'll get the benefit of
exposure there', he said.
Mr Schwarzman added that UCAR could be floated publicly within the next year
or two.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Rail sale may delay BR and London fare rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail and London Transport fare increases due on January 1 face
postponement because of difficulties resulting from rail privatisation and
performance targets set by the Passengers' Charter.
British Rail is expected to announce average increases of 3 per cent to 4
per cent for 1995, nearly double the level of inflation but lower than the 6
per cent the Treasury is believed to have been pressing for.
London Transport, whose fares normally rise in unison with British Rail's,
is expected to putbus and Underground fares up by about 5 per cent a week
later than normal on January 8. However the BR increases may have to be
deferred.
BR has faced obstacles in agreeing rises for the increasingly independent
train operating units that are taking over the running of train services.
Some of these will soon become independent companies to be sold into the
private sector, while others will be sold later in the privatisation
programme.
The Department of Transport, the Treasury and the prime minister's office
are understood to have discussed the level of rail fares increase. Mr John
Major is believed to have insisted that rises should be modest.
The Passengers' Charter imposes limits on increases on lines that fail to
meet reliability and punctuality targets. That means that for the second
year running BR has had to work out smaller increases for parts of the
network and agree them with the Transport Department.
Failure by BR and London Transport to increase fares simultaneously means
Underground passengers who buy Travelcards, which can also be used on BR,
would pay more than passengers who start their journey with BR.
A limit on increases will be good news for travellers but will put financial
pressure on BR.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Post Office set to expand into travel insurance sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Post Office is close to a deal with a leading insurer that would enable
it to sell travel insurance through many of its 20,000 branches.
The deal, expected to be finalised by January, is part of a drive by the
Post Office to expand the range of products and services offered through
what the government has described as the largest chain of shops in Europe.
Three companies are understood to be on the shortlist for the travel
insurance deal.
The arrangement is likely to be structured to give the Post Office a
percentage on every policy or block of policies sold.
News of the transaction comes less than two weeks after the government was
forced to abandon plans to privatise Royal Mail, the Post Office's letters
division, following opposition from some Tory backbenchers. Post Office
managers are now keen to exploit new government guidelines on the range of
transactions that can be handled through the organisation's retail network,
Post Office Counters, and are seeking to branch out into financial services
and insurance.
According to Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive, new business generated as a
result of the relaxation of the guidelines may eventually account for as
much Post Office Counters business as Royal Mail does. In the year to March
1994, Royal Mail accounted for Pounds 221m of the branch network's Pounds
1.09bn turnover.
Mr Cockburn added: 'Within a five-to-10-year timescale, we should be
thinking about creating a significantly larger raft of new business in the
Post Office as a result of the wider powers the government has given us. The
thing the post offices are very good at is doing nationwide transactions in
very large quantities.'
Since May, the organisation has offered bureau de change services, in
conjunction with the Bank of Ireland, at some 4,000 Post Office branches.
About 1,500 branches were involved in this week's launch of the UK's
national lottery. The new guidelines were set out this year in the
government's consultative paper on the future of postal services.
Previously, the Post Office was allowed to do business only for the public
sector and recently privatised utilities.
The paper also set out plans to bring 'rapidly to fruition' a Pounds 130m
project to automate benefits payments.

FT  17 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Unigate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unigate's increase in its interim dividend was a tangible expression of the
group's confidence in the future. The mild optimism contrasts with near
panic before the new milk marketing regime took effect. Now that Milk Marque
is two weeks old, price rises of 2p a pint appear to have stuck both in
supermarkets and on the doorstep. The impact on Unigate's profitability is
unlikely to be quite so dire as feared. Sensing this, shares in both Unigate
and Northern Foods have risen sharply in the past fortnight.
The stock market reaction, however, underestimates the scale of the problems
ahead. Unigate will not be able to recoup the full annual Pounds 40m
increase in milk costs. Moreover, higher prices for home-delivered milk may
accelerate the decline of this high-margin business. In the long run,
Unigate will gain from sourcing more than half its milk from farmers
operating outside Milk Marque. But initially at least this milk commands a
premium price not yet offset by improvements in quality and reduced delivery
costs. Unigate will obtain better prices if it acquires Dairy Crest, which
would more than double its buying power.
Unigate will respond to the strategic challenges by implementing swingeing
rationalisation measures, giving rise to an exceptional charge far in excess
of the expected Pounds 10m hit to operating profits. This will arguably make
the group fitter in the long-term but now the shares' main attraction is the
6.3 per cent prospective yield.

FT  17 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the chancellor had dreamt up the most favourable economic figures
possible for the run-up to the budget, they would not have been much
different from those published yesterday. The UK appears to be enjoying
rapid economic growth with little inflation.
Underlying inflation in the year to October was lower than expected,
remaining at a 27-year low of 2 per cent. The sharp and politically
desirable fall in unemployment might have indicated an economically worrying
tightening of the labour market. But underlying wages growth remained
unchanged for the fourth month at 3.75 per cent, while unit wage costs
continued to fall. Meanwhile, the public sector actually repaid some debt.
That was partly because of Pounds 1.5bn of income from the last tranche of
the BT share sale, but it was also thanks to an impressive increase in tax
receipts. A strong improvement in corporate profitability helped these rise
14 per cent during the first seven months of the fiscal year. The figures
were so good some economists reduced their public sector borrowing
requirement forecasts for next year.
With economic growth above trend, interest rates will eventually have to
rise. But yesterday's benign data reinforce the view that there is no
current need for an increase. The outlook for the markets is fairly
positive. Lower than expected inflation and reduced public funding
requirements should sustain gilts, while equities should be buoyed by the
strong growth of corporate earnings and dividends.

FT  17 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Soft commissions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Soft commission is something of a misnomer. Commissions are normally paid by
the investor to the stockbroker, not the other way round. The practice of
paying institutions 'in kind' in return for a commitment to deal looks
suspect, even if it is not illegal or necessarily unethical.
The obvious question is who benefits from the strange practice. Fund
managers clearly do, as the benefits they receive reduce the costs of
running an investment management business, and hence increase profitability.
The benefits do not necessarily feed through to the client, who bears the
dealing costs and the consequent impact on investment performance. It is
likely that unnecessary deals are done on the client's behalf, at a higher
cost than if orders were placed directly with a market-maker.
New proposals from Imro, the fund management industry's watchdog, try to
make a distinction between acceptable and non-acceptable kinds of 'softing'
 -the latter of which would be banned. But this approach is likely to run
into definitional problems. It also looks heavy-handed. Fund managers are
already required to reveal their soft commissions to their clients, giving
them an opportunity to object. Responsible fund managers are increasingly
likely to boycott the practice, as Mercury Asset Management has done this
week. If trustees of pension funds and their advisers fail to put pressure
on managers to abandon soft commissions, they have only themselves to blame.

FT  17 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Laughing gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year British Gas was fighting tooth and nail to preserve its domestic
monopoly; yesterday it welcomed the promise in the Queen's speech to abolish
that monopoly. The main reason for the change of heart is that Gas has
convinced ministers to create a level playing field when the market is
opened to competition. A demonstration of the new approach will come today
when Gas announces price rises for late-paying customers but discounts for
prompt-payers. Without such differential pricing, rivals would have been
able to concentrate on profitable prompt-payers, leaving Gas with
loss-making late-payers.
Of course, when the monopoly goes, Gas's market share will fall, but the
decline is unlikely to be rapid. If the development of competition in the
telecoms market is anything to go by, a largish discount will be needed to
convince customers to switch. But given that all operators will face roughly
the same charges for wholesale gas and transportation  - which account for
the bulk of total costs - rivals will struggle to undercut Gas. The new
competition will also give Gas an added incentive to cut costs. Yesterday's
better than expected third-quarter results show the restructuring programme
is already containing costs; in coming quarters they should start to fall.
More worrying for investors is next year's review of Gas's transportation
price cap. The risk is that the regime will be tightened. But there are
opportunities too. The regulator is considering replacing the price cap with
a mechanism for sharing excess profits with customers. That might lead to
sharper falls in bills. But, if Gas also improved its performance, the quid
pro quo would be higher profits.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Brussels officials clash on state aid to airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A fragile consensus inside the European Commission snapped yesterday as two
senior commissioners disagreed in public over newly agreed guidelines on
state aid to Europe's troubled airlines.
The rift emerged after Mr Marcelino Oreja, outgoing Spanish transport
commissioner, suggested that state bail-outs could be justified in
exceptional circumstances, such as currency devaluations or a war.
Mr Karel Van Miert, Belgian commissioner responsible for competition policy,
rejected Mr Oreja's statement on currency devaluations as incompatible with
guidelines agreed hours earlier by the full 17-member Commission. 'This is
not a correct interpretation,' he said.
The clash raises questions about the credibility of the guidelines, which
are intended to serve as justification for the recent approval of FFr20bn
(Pounds 2.4bn) in state aid to Air France and as a reference for future aid
cases.
Consideration of currency devaluations in state aid cases would be highly
controversial. It would favour airlines from countries with weaker
currencies, such as Olympic of Greece.
The debate about the tightness with which rules on state aid should be drawn
has intensified in Europe after British Airways and other European airlines
in the private sector mounted a legal challenge to the Commission's decision
last summer to approve the Air France aid.
Yesterday's clash represented a dress rehearsal for the battle in Brussels
over whether to approve new state aid for Iberia, the Spanish national
carrier, which may seek up to Dollars 1bn as part of a new restructuring
package.
Spanish officials are privately furious that Mr Van Miert pre-emptively
ruled out a new state aid package for Iberia last week - ahead of any such
request.
This week, Mr Van Miert succeeded in strengthening the eight new Commission
guidelines on state aid. In future, airlines may expect Commission approval
only 'under exceptional circumstances, unforeseeable and external to the
company'.
A Brussels official explained that the new version was in line with the 'one
time, last time' policy on state aid which underpins efforts in Brussels to
liberalise the airline industry by 1997. 'Exceptional and unforeseeable
circumstances means earthquakes or a stock market collapse,' the official
explained.
Mr Oreja told a news conference in Strasbourg that the Treaty of Rome
clearly provided for state aid, adding assistance could be justified if it
was vital to restore the airline to financial viability and resulted from
'circumstances beyond the company's control' - including war or sudden
currency devaluation.
Mr Oreja predicted that the Commission would become progressively tougher on
applications for state aid as competition increased in the wake of further
air transport liberalisation in 1997.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Irish principles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fate of the Irish government should not affect the search for a peaceful
settlement in Northern Ireland. All coalitions carry the seeds of disunity.
The alliance between the traditionally nationalist Fianna Fail and the more
modern-minded Labour Party is no exception. Always fractious, it seems, for
now, to have ended.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, spent yesterday in a dramatic and
seemingly unsuccessful fight for his political life. The government's fall
is, however, a domestic matter, confined to the Irish republic. What is
important beyond those borders is that the ceasefire holds, while the
perpetrators of violence are drawn into the democratic process.
This should be possible whoever is in charge in either Britain or Ireland.
The statement by Mr Martin McGuiness of Sinn Fein that a change of
government in Dublin would be 'very, very unhelpful indeed' should be
rebutted. Sinn Fein, the public face of the IRA, must rid itself of the
habit of hinting that it may not be possible to maintain the ceasefire if
this or that condition is not met. Such threats are unacceptable if its
protestations of peaceful intent are to be taken seriously.
That said, no new constitutional settlement for the island of Ireland is
likely to last without the backing of Fianna Fail, either as the leading
partner in a coalition or in some other role, even if that has to be
exercised from the opposition benches. Mr Reynolds, the party's leader, has
acknowledged that the claim in the Irish constitution to the six British
counties must be rephrased to allow for self-determination by the people of
Ulster. All mainstream Irish parties accept this, but an amendment drafted
or backed by Fianna Fail would be much surer to pass, than one emanating
solely from a government headed by the more anti-republican party, Fine
Gael.
There lies the rub. Too republican a flavour to any proposed amendment could
lead to the rejection of any parallel constitutional package put before the
northern electorate. Too unionist a flavour, and Irish nationalists might
say No. It should be remembered that the Downing Street declaration, issued
jointly by Mr Reynolds and Mr John Major last December, commits both
governments to the principle that the right of self-determination must be
exercised separately by the electorates of north and south.
If the IRA understands that this leaves it nothing to gain by restarting its
murderous campaign the declaration will prevail, whatever may happen to its
authors. Even when a framework constitutional agreement has been published,
the road leading to a general acceptance of its terms, or something like
them, is likely to be long. Negotiations in Ireland are rarely speedy. There
has never been, nor could or should there be, a guarantee that Mr Reynolds
or, for that matter, Mr Major would remain in office long enough to see the
process through to its hoped-for conclusion.

may have a problem doing so. The name was originally chosen partly so it
would be at the top of any alphabetical list of its sector and partly
because it was short, symmetrical and easy to turn into a logo.
But in Japan, where the company started operations this summer, AXA
apparently means: 'It stinks'. Memorable, anyway.

An extreme case of coals to Newcastle? The Pope was yesterday presented with
copies of the gospels by Walter Veltroni, the trendy Italian ex-communist
and now editor of what used to be the party's daily organ, L'Unita. The slim
volumes are being distributed with the paper both as a promotional exercise
and to underline just how post-communist Italy's left has become. Veltroni,
now a leading member of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left,
is the first PDS member to be received by the Pope. No Pope ever agreed to

Good news for MPs rushing to list their outside interests for fear of being
caught up in the row over sleaze. It seems there is no need to register
those free trips to Paris on the newly-opened Eurostar tunnel rail link.
Apparently since every MP was offered the trip it does not count as a
declarable interest. The moral is clear. It is perfectly acceptable to bribe
our representatives at Westminster as long as we bribe them all.

An appealing feature of Japanese life looks like biting the dust. Because of
an increase in under-age boozing, the government has politely suggested to
brewers that they stop selling beer from their 140,000 street vending
machines. Nobody lightly ignores government suggestions - even politely
expressed ones.
The five leading brewers will decide what to do soon. They will probably
meekly bow heads and shuffle offstage - after all, the machines represent a
mere 7 per cent of sales. But over-age drinkers will mourn the disappearance
of these oases. Not only is vending machine beer always chilled, however hot
the weather, it also comes in a range of sizes, from a one-gulp can up to
two litres, enough to slake the biggest thirst.

Not a peep so far from Canada's Big Five banks. When US banks lift their
prime lending rates, as they have this week, their Canadian counterparts
aren't usually backward in coming forward.
Bank economists can find any number of technical reasons, mostly to do with
interest-rate spreads, why the Canadian banks won't be following suit just
yet.
But Observer's not fooled. The banks' year ended on October 31 and their
reporting season begins next Tuesday. Several are expected to announce
record profits. Royal Bank of Canada, for instance, is set to become the
first Canadian bank to earn more than CDollars 1bn.
Having long struggled to overcome a reputation as corporate fat cats, the
last thing the banks want is to be seen, through a rise in the cost of
lending, to be upsetting the small businessmen they are keen to woo.
But . . . once the results season is over, the profit motive is sure to come
back into its own.

Mansion House. When was the last time anyone engraved an interest rate in
stone?
Howe's observant eye had spotted a block of apartments near London's
Camberwell Road called 'The Four Per Cent Industrial Dwellings Association'.
He could not miss it, he said, because the rate was engraved on the face of
the building - erected less than 90 years ago. The 4 per cent was meant to
impress investors seeking high yields - rather than borrowers looking for
cheap mortgages.
But Howe did not sound at all optimistic about the future employment
prospects for stonemasons. Surely the Bank of England could do with a bit of
fettling up in the interim?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sad day tomorrow for Glaxo's shareholders as Sir Paul Girolami finally steps
down from the helm of the UK drugs giant. Tory treasurer Lord Hambro could
also be forgiven for feeling a mite upset since Girolami's going will almost
certainly leave a gaping hole in the Tories' bank account.
Under Sir Paul, Glaxo has been a substantial donor to the Conservatives,
giving Pounds 550,000 since 1985 when he became chairman. He justified the
largesse as being in the best interests of shareholders. But Sir Colin
Corness, the part-time Bank of England director who will take the Glaxo
chair, begs to differ.
An outspoken critic of corporate donations, he has not yet had a chance to
discuss the issue with Glaxo's other directors. He doesn't take over till
May. But the Tories are bracing themselves for the worst unless Lord Howe, a
Glaxo new boy, can save the day.

FT  17 NOV 94 / A tough act to follow: Japanese business is hoping for
monetary relaxation under a new central bank governor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a deserted Tokyo, at midnight, a huddle of people gathered last week for
an out-of-hours announcement. Mr Yasuo Matsushita, a former bureaucrat and
commercial banker, had been selected as Japan's next central bank governor.
The late-night timing could hardly have heightened the interest in the
appointment: few are the Japanese businessmen and financiers who have not
hoped for a softening in monetary policy with the ending of the dramatic
tenure of outgoing governor Mr Yasushi Mieno.
The current restructuring of the Japanese economy owes much to Mr Mieno's
vision, and the slowness of the recovery something to his discipline. He
moved to curb the unbridled growth of the 1980s, and has since held to a
policy designed to squeeze Japan's corporate sector.
Mr Matsushita's task will be to steer the economy through the fallout from
this process: refining the balancing after the overhaul. Such an agenda is
unlikely to prompt a change of course on the scale witnessed by Mr Mieno,
but it may prove as controversial.
When Mr Mieno took office five years ago Japan's wild financial party of the
late 1980s was at its high point. Financial liberalisation, rapid economic
growth and easy money had given birth to a bubble economy.
What began as an explosion in land prices, in cramped conditions of tight
supply and ballooning demand, had quickly spread to embrace equities, bonds,
and even golf-club memberships. By the time of Mr Mieno's accession, land
prices had risen fivefold in a little over three years, and the stock market
had tripled in four.
Appalled by the lack of financial control, Mr Mieno, something of an ascetic
said never to have bought a share in his life, acted quickly to burst the
bubble. Within three weeks he had cut financial sector liquidity and over
the next 15 months he raised the discount rate five times, taking it from
2.5 to 6 per cent by the end of 1990.
The recession that followed proved the most serious in Japan since the
second world war. Share prices collapsed by more than 50 per cent in four
years, and land prices fell by up to 70 per cent.
As domestic demand fell, corporate Japan was hit by overcapacity. The rise
in the yen, prompted by rising interest rates, the large and rising current
account surplus and a slowdown in Japanese overseas investment, led to
declining demand in export markets. The underlying inefficiency of much of
Japanese industry was exposed.
The central bank responded to the recession with increasingly urgent cuts in
interest rates, taking the official discount rate to a record low of 1.75
per cent last autumn.
In the year since, the first signs of sluggish recovery have emerged, with
the economy expected to expand by about 1 per cent this year, accelerating
slowly thereafter.
But the weakness of the recovery presents the new governor with a challenge
as difficult as the one that faced his predecessor: he must find the right
mix of monetary policy to meet an exacting set of demands. In addition to
the usual need to sustain non-inflationary growth, policy must deal with the
continuing financial consequences of the collapse of the bubble - corporate
indebtedness and the banking system's bad loans. It must also address the
longer-term transformation of the economy into an efficient, deregulated
market system.
So far under Mr Mieno, the bank's approach has been a surprising one - a
gentle tightening of monetary conditions. Since July, overnight call rates
have been allowed to drift upwards - from 2 per cent in July to 2.3 per cent
last week.
'Since the summer the bank has moved gradually to tighten liquidity, which
has pushed up short-term interest rates,' says Mr Richard Werner, chief
economist at Jardine Fleming in Tokyo.
Many economists are puzzled by the bank's tactics. If the slow upturn had
been accompanied by the merest hint of inflation, monetary tightening would
have been comprehensible. In fact the opposite has occurred. The recovery is
so weak that it has failed to counteract the prevailing deflationary forces
at work. Wholesale prices are falling at a rate of 2 per cent a year and
consumer prices are stable.
So the bank's tightening, though gentle for the moment, seems unnecessary.
The risks associated with it also appear to be unbalanced. There is an
infinitesimal risk of inflation if policy is relaxed, but a significant risk
of renewed economic slowdown if policy is tightened. Confronted with this
choice the bank has elected to tighten.
Mr Toshio Koyano, economist at DKB Research in Tokyo, says: 'The BoJ's move
in the past few months has been premature - restraining monetary growth now
carries a risk of endangering the recovery.'
Most central bankers have a weakness for what Lord Healey, chancellor in the
last British Labour government, called sado-monetarism. But in the Bank of
Japan's case, there seems to be a more rational explanation for the
strategy, based on Mr Mieno's increasingly bullish view of economic
prospects. The bank's official judgment is that the economy is 'in the early
stages of recovery', a much less cautious view than one espoused by other
public bodies.
Believing this, the bank's behaviour has differed in this cycle from its
policies in previous cycles. In the last two recessions of the 1980s,
interest rates were still allowed to fall even after the output gap - the
difference between actual output and potential output - had started to
narrow. Interest rates began to ease upwards only when inflationary
pressures had clearly returned to the economy.
This time, the bank is tying monetary policy to its perception of the
performance of the real economy, rather than price levels. It has acted to
raise interest rates as soon as the output gap has started to close - even
though inflation is falling.
The bank 'has placed overwhelming emphasis on the pace of economic recovery
 -not inflation - as the key policy determinant,' explains Mr Feldman, chief
economist at Salomon Brothers.
The reason appears to be that the bank is determined to use monetary policy
to promote the restructuring of the economy. The long recession and the rise
in the value of the yen have forced companies to begin to reduce the
overcapacity produced during the bubble. According to Mr James Vestal, chief
economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo: 'By allowing the economy to
work through the excesses of the second half of the 1980s on its own, the
bank will ensure that the momentum for deregulation, restructuring and
change remains intact.'
Mr Matsushita may wish to follow the policy of squeezing the corporate
sector. But as former chairman of Sakura, a bank with one of the largest
portfolios of bad loans, he will be more aware than most of the significant
risk of a crisis in the financial sector.
Japanese banks have not moved quickly to rid themselves of the problem loans
collected in the bubble years. The leading banks have made provisions of
just Y3,000bn out of as much as Y30,000bn. Years of sluggish economic
growth, however cathartic for manufacturers, would be difficult for the
banks, for which it means weak demand, continuing asset problems and poor
profitability.
Worse, the present monetary tightening is potentially ruinous for them.
Already the upward drift in short-term rates has pushed up banks' funding
costs. As interest rates rise, banks' interest costs rise more quickly than
their income, because of the structure of their assets and liabilities. That
is already putting pressure on margins and will limit further their scope to
dispose of bad debts.
Financial markets are speculating that Mr Matsushita, with his direct
experience of the banking sector, might adopt an easier monetary policy to
assist the banks.
But more likely, the other, longer part of his experience - as a bureaucrat
in the finance ministry - will incline him towards a middle course.
Macroeconomic policy is likely to be geared towards restrained growth to
maintain the pressure on corporate Japan, while banks will be nursed back to
health by micro-management.
'The focus will be on case-by-case problem solving of particular banks'
balance sheet problems,' says Mr Jesper Koll, of JP Morgan in Tokyo. 'The
governor will act as a hands-on manager of these issues. Interest rate
policy will not change for the time being.'
The implications of that strategy are far-reaching. Policy will not be
dictated by the fear of a banking collapse. Instead, some banks may be
allowed to fail if they do not represent a risk to the banking system. Mr
Matsushita will need to draw on all the credit that his years in the banking
sector have given him if he is to achieve that.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Flushing out the rebels
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major is quite right to make the passage of the European Community
(Finance) bill a matter of confidence. He could not remain prime minister if
he did anything less. His undertaking to contribute to the enlarged European
budget was given with the cabinet's support. As Mr Major said in the Commons
yesterday, there is no room for compromise. He was, of course, addressing
the rebels within his own party.
Labour must now decide whether its support for the European Union overrides
the temptation to vote opportunistically in the hope of staging a coup. The
likelihood that such a piece of theatre might succeed is small. Few
Conservative Eurosceptics are willing to topple their own administration.
The handful that might be so minded is outnumbered by Ulster Unionists who
support the Tories. The Liberal Democrats might not vote with Labour. In
sum, the balance of risk favours the prime minister.
A similar risk assessment has dictated the government's legislative
programme for the coming session. Here too the watchword has been caution:
there is clearly no stomach for the prospect of facing backbench rebels down
on substantive matters such as the privatisation of the post office. The
unavoidable bravado over the European finance bill apart, the motto is
'safety first'.
This may be no bad thing. The actions of a parliament are best judged on
grounds of quality. The quantity of new bills should be kept low. The speech
delivered by the Queen at the opening of Parliament yesterday contained a
smaller package of proposals than has become customary since 1979. Few if
any are radical or dramatic. In the debate following the speech the leader
of the opposition found little to quarrel with in any of the prime
minister's specific proposals. This revving down of the pace of law-making
may be derided in Westminster as 'consolidation' but beyond the small circle
of everyday politicking there may be a more positive response.
As the chancellor of the exchequer is fond of saying, what the public wants
is a period of good government. There is no evident demand for
ever-increasing amounts of hasty and therefore botched legislation. It will
be possible to assess specific bills when they are published, but at first
reading a list that includes pensions reform, a tidying-up of the health
service bureaucracy, mini-privatisations of the Crown Agents and the
commercial parts of the Atomic Energy Authority and a disability rights law
is welcome - although the latter may be too watered-down to be useful.
A period of low-key government might benefit the Conservatives. Unemployment
has fallen for the tenth consecutive month. Inflation is steady, around the
mid-point of the 0-4 per cent target range. A faster than advertised
reduction in public sector borrowing seems likely, offering a potential
justification for tax cuts in the 1995 budget. Mr Major's fortunes may yet
improve, if only accidents will stop happening to his government.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Personal View: Europe must show will to compete
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ZYGMUNT TYSZKIEWICZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For an employee or manager 'competitiveness' - like 'restructuring' - can
send nasty shivers down the spine. If you are neither, however, it is a
subject that can make your eyes glaze over with boredom.
Since most European politicians have not worked in - or managed - companies,
this may explain why Europe's competitiveness has steadily declined over the
past 20 years, with little being done about it. In fact, quite the opposite:
laws have been introduced - and continue to be introduced - whose effect is
to erode Europe's competitiveness even further.
However, there are now some encouraging signs of change. The economic
recession of the past three years has forced companies, national governments
and the European Commission to look for the causes of decline and to
prescribe remedies. As a result, 'competitiveness' is high on the political
as well as the business agenda.
Even so, there remain a number of causes for concern:
As we emerge from recession, the political will to carry out the fundamental
structural reforms necessary to restore competitiveness may evaporate.
With the notable exception of Unice (Union of Industrial and Employers'
Confederations of Europe), nobody is talking about the size, the cost and
the burden of the state in Europe's economies. Until that problem is
recognised and tackled, we shall continue to suffer a heavy disadvantage
vis-a-vis our main industrialised competitors.
Europe's most ambitious strategic plan in favour of competitiveness - a
genuine single market - is on the back burner, and, according to reports, no
heavyweight commissioner volunteered to assume responsibility for making it
work.
The essential corollary of competitiveness - a strict competition policy -
is being applied without the necessary rigour and determination. State aids
continue to be authorised too easily by the Commission, in many cases to the
detriment of just those companies that have undergone the painful process of
restructuring.
The legislative programmes of the German presidency and of the European
Commission still include measures which, collectively, can do grave harm to
European competitiveness - such as proposals for directives on a CO and
energy tax, on withholding taxes on savings, on parental leave, on atypical
work contracts, on the reversal of the burden of proof in discrimination
cases, on the posting of workers.
A further cause for concern are the measures missing from the legislative
programme. For example, proposed directives designed to eliminate double
taxation in the single market or introduce loss consolidation across
national frontiers are stuck in the European Council and have made no
progress for more than three years. Without these, the single market can
only be a shadow of itself, just as it will be until we have a workable
European company statute to simplify administration and accounting practices
which currently must conform to 12 separate regimes.
But if there is uncertainty about whether the Commission, the Council and
national governments have it in them to reverse present trends, the talk, at
least, is encouraging. The Delors white paper of December 1993 on growth,
competitiveness and employment contained many parallels with Unice's own
well-received studies of European competitiveness presented earlier this
year to the Commission and to the EU summits in Brussels and Corfu. The
Delors paper recognised the importance of competitiveness as the essential
precondition for economic growth and job creation.
In September the Directorate for Industrial Policy, under Commissioner
Martin Bangemann, published an important paper on industrial competitiveness
which unequivocally states that it will not be possible to restore growth
and consolidate economic revival in Europe except through compet-itive,
efficient and innovatory industry.
The German presidency of the European Union has now appointed the Molitor
Committee to identify what laws and regulations at both national and EU
level should be simplified or abolished in the interests of efficiency and
competitiveness.
Firm action is still lacking, however. Meanwhile, capital is highly mobile.
Investors will choose markets where prospects are best.
Yet it is well within our power to restore European competitiveness. As
President Woodrow Wilson said in 1912: 'While competition cannot be created
by statutory enactment, it can, in large measure, be revived by changing the
laws and forbidding the practices that killed it.'

FT  17 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Euro-fraud
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Too much beef, too much grain, and now too much fraud. The European Union's
institutions, particularly its Common Agricultural Policy, have generated a
mountain of corruption to stand beside the other piles of unwanted
commodities. The question now is whether the fraud can be curbed as long as
those policies remain.
This week, the Court of Auditors, the EU's financial watchdog, accused the
European Commission of failing to take fraud seriously. Its 484-page report
is the latest in an increasingly impassioned series from European and
national organisations.
Each tells the same story of fraudsters frolicking through Europe's complex
rules for disbursing funds, particularly those for agriculture and
infrastructure. Large sums have been paid for non-existent wheat and for
sub-standard olive oil. Cartloads of sugar, cattle and sheep have been
smuggled across borders and re-imported to earn subsidies.
Agriculture has proved particularly troublesome because the CAP allows
identical products to be sold at very different prices or to earn different
subsidies on either side of increasingly porous national borders. Its
complexity also facilitates fraud within a country: 'set-aside' requires
detailed monitoring of each farm.
Meanwhile, member states have a disincentive to uncover fraud by their
citizens, given the embarrassment that follows, and the risk that their
governments will then have to pay compensation.
There are signs that the public is increasingly irritated, but no signs of
corresponding outrage in Brussels. Beyond doubt, member countries should
give more thought to the practicalities of enforcing policies before passing
them. But the Commission also needs to find better tools for enforcing those
which already exist.
It could apply more vigorously a sanction it has sometimes wielded in the
past: withholding payments from member states which cannot demonstrate good
management of agricultural funds. It could also enforce existing community
regulations that require member states to penalise individuals who misuse
funds. It could, too, increase the potential penalties that governments
face; at present, governments can be forced only to pay back the
misappropriated money.
One more ambitious route is also worth considering: requiring countries to
contribute part of the agricultural programme's costs. A UK House of Lords
committee reported this summer that EU structural programmes suffered less
from fraud than agricultural schemes. It suggested that this is because
countries must contribute to structural projects themselves and so have an
incentive to manage the money well.
Ideally, the EU would not be burdened by programmes, such as the CAP, that
invite fraud. But even if they do remain, the option not available to the
Commission is to allow the scams to continue. Eventually that will bring all
EU programmes into disrepute.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Post-money world on our doorstep
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A week in which the whole world has been waiting for a Federal Reserve
meeting may seem a surprising one in which to express doubts on the power
and importance of central banks. Some contrary souls may, however, suspect
that just when an institution seems most triumphant, history will
subsequently show that it has passed its zenith. The serious point is that
the monetary system over which the central banks preside is changing so
radically that eventually there may be little room for their present
functions.
It is indeed time to sit up and take notice when such a thesis is put
forward not just by outsiders and free-banking fanatics, but by two serious
and sophisticated economists from the Central Bank of Ireland. They are FX
Browne and JPC Fell (shortly to move to the European Monetary Institute).
Their paper is entitled Inflation - Dormant, Dying or Dead? (Central Bank of
Ireland, POB 559, Dublin 2). Their thesis is that 'the newly-liberalised
financial markets can render impotent monetary policy actions that are
ostensibly inflationary'. Moreover 'over a much longer future horizon,
payment system advances, already realised or in the pipeline, could push
capitalist economies into a new post-monetary world without money or
inflation'.
The authors are adamant that inflation has up to now been caused by
excessive expansion of the money supply. They explicitly reject structural,
real economy, explanations of the kind put forward by Roger Bootle in an
HSBC Greenwell paper. But unlike conventional monetarists they envisage the
defeat of inflation, not by controlling the money supply, but by
establishing an economy in which money as we now know it has ceased to
exist. Readers who are suspicious of my gloss should refer to the original.
The first and most familiar part of the thesis is that the the bond market
is becoming the arbiter of monetary policy. The authors argue that the bond
market will itself tighten policy by pushing bond prices down and yields up
at the slightest whiff of an inflationary threat. I have myself argued that
the bond market can be and often is wrong and that central bankers should
not follow it blindly in setting short-term rates.
The novelty of the Irish paper is the suggestion that borrowers will no
longer be able to bypass the bond market by borrowing short term at
officially determined interest rates. Bank depositors who regard bank
interest rates as too low in view of likely inflation will quickly move into
longer-term securities, thus forcing up the whole yield curve and closing
off the option of borrowing cheaply at excessively low interest rates. They
also suggest that past bond market overshooting and undershooting reflect
hyper-sensitivity to inflationary developments, which will no longer make
sense in the new post-monetary world.
The second and still reasonably familiar part of the Irish thesis turns on
'securitisation'. This ungainly word refers to the tendency to borrow and
lend to a greater extent via bonds, equities or other securities, which can
be bought and sold in the markets, and thereby to bypass the banking system.
The authors argue that central banks will find it more and more difficult to
exercise leverage on interest rates through the influence of their
operations on the commercial banks, because the latter will become less
important.
Third, because of financial liberalisation, the spending of both households
and companies is becoming much less determined by either immediate income or
money in the bank, than by wealth. Put more simply, people are more and more
able to borrow their way out of temporary squeezes and insure against future
shocks. Expenditure will in the end be limited only by wealth - which like
most economists they define as the discounted total of expected future
income streams. The Irish authors draw from this development the implication
that money is just the most liquid form of wealth; and boosting or
restricting its supply will become pointless as people will simply use other
assets or borrow from each other.
Fourth, and most radically, the authors suggest that cash will dwindle in
importance and may eventually disappear. Currency and bank balances with
central banks together make up what economists used to call cash.
'Electronic money' may eliminate the need for both types.
Why do banks hold balances at central banks? Basically because such balances
are default free. Such perfectly safe assets are essential when net
settlements are made with other banks at the end of a working day, as some
risks are being run. But in the brave new world there will be 'Real-Time
Gross Settlement'. What this ugly piece of jargon means is that each
transaction between banks will be settled instantaneously and the
creditworthiness of the partner verified simultaneously. When this occurs
banks will avoid tying up assets in central bank balances paying minimal
interest rates.
A parallel development at the retail end is 'Electronic Funds Transfer at
Point of Sale'. Customers will have debit cards which can be drawn down as
they shop. Not only will these be cleaner and more theft-proof than notes
and coins; there will be no technical reason why interest should not be paid
on balances in credit.
Fifth, and most far-reaching, when electronic money has gone far enough, the
way will be open for the disappearance of money as a means of exchange and
the settlement of all transactions in assets such as mutual fund shares.
Such shares are not redeemable into dollars, sterling, marks, yen or Ecus.
They are claims on the equities or bonds, asset-backed securities,
commercial paper and other assets in which the funds have been invested.
Their value depends on the value of these underlying assets.
Sixth, the result will be, it is argued, a standard of value in which prices
can be set and long-term contracts denominated, divorced from the means of
payment. The Irish authors suggest that values will ultimately be measured
in terms of a unit account defined in terms of a basket of goods.
Before dismissing the Irish picture as fanciful, look at the many existing
developments pointing in that direction. The growing influence of the bond
markets on monetary policy does not need to be laboured. Securitisation has
become a cliche. The buoyancy of UK domestic demand, in spite of large tax
increases, suggests that expenditures are indeed becoming less constrained
by income and cash flow. The technology for electronic banking already
exists. Currency has become a much smaller part of the money supply; and, in
the US, money market mutual funds have shot up to become nearly as large as
bank deposits. One central banker remarked to me that the present very low
growth of broad money would have been a pointer to recession in any previous
period.
The controversial part of the Irish thesis is not the move towards a
cashless and policy-immune economy, but that the process will be benign. The
authors have, for instance, only a couple of throwaway sentences on how the
suggested basket-based unit of account will be created and maintained.
The trend towards a post-monetary society will not solve the policy problems
of the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England while it is only a trend.
Indeed, the Irish authors warn that, during the transition, monetary policy
may only be able to operate by driving financial markets 'against solvency
constraints'. Nevertheless a view of the possible destination must surely
help. For policymakers need to think both about the problems of the
transition and how to see that the emerging new monetary world is brave as
well as new.

Sir, Your leader, 'Planning for higher prices' (November 10), fails to take
into account the millions of people, including the elderly, the disabled and
families without access to private transport, who are being disadvantaged by
the proliferation of out-of-town superstores.
The independent small corner shop plays a crucial role for these citizens
and they would be the first to lose out were we as a nation to
followlemming-like the American way of shopping.
America now suffers from the 'doughnut' effect, namely everything on the
outskirts with very little, if anything, in the middle.
Rather we should follow the Japanese example where planning permission is
not given for a large retail development without a vote being taken first
among the local business community.
It may be the case that these superstores are immensely efficient, clean,
with a wide choice of goods and services to hand. However, once the
superstores have killed off the competition it may just be that quality will
go down and prices will go up.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Politics, not control, behind UBS
proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KLAUS GOTTSCHLICH and Mr PHILIPP MEIER-SCHERLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Much has been written about Union Bank of Switzerland's proposal to
convert its registered shares into bearers ('UBS holders urged to reject
change', November 15). However, the discussion in the UK as well as in the
US misses some important points.
The row between UBS and BK Vision, its single biggest shareholder, may on
the surface look like a contest for control. It is in fact a struggle with a
highly political background. UBS's managers claim to have obligations to
society which prevent them from maximising shareholder value. The fact that
UBS's managers are willing to sacrifice profits in order to meet the demands
of various 'stakeholders' may seem odd to Anglo-American investors and lend
support to BK Vision's opposition.
We have recently talked to Dr Martin Ebner, president of BK Vision, about
his views on corporate governance. We would point out that Dr Ebner, while
acting as a trustee for his own shareholders, has also adopted measures to
entrench himself outside the influence of the stock market. Furthermore, he
has left no doubt that he wants to use his voting power in public companies
as an instrument to influence Swiss politics.
Bearing in mind, for example, his hostility towards European integration of
Switzerland, investors cannot be sure BK Vision will always stand for
shareholders' interests.
For institutional investors it may be tempting to support BK Vision in its
bid to block the proposed simplification of UBS's capital structure.
However, this is little more than a problem of a shift in control. As long
as Swiss law allows discrimination against foreigners, the creation of
differential voting rights, the introduction of voting limitations, and the
like, there will be no market for corporate control worthy of its name.
The real issue is whether UK and US investors want to be excluded in the
future from control of Swiss companies in which they have invested. If this
is the case let them vote for Mr Ebner. If not, they should start to fight
for capital structures that allow competition for the resources of a public
company at all times. Mr Ebner will not do this for them, as he has nothing
to gain from such action.
How long do Anglo-American investors want to sit idly by watching Nestle,
Sandoz, Roche and others use international markets for corporate control,
while at the same time being denied the gains from mergers and takeovers in
Switzerland?

FAILURE IN BRITISH GOVERNMENT: THE POLITICS OF THE POLL TAX
By David Butler, Andrew Adonis and Tony Travers
Oxford University Press, Pounds 25 hbk, Pounds 7.99 pbk, 352 pages
This book, which chronicles the birth, life and death of the UK's poll tax,
is important, interesting and thorough. The authors have interviewed most of
the main people involved - including myself - and conclude that the policy
reveals shortcomings in the workings of the British government that
ultimately led to the toppling of Mrs Thatcher.
The book addresses three basic questions. First, why was it necessary to
devise a new form of local government tax? Second, why was the poll tax
selected? And third, why did it go so badly wrong?
The pledge to abolish domestic rates was made in the summer of 1974 by
Edward Heath, the then Conservative leader. But nothing was done about it. A
review of the rating system in 1979 when Margaret Thatcher became prime
minister led only to a reduction in the government grant to local
authorities.
By 1984 the position had become intolerable. It was difficult for the
government to get orders on grants to local authorities through the Commons
since the Treasury controls, of byzantine complexity, bore heavily on
Conservative councils. At the same time, certain Labour inner-city councils
were flouting the system by spending at record levels. The review that led
to the poll tax was put in hand, conducted by William Waldegrave and me as
environment ministers.
The central question was how much freedom a local authority should have. We
were looking for a robust and substantial tax base for local authorities
that would allow them to raise and spend their own money, and to answer for
it to their electorates.
The solution we came up with was a charge for local services, the community
charge - soon dubbed the 'poll tax'. It was based upon the principle that a
wider tax base was necessary because out of the 35m taxpayers only about 14m
paid rates; since many of these received rate rebates, only about 8m paid
rates in full.
The idea of a community charge was first mooted at Chequers, the prime
minister's country residence, in March 1985. It was envisaged that the
charge would be between Pounds 50 and Pounds 100 a head. If the people who
attended that crucial meeting had realised the poll tax would be levied at
nearly Pounds 300 a head in its first year, I am sure the proposal would
have been dropped.
The book is wrong, incidentally, to say those involved wanted 'to please
Margaret'. She had no clear views on what should replace rates, and her
enthusiasm for the poll tax flowered late.
Three things could have made the poll tax more bearable. First, a lower
level in the initial years, which would have meant introducing it in tandem
with rates. Such 'dual running' was abandoned after a debate at the
Conservative party conference in 1987. One should never allow the Tory party
conference to make policy - that is not its function.
Second, the exclusion from the tax of everybody below the age of 21 would
have taken the sting out of student protests. Unfortunately the purist
interpretation - that everyone over 18 had to pay - won the day.
And third, the central government grant to local authorities for 1990, the
first year of the poll tax, was utterly inadequate, and put further upward
pressure on its level.
The Treasury was not helpful: Nigel Lawson, then chancellor, opposed the
poll tax but was not prepared to block it. He was already at loggerheads
with the prime minister over the entry of sterling into the European
exchange rate mechanism and could not take on another issue.
That left Chris Patten, environment secretary in 1990, and me as
Conservative party chairman with the enormous problem of having to justify a
high and unpopular tax.
Did ministers fail? The poll tax was chosen after careful examination and
full discussion, which this book acknowledges.
One of the reasons it went so badly off the rails was that ministers
collectively were not looking at the political consequences. Cabinet
committees and the full cabinet examined the poll tax but in a fragmentary
way. There was no real political discussion.
Nor was parliament effective in scrutinising the impact of the tax. Attempts
to modify the legislation were viewed as destructive of the whole concept
and this made it even more difficult to get modest, but sensible, changes
accepted.
What, then, were the political consequences of this episode? I do not
believe it was the critical factor in Margaret Thatcher's fall. The 1990
local government elections showed councils such as Wandsworth and
Westminster could win majorities if the poll tax was low as a result of
lower expenditure. It was a good stick to beat Margaret Thatcher with, but
it did not match Sir Geoffrey Howe's resignation speech.
Where do we go from here? The present system of funding local government
based upon the council tax and tough central government controls is unlikely
to survive. It does not give local authorities the freedom they should have
and this will increase friction and hostility between local and central
government in future.
There is no easy answer by, for example, allocating a slice of income tax to
local government and calling it local income tax. If money is raised
centrally and simply allocated to local authorities, what is the purpose of
those authorities?
Lessons have certainly been learnt from the failure of the poll tax. But the
issue at the heart remains what it was - the powers of a centralised state
as opposed to the powers of a decentralised state. The issues raised by this
episode are not simply fiscal, they are also constitutional.

<TEXT>
Sir, I was not surprised to hear of Kim Fairweather's experiences with BA
(Letters, November 12/13). I have been a regular business traveller with BA
for many years, and I am also a silver tier member of the frequent flyer
programme. I also have never been offered an upgrade. I have even had to pay
to upgrade, when my male travelling companion has been offered a free
upgrade.
This discrimination does not only apply to upgrades. My male colleagues
frequently receive vouchers or bottles of wine when they complain about
re-routings or bad service. All I get is an obsequious letter, not
explaining the problem, and stating how much they value my custom. BA is
like the curate's egg - good in parts - but for the female business
traveller, the good parts are increasingly hard to find.

Sir, With regard to airline upgrades, I do not fly very frequently. However,
I am a regular first class traveller on British Rail. I should be annoyed

standard class passengers were 'upgraded' to any empty seats without extra
payment.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Complacency about escalation of debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ANN PETTIFOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Barry Riley (Weekend Money, November 12/13) is a little too complacent
about the indebtedness of poor countries. 'Most of such countries,' he says,
'have been allowed to renege on the bulk of their debts and are now at
various stages of a third world economic boom.'
This is unfair and untrue. Because of what Keynes called 'the magic of
compound interest', because of high real rates of interest, and because of
unfavourable exchange rate movements, every single month between 1982 and
1990 - every month not year - the poor of the south paid the rich north
Dollars 12.5bn. This is as much as the entire third world spends on health
and education combined. Interest arrears on long-term debt owed to official
creditors has risen from Dollars 126m at the beginning of the 1980s to more
than Dollars 10bn today, and more than half of the debt owed by poor
countries to the Paris Club now consists of capitalised interest.
Over the period 1993-1996 poor countries are scheduled to pay an average of
USDollars 41bn a year to their creditors - most of them rich OECD
governments. This is two to five times as much as they were able to pay in
1992.
Of growing concern is the stock of debt owed by developing countries to the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which has risen faster than any
other type of debt. It tripled from Dollars 98bn in 1982 to Dollars 304bn in
1992. Furthermore, there is no mechanism for the rescheduling or reduction
of this debt.
Translated into ability to pay, Africa is more debt-distressed than any
other developing region. Its debt has spiralled from Dollars 8.4bn in 1980
to just under Dollars 200bn now. This is equivalent to 110 per cent of
Africa's entire income.
The Debt Crisis Network, an alliance of 40 organisations working in, or
linked to, developing countries, has welcomed the chancellor's recognition
of 'the unsustainable debt burden' of the poorest countries. We only wish
that his concern was shared by columnists on your newspaper, so that your
readers may not all be rudely jolted out of complacency by the next debt
crisis.

SECOND BEST (12)
Chris Menges
THE SHADOW (12)
Russell Mulcahy
AIRHEADS (15)
Michael Lehmann
MY FAIR LADY (U)
George Cukor
Owing to the indisposition of Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers, My Fair
Lady is the surprise addition to the week's release schedule. What it is to
have our censor to guide and guard us. Spared NBK's depraving modernism, we
can bask in a week where the sun seems never to have set on Nice Anglo-Saxon
Values; or never to have risen on challenge, disorientation or originality.
Screen violence has become an all-purpose scapegoat today. A well-known
movie reviewer on TV said recently, with a cosmic shrug, 'A hundred years of
cinema and we end up with Arnold Schwarzenegger.' But I am more concerned
that after 100 years we end up with Second Best, Airheads, and The Shadow;
not to mention a 30-year-old revived musical.
Violence is not the enemy of art or morality. In a grown-up world both these
arenas should be strong enough to accept the challenge of lively debate. The
enemy of art, and of thinking morality, is the apathy of demure
traditionalism or brainless trend-following: both of which are written
through this week's films.
We see the first in Second Best, the potentially touching tale of a Welsh
sub-postmaster (William Hurt with accent and curly-red wig) who seeks to
adopt a disturbed youngster (Chris Cleary Miles). But he has many battles to
fight: not least with the uneven style and tone adopted by the British
director and former cinematographer (The Mission, The Killing Fields) Chris
Menges.
As in A World Apart, his anti-apartheid directing debut, Menges has a
maddening ability to outline main characters with a sharp, compassionate
light while letting the rest of the film dissolve into miasma. Miles is very
moving as the boy, his large, hunted eyes ranging from bleak defence to
tearful self-surrender. And Hurt's pained precision in the older role is
masterly. The face is a transparent mask of perplexity: a kind of
physiognomic fish tank through which we watch his restless thoughts.
But this central tale of bonding between two emotional cripples - both
maimed by lack of parental love, as illustrated in the the epidemic of
flashbacks in David Cook's script (from his own novel) - takes place in a
social and moral void.
Where are Hurt's fellow villagers? How - apart from some brief rhubarbings
from gossipy shop customers - do they react? And how should we react to a
story in which a single man with no sex life, apart from the 'DIY' option
that probing social worker Jane Horrocks compels him to admit to, seeks an
11-year-old surrogate son? It surely arouses a suspicion, at least, of
substitute sexual passion.
The movie stutters around this question as it does around the dainty,
ever-flowing tea table in Hurt's low-ceilinged home. Menges and Cook behave
towards us like parents failing to get up the nerve to tell their child the
facts of life. And as other characters, from Uncle John Hurt via adoption
therapist Prunella Scales to Keith Allen as the boy's ex-convict Dad, pop up
even the brave naturalism of the central duo starts to look like part of the
dramatic evasiveness.
Second Best ends up as second best itself to Cook's 1980s TV play Walter,
another, tauter case study of emotional arrest. That one starred Ian
McKellen. And where is Sir Ian?
The finest Shakespearean actor of his generation balances a pair of specs
and a wobbly American accent in The Shadow. He plays a bomb-designing boffin
caught in a tug of war between the hero (Alec Baldwin as caped wrong-righter
Lamont Cranston) and the villain (John Lone).
This is another film that makes us long for the impious, millennial anarchy
of Stone's mayhem opera. Time-warped in 1930s New York, we stutter through
yet another romp about a comic-book crusader filmed in a style that Batman
popularised as 'retro-noir': dimly lit and stuffed with yesterday's
iconography. A Fu Manchu-style baddie; a Gotham City sketched in swift,
cliche strokes of post-Depression Gothic; and Baldwin leaping into
invisibility with all the ease of an actor who has scant discernible
presence even when we can see him.
At the start it looks hopeful. The director is Russell 'Highlander' Mulcahy,
so the camera swoops and soars. The special effects boast a flying
ornamental knife with an animated face grimacing on its hilt. And we like
the museum security guard who when confronted with a close descendant of
Genghis Khan stomping towards him, after emerging from a sarcophagus, says,
'Er, we're closed.'
But a little post-modernism goes a long way; a lot can end up going
absolutely nowhere. The Shadow is auto-erotism as style: the cinema's form
of DIY love play, losing itself in reflected reveries of past glory. How apt
that it ends with another of those hall-of-mirror shoot-outs plundered from
Orson Welles's The Lady From Shanghai. Or is this another in-joke? Welles,
after all, was the original radio voice of Lamont Cranston.
Airheads is the week's third distress call from Anglophone cinema. This time
a Los Angeles radio station is comically hijacked by a fame-seeking rock
group calling themselves The Lone Rangers, led by Brendan Fraser, last seen
as a defrosted Neanderthal in California Man. They try to force the station
boss (Michael McKean) and the DJ (Joe Mantegna, mugging away in a wig as if
he had never been America's leading Mamet actor) to play their demo tape
over the air.
Director Michel Lehmann's early career was a downhill slalom from Heathers,
his sweetly malicious comedy about a girls school, to Hudson Hawk, his Bruce
Willis superflop. Lehmann still seems to be wearing runaway skis. The plot
does not so much progress, more zigzag between deadly marker-posts. Blunt
gags snap at the ankles; tone-changes are tried and discarded; finally the
film ends in a heap at the bottom of the piste.
At least My Fair Lady has grace and a sense of presentation. We still look
at this large, creamy epic made from the Lerner-Loewe stage musical and
wonder if less would not have been more. (Did they keep saying to designer
Cecil Beaton, 'More frou-frou, Cecil]'?) But when the film is tuneful it is
very tuneful. And even when it is tuneless we have Rex Harrison,
master-croaker, in charge of the sprechtgesang.
The other pleasure for revival buffs is Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves:
neo-realism on wheels. The 1948 Italian classic is proof that all you need
to make a great film is a camera, a few streets, and a group of characters
tested by credible extremity.
Much like Natural Born Killers. Oliver Stone's film is not a great one, but
at least, unlike any other new film this week, it is in touch with real life
and raw emotion. It looks like a work of cinema made today for audiences of
today. But in Britain, thanks to a movie-vetting system based on bowing to
yesterday's moral mandates, we shall have to wait till tomorrow, or longer,
to see it.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Arts: Simple ideas come off best - Fringe Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you want to see a really sparkling first play, pick Nick Grosso's Peaches
at the Royal Court's Theatre Upstairs. This has authenticity written all
over it, yet the touch remains light. The background is the numerical
explosion of Britain's student population. Here are semi-educated young
people at university, at first just messing about, drinking and dancing,
then ultimately looking for jobs.
The university is Leeds, suitably far north, but still only a few hours
drive from the magnetic pull of London. Driving plays a large part: the
scenes where students drive and talk in cars up and down the M1 are
beautifully done - you almost think that Peaches might have been made for
television.
In a succession of short scenes Grosso uses surtitles to indicate the
location and the characters. Far from being trendy, the men are frankly
reactionary. 'Peaches' is the word for women, which is what the male
students think about all the time even if they occasionally talk about
something else. They regret that so many of the women have turned gay,
vegetarian or vegan.
Grosso writes without bias or preaching. He simply shows the students as
they are. Some education has clearly rubbed off on them, though they try to
conceal it. For instance: 'Do you know Raymond Chandler?' 'You mean the one
who played for Fulham?' Or 'what's that book about the future - 1973? They
had to change the title.' The men live in the past.
There are also social nuances even among students trying to be egalitarian.
Watch the embarrassment when Frank (Ben Chaplin) goes off to a girl friend's
country house and finds he doesn't like the country.
The play comes from the Studio of the Royal National Theatre, where they do
intensive rehearsing and experimenting. The work pays off. Not a line nor a
movement in this piece is lost. Under James Macdonald's direction and David
Roger's design, there is marvellous attention detail. Note the cows outside
the country house and the pigeons outside the window of a London flat.
Yet it cannot be true that the National Theatre can make a good production
out of anything. The writing has to be there in the first place. The only
trouble with Peaches is that it lasts 75 minutes.
Beware of plays that try to be too clever. One good idea is usually enough.
At the Gate Theatre Maria Irene Fornes has an excellent idea at the start of
The Danube: it could be sustained throughout, but distractions get in the
way.
The piece plays around with foreign language teaching. It is Budapest 1938.
On the board is Unit One: Basic sentences. An American talks to some locals
in that slow stilted style that goes with learning a new language. 'Are you
a Hungarian?' 'No, I am an American.' The conversation moves on: 'What do
you eat for breakfast?'
There are some promising developments. A Hungarian father (Simeon Andrews)
muses that some say German is the language of the future, but that others
that it is English. The father has a marked preference for German
cigarettes. Since this is close to the eve of the second world war, all that
is appropriately ominous.
Then The Danube shoots off all over the place. As a programme note puts it:
the play 'soon departs from chronologically (sic) realism'. The notes also
refer to nuclear fall-out from north eastern Kazakstan, pollution in
Budapest and the London suburb of Putney, as well as the alleged misdeeds of
the mining company, RTZ. The characters begin to suffer from respiratory and
other diseases, yet nothing is very clear.
Meanwhile, the play continues in its language lesson format. This is a
useful dramatic venture in itself, showing how text book language is not
always so different from the language people speak if they lack individual
self-expression. It could be further explored. Ms Fornes throws away the
chance by trying to do too much.
One other slight cavil. Short plays seem to be catching. The Danube lasts
only 80 minutes. There is, however, one joy. Hannah Miles makes her first
professional appearance as the Hungarian daughter. Previously she had played
Hedda Gabler at the Guildhall school. She has great poise, and is clearly an
actress to be watched. Direction is by Nancy Meckler for the Shared
Experience Theatre.
*
At the Cockpit, John Constable's Tulip Futures suffers even more than The
Danube from seeking to be too clever. It may sound a good idea to write a
play about the financial market in Dutch tulips in the 17th century measured
against the market for art: it is a piece about relative values. Yet good
ideas are not always inherently dramatic: it helps to have characters,
feeling and wit. Still, the piece is redeemed by a splendid last five
minutes when the characters in the original portraits speak from their now
elevated position in the National Gallery. Abigail Morris directs and there
is a remarkably ambitious set designed by Tom Piper.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Arts: Albee's 'Three Tall Women' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's a poor sort of memory that only works backward,' the Queen remarked.'
In the first half of Edward Albee's virtually plotless play Three Tall
Women, memory works only backward. The play's three heroines are young (26),
middle-aged (52), and old (92), and they represent potential, achievement,
aftermath. Si la jeunesse savait . . . si la vieillesse pouvait. In Act Two,
however, the play moves through the looking-glass, and memory works forward.
The effect is original, contrived, witty, meandering, touching, impressive,
specious. The play was new in 1991, has received several prizes since its
New York City premiere this February, and now reaches London in an
illustrious new production led by Maggie Smith and Frances de la Tour as
Heroines A and B.
It is the 92-year-old, a rich New England lady at death's door, who is the
centre of the triptych. In Act One, her memory is sliding in and out of
focus (other signs of old age are explicit; the onset of Alzheimer's disease
is implicit); and the other two are her companion and a member of her
lawyer's firm. In Act Two, however, she is nothing but memory; and the other
two are herself at younger ages. The sense that she carries these younger
alter egos inside her is clear, even though the 26-year-old repeatedly
refuses to age into that.
Maggie Smith's creation of the old lady is a marvel of daring and
incisiveness. Early on, she starts to wail - for no very good reason, and
not for the last time - and the accuracy with which her vocal tone and
facial expression capture the peculiar misery of helpless old age is
uncannily fine. Yet within seconds her mischievous wit bobs back, and
moments later her malicious disdain also. She is more autocratic, more
disturbed, more volatile, than Myra Carter in the same role in New York; she
achieves serenity only gradually.
On two or three occasions, she over-employs some comic devices - staccato,
bird-like turns of the raised head, swivellings of the eyes, all as seen
last year in The Importance of Being Earnest - but these are minor blots. In
Act Two, she achieves a quiet and stillness that must rank among the finest
hours of her great career.
Frances de la Tour's performance is without blot, and complements Smith's
with model generosity, dryness, and elegance. Anastasia Hille's performance,
in the junior role, is altogether less accomplished: fussy, restless, silly.
Anthony Page's direction is perfectly paced; Carl Toms's decor and Tom
Rand's costumes are handsome.
Wilde's line, 'The tragedy of old age is not that one is old but that one is
still young', explains part of the feeling that the play creates  - but only
part. For the young woman is so evidently callow beside the older two. The
52-year-old has more compassion, more irony, more resignation; and the
92-year-old is moving towards the final resignation. They speak of family,
losing virginity, marriage, sex, adultery, motherhood, illness - much of
which has not yet happened to the 26-year-old. Interestingly, though the
younger woman is most alarmed at the prospect of disillusion in marriage,
the older women are most troubled by their son (who appears, albeit without
speaking a word).
The play is weaker and slighter than it has been proclaimed. (I confess
that, at its NYC premiere this February, I nodded off more than once - but
put that down to jet-lag. At the London premiere last night, however, I
spotted others yawning or slumbering at the points I had faded before.) The
writing is full of humour, grace, irony, edge; but too often a certain
whimsical preciosity protrudes. Lines are repeated and echoed at times with
a sub-Gertude-Stein effect; non sequiturs and stream-of-consciousness
changes of subject abound as if Albee were imitating effects from Anton
Chekhov, Virginia Woolf, Samuel Beckett, and others. An evening both
rewarding and frustrating.
At Wyndham's Theatre, WC2

FT  17 NOV 94 / Arts: The Brandenburgers in Bohemia - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Chelsea Opera Group, whose regular concert performances of neglected
works are a valuable asset to the London music scene, has in the past
enjoyed particular success with Slavonic repertory - the body of operatic
literature most under-represented in the west - and Sunday's performance of
The Brandenburgers in Bohemia was no exception.
Smetana's first opera (premiered in 1866), though uneven, is full of vivid
music. With its idiom derived from mainstream European opera, The
Brandenburgers anticipates only here and there the composer's mature 'Czech
style', but several appealing folkish episodes make it worth hearing
regardless of the shortcomings - revealed all too clearly at the Queen
Elizabeth hall in Deryck Viney's stilted translation - of its libretto.
Although The Brandenburgers was a great success at first - for a while it
even overshadowed Smetana's second opera, The Bartered Bride - the work has
always been hostage to its country's fortunes. With a plot based on an
incident during the 13th-century Brandenburg invasion, it has provided
discomfort for any occupying force; the opera was, of course, too close to
the bone for the Nazis, who banned it.
Sunday's concert had a valuable link with Czech operatic tradition in its
conductor, Vilem Tausky. The 84-year-old came out of virtual retirement,
eager to do The Brandenburgers, the only one of Smetana's eight operas he
had never conducted before.
A pillar of post-war operatic life in Britain, Tausky was given a
heartwarming reception. In spite of physical frailty, he galvanised the
orchestra and chorus into one of their best recent performances, and led a
lively account of the piece.
One longed, ungratefully, for Czech singers, but the Chelsea Opera Group
mustered a worthy cast with only a few small-voiced or score-bound
exceptions. Helen Kucharek's fresh soprano made her affecting as the heroine
Ludise, and she was nicely complemented by Jacqueline Bremar, lively as one
of her sisters, Vlcenka.
Jeffrey Carl was a musical Tausendmark, but as the villain of the piece
lacked vocal heft. The tenor Donald Stephenson's peasant leader Jra was
vivid in his crowd-inciting song-and-dance number, and Mark Beesley's Mayor
of Prague had dignity.
The most powerful singing came from Jeremy White's bass Old Villager, whose
Act 2 prayer (with chorus) is one of the opera's finest passages.

What constitutes a riot? Tonight's revelation of Forbidden Britain (9.45pm,
BBC2) is too vague, including Orange march scuffles, striking miners and the
1946 Bolton football disaster when 33 were crushed to death. But riots? You
might as well include Harrod's sale.
Despite Zoe Wanamaker's portentous tones claiming that riot coverage has
always been censored, there's plenty of the real thing, notably a 1932
hunger march that turned violent and the battle of Cable Street. Wry
recollections never fulfil the subtitle's promise, 'Our Secret Past'.
Finney (9pm, ITV), a new drama series hovering dangerously near cliche, is
worth a look for the acting. Warm-hearted Geordies have a criminal
underworld and gangster sub-culture that can turn nasty to the family white
sheep (David Morrissey).
Family ties of a different kind are infinitely moving in Witness: The Search
for Alison MacDonald (9pm, C4). The mystery is less what happened to Alison
when she vanished in India but why her father, a Scottish minister, is
convinced of both her survival and God's goodness.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Arts: The Brno Philharmonic - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY BYE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Western classical music lovers the city of Brno, the provincial capital
of Moravia in the Czech republic, probably means just one thing: Janacek. It
was there that he worked for the greater part of his life and there in the
city's opera house where, during the 1920s, the last four of his remarkable
operas were first performed.
Curiously, the official founding of the city's flagship symphony orchestra,
the Brno Philharmonic, postdates even that memorable era: although the Brno
Philharmonic Society started giving concerts as far back as 1808, and in
various guises (at one point as the Brunner Philharmoniker playing for the
German Opera) has actively participated in the city's musical life ever
since, it was not until 1956 that its present status - as the Brno State
Philharmonic Orchestra - was fully established.
Yet one would hardly have guessed its relative youthfulness from the
assurance and love with which the orchestra under its Principal Conductor,
Laos Svarovsky, played a programme ideally suited to its many qualities at
the Royal Festival Hall on Tuesday: nothing from the core Austro-German
repertoire, but Smetana, Tchaikovsky, Suk and Janacek, all composers who
found a perfect match in the orchestra's unanimity of purpose and radiant
delivery.
If the choice of the overture to Smetana's The Bartered Bride as opener was
somewhat predictable (though not inappropriate, since this was the opera
which inaugurated Brno's National Theatre in 1884), it certainly set the
tone of the evening in the agility and incisiveness with which it was
projected, qualities even more evident in the glowing textures of Josef
Suk's attractive if slight Fantastic Scherzo which the orchestra convinced
us was nothing less than a masterpiece.
Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto certainly benefited from the orchestra's
warmth and vernal freshness, and in Igor Oistrakh it found an ideal partner.
Admittedly Oistrakh's rubato was a little free to begin with, causing some
problems of ensemble, but once he embarked on his first bout of
passage-work, strict - though by no means inflexible - time was the order of
the day and the interpretation - objective but intense, robust but capable
of delicacy - took wing. The slow movement, natural and supple was imbued
with a lyricsm free of mawkish sentiment, the finale precise and
rhythmically poised.
And, of course, to end it had to be the Janacek Sinfonietta, complete with
the luxury of 13 extra Czech brass players. Janacek's sinewy orchestration
can often sound simply bizarre in the wrong hands, but here seemed to hold
no terrors: confirming the Brno Philharmonic's inborn musicality and utter
unselfconsiousness, qualities which seem to infuse all it comes into contact
with, traditional - and fast-disappearing - music-making at its best.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Packaging corporate
presents - Christmas is coming and the gift budget is fattening up after
some lean years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The padded envelopes and strangely-shaped packages are starting to arrive:
it is the time of year when diaries, pens, calendars, bottles and even
hampers are beginning their ritual circulation between companies.
Christmas provides the perfect excuse for buttering up clients in the hope
that their custom will continue and augment over the coming year. Companies'
gift budgets were tight during the recession, but those involved in
manufacturing and supplying the gifts now report that business is brisk.
There is concern from some in the industry that recent allegations in the
British press of 'sleaze' in public life have put a last-minute dampener on
enthusiasm for gift giving and receiving this Christmas; others report no
discernible damage has been done.
Alyson Cook, editor of the trade journal Promotions and Incentives, says
that gifts have been in the spotlight more over the last few weeks than ever
before. 'A certain amount of suspicion has been generated among general
consumers as well as employees about receiving corporate gifts. It is a
great shame because corporate gifts are all about the feel-good factor -
enhancing your company's image with regular or potential customers,' she
says.
But Peter Austin, managing partner of Clearwater Hampers, which has seen
sales 80 per cent up on this time last year, says there has been no sign of
post-sleaze puritanism. 'Not a sausage,' he says emphatically, although he
reports losing two or three companies which have their headquarters in
Italy, which has had its own sleaze to contend with.
Even where companies do object to their employees receiving gifts, it seems
that some gift-givers may be finding their way round a ban. Says Alan
McCleave, business development manager with Bordeaux Direct, the wine gift
service: 'We are just given home addresses half the time. I would imagine
that is one way of getting round it.'
Austin is sceptical that mailings to home addresses show the rules are being
bent. An external gift-giver would be unlikely to have an employee's home
address and it would look a bit odd suddenly to ask for it, he says.
Austin's hamper company also sends many gifts to home addresses, but it is
employers themselves who are sending them as Christmas bonuses, he says.
A home delivery saves having to lug a hamper home on the bus, and it stops
envious glances at other employees' presents. Even at Christmas, hierarchy
intervenes. Austin explains: 'If you have staff of different seniority, you
do not want one person who has got a small hamper looking at the chap over
the desk who has got one twice the size.'
Apart from hampers and wine, Cook reports that gift vouchers, particularly
those redeemable at large retailers such as Marks and Spencer, J. Sainsbury
and Argos, have been a growth market in recent years. Goods bought with gift
vouchers are unlikely to be a year-round reminder of the giver's
munificence, or sit around on a desk like a pen or a diary, adorned with the
donor company's logo and telephone number. Nevertheless, says Cook, vouchers
are popular with recipients' families  - a warm glow at home is bound to
enhance the feel-good factor.
For some companies, giving gifts is all about attracting attention with
freebies that are often in dubious taste. Says Cook: 'You can get your own
branded condoms. They can be luminous, shaped to any size and posted under
plain cover.' One of this year's particular hits has been dolls featuring
the chart-topping pop band Take That, she reports.
In the experience of Jill Wilkin, marketing manager of software company BMC,
even the hardest-bitten manager will have a soft spot for a silly gift.
Key-rings may be a cliche, but a train-shaped key-ring, which emits
train-like sounds when a button is pressed, is apparently irresistible.
Present one 'to a grown man who runs a company and he will fall about in
hysterical laughter,' she says.
While companies may toy for a time with something different for their
corporate gifts, they will usually revert to the top five safe bets,
according to Andrew Bourne, who heads the largest UK gift business, Bourne
Publicity.
These hardy perennials are pens, diaries, calendars, mugs and desk pads,
replete with company logo. The logos have become more discreet, says Bourne,
and quality of gifts has improved vastly. 'It used to be a high volume of
low-priced items which fell apart, doing more harm than good,' he says.
He finds that companies are now giving fewer gifts, spending more on them
and targeting them more closely. Clients include Sony, Royal Mail and IBM,
for which Bourne has assembled a brochure of Pink Panther-themed promotional
gifts.
Wilkin agrees that the emphasis is now on quality and targeting. Her main
aim is to get desk space: 'We go for items which are useful, go on the desk
and don't take up too much space. A lot of people now work in open-plan
offices. You can't give them calendars because they don't necessarily have
their own wall to put them on.'
Gifts such as computer-mouse mats have been particularly popular, she says.
Every item will have her company's name and telephone number. 'If they hit a
problem, they don't even have to think who to talk to - our name is there,'
says Wilkin.
Like many other companies, BMC uses promotional gifts around the year, at
exhibitions, seminars and as incentives, for example, for customers to fill
in questionnaires. 'There is less of a push now at Christmas than there used
to be.'
For most companies the issue of whether or not to send corporate gifts this
year will have been decided months before the current bout of sleaze
allegations set in. According to Cook, 'the sensible promotional manager
will have organised his gifts way back in the summer, buying in bulk to get
a good price'.
Even those who have hesitated at the last minute may reconsider their
decision in the cold light of the new year, in the experience of McCleave.
Last Christmas some customers said they were calling a halt to gift-giving.
'Then they all panicked in January when they found their rival companies
were doing it and getting the business,' he says.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Generation X goes to
the anti-mall - Victoria Griffith finds designer graffiti and a lack of
marble fountains at The Lab, dedicated to young Californian shoppers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Graffiti on the crumbling wall declares 'Lost in a sense'. Weeds creep up
through cracks in the pavement. Teenagers in cut-off shorts and hiking boots
lounge on thrift-shop furniture.
The scene may be evocative of city slums, but there is nothing undesirable
about this picture in the eyes of its creators. The place is The Lab, a
shopping complex in southern California that bills itself as the first mall
in the US to be conceived for a single generation.
In fact, say its developers, The Lab is not really a mall at all; it is more
of an anti-mall. A hotch-potch of broken signs, scaffolding, and a fountain
made of oil drums, the anti-mall's target audience is the so-called
Generation X: 18-30-year-olds.
'If anyone blindfolded you and dropped you in a typical mall across the
country, you would not have any idea where you are,' says The Lab's
developer Shaheen Sadeghi. 'Here, we tried for something different, not the
old fountain-and-marble formula. We tried to put some excitement in
retailing.'
Usual mall mainstays such as Neiman Marcus, The Banana Republic and
Waldenbooks are conspicuously absent. Instead, The Lab offers a comic book
shop called Collectors Library and a florist called Weeds.
So far, The Lab's strategy seems to work. The complex rented out all
available spaces before its opening in March, and retailers say they are
pleased. 'It allows us to reach our target market,' says Rodney Metoyer,
manager of Tower Alternative, a subsidiary of the music store Tower Records.
Tower Alternative, created specifically for The Lab, stocks recordings of
trendy bands such as The Cranberries, Green Day and Nirvana, as well as
unsigned local bands from the area.
The retail store Urban Outfitters forms the anchor for the shopping complex,
and the chain's architect, Pompei AD, designed The Lab. It is Urban
Outfitters' first time in a mall - part of the chain's strategy has been to
locate only in urban areas.
The Lab's architects say the store is meant to mimic dense urban
environments. 'We were looking for the same sort of excitement and energy
you get from being in a hip neighbourhood of a big city,' said Ron Pompei,
principal of Pompei AD 'Imperfections are OK here.'
As a base for the old and crumbling look, The Lab was built in and around
the most ancient structure in the town of Costa Mesa, near Los Angeles - a
military barracks from the 1950s.
Instead of building the complex in a real downtown area, Pompei imported
urban decay for the simple reason that there are very few old downtown areas
in southern California. 'There's no sense of centre here, and we are trying
to fill that void.'
Apart from Urban Outfitters and Tower Alternative, The Lab has no large
chain stores, because Sadeghi believes Generation X opposes the
homogenisation of American culture. Instead of 'food courts', the clusters
of fast food restaurants found in most malls, The Lab dishes up health food
in a coffee house furnished with lumpy sofas.
The Lab also capitalises on Generation X's penchant for good causes. Instead
of car expos and fashion shows, The Lab sponsors special charity events. One
initiative earlier this year, for instance, invited shoppers to buy broken
tiles to decorate walls. Proceeds went to a charity for the homeless.
Sadeghi says the town was sceptical when The Lab first laid out its plans.
'They thought we were going to attract unemployed kids with tattoos,' he
explains. 'But the people who come here are mostly students and young
professionals.' Although The Lab is unabashedly aimed at the young, it has
also attracted older customers. Sadeghi says half its customers are over 30.
The formula may work in southern California, but it is questionable whether
it will be as big a success in other areas of the country, such as the
north-east and north-west of the US, where young trend-setters have
authentic crumbling downtown areas to frequent.
But Sadeghi says he is planning new anti-malls. He is currently eyeing a
deteriorating downtown section of Seattle, Washington, and a suburban area
on the edge of San Diego, south of LA. Once again, Pompei will provide a
pseudo-urban design. The details have not yet been finalised, but one thing
is certain. There won't be a marble fountain in sight.

FT  17 NOV 94 / People: No flies on Merrill Lynch's Owen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The average age of members of Merrill Lynch's London office has taken a dip
this week following the retirement of John Owen, 60, the longest serving
member of London's US stockbroking community.
When Owen joined Merrill's London office in 1961 as a Pounds 1,450-a-year
trainee broker, Merrill had a staff of 10 and was the sort of outfit that
was prepared to challenge the City establishment by advertising its
services. Lord Dundee of the London Stock Exchange gave us a 'very hard
time', says Owen.
Today, Merrill employs around 1,800 people in the City and many of them got
their job because they caught Owen's eye. Owen went trawling for new
recruits long before it became fashionable for stockbroking firms and
merchant banks to do the 'milk round' at universities.
Many still work at Merrill but others who have gone on to greater things
include Richard de Lisle, managing director of equities at Dean Witter,
Geoffrey Bunting, first vice president of Prudential Bache Securities,
Jonathan Laing of JP Morgan Securities, and Richard Spring, the Tory MP.
A former chairman of the Association of New York Stock Exchange Member Firms
in the City, Owen has bumped into most of the big investors during his City
career. There will be plenty of people who still recognise the name of Jim
Slater, the wealthy investor who once ran Slater Walker Securities. But how
many, like Owen, dealt with go-go investors such as Gerry Tsai or Bernie
Cornfeld?
Owen refuses to accept that the City is less fun than it was when he
started. His advice to young stockbrokers is to get an egg-timer. If the
sand has run out and you are still talking, you are not doing your job. His
final tip: never believe a broker who says that it's different this time.
'In my experience it is never different,' says Owen, who plans to use his
retirement to improve his fly fishing.

FT  17 NOV 94 / People: Premier position for Barrie Stephens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER and PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Premier Consolidated Oilfields has come up with a high-profile replacement
for Roland Shaw, the controversial founder of the independent oil and gas
exploration company who was ousted in August.
He is Barrie Stephens, the 66-year-old Welshman who has built Siebe, the
international controls group, into one of the UK's biggest engineering
companies. During his 31 years at Siebe, sales have grown from Pounds 1m to
Pounds 1.86bn and the Windsor-based group now employs 32,000 people
worldwide.
Stephens combined the roles of chairman and chief executive at Siebe until
the begining of this year, and still works three days a week as chairman. He
became a non-executive director of Simon Engineering last year.
Roland Shaw, Premier's colourful founder, was forced out in a boardroom coup
at the age of 72. Shaw, who came to London from Dallas in the 1960s, is well
known in the oil industry for his outspoken views and strong personality.
The archetypal deal-maker, Shaw is widely credited with building up Premier
from scratch to a company that at the peak of the oil market was worth
Pounds 500m, compared with its present value of Pounds 142m. However, his
flamboyant approach sat uneasily with the other members of Premier's board
when conditions in the oil industry were more sober. He was stripped of his
executive position in 1992 and quit as non-executive chairman in August.
Shaw remains chairman of Heritage Oil and Gas.
According to Charles Jamieson, Premier's chief executive, Stephens has
contacts not only in the City, but in the international business community
where Premier is expanding its operations.

FT  17 NOV 94 / People: Morgan finds his password at Zergo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Morgan, former director general of the Institute of Directors, has
added Zergo, an information security company, to his list of non-executive
directorships.
Morgan, 58, will be able to exploit his computer expertise in his new role:
for 30 years he worked for International Business Machines, the world's
largest computer company, before moving to the IoD in 1989 for a period in
office distinguished by trenchant defence of the free market.
Zergo, with a turnover of about Pounds 7m and funded through venture
capital, looks a different kind of story. It is a comparatively new company,
based in Basingstoke, Hampshire. Its managing director is Professor Henry
Becker, a specialist in passwords and encryption technologies.
Its successes include providing security modules to Visa International and
enhanced security systems for the banks' Clearing House Automated Payment
System.
Morgan's role is expected to include overseeing Zergo's eventual move to the
stock market. Despite some jitters about high technology companies in the
light of recent reverses, Morgan should have little difficulty in persuading
the City of Zergo's potential. Information security is foremost in many
minds at present.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Technology: Toyota moves on line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Toyota, the Japanese car maker, is tying up with a cable TV operator to
conduct experiments in high-speed data transmission.
Toyota and Himawari Cable, which operates in the Nagoya area where Toyota is
based, will start experiments this month in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)
high-speed data transmission using Himawari's optic fibre cable. Toyota owns
almost 13 per cent of Himawari, which reaches 90 per cent of households in
Toyota city.
ATM is a technology which enables data to be sent at about 26 times the
speed of systems using conventional telephone lines by sending digital
information in packets.
Speedier data transmission will allow Toyota to improve efficiency in
communications between facilities, the company says. 'We need to send huge
amounts of information, such as vehicle designs,' Toyota explains.
The company, which is also a shareholder in IDO, the cellular phone maker,
and in Teleway Japan, a long-distance carrier, hopes to expand the network
to affiliated companies in the auto industry by the end of 1996.
If Toyota succeeds in linking its separate facilities with each other and
with suppliers, the lead in efficiency the company already commands over
many auto manufacturers is likely to widen even further.
Toyota is one of the more forward-looking in its approach to advanced
computer and tele-communications technologies among Japanese companies,
which have generally been slow to adopt high technology in the office.
Japan's largest car company has also been quick to make use of computer
on-line services, for example. It has built an on-line forum on the Prodigy
computer network in the US through which it provides Toyota owners with
information on everything from insurance to future models and accessories.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Technology: How the Japanese measure up - A look at a new
database of body sizes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A band of British MPs visiting Japanese schools recently were surprised that
the children's body frames were far larger than they had expected. 'There
were a few as big as me,' said one after a day at a school in central Tokyo.
Japanese children are becoming generally taller and bigger than previous
generations. Changes to the normal diet, now containing more meat and dairy
products rather than fish and vegetables, and a more westernised lifestyle -
using chairs rather than sitting on tatami-matted floors, for instance - are
reckoned to have contributed to the modern Japanese physique.
Such changes have also started to affect industrial manufacturers. Calls
from companies for more accurate data on the growing sizes of the Japanese
have prompted the government to compile statistics in order to capture the
changes. A comprehensive survey of physical sizes was initiated at the start
of last year for the first time since 1978.
After two years of gathering data, the Research Institute of Human
Engineering for Quality Life (HLQ), an organisation affiliated to the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti), started marketing its
database last year.
The institute gathered data from 35,000 people between the ages of seven and
70. A measuring machine equipped with laser beams captured three-dimensional
images of the bodies, with measurements provided for every three
millimetres.
The institute has received more than 400 queries and has now sold 95
database packages. The statistics are expected to help manufacturers save on
product sizes and reduce risk of accumulating unwanted stock. Clothing
makers, consumer electronics and automobile companies are among the
purchasers.
The washing machine division of Matsushita Electronic Industries, the
leading consumer electronics company, has used the institute's data on arm
length, while Nissan Motor says it bought the data to determine seat size
and the amount of room between the head and the car roof.
Toto, the lavatory maker, says the data confirmed that Japanese toilets did
not need to be altered as bottom sizes were not changing drastically.
Goldwin, a sportswear maker, added a new size for shorter, plumper
middle-aged women on to its mountain climbing gear line after buying the
data, while a spectacles manufacturer was surprised that head sizes of
primary school children were getting larger than expected, and increased the
number of spectacle sizes for children.
Yoji Fukuda, head of technology development at HLQ, says the institute spent
Y500m (Pounds 3m) on the project. The database provides data of 178 body
parts, from the thickness of the hand to the distance between the eyes.
According to the data, females in their 40s were 2.7cm taller than 15 years
ago; males in the same age group were 3.5cm higher. Women in their 20s were
2.2cm taller; bust and waist measurements were larger by 1cm.
The statistics also show that the Japanese foot has become narrower, but
indicate that Japanese still have shorter, lower legs and upper arms
compared with Caucasians.
Miti is currently reviewing the Japan Industrial Standards - national size
and format standards for industrial products - based on the data.
It is comparing the differences with the standard sizes set in 1980 and is
expected to revise the national standards in 1996.
Fees for the database, available on floppy discs or paper, depend on the
menu required. A basic package covering 1,000 people costs around Y180,000,
while small and medium-sized companies are eligible for discounts.
A ski-boot maker, for instance, buying foot measurements of 10 categories
could pay between Y380,000 and Y1.3m.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Technology: Electronic immunity - Tom Foremski outlines the
similarities between computer viruses and their biological counterparts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The similarities between computer viruses and human ones may be closer than
the name alone suggests, according to computer scientists at IBM's Thomas J.
Watson Research Centre.
IBM researchers have discovered similarities in the way computer viruses
spread and the way human viruses jump from host to host. This has led them
to develop anti-virus technology that continues the biological metaphor -
using a model of the human immune system to develop a way of automatically
trapping and eradicating computer viruses before they can damage the host
personal computer and spread to other computers.
The IBM Automated Immune System is an electronic version of our human immune
system and could provide a breakthrough in the fight against computer virus
infections. There are at least 6,000 computer viruses and computer security
experts say they are discovering as many as three new viruses a day.
A computer virus is a hidden program that can replicate itself, and
sometimes causes widespread damage to data stored in the computer. While few
of these rogue programs reach widespread distribution, computer viruses pose
a daily threat to PC users.
'The Automated Immune System allows us to detect a virus without having any
prior knowledge about it,' says Jeffrey Kephart, manager of anti-virus
technology at IBM's High Integrity Computing Laboratory at the Thomas J.
Watson Research Centre. 'Once the virus has been detected, the system
automatically analyses it and removes it from any infected files.'
This approach differs from the way most current anti-virus software
operates. Anti-virus applications, such as VirusScan from McAfee Associates,
are at their most effective against known viruses and must be updated
regularly with the 'signatures' of new viruses.
Kephart says the system is modelled on the way the human immune system
protects us against viral infection. In the IBM approach, the anti-virus
software uses a decoy program to attract a virus if one is present.
The software can detect an infection by noticing changes made by the virus
in the decoy program. It will then isolate and analyse the virus, and erase
it from any infected files it finds. In the human immune system, a cell
called a macrophage searches for infecting organisms. When the macrophage
finds a virus or bacteria, it makes an analysis and then alerts other immune
cells to the specific infecting organism, triggering the production of
antibodies that target specific infections.
The IBM system has an additional capability. It helps stop the spread of
virus infections to other computers. This is essential in today's high-speed
networks because a virus can quickly spread. The system sends out a message
to neighbouring PCs that it has found an infection and instructs them to
look for a specific virus. In this way, the path of a computer virus
infection can be traced and contained.
The IBM Automated Immune System is in the prototype stage and will be
introduced into IBM's commercial anti-virus software next year. While it
appears to be an important step against infections, it will not eliminate
computer viruses. 'There are some sophisticated viruses being written,' says
Bill Arnold, an anti-virus specialist at IBM. 'These viruses are written by
people who know how we detect and analyse viruses. One such virus is the 1/2
virus which breaks itself into pieces to make itself more difficult to
analyse.'
Computer virus creators have developed what are called stealth and
polymorphic viruses. A stealth virus hides inside a PC and makes itself
invisible to anti-virus software. A polymorphic virus will change itself
slightly every time it infects a PC or a file, making it difficult to
analyse or create a 'signature' that can be used to detect infections.
Phil Talsky, manager of product marketing at McAfee Associates, says it is
risky to do nothing when a virus is detected, even if it does not appear to
be causing problems. 'The trouble is that you can never really know what the
virus will do and you risk a much bigger problem at a later date,' says
Talsky.
Although there are increasing numbers of sophisticated computer viruses, PC
users should not panic, says David Stang, computer virus expert and
president of anti-virus software firm Norman Data Defence Systems. 'The
chance of being infected is very low,' says Stang. 'But if you do have an
infection, it can be very expensive.' Stang cites the case of a brokerage
firm forced to shut down its PCs to clean out a virus infection and lost
millions of dollars in business during the few hours the PCs were turned
off.
Magali Grimany, information security analyst at Suntrust Bank, based in
Atlanta, Georgia, says that a virus infection closed down one of the bank's
servers affecting dozens of PC users for most of the day. Suntrust now uses
McAfee's VirusScan package to protect more than 8,000 PCs.
McAfee and other firms such as Symantec are trying to make the updating
process easier with new software that will automatically update. Suntrust
and other large organisations also prohibit staff from bringing in diskettes
from home or inserting diskettes into their PCs that have not been scanned
for viruses.
Creating a computer virus is not that difficult and is not illegal, says
Stang, which is why there are so many. 'You can buy a CD-Rom disk containing
hundreds of viruses and you can down-load software for creating viruses from
computer bulletin boards,' he points out.
Kephart is not the only one to note the analogy between computer viruses and
their biological counterparts. The British physicist Stephen Hawking gave
the keynote speech at a computer show earlier this year. He found it ironic
that the only form of 'life' we have created so far is purely destructive.

FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Contentious clauses may evade debate -
Pensions reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's intention to introduce sweeping legislation to bring sex
equality into state pensions and 'security, equality and choice' into
occupational and personal pensions was announced in a single sentence.
But the bill is likely to be one of the biggest introduced into parliament
in recent years. The pensions industry expects it to include up to 140
clauses and to take until next autumn to become law.
Industry officials are saying that some of the most contentious parts of the
legislation - setting out how it is to be applied - may not be debated
during the bill's passage through parliament, but instead be covered by
secondary legislation, regulations from the Department of Social Security or
'guidance notes' from the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, a
non-governmental professional body.
Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the Commons social security committee,
expressed concern yesterday that some crucial provisions, such as minimum
solvency, would not be subject to political debate. Mr Field said the
government could issue statutory instruments in advance so that MPs could
know exactly how it intended to apply vague provisions of the legislation.
In particular, the bill may not include the specifics of a new 'minimum
solvency requirement' which will require pension schemes to have enough
assets to pay accrued pension benefits if they are wound up immediately. How
the value of those assets is to be calculated is the subject of acrimonious
debate, with employers saying the plans will impose significant costs on
schemes.
Actuaries are questioning whether a lower-cost alternative being considered
will go far enough to offer the security recommended by the government's
advisory body, the Pension Law Review Committee.
Ms Penny Webster, partner at consulting actuaries Bacon and Woodrow, said:
'My concern is that, depending on what solution is adopted, it could be
misleading.'
The main points of the legislation are:
To raise the age at which women are eligible to receive state pension
payments to 65 to match that of men.
To give effect in domestic legislation to recent rulings from the European
Court of Justice requiring employers to offer equal pension benefits to men
and women.
To simplify arrangements for contracting out of the State Earnings Related
Pension Scheme, including abolishing the alternative Guaranteed Minimum
Pension. Instead, employers will have to demonstrate that they offer
benefits broadly equal to those obtainable under Serps to be eligible to
receive rebates of National Insurance contributions.
To require all occupational and personal pensions to pay benefits which rise
in value each year by at least 5 per cent or the retail prices index,
whichever is lower.
To introduce age-related rebates of National Insurance contributions for
those with personal pensions or who are members of employer-sponsored
Contracted Out Money Purchase Schemes.
This is intended to discourage those who opt out at a young age, when the
value of the flat-rate rebate is highest, from going back in when they are
older.
To give greater flexibility in converting pension investments into
annuities. This could help those who retire when interest rates are in a
trough - they would otherwise have to buy annuities at the top of the
market, earning lower retirement benefits.
To put in place the recommendations of the white paper on occupational
pension reform. This includes the controversial minimum solvency standard as
well as an equally controversial proposal requiring companies to have
member-elected trustees.

FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: European bill to be given top priority -
Parliamentary timetable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government plans to confront its critics - both internal and external -
over the next few weeks by giving parliamentary priority to its European
finance and Jobseeker's Allowance bills.
Senior ministers said the two bills would be introduced quickly in the
Commons, with a third controversial bill to remove a layer of administration
from the National Health Service.
The European bill, which will increase UK contributions to the European
Union, will provide the main battleground between the parties, not least
because of the government's threat to call a general election if it is
amended or defeated.
The bill on the Jobseeker's Allowance, which replaces unemployment benefit,
will face tough opposition from the Labour party, which says that it will
strip 90,000 people of benefits and force means testing on a further
150,000.
The NHS proposals are also guaranteed a stormy passage through parliament
because of strong Labour opposition to the prospect of substantial job
losses and claims that the reforms will damage patient care.
Much of the remainder of the government's programme will be given a fair
wind by the opposition parties, including the bills to reform discipline in
the medical profession and set up a review body to investigate miscarriages
of justice.
The parliamentary business managers have chosen to start two uncontroversial
bills - reforming agricultural land tenure and the Scottish criminal justice
system - in the Lords, where a series of important bills were mauled in the
last session.
The government has yet to work out a timetable for other bills which are
likely to prompt criticism from MPs and peers of all parties. These include:
A hybrid bill to authorise the construction of a high-speed rail link from
London to the Channel tunnel, which will allow opponents of the scheme from
Kent and east London to petition parliament.
A bill to tackle discrimination against the disabled. The bill is unlikely
to satisfy campaigners, who are still angry about the way that Conservative
whips killed a more comprehensive private member's bill in the summer.
Many Conservative MPs and peers were privately sympathetic to the earlier
bill, and the opposition parties may attempt to embarrass the government by
tabling a second private bill, possibly in the Lords.

FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Moves on bias set to anger activists -
Disabled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government attempts to tackle discrimination against disabled people are
likely to inflame rather than satisfy campaigners.
A bill is to be introduced reflecting proposals in 'Disability - On The
Agenda', a government consultation document published in July. This was
produced after a furore in May, when the government blocked a private
member's bill from Mr Roger Berry, a Labour MP, designed to outlaw
discrimination against disabled people.
The consultation document concentrated on employment, access to goods and
services, financial services, building regulations and the establishment of
a new advisory body.
Disability activists regard the document's proposals as inadequate and will
take the same view of a bill based on them.
They are concerned that important areas such as transport and education are
likely to be excluded from the bill's scope, while the suggested new
advisory body would lack legal enforcement powers of bodies such as the
Commission for Racial Equality and the Equal Opportunities Commission.
The government could run into parliamentary pressure to strengthen its bill
if a survey of MPs by the charity Scope - formerly the Spastics Society -
proves correct. This suggests that 25 per cent of Conservative MPs believe
Mr Berry's stronger proposals should be implemented, with 71 per cent of
Conservatives saying they support them in principle but were concerned that
the costs would be too high.
In its opposition to Mr Berry's bill the government costed the extension of
disabled people's rights at Pounds 17bn plus a recurring Pounds 1bn a year.
Disability campaigners say such estimates are unrealistically high.
Lord Ashley, co-chairman of the all-party parliamentary disablement group,
said yesterday that he intended to introduce his own bill in the Lords. The
government's proposals were 'belated, limited and inadequate', he said.
Radar - the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation - said the
consultation document's proposals on which the bill would be based were half
measures. Radar added: 'They will not ensure that disabled people have
equality of opportunity in all aspects of their lives, nor will they give
disabled people the right to legal redress against unfair discrimination.'
Campaigners in the UK are encouraged by an apparent change of attitude
towards the wide-ranging Americans With Disabilities Act in the US.
Although the act was originally opposed by employers because of similar cost
concerns to those advanced in the UK, there is now evidence of greater
acceptance and support. The disability lobby in the UK, however, does not
have the political strength of its US counterpart. Public alarm about
murders and other violent offences committed by people with serious mental
disorders has prompted tighter controls in a mental health bill.
The bill will introduce new powers of supervised discharge from hospital,
and extend from six months to 12 months the period during which released
patients can be recalled.
Mental health charities will oppose the proposals. They say that
better-funded community care is required, rather than changes in the law
that will stigmatise mentally ill people.

FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Critics fear effect of streamlining
proposals - National Health Service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Organisational change started by the government's 1991 reforms to the
National Health Service will continue with the abolition of health
authorities in their present form.
England's eight surviving regional health authorities will be abolished by
the health authorities bill.
The authorities will be replaced by regional offices of the NHS executive,
which is responsible for the daily running of the service. Although the aim
is to streamline the central structure now that patient services are managed
locally, critics fear the end of regional authorities may increase
accountability problems.
The bill will create about 100 multipurpose local health authorities in
England. These will replace the existing 111 district health authorities -
responsible for purchasing hospital and community services - and 92 family
health service authorities, which handle the family doctor service. The
authorities already work closely together in many parts of the country.
Ministers say the cut in the number of regional authorities and other
administrative changes have already saved Pounds 30m, and they expect
further substantial management savings.
The government intends to tighten sanctions on doctors who underperform with
the medical act (amendment) bill. At present the General Medical Council,
the profession's disciplinary body, can take action only if doctors are
guilty of serious professional misconduct. The bill will extend its
disciplinary powers to those whose performance is consistently poor.

FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Early move on monopoly welcomed - Gas
deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Independent gas companies hoping to enter the lucrative market for supplying
Britain's 18m households were relieved to see that legislation for removing
British Gas's mono-poly will be introduced soon.
The shape of that legislation will be crucial in determining how many
companies participate in the domestic market, where many have pledged to cut
bills by 10 per cent.
One of the most important tasks of the legislation will be to spell out the
transitional arrangements and a timetable for bringing the industry into
full competition by 1998.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, has signalled that the market will be opened
up in stages with an area - possibly the size of a county with 500,000
inhabitants - set up as a pilot project in April 1996. After that would
follow a larger pilot involving 2m people in 1997.
But most companies are looking to the onset of full competition a year
later, when they will be able to compete on a national scale with British
Gas. They want government legislation to contain a clear date for opening up
the market to avoid gas deregulation being put off, especially after the
next general election.
Mr Peter Bryant, chairman of Utilicorp UK, an offshoot of the big US gas
company, said: 'Companies need to make substantial investments to go into
the household market, and uncertainty over when it will be opened up has
hung over the industry for too long.'
He reckons it takes at least Pounds 10m to set up the sort of infrastructure
required for becoming a significant operator in the household supply market.
This covers spending on computer systems, trained personnel and facilities
for customers to pay their bills, before the price of securing supply from
gas fields is considered.
But the amount of investment required to enter the domestic market will
depend very much on the regulatory requirements imposed on operators in
return for a licence to supply households. British Gas is keen to see its
rivals forced to meet the same social obligations as are now imposed on its
monopoly business.
Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, said: 'For everyone to
share the benefits of competition it is essential that all entrants to the
market share the obligations as well as the rewards.'
The legislation should determine how onerous these social obligations will
be. Generally it will involve independents setting up special provisions to
cope with customers who have difficulty paying bills. It should also set
rules on disconnections, care of older and disabled customers and advice on
energy efficiency.
If the regulatory requirements were very stringent they could deter some
operators from entering the market. Mr Norman Ellis, managing director of
Kinetica, a joint venture between PowerGen and oil company Conoco, said: 'We
have to convince our shareholders that there is at least some margin and
benefit in going into the domestic market.'
This is why some players favour deliberate vagueness on social obligations,
preferring to give the regulator discretion to change service standards as
the market develops.
Intense competition in the business gas supply market has already eroded
margins to the point where British Gas is not much interested in trying to
win back its lost market share.
Competition will also be tough in the household market, with a shake-out
expected in the next couple of years.
Mr Bryant believes that only half of the present 30 to 40 operators in the
business market will survive in a deregulated domestic market.
The forthcoming legislation will have to set down rules governing the use of
the pipeline system, which British Gas will continue to run, as well as
giving new powers to the regulator to police pipeline operations.

FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Climbdown on full-blown sale - Crown
Agents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Crown Agents, the government agency responsible for financial,
professional and procurement services in developing countries, is to be
moved into the private sector.
The measure, announced in the Queen's Speech, marks a climbdown from
original plans for full-blown privatisation. Instead, the agency will be
transferred to an independent foundation, limited by guarantee, and with no
government representatives on the board.
Managers of the agency, which plays an important role in implementing the
Overseas Development Administration's bilateral aid programme, welcomed the
move. They believe it will create greater accountability and prove to
clients that it is independent of government pressure to 'buy British'.
The move is not intended to raise money, although it is possible a small
amount will be raised from the repayment of debts owed by the Crown Agents
to the government.
The agency has made payments of about Pounds 20m in capital and interest
since it was established in its present form in 1979, but last year made a
profit of only Pounds 244,000.
The agency employs 800 staff with offices in 38 countries and an annual
turnover of about Pounds 250m, making it one of the world's biggest
purchasing organisations. It receives no regular subsidy and less than 30
per cent of its income is generated from the UK.
Its new structure is similar to that of the Wellcome Foundation, the health
insurance groups PPP and Bupa, the AA and RAC motoring organisations and the
British Standards Institute.
The board will include members who reflect 'the international character of
the agency's work', as well as representatives of aid agencies and the
commercial sector.
The agency's profits will not be distributed but will be reinvested in its
work, which it says has a 'social purpose'.

FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Nuclear division wants sale in 1996 -
Privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AEA Technology, whose forthcoming privatisation was confirmed by the
government yesterday, hopes a sale will be made after the financial year
ending March 1996.
The company wants to build a track record following its separation last year
from other divisions at the UK Atomic Energy Authority, whose
responsibilities include overseeing decommissioning and safe handling of
nuclear liabilities.
AEA Technology is a science and engineering business which sells technical,
safety and environmental services and products to industries and governments
throughout the world. It is thought to be worth at least Pounds 200m, has an
annual turnover of Pounds 250m and expects profits this year of Pounds 10m
compared with Pounds 5m last year. The company employs 4,000 people and sees
no likelihood of this declining.
Growth areas include over-seas work, where turnover increased by 40 per cent
last year and is expected to grow this year to about Pounds 60m.
This year is also expected to see a 50 per cent growth in private-sector
business in the UK.

FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Pollution agency wins approval -
Environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-awaited Environment Agency to regulate pollution has finally won
the go-ahead with the inclusion of the environment agencies bill in the
Queen's Speech yesterday.
The agency, seen by ministers as a 'one-stop shop' for pollution regulation,
will merge Her Majesty's Pollution Inspectorate, the National Rivers
Authority and the waste regulation functions of local authorities. Mr John
Gummer, environment secretary, has said the integration will result in a
leaner, fitter, 'more together' regulator.
The government also made clear yesterday that it was determined to push
ahead with controversial schemes to raise the proportion of waste packaging
which is recovered or recycled. Further legislation to encourage
industry-led recycling programmes could follow, it said.
Manufacturers and retailers have been concerned that increasing the amount
of recycling, a UK obligation under the European Union packaging directive,
could add Pounds 100m to costs at some point along the chain between
production and point of sale, and would increase the cost of the weekly
shopping basket.
The environment agencies bill will also establish a Scottish Environment
Protection Agency and include measures to set up new independent authorities
for the 10 national parks in England and Wales.
Environmental pressure groups yesterday greeted the announcement warily.
Many, such as Greenpeace, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and
Friends of the Earth, have criticised the proposals on the grounds that the
new agency would be too soft on industry.
Friends of the Earth said yesterday that after the creation of the agency it
would be less easy to pursue court cases against the government. At present
ministers have a 'duty to further nature conservation', but the draft bill
says instead that they must 'have regard to the desirability of conserving
and enhancing natural beauty', the group said.
Debate on the structure of the bill has also provoked argument between the
present pollution regulators. Officials from the pollution inspectorate and
local authorities have been concerned that the agency would be dominated by
the NRA, which employs thousands of people to monitor the state of rivers,
separate from its regulatory role.

FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Major pledges a boost from 'meaty
measures'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major, the prime minister, forecast yesterday that inward investment
would 'continue to flood in' to Britain as the containment of inflation
remained a central objective of government policy.
Outlining the legislative programme for the new parliamentary session in the
Commons, he suggested that the significance of the 'vote of confidence by
foreign investors in the British economy' had not been fully appreciated.
He again underlined the importance of holding to the maintenance of low
inflation as a long-term objective.
Mr Major said: 'For the first time we may be in a position where we have
broken the inflation psychology which has damaged this country time and time
again since the war.'
He flatly rejected the charge made by Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, that
the lack of substance in the Queen's Speech showed that the government was
'out of touch and out of steam'.
The prime minister insisted that the 'meaty measures' which the government
intended to introduce would provide a further boost to the economy.
These included the bill authorising the construction and operation by the
private sector of a high-speed rail link between London and the Channel
tunnel. Mr Major said this was likely to create between 10,000 and 15,000
jobs.
Mr Major ignored Labour taunts about the absence of a measure to privatise
the Post Office as he told MPs that the government intended to 'proceed with
privatisation'. This would be achieved with the bills to privatise the Crown
Agents, which played a significant role in delivering the overseas aid
programme, and by the measure promoting competition in the gas industry.
Mr Major suggested that Labour MPs would find it difficult to oppose the
legislation providing for the equalisation of the retirement age for men and
women at 65.
He recalled that this approach had been recognised as reasonable by the
Commission on Social Justice appointed by John Smith, the late Labour
leader.
Mr Blair said that the Queen's Speech reflected the central quandary facing
the Conservative party - 'whether to praise Thatcherism or to bury it'.
It was four years since the departure of Mrs Thatcher and the issue was
still unresolved, with the result that dogma was being tempered by
dithering.
Mr Blair said that the 'politics of the 1980s' had run their course, and
that the concerns and needs of the British people had changed: 'It is the
Labour party that speaks for them.'
He said the British people wanted a new economic approach based on
partnership between the public and private sectors, and management and
employees which gave businesses and families the stability to plan for their
future.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said ordinary people had taken a
severe battering from the government over the past five years.
They had suffered from lost jobs, threatened homes, cuts in services,
burgeoning crime and swingeing increases in taxes.
Mr Ashdown said: 'If now the economy is improving then people can be
expected to feel relieved. But it is a bit much for the prime minister to
ask them to feel grateful.'
Mr Ashdown accused Mr Major of always reacting behind events, never ahead of
them. 'He is driven to action by a small group of backbenchers here or a
collection of newspaper reports there.
'It seems the prime minister's chief calculation is not what is right or
what is wrong - but what he can get past his divided and waring party.'
Mr Michael Spicer, Tory MP for Worcestershire South and a leading
Eurosceptic, indicated that he was unlikely to vote against the bill
authorising an increase in UK payments to the European Union.
He said that the Conservative party needed to unite behind a radical
programme for securing fundamental changes in the Common Agricultural Policy
and other areas rather than 'worrying about a particular measure'.
The six-day debate was adjourned until today.

FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Ministers plan body to probe miscarriage
of justice claims - Legal reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has bowed to growing pressure from senior judges by including
in the Queen's Speech a bill to establish an independent body to investigate
alleged miscarriages of justice.
The Criminal Cases Review Authority was first recommended by last year's
report of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice after a damaging series
of wrongful convictions dented public confidence in the criminal courts.
Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, and other senior legal figures pushed
for its early introduction after the government failed to include it in this
year's Criminal Justice Act.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, indicated earlier this year that the
government was committed to introducing the authority, but only when
parliamentary time permitted.
The criminal appeal bill will not be published until later in the
parliamentary session, to allow time to secure cross-party agreement on
outstanding issues.
The bill will reform the powers of the Court of Appeal by clarifying the
grounds for allowing a criminal appeal and making new provisions for
retrials and the acceptance of fresh evidence.
At present the Home Office reviews about 700 cases a year, with the home
secretary referring about 10 to the Court of Appeal. Between 1988 and March
last year the government paid Pounds 3.4m in compensation and ex gratia
payments to 70 people who had been wrongfully convicted.
The new authority will act as a body of last resort after normal avenues of
appeal have been exhausted, and will refer cases back to the Court of Appeal
where appropriate without any recommendation.
It will have no investigative powers of its own but will be able to
institute inquiries, obtain access to relevant information and commission
police investigations.
There will be no right of appeal to another body against its decisions, but
they will be open to judicial review by the High Court. The bill will set
out the criteria for referral to the courts on the basis that there should
be some new matter for them to consider.
The authority, which will operate in England, Wales and Northern Ireland,
will also take on responsibility for investigating wrongful convictions and
inappropriate sentences in magistrates' courts.
Leaders of the legal profession welcomed the bill's inclusion in the Queen's
Speech. Mr Robert Seabrook QC, chairman of the Bar, said it provided 'a
much-needed signal of the government's commitment to restoring confidence in
the criminal justice system'.

FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Lacklustre clash of leaders proves
narrow win for Blair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, yesterday scored a narrow victory in his
first full-scale Commons clash with Mr John Major, the prime minister.
In a lacklustre debate on the Queen's Speech, Mr Blair successfully fought
off an ambush by backbench Conservative MPs who sought to undermine his
first Commons speech as leader by repeatedly interrupting him.
The Tory tactics backfired as Mr Blair dealt with the interruptions in the
style of a headmaster accepting and dismissing a series of cheeky questions
from the less intelligent members of the fourth form.
Even the prime minister allowed himself a smile as Mr Blair joked that Mr
Bob Dunn, a Tory backbencher who had admitted regularly ignoring the advice
of experts, was unlucky not to have made it to the cabinet.
Mr Blair focused his attack on the Conservative record on taxation and the
economy, prompting irritable interventions from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, and Mr Norman Lamont, his predecessor.
Mr Blair ridiculed Mr Major's decision to drop Post Office privatisation in
the face of opposition from a handful of rebels.
It was not in the legislative programme because 10 Tory rebels had opposed
what was supported by 340 other Tory MPs, including the prime minister. He
called for the Post Office to be 'liberated within the public sector'.
Mr Blair derided as an empty gesture Mr Major's threat to call a general
election if the European contributions bill is defeated.
Mr Blair said the Queen's Speech showed that the government was 'out of
touch and out of steam'. The cabinet was 'so riven by factions, buffeted by
one day's headlines to the next, that it cannot address the interests of the
country'.
But, in a speech widely regarded as lacking inspiration, Mr Blair failed to
tempt an intervention from the prime minister, or to deflect Mr Major from
the main body of his prepared speech, which focused largely on Northern
Ireland and Europe.
Mr Major, unwisely tempted by the witty opening to Mr Blair's speech,
attempted several jokes, all of which fell flat. But he was on surer ground
with an attack on the opposition leader's claim to have transformed Labour.
Disparaging the 'new Labour' tag developed by Mr Blair, the prime minister
claimed that eight shadow cabinet members remained committed to unilateral
nuclear disarmament, giving a fresh meaning to the phrase 'brothers in
arms'.

FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Government to take advantage of thin
legislative programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to take advantage of its relatively thin legislative
programme to introduce several uncontroversial but overdue measures of law
reform, Robert Rice writes.
It hopes to make use of a new parliamentary procedure for uncontroversial
law reform known as the 'Jellicoe procedure' to bring in five bills based on
reports by the Law Commission, the government's law reform body.
The procedure, named after the Lords select committee which recommended it,
was used earlier this year to pass the Law of Property (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act 1994.
It involves the use in the Lords of a special public bill committee which
has powers to receive evidence on a bill from interested parties before
considering it clause by clause, so speeding its passage.
The government's recent record on implementing reforms recommended by the
commission is poor. More than half the 40-plus reports produced by the
commission since 1984 remain under consideration or have not been
implemented.
Among the five bills is a private international law bill which would modify
and clarify the rules on the payment in England and Wales of interest on
judgment debts and arbitration awards which are expressed in foreign
currency, and the rules by which UK courts decide which country's laws
should apply in a civil negligence cases with a foreign element.
There will also be a civil evidence bill to abolish the hearsay rule, which
prevents witnesses giving evidence second-hand in civil trials.
The rule frequently results in increased costs and delays and can result in
relevant evidence being excluded altogether where witnesses cannot attend
court.
The other bills will reform domestic violence laws and aspects of the law on
wills.

Legislation to reform agricultural tenancy laws in England and Wales has
been broadly welcomed by farming groups for its provisions to free up land
for young farmers and new entrants to farming.
The legislation will reintroduce freely-negotiated tenancies between farmer

The government's legislation to introduce a six-month Jobseeker's Allowance
as a replacement for unemployment benefit and income support in April 1996
can expect strong opposition from the unemployment lobby.
Mr Paul Convery, head of the independent Unemployment Unit, said yesterday
that his organisation would be pressing a range of reasoned amendments to
the bill when It reached the committee stage.
The measure is expected in the Commons before the Christmas recess.
Ms Harriet Harman, shadow employment secretary, said yesterday that the
Jobseeker's Allowance would 'not help a single person back into work'.

The law in Scotland regarding children will be comprehensively updated by
the children (Scotland) bill, the biggest piece of children's legislation
for more than 20 years.
The bill will incorporate lessons learnt in the Orkney child sex abuse
affair. It will set more exacting criteria to be met before children are
taken into care in emergencies. These will include a new 'exclusion order'
under which a suspected abuser can be banned from a child's home.
There will also be a 'statement of parental responsibilities' outlining what
is expected of parents in raising their children.

<TEXT>
The criminal justice bill for Scotland will include measures to increase
penalties for people who commit crimes while on bail and make it difficult
or impossible for people convicted of serious offences such as murder or
rape to get bail when charged with a similar offence, James Buxton writes.
The bill will also streamline court procedures in an attempt to reduce the
number of trials adjourned or cancelled at the last minute. Scotland's
unique 'fiscal fine' - a fixed penalty fine similar to a parking ticket -
will be extended to deal with a wider range of minor offences.
The appeal system will be amended so that two judges instead of three will
preside over many appeals against sentences.

FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Tough fight beyond the glitz of a royal
occasion - Forget the Queen's Speech, says Philip Stephens. John Major must
now restore the government's reputation for competence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forget the Queen's Speech. Mr John Major's political fortunes over the next
year will not depend on the agricultural tenancies bill or on his plans to
abolish regional health authorities. Nor for that matter will they hang on
the gap in the legislative programme left by the decision to scrap
privatisation of the Post Office.
The government, still languishing in the opinion polls, enmeshed in charges
of 'sleaze' and unable to demonstrate grip or sense of purpose for more than
brief periods, has a bigger task. As it enters the second half of this
parliament it must restore the reputation for competence which has so sorely
eluded it since sterling's ignominious exit from the European Monetary
System two years ago.
The strength and durability of the economic recovery, the prospects for
pre-election tax cuts, tranquillity or otherwise in the classrooms, and the
future of the welfare state are the sort of things that preoccupy the
electorate. If peace in Northern Ireland turns from a fragile promise into a
reality, Mr Major's achievement could yet change the political climate.
We will hear no great debates on the Clapham omnibus about whether the bills
which form the core of the legislative programme mark a victory for the
cabinet's consolidators or for its radicals. Arguments about the
government's lack of Thatcherite edge belong to the rarefied atmosphere of
Westminster, not to the real world.
Here we must enter a caveat. There is one piece of legislation that must be
passed. And the capacity of the Conservative party to shoot itself in the
head can never be discounted. The bill to implement the increased funding of
the European Union agreed at the 1992 Edinburgh summit is threatening
another convulsion on the Tory backbenches.
Mr Major had no choice other than to make it an issue of confidence in his
government. After the agonies over the Maastricht Treaty the cabinet is
agreed that appeasement will never satisfy the anti-Europeans.
It is always possible, just possible, that there are enough nihilists among
the irreconcilables to bring down the government. But the odds
overwhelmingly are that the bill will be passed.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, wants the key second reading debate to be
held the day before his November 29 Budget. The more rational Eurosceptics
on the backbenches see little point in handing to Mr Tony Blair Britain's
negotiating mandate at the far more important 1996 intergovernmental
conference. Outspoken critics of Brussels among the younger generation - Mr
Bernard Jenkin is a good example - have anyway been unwilling in the past to
match dark words with action.
The rest of the programme is not without substance. Gas deregulation will
complete the unfinished business of the 1980s privatisation programme.
Equalisation of the pensions age at 65 and tighter regulation of pension
funds is relatively uncontroversial. The Jobseeker's Allowance may mark the
beginning of a new, cross-party consensus on the structure of benefits. No
one will quarrel with the creation of an environmental protection agency or
with the principle, at least, behind the government's belated promise to do
something to end discrimination against the disabled.
Mr Major's mistake has been not to make a virtue out of a more commonsense
approach to legislation. Like many in his administration he is a prisoner of
the idea that good government defines itself through permanent legislative
revolution. The then Mrs Margaret Thatcher thought the same when she
introduced the ill-fated poll tax. On the centre-left of the party Mr Clarke
shares the Maoist instincts more commonly associated with the Tory right.
The prime minister has been mesmerised by the anger of the right over the
Post Office. So his aides spent much of yesterday assuring journalists that
his administration had not run out of steam.
As Mr Blair remarked during a competent - if less than spectacular - debut
as party leader in a set piece Commons debate, the Conservative party is
still undecided whether to praise or to bury the memory of Mr Major's
predecessor.
As he enters the second half of the parliament Mr Major must make that
choice. All precedents suggest it will be impossible for the government to
recover its position before an election due at latest in mid-1997. It may be
that the right of the Tory party has simply become ungovernable. The rebels
may fall into line over Europe this time only to pick a bigger fight in
1996.
But no one, least of all Mr Blair, is sure that the game is lost for Mr
Major. The mood of the country over the next 12 months should provide the
answer. Yesterday's batch of statistics confirmed that the economy is on the
government's side. Mr Clarke will not unveil tax cuts in the Budget, but the
profile of public borrowing should leave them within reach this side of a
1997 election.
If all this translates into a significant improvement in the polls the
government has a chance. If it does not then the Conservative party will be
unable to escape the fate of its leader.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Forsyth trial put on hold
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Elizabeth Forsyth, a close associate of Mr Asil Nadir, cannot be put on
trial until the Swiss authorities have sent evidence to Britain, London's
Bow Street magistrates were told yesterday.
Prosecution solicitor Mr Peter Kiernan said the Serious Fraud Office hoped
to have its requirements before Christmas. It was planned that Mrs Forsyth's
case would then be transferred to a crown court.
Mrs Forsyth chaired South Audley Management, the company that dealt with the
personal tax and property affairs of Mr Nadir, chairman of the
fruit-to-electronics company Polly Peck International.
Mrs Forsyth successfully applied through her solicitor, Mr Peter Krivinskas,
for reporting restrictions on the proceedings to be lifted. He said such an
application was unusual.
Presiding magistrate Mr John Holland said he had been advised that he had no
discretion in the matter and had to grant the order.
Adjourning the case until December 29, he told Mrs Forsyth her Pounds 20,000
bail would continue.
Mr Nadir, who jumped bail of Pounds 3.5m last year and fled to northern
Cyprus, faces charges of theft and false accounting involving Pounds 30m.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Lloyd's may face fresh Pounds 1bn claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest group of Lloyd's of London members to launch legal proceedings in
an attempt to win compensation for losses yesterday said their total claims
could exceed Pounds 1bn.
The Sturge Names Action Group, which represents more than 3,000 Names -
individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the insurance market -
said it hoped to raise about Pounds 5m from members for its fighting fund
and to begin issuing writs in January.
Syndicates run by Sturge managing agents were among the worst-affected by
Lloyd's recent problems, including heavy US asbestosis and pollution claims.
But the action group acknowledged that the pool of funds available to meet
damages won by any Lloyd's Name was limited and could be exhausted by cases
further ahead in the legislative queue. It is likely to be more than 18
months before any Sturge case reaches court.
Mr John Rew, action group chairman, hinted that the group was hoping for a
fresh attempt by Lloyd's at an out-of-court deal. Many Names believe that if
another attempt is made at a settlement those pursuing legal action would
fare better that those who are not.
The action group said total losses on the relevant Sturge syndicates in 1990
and 1991, the latest years to be reported, had reached Pounds 747m but might
exceed Pounds 1bn.
The action group is focusing initially on claiming damages for losses
incurred by syndicate 210, run by one of the Sturge managing agencies, which
are subsidiaries of Sturge Holdings. Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Sturge
Holdings, is a former chairman of Lloyd's.
The action group's case is that a reinsurance policy taken out by the
syndicate in the 1970s to provide protection against 'long-tail' liabilities
 -those which can take many years to produce claims - should not have been
commuted in 1991. The action group says that removing the reinsurance cover
resulted in Names losing at least Pounds 100m.
The group said it planned legal action against Sturge managing agencies,
agencies which placed members on Sturge syndicates, and Neville Russell,
Sturge's auditors.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Shortage of skills hits west Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More companies in the west Midlands are finding it difficult to recruit the
labour they need than at any time since winter 1990, according to an area
business survey.
The West Midlands Business Survey, covering 931 companies in the region and
published yesterday, shows that 29 per cent of companies consider labour
recruitment has become more difficult. This compares with 15 per cent six
months ago and about 10 per cent for 1991-93, when the recession was felt
most acutely.
Historically, skill shortages have tended to emerge quickly in the west
Midlands as economic recovery leads to employment growth.
The survey says there is 'clear evidence of a tightening of the labour
market in spite of a comparatively high level of unemployment reported in
official statistics'.
In both spring and autumn 1994 44 per cent of companies reported taking on
more personnel. Between spring and autumn the proportion of companies
shedding labour dropped to 18 per cent from 25 per cent.
This has been accompanied by signs of rising wage levels. The proportion of
companies reporting wage and salary rises of more than 5 per cent has risen
to 21 per cent from 16 per cent in the spring.
By contrast with previous surveys, the latest survey illustrates the
problems of recovery. Evidence of skill shortages is accompanied by
complaints about rising raw material costs. More than half of companies
reported raw material and other input price rises of more than 5 per cent,
compared with slightly more than one-third six months ago.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Post Office chief to fight on from within
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chief executive of the Post Office is determined to go on fighting for
greater commercial freedom in spite of this month's shelving of the
government's privatisation plans.
Mr Bill Cockburn, who took a high profile in the campaign by Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to win over Tory MPs to the cause
of privatisation, said he did not think there was 'any mileage in grand
gestures' such as resignation.
Mr Cockburn, whose contract runs until September 1995, said in an interview
with the Financial Times that he did not think his credibility had been
damaged.
He said: 'The case we were making was widely accepted. By putting it in the
forefront - although it may have caused a lot of discomfiture politically -
I think we were absolutely right to confront the issues and the issues have
not gone away.'
In spite of his concerns that the Post Office will be left behind by its
competitors if current constraints are not eased, Mr Cockburn forecast that
the half-year results, expected next month, would 'look very good'.
He said, however, this was because the Post Office's profits were 'driven'
by the levy it had to pay to the Treasury which, at Pounds 226m, was more
than Pounds 40m higher than it had been last year.
He is anxious that the fact that mail volume is at its highest yet should
not distract attention from the organisation's declining market share. 'A
business that just looks at an absolute level of growth and does not look at
market share could be heading for real trouble,' he said.
He intends to continue pressing the government to let the Post Office forge
joint ventures - something ministers have opposed in the past.
He regards airlines, technology companies and printing groups as the sort of
organisations the Post Office could team up with in this way. He said he was
prepared to consider joint ventures in which the Post Office would have a
minority stake.
He said the Post Office had no plans to raise prices after the government
climbdown, although much depended on factors including the level of the
Treasury's levy or external finance limit.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Unexpected debt repayment reduces PSBR to Pounds 19.2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget planning was given a boost yesterday when the
government announced an unexpected repayment of debt in October instead of
the usual budget deficit.
With the chancellor putting the final touches to his November 29 Budget, the
Treasury and Central Statistical Office announced a public sector debt
repayment of Pounds 558m last month, compared with City expectations of a
public-sector borrowing requirement of about Pounds 1.1bn and September's
deficit of Pounds 4.09bn.
The October repayment was the first monthly budget surplus since January and
reduced the cumulative PSBR to Pounds 19.2bn for the first seven months of
the 1994-95 financial year from Pounds 19.7bn in the first six months.
The deficit for April to October was Pounds 7.2bn less than the Pounds
26.4bn recorded in the first seven months of the past financial year and
appears to leave the government well on course to undershoot the Treasury's
summer forecast of Pounds 36.1bn for the PSBR in 1994-95.
The local authorities' borrowing requirement was estimated at close to zero
last month. In the first seven months local authorities paid back about
Pounds 800m of debt after net repayments of Pounds 1.8bn in the same period
last year.
Government receipts were swollen by Pounds 1.47bn of privatisation proceeds
in October, mainly from the third tranche of the BT share sale.
Privatisation proceeds totalled Pounds 3.8bn in the April-to-October period
compared with Pounds 3.5bn at the same stage last year.
Receipts in October were also boosted by unexpectedly strong inflows of
corporation tax. These jumped to Pounds 5.51bn last month from Pounds 3.59bn
in October last year and Pounds 4.08bn in October 1992, reflecting the
beneficial impact of economic recovery on company profits.
Total cash receipts were Pounds 20.3bn last month. They rose 8.5 per cent to
Pounds 126.6bn in the first seven months of 1994-95 compared with the same
1993-94 period. Cash outlays were Pounds 20.2bn last month. The Pounds
148.1bn spending total in the first seven months was only 2 per cent higher
than in April to October last year.
Inland Revenue receipts in the seven months were 14 per cent higher than
last year, while those of Customs and Excise were up 9.5 per cent and social
security contributions were 11 per cent higher.
On the spending side, net departmental outlays were up about 1.5 per cent in
the seven months. According to Mr Kevin Darlington and Ms Helen MacFarlane,
economists at brokers Hoare Govett, this low growth, reflecting low
inflation and falling unemployment, should enable Mr Clarke to cut about
Pounds 5bn from spending plans for this year.
Analysts warned, however, against expectations of such a sharp downward
revision of this year's PSBR forecast in the Budget. Government spending
tends to gather pace as the financial year progresses. Although corporation
tax inflows are strong, lower-than-expected inflation has depressed receipts
from income tax and value added tax receipts below government expectations.
This month's Treasury survey of independent forecasts showed an average
expectation that the 1994-95 PSBR will be Pounds 32.6bn, falling to Pounds
24bn in 1995-96.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Jobless drop is sharpest for six years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sharp fall in the unadjusted rate of claimant unemployment last month
was the biggest monthly decline since October 1988, when the rules governing
claims by 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds were altered.
According to the Department of Employment unadjusted unemployment, as a
percentage of the workforce, fell from 9.2 per cent in September to 8.7 per
cent in October. The decline of 125,344 to 2.45m was boosted by students
getting jobs after the summer break and by October being a five-week month,
exaggerating the rate of decline.
After seasonal adjustment the decline was reduced to 45,800, the second
highest monthly fall in the recent recovery. Since the biggest decline also
occurred in an October, this suggests that the seasonal adjustment process
is not completely smoothing the fluctuations.
September's seasonally adjusted fall was revised to 31,600 from 28,000. In
the six months to October the seasonally adjusted total declined by an
average 27,500 a month. The Department of Employment estimates the trend is
for a monthly fall of 20,000 to 25,000.
The seasonally adjusted unemployment total was 2.52m in October, or 8.9 per
cent, its lowest level since December 1991. Unemployment fell in all regions
and among both men and women. Since the peak in December 1992 unemployment
has fallen by 455,100.
The stock of vacancies at Jobcentres increased by a seasonally adjusted
10,600 in October to 177,100, its highest level since 1990.
Long-term unemployment, defined as those out of work for more than a year,
fell by 47,800 between July and October and dropped below 1m for the first
time since October 1992.
Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, described the fall in long-term
unemployment as 'a very welcome movement'.
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, said the
government was continuing to fail the long-term unemployed. He added:
'Slight falls will not resolve the massive underlying problem.'
Ms Harriet Harman, shadow employment secretary, said: 'Official figures
suggest that unemployment is still rising among the unemployed and that jobs
are still being lost in the economy.'
The fall in unemployment has yet to result in a pick-up in jobs in the
manufacturing sector. Manufacturing employment fell by 4,000 between August
and September and was up only 2,000 over the quarter.
Manufacturing employers seem to be asking their existing staff to work
longer hours instead of taking on new workers. Overtime working jumped by 1m
hours a week between August and September to reach 9.84m hours, its highest
level since July last year. Short-time working fell to 0.15m hours in
September, the lowest-ever recorded level.

FT  17 NOV 94 / RPI up 0.1% in October: Increase in base rates and mortgage
costs causes rise in inflation but prices remain level for other goods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent rise in base rates and mortgage costs pushed the inflation rate
up last month.
But this was partly offset by flat prices in most other categories of goods,
suggesting that high street price competition remains intense in the
approach to Christmas.
Overall, the Central Statistical Office yesterday said that the all-items
retail prices index, which takes 1987 as 100, rose to 145.2 in October.
This was 0.1 per cent higher than in September, and 2.4 per cent higher than
in October last year.
Most of this increase stemmed from the rise in base rates in September,
which pushed up mortgage interest payments and added 0.4 percentage points
to the overall inflation index. The CSO said this effect was exacerbated by
a rise in outstanding mortgage debt.
Prices in most other areas were flat, or even fell. Consequently, if
mortgage interest payments are stripped out of the index - the measurement
favoured by the government - 'underlying' inflation fell slightly in the
month, and was only 2.0 per cent higher than in the previous October, the
same as in the previous month.
This figure was better than City predictions. Mr Ian Shepherdson, economist
at Midland Global Markets said: 'This is another excellent set of inflation
data.'
He pointed out that the most favourable aspect of the data was that the
price weakness was concentrated in the 'core' consumer areas and did not
stem from erratic elements.
With prices flat in both consumer goods and many service sectors, the data
suggest that the discounting mentality seen in food retailing last year is
increasingly spreading to other consumer areas.
Motoring costs fell 0.5 per cent between September and October, due to lower
petrol and secondhand car prices. Big secondhand cars, for example, were up
to Pounds 200 cheaper.
The price of household service dropped 1.1 per cent in the month, and 1.4
per cent in the year to October, reflecting lower telephone charges.
Food prices were 1.1 per cent higher in October than the year before,
largely because of intense supermarket discounting last autumn.
But food prices were 0.2 per cent lower than in September. Although seasonal
food prices rose, there was discounting on bread, beef, sweets and prepared
meals.
Mr Nick Parsons, economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said: 'It
appears that retailers are entering a further round of aggressive price
discounting.'
Clothing and footwear fell by 0.1 per cent during the month, even though
clothing and footwear prices have risen in October in previous years as a
result of new stock. The CSO said: 'There appears to be a new mid-season
sales effect creeping in.'
Nevertheless, some analysts yesterday warned that these factors could be
reversed in coming months. Mr Adam Cole, economist at James Capel said:
'Several factors . . . suggest that we are close to a turning point and we
expect a modest upwards drift in all measures of core inflation from here.'

FT  17 NOV 94 / City is criticised on 'green' reporting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
City institutions have shown little interest in environmental reporting, Mr
Ian Taylor, junior minister for trade and technology, said yesterday.
He told a seminar organised by the Advisory Committee on Business and the
Environment that retailers had become nervous that any stigma associated
with poor environmental performance by suppliers would attach to them. This
was 'feeding through the supply chain' in demands for better management.
Mr Martin Scicluna, a partner of accountants Touche Ross, said accounting
standards were adequate for companies to start disclosing environmental
costs and liabilities in balance sheets and profit and loss accounts.
He said there was likely to be increasing demand for accountants to provide
independent verification of environmental reports, as his firm had done for
Coats Viyella, the UK's largest textiles company.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Subdued demand eased pressure on interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, hinted that more subdued growth of
consumer demand could delay further rises in interest rates at his late
September monetary meeting with Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England
governor.
The minutes of the September 26 meeting, published yesterday, confirmed that
the chancellor and Mr George had agreed to leave interest rates unchanged
for the time being.
Mr Clarke, while noting that the UK recovery remained strong, said there was
little immediate prospect of inflationary pressure from the consumer side of
the economy.
Mr Clarke said more subdued growth of consumer demand would allow exports
and investment to grow faster and for longer before capacity constraints
were hit.
He added that pay pressures also appeared to be under control.
The September 26 meeting was brought forward because of international
meetings at the end of September and took place only two weeks after UK bank
base rates were raised to 5.75 per cent from 5.25 per cent. There was,
therefore, relatively little new information for the chancellor and governor
to discuss.
Mr George said there was no question of wanting to tighten the policy stance
further in October. He said it was possible, however, that the run of
favourable shocks to inflation might be coming to an end.
Since Mr Clarke made his observations about consumer demand the Central
Statistical Office has disclosed a relatively robust 3.7 per cent rise in
retail sales volumes in the year to September and the Confederation of
British Industry has reported a fall in retail sales in the year to October
 -the first since December 1992.
Official figures on retail sales in October will be released today and
statistics of third quarter consumer demand tomorrow.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Faster growth in pay signalled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Signs emerged in September that pay growth is edging up, in spite of the
annual growth rate of underlying average earnings remaining unchanged at
3.75 per cent.
In the production sector underlying average earnings growth increased from
4.25 per cent in August to 4.5 per cent in September. Manufacturing earnings
grew at 4.5 per cent in September, after August's rise had been revised up
to 4.5 per cent from 4.25 per cent.
The overall figures are being kept low by the services sector, where annual
earnings growth was unchanged at 3.5 per cent in September. The services
figure will be affected in October by the 4.5 per cent settlement for
750,000 local authority manual workers. Last year they received an increase
of only 1.5 per cent.
The underlying figures for average earnings smooth out the effects of
factors such as pay arrears and industrial disputes. The seasonally adjusted
growth in average earnings in the year to September was 3.8 per cent, down
from 3.9 per cent in August.
Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, said: 'Earnings growth is still
some way above the inflation figure and this is an undesirable situation
from the point of view of maximising employment growth.'
In spite of the rise in manufacturing earnings, wages and salaries per unit
of output were 1.4 per cent lower in the three months to September than in
the same three months of last year. This was the biggest fall since records
began in 1970. Figures for previous months have been revised down.
The strong increase in output and the lack of growth in manufacturing
employment has kept unit labour costs subdued.
Manufacturing output per head was 6.0 per cent higher in the three months to
September than in the same period last year.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Bank warns on end to mortgage help
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Any move to withdraw income support on mortgage interest payments would wipe
Pounds 4,500 off the value of the average home, UBS, the investment bank,
warned yesterday.
The cost of income support payments to cover mortgage interest rose to
Pounds 1.2bn last The government has already started to curtail the scheme,
initially by imposing a ceiling of Pounds 150,000 on mortgages which qualify
for support. In April this ceiling was reduced to Pounds 125,000.
UBS estimated that repossessions would rise by 13,000 a year if income
support were removed entirely, causing house prices to fall 7 per cent
across the market.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Transport links set for EU priority
</HEADLINE>

   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two additional transport projects in Britain are to be added to the European
Union's list of priority schemes under its programme of trans-European
networks, Charles Batchelor writes.
The West Coast Line between London and Glasgow and a road connection across
Wales and southern England to the Channel tunnel have been added to the
original list of 11 projects.
Local authorities along the route of the West Coast Line had been lobbying
the government to add it to the list. Plans are being prepared for a Pounds
500m upgrade of the 30-year-old track and signalling.
The schemes on the priority list will be put for final approval to the EU
summit to be held in Essen, Germany, next month.
The trans-European networks are intended to form strategic transport links
across the continent. They will be eligible for EU help with feasibility
studies and other funding.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Trafalgar backed for Samsung contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafalgar House has been named by Samsung of South Korea as the chosen
developer for its Pounds 600m plan to expand production of electronic
consumer goods in north-east England.
The decision to build a manufacturing complex at Wynyard, Cleveland, was
announced by Samsung - the world's 14th-biggest industrial group - last
month.
The complex, which will produce consumer goods including microwave ovens and
computer monitors for the European market, is expected to provide 3,000
permanent jobs by the end of the decade and will create substantial
employment during the construction phase.
It will be the biggest single European investment by a Korean company.
Preliminary design work has been started by Trafalgar House, the UK
construction, property, shipping and hotels group.
A construction contract has still to be signed but Trafalgar is in a strong
position as favoured developer. Mr Chan Bae, Samsung Electronic's UK
managing director, said yesterday: 'We are looking forward to working
closely with Trafalgar House over the next few years.'
The complex - the Samsung Industrial Park - will eventually comprise five
manufacturing plants as well as training and administrative centres.
The first phase includes the construction of microwave oven and computer
monitor plants on the 200-acre site close to Samsung's existing Pounds 20m
colour television factory.
A second phase, providing facilities to manufacture facsimile machines,
colour display tubes and personal computers, is planned to start in 1997.
The company plans to move its European headquarters from Frankfurt to
London. The UK government offered Samsung Pounds 58m in regional grants and
loans to secure the project. With indirect aid, the support is equivalent to
20 per cent of Samsung's investment.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Sub-underwriters 'reaped excess returns of Pounds 289m'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Institutional investors earned 'excess returns' of about Pounds 289m by
sub-underwriting new rights offerings for UK companies between 1986 and last
year, says an Office of Fair Trading study released yesterday.
The study of 691 rights issues, which raised Pounds 39.1bn, said excess
returns may have been even higher - as much as Pounds 480m. Professor Paul
Marsh of the London Business School, who conducted the study, said the exact
level of excess returns depended on how frequently one expected market
crashes such as that in 1987 and whether sub-underwriters tried to hedge
their positions.
He said: 'From a public interest viewpoint, if sub-underwriting costs are
excessive, the direct costs of raising equity capital are higher than they
need be. This has an important bearing on the competitiveness not only of
the issuing firms, but also of the financial services industry.'
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said he would announce
his conclusions about the report 'in the near future'.
The OFT commissioned the report as part of its inquiry into whether a
'complex cartel' exists for commissions. It was concerned that underwriting
fees have remained at the same level - 0.25 per cent to brokers, 0.5 per
cent to the lead underwriter and 1.25 per cent to sub-underwriters - for at
least 30 years.
The London Investment Bankers Association, which represents merchant banks
which arrange sub-underwriting, has argued that the speed with which rights
issues are arranged precludes real negotiations about fees. Moreover,
variations among the qualities of issuers and varying market conditions are
reflected not in the fees but in the discount applied to each issue.
Prof Marsh said there appeared relatively little variation in discounts at
which new shares were issued in rights offerings. He said: 'If the fees were
lowered or the discounts narrowed, then you could reach the conclusion that
the system is fair.'
The Institutional Fund Managers Association, the trade body for
institutional investors, said its members did not view sub-underwriting as a
profitable activity.

FT  17 NOV 94 / BCCI deal for creditors struck: Liquidators to announce
Dollars 1.8bn payment from government of Abu Dhabi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The liquidators of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International
will today announce that they have reached an historic agreement with BCCI's
main shareholder to begin the process of paying creditors.
The liquidators are expected to claim that the agreement, which would secure
Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.14bn) from the government of Abu Dhabi, has been
agreed without a dissenting vote by creditors' committees in London,
Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands.
Progress towards the payment of an interim dividend, now expected next year,
will depend on the agreement being cleared by courts in the three separate
jurisdictions.
However, the agreement has been drawn up specifically to avoid legal
problems which brought about the failure of an original settlement when it
reached the Court of Appeal in Luxembourg last year.
While no dissenting vote has been registered against the scheme it is likely
to prompt vociferous opposition from creditors who fought bitterly against
an earlier settlement both in and outside the courts.
The long-awaited agreement will be notified to creditors from tomorrow and
more than 40,000 booklets explaining the deal are expected to be posted to
creditors in Europe alone.
The agreement is understood not to contain a specific dividend offer because
of uncertainties over the level of the bank's assets, such as unclaimed
deposits, and the number of creditors taking part in the scheme.
If creditors from other jurisdictions decide that more can be claimed
through the scheme than through local administrations they will join it and
so reduce the average dividend.
Another factor making it difficult for the liquidators to put forward a
dividend figure is the continuing costs of running the liquidation itself.
At one point these were thought to be running at Dollars 300,000 a day.
Unofficial estimates put the assets of the bank at up to Dollars 4bn. It is
thought that up to Dollars 3bn is still held unclaimed in branches of the
bank.
The earlier agreement gave a range of compensation from Dollars 1.2bn to
Dollars 2.2bn. The new offer is not linked to claims and the realisation of
assets.
The original offer required creditors to waive their rights to seek damages
from Abu Dhabi. It is understood that this condition has been removed from
the new offer to be published today.
The new offer is also likely to mean that creditors at branches of BCCI in
the United Arab Emirates will get the same dividend as other creditors. The
original document left this unclear.
The new agreement is also expected to include the creditors of ICIC Group -
a BCCI subsidiary which was covered by the original agreement but only to
the extent that any dividends paid would be similar to those of BCCI
creditors.
The progress of the scheme through the courts is likely to be relatively
swift. The earlier plan that was eventually thrown out in Luxembourg was
given prompt treatment in London and the Cayman Islands. In the meantime
creditors will be invited to make comments on the agreement to the
liquidators.

FT  17 NOV 94 / City bankers feel squeeze, not chop: Big job cuts are rare
as yet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employees at City merchant and investment banks may be nervously awaiting
redundancy notices as their organisations approach the end of their
financial years and begin budgeting for the next.
But the most stringent cuts so far have been not of jobs, but of expenses -
the main casualties of austerity are taxi-drivers, caterers and newspaper
publishers.
Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, has put cost control policy into
action with a ban on the use of taxis at the company's expense before 9pm.
Employees' newspaper subscriptions are examined for duplication and, if
necessary, ended.
Entertainment, as always, is a target. Gifts distributed at the firm's
receptions are strictly for guests: Lehman staff may not now help
themselves. Corporate events should be centred on clients as much as
possible. 'There should be no departmental lunches on the firm just because
there is not much going on,' said a Lehman executive.
The firm's impressively named European Expense Advisory Committee is
inspiring and co-ordinating belt-tightening. Lehman defended using senior
managers' time in identifying small cost savings: 'It all adds up,' it said.
Lehman, although rumoured to be preparing swingeing redundancies, says
departures are in single figures and the reason for them is substandard
performance.
Other US investment banks hit by the downturn in world bond markets have
been cutting more radically. Goldman Sachs this week completed a round of 90
redundancies - nearly 5 per cent of its European headcount.
SG Warburg, the UK investment bank which last week reported sharply lower
interim profits, has made 10 people redundant. NatWest Markets has pulled
out of several corporate bond markets and lowered staffing by 12 as a
result.
These disclosures have fuelled anxiety among City employees, but they do not
yet represent the massacre portrayed by the rumour-mill and the headlines.
Goldman Sachs has made the deepest cuts so far but the firm's London
headcount has been rising this year and will remain higher than in January
even after the redundancies.
SG Warburg describes its policy as a 'freeze' at the staffing level of
September 30. 'It would be foolish to get involved in panic measures which
would affect the fabric of the business,' it said.
Hambros, which yesterday reported a sharp fall in interim profits, set
itself against staff cuts in the bond division which suffered most from
adverse market conditions this year.
'If anything, we are expanding it,' said Sir Chips Keswick, deputy chairman.
'It is a core business and we have no intention of leaving it.'
Remuneration is another matter. Goldman Sachs expects to inform employees
about their bonuses in a few days. The average is expected to plummet from
last year and Goldman, as the first investment bank to decide, puts down a
benchmark.
There may be more sackings to come, or to come to light. Visible
redundancies can undermine client confidence. Investment banks privately
admit that they, or at least their competitors, fudge redundancies by
putting them under the heading of quality control. In general, City firms
fervently deny any intention to embark on mass dismissals until they
actually do so.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Major acts to reassure unionists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday tried to reassure unionists about the direction of
talks on Northern Ireland's future. The prime minister told MPs that a joint
authority to handle relations between Ulster and Dublin had been rejected by
the British and Irish governments.
Speaking on the eve of the first visit to parliament for more than a decade
by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, Mr Major said the government
would begin talks next month with both the IRA's political wing and loyalist
representatives - 'so long as the ceasefire is maintained'.
It is understood that the talks with Sinn Fein will probably begin first.
Sinn Fein last night said it regretted the failure of the parties in the
Irish republic's coalition government to agree to stay in office together so
that they could continue with their joint programme, particularly in the
'vital area' of the Ulster peace process.
But at Westminster the Rev Martin Smyth, Ulster Unionist MP for Belfast
South, said: 'I would have thought it would have no significant effect on
the peace process because all the politicians in Dublin are signed up to
it.'
The prime minister assured MPs that Northern Ireland remained at the top of
the government's priorities, but said there was still 'a long way to go'
before peace in the province was secure.
He said good progress had been made in discussions with the Irish government
on the joint framework document that will form the basis of talks involving
Ulster's main political parties.
The document would contain proposals for a locally elected Ulster assembly
and suggest a framework for cross-border structures to handle north-south
relations.
But he emphasised that the framework document would not be 'a straitjacket'.
It was not a 'London-Dublin deal' that would be imposed.
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, expressed 'cautious optimism' on the
province's future and promised that Labour would continue to support the
peace process.
Leading unionists made clear they would not be sorry to see the Irish
political crisis lead to the departure of Mr Albert Reynolds as the
republic's prime minister.
Mr David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist party's legal spokesman, said: 'In a
sense almost anyone would be better than Albert Reynolds.
'As we see it Mr Reynolds . . . has been trying to get quick results. He has
been trying to force the pace of peace negotiations and creating an air of
crisis.'
He rejected the idea that Fine Gael, the main opposition party in Dublin, is
more pro-unionist than Mr Reynolds' Fianna Fail.
Mr Ian Paisley Jnr, of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, said the
peace process would continue whatever government was in power in Dublin.
Mr David Ervine of the Progressive Unionist party, which speaks for some
loyalist paramilitaries, also said a change of government in the republic
would not damage the peace process.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Demolition plan for Wembley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
English Heritage, the guardian of historic sites, yesterday gave tentative
permission for the demolition of Wembley Stadium, a Grade II listed
building, but found fault with plans to modernise it.
It said: 'The international standing of Wembley demands a much more
imaginative approach than shown in this scheme.' Wembley's distinctive twin
towers and grand entrance block must be retained, it added.
The application to renovate the London stadium came from the Genesis
Corporation, which last month approached Wembley plc, the site's owner, with
an investment offer which was rejected. Genesis then approached the London
Borough of Brent, which consulted English Heritage about the redevelopment
plans.
Wembley plc, which has debts of Pounds 150m, yesterday 'noted with great
interest' the decision of English Heritage.
English Heritage is keen to see the stadium modernised. It said: 'The
redevelopment would bring Wembley up to Olympic standard, with increased
seating capacity and modern facilities.
'Whilst we therefore would not be minded to authorise the grant of listed
building consent for the proposals as they stand, we hope that the
applicants will reconsider their scheme in the light of our comments and put
forward what might be considered a more radical scheme which we could
unequivocally support.'

FT  17 NOV 94 / EU officials angered as retraining aid is shunned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain risks losing European Union aid worth up to Ecu674m (Pounds 525m),
intended to retrain workers in frontline industries, because it is refusing
to apply for it, the European Commission confirmed yesterday.
Senior commission officials warned that the UK would not be allowed to 'opt
out' of this policy, which is intended to lift EU competitiveness.
The aid Britain risks fore - going comes under Objective 4 of the European
Social Fund. This policy, agreed by all member states last year, is designed
to boost the skills of workers in industries being restructured.
Social Fund money was previously aimed exclusively at young and long-term
unemployed, while Objective 4 targets workers in threatened industries in
order to prevent them becoming unemployed. The UK regards this switch as
part of a French-inspired commission effort to build up an industrial policy
by subterfuge, and wants to be allowed to spend all Social Fund money on the
jobless.
The commission yesterday agreed on a share-out of Objective 4 funds for the
UK's partners, but confirmed that it was 'holding in reserve' finance for
which Britain had submitted no programme.
Britain is entitled to a total of Ecu3.37bn under the Social Fund up to
1999. Under the formula about 80 per cent of this would go to training the
unemployed, and 20 per cent to Objective 4 - about Ecu674m in the UK's case.
The UK has asked for 95 per cent of its full Social Fund entitlement between
this year and 1996 - the first half of the scheme - but purely for funding
training for the jobless and ignoring Objective 4. Brussels has allowed this
through, while withholding the remaining 5 per cent, worth Ecu80m.
The commission is insisting that the UK redress the balance towards the
Objective 4 programme in the second half of the scheme. Brussels officials
say they are prepared to be flexible, allowing Britain to spend perhaps no
more than 10 per cent of its Social Fund grant on retraining employed
workers.
But Mr Padraig Flynn, EU social affairs commissioner, made clear yesterday
that all member states should implement Objective 4.
Mr Flynn would not spell out publicly the consequences for Britain if it
continued to boycott the retraining policy, beyond stressing that 'we have
no indication we are going to get a programme from the UK' to take up its
Objective 4 entitlements.
Britain has traditionally got the biggest single share of the EU Social
Fund. Between 1989 and last year it received Ecu2bn out of the Ecu7.4bn
total. Its full entitlement of nearly Ecu3.4bn in 1994-99 compares with a
total of Ecu14bn parcelled out to all member states.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Call for separate sale of generating business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, is
calling on the regional electricity companies to sell the National Grid's
generating business separately at its flotation, planned for next year.
The Grid's generation business - pump storage facilities - consists of about
2,000MW of plant in Wales which has typically supplied about 0.5 per cent of
the total output in England and Wales. Analysts put its value at between
Pounds 300m and Pounds 500m.
Prof Littlechild, speaking to the Institute of Economic Affairs, also urged
the regional electricity companies to sell their entire stakes in the Grid,
rather than keep some shares for disposal later.
He also said that there 'would be merit' in considering greater separation
of the regional companies' distribution networks from their other
activities.
He said: 'A clearer separation between monopoly networks and potentially
competitive activities is more conducive to effective competition and the
protection of customers.'
While Prof Littlechild is not able to force the regional companies to comply
with his wishes, his views will influence both industry executives and the
government, which has a golden share in the Grid.
He said continued ownership of the Grid by the regional companies,
acceptable as a transitional measure since privatisation in 1990, seemed
increasingly inappropriate.
'But it is important for the development of competition that transmission be
clearly independent of interests in generation or supply.'
Prof Littlechild has also backed the idea that some of the proceeds of the
sale should be given to consumers. The Grid had a book value of about Pounds
1.2bn when the regional companies were privatised but is now thought to be
worth more than Pounds 4bn.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Network of cycle routes proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A call for Millennium Fund money to back the creation of a 5,000-mile
network of cycle routes throughout Britain was made yesterday by Sustrans, a
charity organisation which builds cycleways.
The backbone of the Pounds 250m network would be a 1,000-mile route linking
Inverness with Dover plus cycle routes in every county bringing 20m people
within 10 minutes of a safe cycle track.
Mr John Grimshaw, Sustrans founder, said the aim was to increase cycle use,
reduce traffic congestion and pollution and provide greater opportunities
for exercise.
The recent review of transport policy by the Royal Commission on pollution
recommended a quadrupling of cycle journeys within a decade. Fewer than 3
per cent of journeys are made by bicycle in Britain compared with 29 per
cent in the Netherlands and 11 per cent in Germany.
Mr Steven Norris, transport minister, said Britain was behind many other
European countries in developing attractive cycle routes.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Children to be allowed in pubs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Children under 14 will soon be legally allowed in pubs, the government said
yesterday.
But they will have to be accompanied by an adult, must leave by 9pm and will
not be able to drink alcohol.
Ministers are also considering allowing pubs to open for longer on Sunday
afternoons under new rules.
Landlords who want to benefit from new rules will have to apply for a
children's certificate and show licensing justices that their pub has a
'family atmosphere'.
Mr Michael Forsyth, Home Office minister, said the laws would probably come
into force early in the new year.
The intention is to limit under-14s to one bar where food and soft drinks
are available.
Ministers first announced their plans to change the laws earlier this year.
Brewers welcomed the move, saying surveys showed that many people were in
favour of children being allowed into pubs.
Mr Forsyth said the government hoped that children would benefit from seeing
sensible drinking in a relaxed atmosphere.
The government was also looking at changing the rules on Sunday opening,
although no decision had been made.
Mr Forsyth said: 'It isn't easy to defend pubs open in the afternoons each
weekday but closed each Sunday.'

FT  17 NOV 94 / Hurd to review overseas aid plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, has ordered a review of Britain's
overseas aid programme in the light of the High Court ruling that he acted
unlawfully in earmarking Pounds 234m for Malaysia's Pergau Dam project.
He has told officials at the Overseas Development Administration to check
whether any of the dozens of projects in other countries financed by the
Pounds 100m a year provided under the government's Aid and Trade Provision
scheme might also be deemed illegal.
Last week the High Court said that the aid grant to the Pergau dam was
unlawful because it was 'economically unsound'.
Mr Hurd has rejected the basis of that argument as illogical because
projects requiring aid necessarily cannot be judged on the same basis as
those for which market finance would be readily available.
A final decision on whether to take the issue to the Court of Appeal will
depend on the outcome of Mr Hurd's review of other aid projects which might
be caught by the judgment.
However the foreign secretary, who is still awaiting the detailed written
judgment from the court, has told colleagues that his instincts are against
appealing against the ruling.
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, has made clear that he will fight a
separate court defeat for the government last week over compensation for
victims of crime. But Mr Hurd believes that high-profile battles with the
courts risk prolonging the political damage inflicted on the government.
Mr Hurd, who will face Labour fire over the affair during today's Commons
debate on foreign affairs, plans to assure MPs that during his five-year
tenure at the Foreign Office, no aid decisions have been linked to sales of
military equipment.
He will reject charges that substantial aid projects in Indonesia have been
linked to large exports of military equipment.

negligence after his workload damaged his health.
The High Court ruled that the council had breached its duty of care to Mr
John Walker, 57, whose workload drove him to a nervous breakdown.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of the public services union Unison,
which brought the case, said: 'This is a warning to employers that they can
no longer expect their staff to pay with their health while struggling to
provide under-funded, under-resourced services.'
The union said Mr Walker would seek more than Pounds 200,000 in damages.
Mr Walker of Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear, had been area manager responsible
for a team of social workers in the Blyth Valley area since 1974. He
suffered a breakdown in November 1986 after his workload grew because of the
rising number of child-abuse cases in the area. A psychiatrist said Mr
Walker's anxieties were sharply focused on work pressures. He had no history
of mental disorder. When he returned to work the following March he found
that paperwork had built up in his absence and help promised from the head
office was withdrawn. He suffered a second breakdown and was dismissed on
the grounds of ill-health.
Mrs Ann Robinson, head of the policy unit at the Institute of Directors,
said: 'Most of us who employ people had better shut up and go home. It will
make people think very carefully about employing anyone at all.' The number
of cases facing employers in areas such as maternity rights, repetitive
strain injury and now stress was becoming an increasing problem, she said.
Northumberland County Council said it would look carefully at the judgment
before deciding whether to appeal.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Separate sale of Grid's generation business advised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Stephen Littlechild, electricity industry regulator, is calling on
the regional electricity companies to sell the National Grid's generating
business separately at its flotation, planned for the middle of next year.
The Grid's generation business - pump storage facilities - consists of about
2,000MW of plant at Dinorwic and Ffestiniog in Wales which has typically
supplied about 0.5 per cent of the total output in England and Wales.
Analysts put its value at between Pounds 300m and Pounds 500m.
In a speech to the Institute of Economic Affairs, Prof Littlechild also
urged the regional electricity companies to sell their entire stakes in the
Grid, rather than keep back some of the shares for disposal later.
He said his preference was that they sell their entire stakes at flotation,
'but if not, within a specified, but short, period after'. In addition he
said there 'would be merit' in considering greater separation of the
regional companies' distribution networks from their other activities.
He said: 'A clearer separation between monopoly networks and potentially
competitive activities is more conducive to effective competition and the
protection of customers.'
While Prof Littlechild is not able to force the regional companies to comply
with his wishes, his views will influence both industry executives and the
government, which has a golden share in the Grid.
He said continued ownership of the Grid by the regional companies,
acceptable as a transitional measure since privatisation in 1990, seemed
increasingly inappropriate.
'But it is important for the development of competition that transmission be
clearly independent of interests in generation or supply.'
Prof Littlechild has also thrown his weight behind the idea that some of the
proceeds of the Grid sale should be given to electricity consumers. The Grid
had a book value of about Pounds 1.2bn when the regional companies were
privatised but is now thought to be worth more than Pounds 4bn.
The Labour party is pressing for a large part of the difference to be handed
over to customers and the companies are proposing a 'rebate' of about Pounds
10 for each customer.

FT  17 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Italy, UK finance plan for Kazakh pipeline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
British Gas and Italy's Agip are considering co-financing a Dollars 1.2bn
oil pipeline at the heart of a dispute with Russia, according to Kazakhstan
officials.
Kazakhstan's deputy foreign minister, Mr Viacheslav Gizzatov, said British
Gas and Agip might join Chevron of the US in financing the pipeline,
connecting the Tengiz field to Russia's Black Sea port of Novorossisk.
The pipeline would also carry oil condensate from a rich northern Kazakhstan
field, Karachaganak, which British Gas and Agip intend to develop. The two
groups have exclusive rights to develop Karachaganak, which contains
reserves of 1,300bn cu m of gas, 650m tonnes of condensate and 200m tonnes
of oil.
The financing plan is part of an attempt to break a logjam holding up
Chevron's Dollars 20bn contract at Tengiz, the former Soviet Union's largest
oilfield.
Kazakhstan is believed to contain some of the world's richest oil and
natural gas reserves. But all export pipelines to the west pass through
Russia, which industry officials say has thrown up obstacles to expansion.
Chevron has refused to proceed with development of Tengiz, estimated to
contain between 6bn and 9bn barrels of recoverable oil reserves, until the
pipeline issue is settled.
The financing proposal involves plans to expand the existing oil pipeline to
Novorossisk. A three partner consortium of Oman Oil, Kazakhstan and Russia
possesses the right to operate the expanded pipeline that would carry
Tengiz's production.
Russia and Oman Oil are insisting that Chevron arrange virtually the entire
cost to build the pipeline, in exchange for a 25 per cent stake in the
consortium. In turn, Chevron has offered to finance half the pipeline, but
effectively wants to exclude Oman, which has put in no finance.

<TEXT>
The Arab League boycott of Israel cost US companies more than Dollars 400m
in 1993, according to a study by the US International Trade Commission.
Although the boycott is directed at Israel, US companies are hurt by a
secondary boycott which prohibits Arab League states from doing business
with foreign companies that conduct trade with Israel. Under US law, US
companies cannot comply with the embargo.
The ITC found that US companies face delays in concluding deals and
difficulty obtaining intellectual property protection. Foreign firms which
are not hindered by anti-boycott laws have a competitive advantage. Mr
Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said the US government would
continue to pursue 'aggressively the dismantling of the remaining aspects of
the boycott'.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US vice-president Al Gore yesterday warned Congress that failure to approve
the Uruguay Round legislation this year would mean its demise, writes Nancy
Dunne in Washington.
'Anybody who says 'delay the Gatt' is really calling for a death sentence on
the biggest tax cut in the history of the world,' he said. 'It is a critical
vote for US leadership in the world.' He spoke on Capitol Hill where
business leaders, administration officials and Republican and Democratic
members of key committees gathered to push for passage of the deal.
Votes are scheduled in the House on November 29 and the Senate on December
1.
Behind the public facade of bipartisan accord, Senator Robert Dole, majority
leader-to-be, is the lone hold out among the congressional leadership. He
has made several demands, most ludicrous being that Mr Mickey Kantor, US
trade representative, go to Kansas to debate Mr Ross Perot, the Texas
billionaire.
Mr Dole wants establishment of an eminent persons group to review decisions
by the new World Trade Organisation and report on them to Congress and a
procedure to pull the US out of the WTO if it impinges on US sovereignty.
The concerns about sovereignty are widely regarded as spurious since the
issue has been repeatedly addressed in the implementing legislation. But as
a likely presidential candidate in 1996, he is seeking to placate
conservative Republicans, who urge delay.
With Mr Kantor's agreement to 'carefully consider' Mr Dole's proposals,
approval prospects seem to have improved.
Little trouble is expected in the House, where Mr Newt Gingrich, the
speaker-to-be, has climbed firmly aboard. The difficulty is the Senate where
60 votes out of 100 are needed for a waiver of budget rules before the
legislation can go to the floor.
Senator Jesse Helms, expected to be next chairman of the foreign relations
committee, has written to President Bill Clinton seeking a delay until next
year. If granted, he said, he would consider the administration's foreign
policies 'fairly and fully'.
Many congressional Democrats are sceptical about the demands. 'It is highly
unlikely that the Republicans would risk initiating gridlock as their first
action in control of this place,' said one.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ron Brown, US secretary of commerce, yesterday witnessed the signing of
Dollars 40bn-worth of contracts and memoranda of understanding between
Indonesian and US companies in Jakarta.
The deals, which came a day after the signing of free trade plans at the
Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit, reflect the more aggressive
stance by the US government to helping US companies secure contracts
overseas.
'In contrast to previous administrations, we have unashamedly been active in
helping our businesses win contracts abroad,' said US President Bill Clinton
in Jakarta. Many of the contracts have been in the pipeline for some time.
Over the past few days the US has signed contracts and memoranda worth more
than Dollars 400m in the Philippines and clinched deals worth more than
Dollars 250m in Malaysia.
Topping the list of deals in Jakarta was an undertaking between Esso
Exploration and Production Natuna and Indonesia's state-owned oil company,
Pertamina, to sign a basic agreement to develop the Dollars 35bn Natuna sea
gas project.
The US Eximbank Bank supported two of the Indonesian deals; a credit
agreement with the ministry of finance to back a Dollars 65m AT&amp;T contract
with PT Telkom and a memorandum of understanding with the forestry ministry
to support Motorola's Dollars 104m forest radio communications system
project.
Britain's Philip's Systems made an initial bid for the latter project and
completed the preliminary stages in implementing forest radio communication
systems in Indonesia. However, it lost out to Motorola in the later stages.
The Eximbank agreements are part of new US 'Tied-Aid' credit offers.
The policy 'is designed to counter foreign tied-aid offers and level the
financial playing field for US exporters,' the bank said. Tied aid is
government to government concessional financing which is linked to the
purchase of donor country exports.
Other memoranda included a Dollars 2.6bn project for the supply of power
equipment and services by Mission Energy and General Electric to Indonesia's
first large-scale independent private power project, Paiton.
Heard Energy Corporation headed a consortium of bidders which signed a
memorandum of understanding for a Dollars 200m power project with
Indonesia's directorate of electricity and energy development and PT Panha
Serodia Pradhana.
The companies are expected to build, own and operate a 200MW coal-fired
power plant to supply Indonesia's state owned electricity company, PLN.

FT  17 NOV 94 / World Trade News: China the big prize in Asian beer sales
contest - The market of the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heineken, the Dutch brewer, has until now had the Asian beer market largely
to itself as other big European or American brewers were content with their
domestic markets.
But with home markets stagnating and Asian countries offering the fastest
rising beer consumption in the world, Heineken is racing against the likes
of Anheuser-Busch and Philip Morris of the US, Kirin of Japan, Molson of
Canada and San Miguel of the Philippines to establish its brand in new
markets.
The prize is China, already the third biggest beer market after the US and
Germany. Demand is largely met by a highly fragmented domestic brewing
industry. But consumption is growing so fast that additional sales each year
amount to 20m hectolitres, equivalent to the total yearly beer consumption
of a much more mature market such as France.
To cope with this growth, the Chinese government has already opened up the
industry to a handful of foreign investment projects with more to come.
Heineken, for example, already has a stake in Fujian Brewery in Fuzhou and
hopes it can establish up to four more ventures in China by the end of next
year.
In common with its competitors, the Dutch brewer is also pushing into small
countries. Following on from deals in Vietnam and Thailand, its latest
project is a brewery in Cambodia where per-capita beer consumption is a
fraction of that in Heineken's Netherlands home market.
Some of Heineken's rivals are larger but the Dutch company has advantages
gained from its experience abroad. Anheuser-Busch's revenues, for example,
were Dollars 13.2bn last year but only 3.8 per cent came from outside its US
home market. Heineken's revenues were less than half that but Europe
accounted for only 49 per cent with a further 25 per cent from elsewhere in
the western hemisphere, 15 per cent from Africa and 11 per cent from Asia.
To further its Asian ambitions, Heineken is drawing on its 63-year-old joint
venture with Fraser &amp; Neave, the Singapore-based drinks group. Asia Pacific
Breweries (APBL) is 42.5 per cent owned by Heineken which looks after
technical aspects while sales are the responsibility of its Singapore
partner.
The two partners, who have already invested through APBL in Vietnam, China
and Thailand, expect to invest another Fl800m (Dollars 475m) in Asia over
the next five years, nearly four times as much as they spent in the
preceding five-year period.
For Heineken, the attraction of APBL lies in its local expertise in Asian
markets and its Tiger beer brand. This allows Heineken to pursue a
two-pronged approach using national and regional brands plus its
international Heineken brand. The Cambodian brewery, for example, will
produce Tiger as well as another APBL brew, ABC Stout while Heineken will
export its own premium lager to the country.
Heineken usually begins to build brand awareness in a country in this way.
Once the brand is established, it often switches to producing it locally.
Thailand will be one of the next countries to begin brewing the lager.
For all its success in emerging Asian markets, Heineken has not always
succeeded in more mature ones. In Japan, where Heineken is brewed under
licence by Kirin, and in South Korea, where Heineken is imported, the
company has had to admit that sales are disappointing.

France may drop its threat to veto a new international ban on direct
shipbuilding subsidies if, in talks with Brussels, it can find other ways to
help its merchant-ship construction sector.
At stake is last July's agreement between European, US, Scandinavian and
Asian countries representing 80 per cent of world shipbuilding. Negotiated
over five years within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), the agreement would put an end to the system whereby
European Union governments can pay up to 9 per cent of the cost of a boat
built in national yards.
The agreement would not come into force until 1996. But the German
presidency of the EU is keen to get the deal, negotiated by the European
Commission, ratified at a Council of Ministers meeting on November 28.
France has made no secret of its opposition to the deal, and threatened last
month to invoke the 'vital interest' clause of the 1966 Luxembourg
compromise to block it.
However, to avoid a damaging confrontation with Germany, the Balladur
government has seized on suggestions from Brussels that Paris could exploit
the OECD agreement's authorisation of some indirect aid by increasing
payments for research and development, environmental and training purposes.
'This would be an elegant way out,' an expert in the OECD negotiations said.
To date, France has refused to follow Spain, Portugal and Belgium in winning
an extra period to phase out subsidies under the OECD accord by agreeing to
further capacity cuts. 'We have restructured enough,' said one French
official, citing the drop in the number of French-built merchant ships from
25,000 in 1975 to 4,800 now.
'But the Commission has suggested we come up with a plan that takes account
of past restructuring expenses,' such as redundancy payments, the official
said yesterday. Brussels officials stressed, however, they were suggesting
nothing that would break an agreement which has the support of 11 other EU
members, as well as the signatures of the US, Japan, South Korea, Finland,
Norway and Sweden.
French officials believe that Germany will help Paris out of the impasse.
They said the OECD negotiations were triggered by the US threatening
Germany, Japan, Korea and Norway with retaliation for unfair trade
practices, and claimed Paris had been accommodating in letting Bonn raise
subsidies to the Rostock yards in eastern Germany.
The OECD accord allows governments to offer 'home credits' (to a domestic
buyer to buy a domestic ship) equivalent to 'export credits' (for foreign
purchasers of boats built at home). But France complains that, with the
French merchant fleet ranking 36th in the world, it has too few shipowners
left to take advantage of this.
Experts counter that France's problem is that its yards no longer make
enough of the vessels sought by shipowners. Its small-ship construction
sector has specialised in cruise ships and LNG gas carriers, and has
performed well in export markets. Of the 15 ships on order to French
shipowners, only four are being built in French yards.

FT  17 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Israel eyes wider EU trade ties - But
talks stall over pace of drive into Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Israel is seeking long-term strategic economic integration with Europe in
its negotiations over a new trade association agreement due for completion
by the end of the year.
But the negotiations, which made substantial progress earlier this year,
have stalled over differing views of the pace of Israel's economic drive
into Europe.
Israeli officials say they envisage the agreement leading to a fundamentally
new relationship between Israel and Europe under which Israel will be
granted the same status as members of the European Free Trade Association
(Efta) within the framework of the European economic area.
'We want the benefits of economic membership of the EU without political
membership,' said Mr Oded Eran, the co-head of the Israeli negotiating team.
Israel's push towards Europe reflects the growing position of the EU as
Israel's main trading partner. Last year the volume of Israel-EU trade was
Dollars 14.4bn, 40 per cent of Israel's total trade, and is projected to
increase next year to almost 50 per cent.
Senior EU officials say they share the long-term vision of Israel having a
special place in Europe but believe the process should be evolutionary. The
EU is growing increasingly frustrated with Israel's rigid demands in
agriculture and public procurement which could derail efforts to sign the
agreement by the end of the year.
'You can always ask for the moon but we are saying take what you have got
and continue from there,' said Mr Juan Prat, European Commission director
general, on a recent visit to the region.
Mr Prat said the EU had already made considerable concessions to Israel in
the current talks which would institutionalise political dialogue and help
to reduce Israel's Dollars 6bn trade deficit with Europe.
Under the agreement, Israel will become the first non-European country to
gain access to the EU's research and development programme. The EU has also
revised rules of origin and accepted the principle of rules of origin to
allow products resulting from Arab-Israeli joint ventures access to the free
trade area.
The changes in the rules of origin will have a favourable impact on Israeli
exports of high tech, electronic and communications products.
But while Israel has said they are satisfied with these concessions, they
want the EU to open further its agricultural market to cut flowers, easy
peel citrus fruits, table grapes and processed products such as juices.
The move is opposed by southern European states, notably Spain and Italy.
Israel argues the EU must recognise that, as part of the Middle East peace
process, it has opened its markets to Palestinian agricultural produce in
the face of opposition from Israeli farmers and is being asked to make
further trade concessions to Jordan.
Peace with Syria would involve an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights,
further damaging Israeli agriculture.
'We are being asked to make trade concessions to the region to consolidate
peace and, in return, we are asking Europe to make an economic balance by
deeper association,' said Mr Eran. 'Agriculture is the perfect example where
Europe could offset the concessions we made to Palestinians by making
concessions to us.'
Israel is also holding out for concessions in opening of the EU market for
public procurement in telecommunications and says the EU's demand for a
reciprocal opening of all sectors of public procurement would worsen its
trade deficit.
The EU says it accepts Europe must play a critical role in cementing Middle
East peace and is prepared, as a much bigger economy, to make uneven
concessions to Israel but it expects some reciprocity. Mr Prat said Israel
had not complied fully with the 1975 trade agreement. An example, he said,
was Israel forcing a one year certification process on imported tourist
buses from Spain.
Mr Prat said the EU wanted to reduce Israel's trade deficit and the
agreement, as it stands, would considerably help to narrow the deficit. But
he said: 'Israel has a structural trade deficit with the world, including
the European community. . . The agreement will help the trade deficit and
this is our objective but it is not the miraculous solution.'
Ultimately the dispute between Israel and the EU is more about timing.
Israel wants a huge leap forward in economic relations enshrined in the new
association agreement. Europe believes the agreement should grant
considerable benefits now, as a stepping stone towards the fuller economic
integration Israel wants.

FT  17 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Dole seeks review of WTO's decisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senator Robert Dole, the likely majority leader of the US Senate, is
requesting establishment of an eminent person's group to review decisions to
be taken by the new World Trade Organisation and report on them to Congress.
He is also seeking assurances that the US could pull out of the WTO at any
time after it succeeds the General Agreement on Tarrifs and Trade next year.
Mr Dole, who represents the grain-growing state of Kansas, said he was
looking for a way to 'extricate us from the World Trade Organisation, if we
are getting adverse decisions. That's the big sticking point, at least in my
part of the country.'
Mr Dole's suggestions coincided with requests from Republican leaders to
delay a vote on a the Uruguay Round world trade treaty due at the end of the
month. Mr Jesse Helms, of North Carolina and incoming chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to US president Bill Clinton requesting
the vote on liberalising world trade be postponed until early in 1995
because more hearings were needed.
Republicans will take control of both the House and Senate next year and
some Republican lawmakers believe the change in power gives them an chance
to recast the Gatt legislation. Under congressional 'fast track' rules, the
implementing legislation now moving through both Houses cannot be amended.
Mr Leon Panetta, White House chief of staff, has called for bipartisan
co-operation on the Gatt treaty. 'I think all of us recognise the importance
of getting that kind of major trade agreement enacted,' Mr Panetta said. 'It
will be a test of our ability to work together to ensure that we are trying
to protect this country's interest,' he said this week.
The new provisions, as proposed by Senator Dole, could be attached to a
trade bill which would also grant the Administration renewed fast track
authority to negotiate new free trade agreements in Latin America.
Senator Dole, widely expected to run for his party's presidential nomination
in 1996, is seeking to placate the many conservative Republicans who oppose
the WTO on the grounds that it will require the ceding of US sovereignty to
an international organisation.
The Gatt treaty, which took seven years to negotiate, would cut trade
barriers and cut tariffs worldwide.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Deregulation boost for Japan by year 2000: Keidanren sees
short-term rise in unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Full-scale deregulation of the Japanese economy would cause a temporary rise
in unemployment and a drag on growth, leading to a net rise in prosperity in
six years.
That is the main conclusion of a report* by the Keidanren, Japan's leading
business lobby, in support of its campaign to encourage the government to
fulfil promises to curb the administrative controls which constrain an
estimated 40 per cent of industrial activity.
The Keidanren predicts that the collapse of inefficient businesses as a
result of increased competition would wipe Y10,000bn (Pounds 64bn) off gross
domestic product and put 2.84m people out of work in the next few years. A
rise in imports - already evident in trade figures - would come at the cost
of a fall in domestic production, says the study.
By the year 2000 however, consumer prices would have fallen enough to
produce a rise in real incomes and demand, which would feed through to an
eventual rise in output. It cites forecasts of a 20 per cent fall in
consumer prices by 2000, from the present level, around 50 per cent above
average prices in New York, London, Paris and Berlin.
This would lead to a net increase in 740,000 jobs and a Y177,000bn rise in
national wealth over the six years, equivalent to 5 per cent of GDP a year,
according to a Keidanren economic model.
Its forecasts are hypothetical, given the government's reluctance to
deregulate faster than the vested interests which help keep it in power will
allow, and companies' traditional aversion to making redundancies. Yet the
study is one of the clearest analyses yet of the practical problems ahead
for Japan's latest deregulation drive, started just over a year ago by the
former government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa.
To ease the shock of transition to a freer economy, the Keidanren calls for
joint government-private action to improve 'social capital'. By that it
means improving urban infrastructure, telecommunications and improving
Japan's current slim social services.
The study also urges the government to promote venture capital companies, to
encourage small business to flourish in new markets opened up by
deregulation. It calls for tax breaks for start-up companies, financial aid
for their long-term investments and easier listing requirements for the
over-the-counter (OTC) market. OTC listing rules are far higher than in the
US, birthplace of modern venture capitalism, the Keidanren says.
The industries most likely to grow as a result of deregulation include
service sectors, where Japanese productivity lags well behind the US and
Europe, the study suggests. These include, sport, travel,
telecommunications, multi-media and environmental businesses, says the
Keidanren. Irrespective of deregulation, the study forecasts a growth in
services for the elderly, where Japan has the world's fastest ageing
population profile.

Heavy fighting between rival clan forces erupted in Somalia's breakaway
north-western capital of Hargeisa, forcing relief workers and hundreds of
civilians to flee, foreign aid officials said yesterday. Some 20 relief
workers from the United Nations and other agencies had abandoned the town
where fighting raged on Tuesday. The workers were attempting to leave by
road to Burama, about 160km west, the officials said by satellite telephone
from Hargeisa.
Witnesses described scenes of mayhem as hundreds of civilians fled on foot
through the streets of the war-damaged city as the rival clans duelled with
mortars, anti-aircraft guns and small arms fire. The number of casualties is
not yet clear. The fighting was between Habr Awal clan militias loyal to Mr
Mohammed Ibrahim Egal, the 'president' of the breakaway republic of
Somaliland, and Habr Yunis militias loyal to the north-western region's
former ruler, Mr Abdurahman Ahmed Ali 'Tur'. North-western Somalia was
devastated by a civil war which erupted in 1988 and spread to the southern
capital of Mogadishu.

North Korean diplomats told United Nations atomic safeguards officials
yesterday that inspectors could leave for North Korea as soon as possible to
begin some measures to monitor a nuclear freeze, UN officials said. Mr Kim
Gwang-sop, North Korea's ambassador in Vienna, said the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) should also send a technical team to Pyongyang to
discuss details of monitoring the freeze agreed with the US in a
breakthrough accord last month. 'This was a good start,' said Mr Hans Meyer,
IAEA spokesman, at the end of talks between Mr Kim and IAEA safeguards
department chief Mr Bruno Pellaud at the agency headquarters in Vienna. 'Our
technical team could leave for North Korea by the weekend,' he said.
North Korea pledged in its agreement with Washington to halt activities at
its nuclear sites and stop construction of two new nuclear reactors in
return for modern western nuclear technology, in an operation estimated to
cost Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.56bn).

FT  17 NOV 94 / Aborigine fund move defeated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Efforts to increase significantly the money available to a federally
constituted Aboriginal land fund were defeated yesterday in the Senate, the
Australian parliament's upper house. The fund is designed to acquire land on
behalf of the vast majority of Aborigines who will see no practical benefit
from the country's Native Title legislation, which was passed with much
difficulty last year. The Native Title act was the first piece of
legislation to acknowledge that Australia was inhabited before European
settlement.
At that stage the government promised to set up a land fund to make
acquisitions on behalf of dispossessed Aborigines. However, when details of
the scheme were released, critics said it was too small to be viable, and
poorly structured. Amendments put forward, but defeated in the Senate
yesterday, would have increased funds flowing into the land fund to ADollars
15bn (Pounds 7bn) over a 10-year period. The current government plan is for
just ADollars 1.4bn, over the same decade - with much of this money being
invested to ensure that the fund is self-sustaining in 10 years.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australia doubled in size yesterday, as it formally claimed massive new
offshore territory under an international 'law of the sea' convention. The
1982 United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea, which was finally
ratified this year, aims to divide about 35 per cent of the world's oceans
among over 100 countries. In Australia's case it means that the country can
claim an exclusive economic zone extending 200 nautical miles from its
baselines, instead of the traditional 12 miles.
Because of the nation's extensive coastline it is now claiming around 5.7m
sq miles of ocean water, of which 4.2m sq miles derives from the new
extended nautical limits. As a result, Australia can boast one of the
largest 'exclusive economic zones' in the world.
While much of the additional territory is undisputed, there is disagreement
with Indonesia over territory around Christmas Island and off the north
coast of Australia, including the resource-rich Timor Gap.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The strains of recession continue to take their toll of corporate Japan,
even into the beginning of the economic upturn, as shown by a sharp rise in
bankruptcy debts last month. Debts left by corporate collapses rose by
nearly half from September to Y845bn (Pounds 5.4bn) in October, just over
double the level the same time last year, according to Teikoku Databank, a
private credit research agency.
The figures are always volatile, distorted in this case by the Y518.5bn
bankruptcy of Nippon Mortgage, the third largest business collapse of
post-war years. They nevertheless highlight the continuing weakness of
corporate balance sheets. However, there was good news in the number of
company collapses, down by 2.5 per cent from a year earlier, for the fourth
month in a row. Nearly two thirds blamed their failure on the recession,
while a mere 10 out of the total of 1,226 October bankruptcies cited the
yen's strength as the reason for their collapse.

<TEXT>
Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, is suing three of China's biggest
trading companies for allegedly failing to pay nearly Dollars 100m (Pounds
64m) in debts arising from foreign exchange trading.
China United Petroleum Chemicals (Unipec), International Non-Ferrous Metals
Trading (Minmetals) and China National Metals and Minerals Import and Export
(CNM) have been given 30 days to appear before the US district court in New
York to answer the claim.
According to documents lodged with the court, Lehman claims that Unipec owes
it Dollars 44m, plus interest, arising from losses incurred in its foreign
exchange and swap trading activities with the bank from May until August
this year. Lehman claims a further Dollars 55.5m, plus interest, from
Minmetals and CNM for losses arising from similar transactions over the same
period.
The suits were filed on Tuesday and have stunned bankers in Beijing and Hong
Kong. They said that the companies concerned were trying to raise bank
finance and that, if the suits drag on, then international banks may be wary
of lending to them.
'These companies have extensive international involvement,' said one
European banker stationed in Beijing. 'Foreign banks have something to lose
here, but China has more to lose from this action.'
Lehman's decision to seek legal redress follows failed negotiations with the
companies. In a statement, Lehman said the lawsuits should be viewed 'only
as a necessary step toward resolving a commercial dispute with two
customers'.
None of the Chinese companies concerned has made any comment.
The bank's lawsuit comes at a time, however, of increasing frustration with
lending in China. Some bankers said yesterday that the suit might indicate
that western financiers would be more public in seeking recovery of unpaid
debts.
At the weekend it emerged that 31 foreign banks had petitioned Mr Zhu
Rongji, China's economy minister, to help them recover Dollars 600m in loans
to Chinese state industry which had gone bad.
The petition was submitted to Mr Zhu last month, the Tokyo newspaper, Nihon
Keizai Shimbun, reported. The loans are believed to date back to the early
1980s and many of them are connected to leasing. Of the banks concerned, 24
of them are Japanese with total loans to Chinese industry outstanding of
Dollars 1.8bn.
Bankers also said that problems the London Metals Exchange had encountered
with China International Trust and Investment Corporation (Citic) had not
engendered confidence in China. Citic Shanghai, a wholly-owned subsidiary,
is alleged to have defaulted on obligations of between Dollars 30m and
Dollars 50m arising from futures trading on the LME earlier this year.
Citic's initial response was to claim that the trading by Citic Shanghai was
unauthorised and therefore not the responsibility of the parent company.
Recently, however, it had indicated it would make good its obligations,
bankers said yesterday.
'Citic is one of the very best names and we can do nothing but assume that
they will settle the bill,' said one.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Unita urges UN truce observers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Angolan rebel movement Unita yesterday urged the United Nations to place
observers in the African country's battle zones to guarantee a truce due to
be effect last night, Reuter reports from Lisbon and Luanda.
Unita's Lisbon office said in a statement that government forces could not
be trusted to observe the truce, which is due to hold until a formal
ceasefire is declared after a new peace accord is signed on Sunday.
'Unless the truce is followed by the rapid placing of Unavem (United Nations
Verification Mission) observers in the areas where military activity is most
intense, there is no guarantee that the government will order its generals
and mercenaries to stop their attacks,' it said.
The truce came after talks in Lusaka by opposing commanders in a conflict
which has killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced millions and
ruined the economy of the diamond- and oil-rich country.
The rebel statement said Unita did not trust the government's declared
commitment to national reconciliation in view of the offensive it had
launched since the two sides initialled the new peace agreement in Lusaka on
October 31.
The offensive has led to the government's capture of Huambo, a Unita
stronghold in the central highlands, the oil town of Soyo and Mbanza Congo,
the capital of Zaire province in northern Angola.
Representatives of both sides met in Lusaka secretly yesterday. Officials
close to the talks said details of the session were not expected to be made
public before the weekend.
There has been no reaction so far from either President Eduardo dos Santos
or Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader, to the truce declaration.
Military analysts said the truce merely halted immediate hostilities and
details of the ceasefire, including the thorny issues of the security of Mr
Savimbi and other leaders of Unita and the planned disarming of guerrillas,
had to be sorted out before Sunday.
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki yesterday ruled out deployment of
a southern African intervention force to rescue the peace process in Angola.
Responding to questions in parliament, Mr Mbeki dismissed reports that South
Africa had considered joining a force to enter Angola when it appeared that
a peace accord would not be signed.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Syrian executions concern Amnesty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AP

<TEXT>
Amnesty International expressed concern yesterday about an apparent increase
in the number of executions in Syria and a lack of fair trials in
death-penalty cases, AP reports. The group reiterated its longstanding
concern about the cases of thousands of political prisoners in Syria. The
statement came after the first visit to Syria by a team from the
London-based international human rights group for talks with high-level
officials.
Amnesty described as 'positive' Mr Assad's release of thousands of political
prisoners since 1991, but said there had been little progress made in
reviewing the cases of others, some of whom have been jailed for more than
two decades.
Amnesty said that during its visit, the delegation raised the cases of more
than 1,000 people, including prisoners detained without trial, those held
even after expiration of their sentence, torture allegations and cases of
people who simply 'disappeared'.
The number of political prisoners in Syria runs in the thousands, Amnesty
says, conceding that an exact figure is impossible to obtain under current
circumstances. Some of the longest-standing political prisoners in Syria are
senior politicians jailed after Mr Assad's bloodless coup in 1970.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Kenya does a tidy-up before investors meet: Leslie Crawford
weighs economic reform commitment on day of London conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The end of the year usually heralds a flurry of economic reforms in Kenya.
The proximity of the annual meeting of donor governments and reviews by the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank help concentrate the minds of
policy makers as they struggle to meet targets to qualify for more aid.
This year has been no exception. Earlier this month, Mr Musalia Mudavadi,
Kenya's finance minister, deregulated the oil industry - the last remaining
sector of the economy subject to price controls.
Mr Mudavadi also announced that civil servants in his own ministry and the
central bank were under investigation for the irregular payment of billions
of shillings in export compensation last year to a trading firm, Goldenberg
International. Its owner, Mr Kamlesh Pattni, who was charged with corruption
earlier this year and later released on bail, is back in prison.
The actions appear to have been prompted by the need to convince donors that
Kenya is committed to open government as well as an open economy. The slow
judicial investigation into the Goldenberg affair - the biggest embezzlement
of public funds in Kenya's history - had led many Kenyans to believe it
involved powerful godfathers within President Daniel arap Moi's government.
The last-minute house-cleaning may also have been inspired by President
Moi's visit to London this week, where he is expected to inaugurate an
investors' conference today. The meeting, organised by the Confederation of
British Industry, hopes to sell Kenya as a reformed economy with good
investment opportunities.
Rapid deregulation over the past 18 months has produced some encouraging
results. Inflation has fallen from a peak of more than 100 per cent in early
1993 to an annualised rate of about 13 per cent.
Record prices for coffee will boost export earnings this year. After the
removal of exchange controls, the Kenya shilling has, against expectations,
appreciated against the dollar, while the central bank has accumulated
Dollars 800m in foreign exchange reserves, equivalent to six months'
imports.
With good rains promising a bumper maize harvest, and a strong shilling, Mr
Mudavadi believes the goals of price and currency stability are within
reach. 'The economy is moving towards single-digit inflation, which it last
encountered in 1987,' he told a recent meeting of Kenyan employers.
But for the past three years, economic growth has been less than half the
annual 3 per cent increase in population. Manufacturing is hurting from high
domestic interest rates and a flood of cheap imports, while the strong
shilling has eroded the profitability of the tourist industry. Despite a 10
per cent increase in tourist arrivals this year, most hotels on the Mombasa
coast say they are operating at a loss.
'The government is acutely aware that in order to maintain social peace, the
economy must create 450,000 jobs a year,' says the director of a
multinational company in Nairobi. 'And in order to do so private investment
must be revived.'
The London conference marks Kenya's first attempt in many years to attract
foreign direct investment into the country. Hopes are running high, but the
outcome may fall short of expectations.
'Kenya is only likely to see incremental amounts of new investment from
companies already based in East Africa,' says one businessman who will be
attending the conference. Kenya is a latecomer to the liberalisation game,
having embarked on economic reform a decade later than Latin America and 20
years after south-east Asia. Its 26m citizens are too impoverished to
provide an attractive domestic market for foreign manufacturers, while the
pursuit of export-led growth stumbles over innumerable obstacles: the
distance from export markets, a dilapidated infrastructure, a
poorly-educated workforce and competition from other third world countries
following similar strategies.
There are also lingering doubts about President Moi's commitment to staying
the course, particularly if benefits are slow to materialise. He has reneged
on the reform process before - reimposing exchange controls in March 1993
and banning grain imports in August this year.
Although both relapses were corrected, they reveal deep schisms within
government over the policies adopted over the past 18 months. Mr Mudavadi
and central bank governor Mr Micah Cheserem have often looked lonely and
exposed as the principal champions of reform.
Much remains to be done, mainly in areas in which IMF technocrats fear to
tread. The modernisation of the economy would proceed more rapidly, and far
more smoothly, if its die-hard opponents were removed from senior positions
in the civil service, the ruling Kanu party and President Moi's inner circle
of advisers.
Political infighting has delayed the government's privatisation programme,
while a weak judiciary, beholden to its political masters, has made little
progress in investigating a host of financial scandals that robbed the
exchequer of some Ks30bn (Pounds 461m) - 10 per cent of GDP - last year.
Economic liberalisation, however, is creating a groundswell for fundamental
political change far greater than the social protests which brought about
democratic elections in 1992. Forced to compete, businessmen have become far
more critical of the system of political patronage which has made a few
individuals immensely wealthy and rendered them above the law.
'Kenya has changed,' says Mr Raphael Waita, deputy managing director of
Caltex Oil Kenya. 'Liberalisation has reduced corruption. We don't have to
kneel before government officials any more. What we now need is a clear
legal framework that creates a fair competitive environment for everyone.'

FT  17 NOV 94 / Vietnam gets Dollars 2bn in new assistance: Achievement
boosting growth to 8.5% warmly endorsed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Vietnam was yesterday promised Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.26bn) in new assistance
at a foreign aid donors conference in Paris which warmly endorsed the
country's achievement in boosting economic growth this year to 8.5 per cent
while keeping inflation low.
The new aid comes on top of Dollars 1.8bn pledged last year to Vietnam,
whose development efforts 'deserved large-scale support from the
international community,' according to a communique issued at the end of the
two day conference which was chaired by the World Bank.
'Vietnam is on the right track,' Mr Callisto Modava, a regional director of
the World Bank, said of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's economic reform
policies.
'It has the right vision and is producing results,' he said.
'This country clearly has the potential to be a real success story.'
However, the Vietnamese delegation led by Mr Do Quoc Sam, chairman of the
state planning committee, admitted that it had some problems in using some
of the aid it received last year, and it promised to streamline its
bureaucracy dealing with development aid and project implementation.
Of the aid pledged last year, about Dollars 400m had been disbursed.
Mr Madavo said said the disbursement difficulties stemmed from Vietnam's
unfamiliarity with identifying suitable projects for receiving aid and the
different procedures among individual donor nations for releasing cash.
It was not surprising there had been delays as this had been Vietnam's first
year of dealing with donor nations, he added.
Vietnamese officials emphasised their government's 1995 priorities of
reforming state enterprises and the budget, boosting private industry and
agriculture, modernising the financial system and further opening the
economy to foreign investment and trade.
The meeting concluded with agreement that alleviating poverty, protecting
the environment and reforming public administration should be aid
priorities.
In absolute terms Vietnamese remain very poor, despite rapid recent
improvement.
Ten European countries plus Canada, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and
Australia attended the Paris meeting as donors, while the US participated as
an observer and made no bilateral pledges.
However, Republican Senator Christopher Bond of Missouri was reported during
a visit to Hanoi as promising Vietnamese leaders that the new Republican
majorities in both houses of the US Congress would continue efforts to
improve relations between the two countries.
The US only lifted its trade embargo last year, 18 years after US troops
quit Vietnam.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Landmine sale ban agreed by 22 states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An estimated 22 countries have reached a tentative agreement to ban
international sales of anti-personnel landmines, US officials said
yesterday.
Mr Ralph Earle, deputy director of the US arms control and disarmament
agency, said the agreement came at a meeting of officials working on a
successor to the co-ordinating committee on multilateral export controls
(Cocom), the cold war organisation created to stop the sale of military
technology to the former Warsaw pact.
'They're not addressing tank-killers, they're addressing baby-killers,' Mr
Earle said.
A ban on anti-personnel mine sales would be a first step towards meeting
President Bill Clinton's promise, in a speech to the United Nations general
assembly in September, to throw US weight behind UN efforts to eliminate
anti-personnel mines.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, has argued for much
tougher restrictions on anti-personnel landmines, of which US officials
estimate there are around 85m now scattered in 62 countries.
Discussions are afoot on installing self-destruction devices to prevent such
mines from continuing to claim civilian lives for years after the war in
which they were originally spread.
The Cocom group includes members of Nato as well as Japan, New Zealand and
European non-Nato members such as Ireland and Sweden, but it was dissolved
earlier this year in recognition of the end of the cold war.
Russia wants to join in the regime that succeeds Cocom, which would be aimed
principally at stopping the export of military technology to what the US
calls 'outlaw nations' such as Iran and Iraq.

FT  17 NOV 94 / US arms policy in firing line: Export credit debate holds up
rethink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration's plans to draft a new policy on arms sales
overseas remain hobbled by an argument over whether to provide government
financing to arms exporters.
A draft presidential security directive on conventional arms transfers,
originally intended to be completed by the end of last year, has been
sitting in President Bill Clinton's in-tray at the White House for nearly
two months.
Although the different government agencies that have contributed to the
review have reached general consensus on most of the policy, they remain
divided over the question of an export financing facility.
The defence industry has lobbied hard for an agreement that would give them
access to export credit guarantees once the US government has decided on
national security grounds whether a particular weapons system can be sold to
a particular country.
Administration officials involved with the directive say there has been 'no
recent movement' towards a decision, but remain hopeful one can be taken
soon. However, Mr Clinton will have to resolve the export financing dispute
between government agencies before he signs the directive.
'It's an important issue, but it's not driven by an immediate crisis, like
everything else around here,' said one administration official.
'It's chicken and egg. We can't have an export financing facility until we
have a conventional arms transfer policy, but one of the reasons they're
having trouble with the policy is that they are held up on export
financing,' said a defence industry executive.
The basic lines of the directive are understood not to differ much from
existing policy.
'The basic reason for selling weapons overseas has been to advance our
foreign policy goals. It will remain to advance our foreignpolicy goals,'
said Mr Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman.
Nevertheless, the draft directive includes a recommendation that the US pay
explicit attention to the strength of the US defence industrial base in its
decisions.
Mr William Perry, the defence secretary, said that the impact of foreign
sales on the industrial base could play a particular role in a decision on
whether to sell Lockheed's F-16 fighter aircraft to Latin America. But Mr
Perry, who is visiting Brazil, said the health of the US defence industry
would be 'a secondary consideration'. The US has previously been reluctant
to sell advanced fighters such as the F-16 to Latin America.
Industry officials say the industrial base issue is unlikely to make much
difference, since most arms sales are made to close allies where little
controversy arises.
'We're not going to start selling aircraft to Iraq in order to keep one of
our fighter lines open,' says Mr Joel Johnson, vice-president for
international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association, a
Washington-based trade group.
The issue of US arms sales has become more sensitive in the light of recent
statistics showing that the US has become the world's leading arms supplier.
Between 1990 and 1993, according to a study by the Congressional Research
Service, the US's share of world arms sales rose from 42 per cent to 70 per
cent.
Industry officials point out, however, that much of this apparent surge
results from an increase in arms exports to Middle Eastern allies in the
aftermath of Desert Storm and from the dwindling of Russian exports.
The Pentagon says that US overseas military sales declined from Dollars
33.2bn (Pounds 20.2bn) in the 1993 fiscal year to Dollars 12.9bn in fiscal
1994, which ended on September 30.
These sales are expected to range from Dollars 9bn to Dollars 10.5bn over
the next three years.
But overseas sales are going to be particularly vital in an environment
where the Pentagon's own military procurement has halved and where Mr John
Deutch, the undersecretary of defence, is on the point of deciding which of
a long list including virtually all the big weapons systems under
development should be axed.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Important oil concession to be handed back to Colombia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Royal Dutch/Shell subsidiary today hands back an important oil concession
to Colombia's state-owned oil company, Ecopetrol, after the government
declined to extend its operating contract, reports Stephen Fidler.
The subsidiary, Hocol, took over the 16,000 bpd concession from Tenneco in
1988. The concession, Nieva 540, consists of 10 fields and 134 oil wells
about 150 miles south-west of Bogota. Hocol said it was disappointed and
would appeal against the decision.
The move follows an unsuccessful round of oil and gas tenders this year, in
which bids were submitted for only four of the 21 exploration blocks on
offer.
Mr David Battman, of Control Risks Group in London, says security remains a
concern for oil companies operating in the country. But after having 'shot
itself in the foot over Shell', the government must be 'seen to make more
effort to entice foreign capital and expertise with more attractive contract
terms and guarantees on taxation levels,' he said.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Inflation in US slows to annual rate of 2.6%: Fall is likely
to anger Fed's critics

US inflation slowed again last month, the Labour Department reported
yesterday, giving fresh ammunition to critics of the Federal Reserve's
decision on Tuesday to raise interest rates by  3/4 of a percentage point in
order to head off inflationary pressures.
The consumer price index rose by 0.1 per cent in October, the department
reported, the smallest monthly increase since April. Over the last 12 months
the index has risen by just 2.6 per cent, much slower than September's
year-on-year inflation rate of 3.0 per cent.
Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the inflation index rose by 0.2
per cent in October for a year-on-year increase of 2.9 per cent.
Food and drink prices remained unchanged in October and have increased by
2.2 per cent over the last 12 months. Energy prices fell 0.9 per cent in
October and have gained just 0.4 per cent over the last year.
Apparel, upkeep and transportation prices fell in October, while medical
care, entertainment and other goods and services increased in price.
Although yesterday's figures showed that inflation remains restrained, the
Labour Department announced yesterday that it planned to make significant
changes to the way it calculates the index, which many economists, including
the Federal Reserve, believe overstates the real rate of inflation.
The changes will address the way prices are calculated for food eaten at
home, rents and patented drugs.
But critics of the index say that because the Labour Department still uses
fixed weights for the basket of goods and services included in the index it
will still exaggerate the rate of inflation.
A recent study by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimated
that several different biases cause the CPI to overstate inflation by just
under 1 per cent a year.
A downwards revision in the inflation index could help the federal
government keep its budget deficit under better control, because the index
is used to calculate cost of living adjustments for government wages and
retirement pay as well as social benefits such as social security pensions.
In a separate announcement, the Commerce Department said business
inventories rose in September for the sixth successive month, increasing by
0.5 per cent to a seasonally adjusted total of Dollars 907.2bn (Pounds
553.1bn)
Inventories have risen sharply in recent months, but they remain at
historically low levels, and the ratio of inventories to sales climbed only
0.01 from the historic low it reached in August to 1.4 in September,

FT  17 NOV 94 / Venezuela opens its oil sector to private capital:
Exploration tenders sought for first time since nationalisation in 1976
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuela's national oil company has developed a programme to open its
exploration and production sectors to private capital for the first time
since the oil industry was nationalised in 1976.
Petroleos de Venezuela, PDVSA, plans to seek tenders on profit-sharing
contracts, under which private companies will be allowed to explore about 10
geographical areas onshore and offshore.
Successful companies must finance all exploration themselves. If commercial
quantities of crude oil or natural gas are discovered, the private investor
will then set up a joint venture with one of PDVSA's operating subsidiaries
 -Corpoven, Lagoven or Maraven - to develop the new fields and market the
oil internationally.
If no oil or gas is found in commercial quantities, the private party bears
the loss.
The PDVSA plan must still be approved by the cabinet of President Rafael
Caldera and by a joint session of the Venezuelan Congress. PDVSA officials
expect no big problems.
PDVSA, one of the world's largest oil companies, has extensive proven
reserves of heavy crude oil and bitumen, but wants to boost its reserves of
higher-value light and medium crudes to stay competitive internationally. At
end-1993, PDVSA's proven reserves of crude oil stood at 64.5bn barrels, the
largest in the western hemisphere.
Executives at PDVSA say geological and seismic studies indicate that the
country still has large, undiscovered deposits of light and medium crude
oils. Exploration of the most promising areas by PDVSA on its own would
require capital investments of Dollars 6bn-8bn, taking more than 25 years.
However, PDVSA expects that if private investors join the effort to find
oil, exploration of these same areas could be completed in 10 years, with
all exploration investment paid for by private companies.
The areas to be put up for tender could hold between 7bn and 23bn barrels of
light/medium crudes, plus 10,000bn cubic feet of gas, according to estimates
made by PDVSA after a British Petroleum survey.
Winning bidders will be chosen on the basis of how much of their future
after-tax profits they are willing to hand over to the state if they find
oil and gas. PDVSA says that according to risk contacts offered in other
countries, the state keeps between 71 and 88 per cent of after-tax earnings,
with the remainder going to private investors.
In developing its proposals, PDVSA has been mindful of the failure of this
year's round of oil and gas tenders in neighbouring Colombia. But while
international oil companies such as Exxon, Shell, BP, Amoco and others have
shown considerable interest in the Venezuelan plan, they have some
reservations.
For example, some would prefer a transparent mechanism that would reduce
their payments to the state to encourage them to develop profitably any
smaller, more remote fields. The government is working on a plan which would
offer possible post facto reductions in royalty payments in such cases.
Companies have also expressed concern about government policy, including
strict controls on foreign exchange transactions and the suspension of
constitutional rights to private property.
PDVSA and the government are working on possible solutions. PDVSA managers
point out, for example, that when investors are ready to repatriate profits,
probably in several years, exchange controls should have been lifted or
softened.
'Venezuela is without doubt one of the most attractive countries for risk
investment in exploration,' said the local representative of a US oil
company. 'If PDVSA can work out the kinks, they should receive a strong
response from bidders, and could obtain several billion dollars in
exploration and development capital over the next decade.'
Venezuela has been slowly opening up its nationalised oil industry for the
last few years. Under the previous government, private oil companies were
allowed to produce crude and natural gas under operating contracts in
so-called marginal (relatively small) oil fields. But in these cases, the
operator is paid on a per-barrel basis by PDVSA; the oil does not belong to
the private investor and must be turned over to PDVSA.
Several important joint ventures between PDVSA units and foreign companies
have been established in producing natural gas and upgrading heavy oil, but
none has begun to operate. Until now, exploration for and production of
crude oil (for eventual sale) had been off limits to private investors.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Cardoso secures clear win in main Brazilian states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's president-elect Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso emerged as the biggest
winner from Tuesday's gubernatorial elections after candidates from his
centre-left Social Democracy party (PSDB) won in two of the country's most
important states and looked set for victory in a third.
The PSDB's strong showing should help Mr Cardoso attract support to build a
majority in Congress and will strengthen his bargaining power in
negotiations over appointments to his government, set to take office on
January 1.
The PSDB's most important victories came in the state of Sao Paulo, where
former senator Mr Mario Covas won easily, and in Minas Gerais, where Mr
Eduardo Azeredo was proclaimed winner with more than 90 per cent of votes
counted. In Rio de Janeiro, where vote counting was proceeding very slowly,
exit polls showed the PSDB candidate to be the clear winner.
Control over these three states, which account for about 60 per cent of
Brazil's GDP, should help Mr Cardoso maintain the fight against inflation
and underpin the new Real currency, which he planned when finance minister.
PSDB candidates were also declared to have won in the northeastern state of
Sergipe and to be well ahead in Para. Including a state won in first round
elections last month, the PSDB now controls six of Brazil's 27 states,
compared to only one before the polls. Only the Democratic Movement (PMDB),
Brazil's biggest political party, controls more states and looks set to
elect at least eight governors.
In Rio, where the army took to the streets and manned polling stations
following widespread fraud at aborted elections last month, voting was
peaceful. The restaged elections, for state and federal legislators, delayed
vote counting in the gubernatorial race. Once counting is completed, the
army is likely to prepare its next move against the city's drug traffickers,
approved by the federal government two weeks ago.
The left-wing Workers Party (PT), whose candidate Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da
Silva lost to Mr Cardoso in the presidential race, succeeded in electing its
first ever governors. The PT won the small southern state of Esprito Santo
and a second candidate looked set to win in the capital, Braslia.
The big loser was the right-wing Liberal Front party, which appeared to have
won only one state, Bahia.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Cubans court UN rights watchdog
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HAVANA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The United Nations' top human rights watchdog began a visit to Cuba
yesterday by meeting political dissidents ahead of formal talks with the
Cuban government.
Mr Jose Ayala Lasso, the Ecuadorean diplomat newly appointed UN high
commissioner for human rights, was in Havana at the invitation of the Cuban
government, normally sensitive to international criticism of its human
rights record.
Reacting to Mr Ayala's meeting with the three moderate dissidents, Mr
Roberto Robaina, Cuba's foreign minister, said the official was free to
speak to whom he wished. 'We want to show the world that, as far as human
rights are concerned, Cuba has nothing to hide.'
Mr Elizardo Sanchez, one of the dissidents who met Mr Ayala, said they gave
him a list of 1,195 persons allegedly being held in Cuban jails for
political offences ranging from rebellion to criticising Cuba's one-party
communist government and leadership.
Mr Robaina said the human rights issue was being manipulated by the US in a
politically motivated propaganda campaign against Cuba. US-sponsored
resolutions passed by the Geneva-based UN High Commissioner for Human Rights
have condemned the widespread jailing of political dissidents and other
rights violations on the island. Other human rights organisations have made
similar charges.
Mr Ayala risks angering his Cuban hosts if he endorses existing accusations
against Cuba, but he could be accused of pandering to the government if he
fails to probe alleged rights violations.
The Cuban government was expected to press its argument that one of the
biggest violations against the rights of the Cuban people was the US
economic embargo.

FT  17 NOV 94 / EU may change banks' property loan rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union is considering changing the rules which govern the amount
of capital banks have to set aside against commercial property loans. There
are loans of Ecu580bn (Pounds 456bn) in the EU.
Under the terms of a deal agreed by EU governments in 1989, banks in
Germany, Denmark and Greece provide only half the amount of capital against
commercial mortgages as their counterparts in other member states.
The regulations must be harmonised by 1 January 1996.
Banks in the three countries could be asked to set aside an estimated
Ecu4.7bn additional capital to bring them into line. Alternatively, the
rules which apply in these countries could be introduced across the EU.
Any change could have a marked impact on the structure of corporate lending
in Europe and on the behaviour of property markets.
The European Commission has asked a group including Britain's Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors, City University Business School,
WestDeutsche Landesbank and Compagnie Bancaire to
consider whether the rules distort the market and whether they should be
removed or applied generally, which would have the effect of increasing
banks' capacity to lend against property.
Mr Peter Champness, who will chair the research panel on behalf of the Royal
Institution, said: 'German banks would be particularly affected by a
requirement for higher ratios and their exposure to property-related lending
is significant throughout Europe.'
The European Mortgage Federation, which represents mortgage banks, said that
institutions in Germany, Denmark and Greece would have to reduce lending
activity and increase interest rates by about 0.25 per cent if they are
forced to set aside additional capital.
It is calling for the lower capital requirement which applies in these
countries to be extended to all member states.
The Federation argues that mortgages are less risky than other forms of
commercial lending if professional property valuations are carried out and
regulations governing loan-to-value ratios are in force.
For example, commercial mortgages only qualify for the lower capital
requirement in Germany if the sum borrowed does not exceed 60 per cent of
the value of the property.
Some national bank regulators are likely to oppose such a change on the
grounds that it would take the EU out of step with international banking
regulations.
The Basle Accord on capital adequacy, which sets capital requirements for
international banks, treats mortgages in the same way as other commercial
loans. The Federation said that the Basle regulations were designed to cover
large international banks while European legislation deals with national
institutions which are not exposed to the same risks.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Europe's long term outlook gloomy but. . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly half the respondents in a survey of European business leaders
published today think China and south-east Asia are likely to outstrip North
America and Europe in economic power by early next century.
Europe's leading industrialists are increasingly confident about the
short-term business outlook, but around one-third say they will continue to
cut back their workforces.
They show considerable pessimism about the continent's long-term ability to
stand up to international competition, particularly from Asia.
The survey was carried out among 1,500 companies in Germany, France, the UK,
Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Belgium by Harris Research for US-based
United Parcel Service.
Executives overwhelmingly favour more flexible labour laws to improve
Europe's poor job prospects. Support for more flexibility in employment
legislation is particularly strong in Germany, which has one of Europe's
most regulated labour markets.
Seventy per cent of companies say Europe is not investing enough in
research, while 56 per cent say investment in training is inadequate.
Some 28 per cent of European companies believe western Europe offers the
worst potential for manufacturing investment among the world's main economic
regions during the next 15 years, while 75 per cent say south-east Asia and
China will be the best area for investment.
China topped the list by a wide margin of eastern and south-east Asian
countries favoured as investment locations, with 64 per cent of respondents
naming it as the country with the greatest potential for investment. The
next most favoured country, South Korea, was cited by only 7 per cent of
companies, while only 1 per cent named Japan as the country with the
greatest potential.
Some 45 per cent of respondents think south-east Asia and China will be the
world's most economically powerful region in 10 to 15 years.
While 41 per cent of companies believe North America will have the strongest
economy by 2010, only 11 per cent believe western Europe will.
Business leaders are lukewarm about the European Union's capacity to help
them improve competitive performance. A total of 45 per cent say the EU
makes no difference to their ability to compete, with 42 per cent saying the
EU is helpful and 12 per cent it is a hindrance.
German companies have the most positive view on the EU's support for
competitiveness, with British, Italian and French businesses the most
negative.
Asked about recipes for improving Europe's poor jobs outlook, 69 per cent of
companies argue for more labour market flexibility. Support is highest in
Germany (91 per cent), the UK (77 per cent), Netherlands (69 per cent) and
Spain (68 per cent).
Only 12 per cent of companies want government intervention to create jobs,
but 17 per cent back the levying of duties on countries with low labour and
environmental standards - a view supported by 45 per cent of French
companies.
The survey offers widespread support for the idea of varying degrees of
integration among EU states. Some 58 per cent see a 'two-speed Europe' as
acceptable in the short term, with 22 per cent favouring this in the long
term too. Only 19 per cent - above all, respondents in Spain and Italy -
rule out the idea.
Establishing a common European currency is seen as the main priority for the
European Commission by only 11 per cent of business leaders. Asked what they
think should be the main objective of Mr Jacques Santer, the Commission's
president-designate, 17 per cent favour bringing down unemployment, while 10
per cent say they support closer European political ties.

EUROPE AND THE WORLD: THE VIEW FROM THE BOARDROOM
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
The fourth UPS survey is based on 1,509 interviews carried out by Harris
  among EU business leaders between September 5 and October 17, 1994.

  revenue.
The following countries were included: Belgium (109 interviews), Germany
  (258), UK (257), France (264), Italy (260), Netherlands (105).

FT  17 NOV 94 / . . .short term business confidence bubbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business confidence in the European Union has gained ground substantially,
led by optimism in Spain, the Netherlands, Italy and the UK, according to
the UPS survey.
However, only one-fifth of companies plan to increase their workforces
during the next 12 months, underlining how employment prospects across
Europe remain bleak.
A total of 72 per cent of companies believe their economic position will be
better in 12 months, with only 2 per cent saying it will be worse - the
highest optimism rating since the survey was started two years ago.
The net balance of companies reporting optimism rather than pessimism about
prospects has widened to 70 per cent from 48 per cent in the autumn 1993 UPS
survey, and only 19 per cent in 1992.
In Spain, 84 per cent of respondents believe their economic position will
improve, compared with 80 per cent in the Netherlands, 74 per cent in the
UK, 73 per cent in Italy and 72 per cent in Belgium.
However, 32 per cent of companies plan to reduce staff during the next 12
months, with only 21 per cent planning employment increases and 46 per cent
saying their workforces will remain the same. Propensity to reduce staff is
particularly large in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, where
respectively 53 per cent, 37 per cent and 35 per cent forecast falling
employment.
In spite of relatively poor German job prospects, the survey shows a marked
increase in confidence in Germany's position as a manufacturing base. Some
28 per cent of respondents say Germany offers the best potential for
manufacturing in western Europe, with Spain favoured by 18 per cent of
companies and Britain by 13 per cent.
Among eastern European countries, the Czech republic is seen by 32 per cent
of companies as offering the best potential for manufacturing investment,
followed by Poland (22 per cent) and Hungary (20 per cent).

FT  17 NOV 94 / Conde's fall felt in Wall Street and the palace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
As the legal noose tightens on Mr Mario Conde, the repercussions will be
felt from Wall Street, home of JP Morgan, the prestigious US investment bank
that became the Spanish banker's firm ally last year, to the Zarzuela
Palace, home of King Juan Carlos where Mr Conde was a welcome visitor.
On Tuesday, a Madrid high court prosecutor accused the former chairman of
Banco Espanol de Credito, Banesto, of criminal fraud, together with nine
close associates who were senior Banesto executives.
Mr Conde, who was dismissed as Banesto chairman by the Bank of Spain, the
central bank, at the end of last year, was yesterday under virtual house
arrest at his Madrid town mansion. High court judge Mr Manuel Garca
Castellon who is likely to begin questioning Mr Conde next week before
deciding whether to charge him, has ordered police to monitor the banker's
movements. He may not leave the country.
Full details of the criminal fraud accusation have not been released but the
allegations made by the prosecutor centre on a web of intermediary
companies, controlled by Mr Conde and the associates accused with him, that
bought and sold assets within the banking group.
If the flamboyant, 45-year-old financier was unreliable, as is alleged by
prosecutor Mr Florentino Orti and believed by members of a parliamentary
commission that has investigated Banesto, should JP Morgan have helped
Banesto raise more than Dollars 700m from the international markets last
year?
If Mr Conde defrauded Banesto's shareholders during his six-year stint as
chairman of the bank, as alleged, just how gullible were the business,
political and media figures who danced to his tune for so long?
Mr Conde was dismissed as Banesto chairman by the Bank of Spain after an
official inspection discovered that the bank had overvalued its Pta7,000bn
(Dollars 61bn at the time) assets by Pta503bn. The Bank of Spain, which also
removed Mr Conde's fellow board members, said the 'support of the entire
banking system' was required to refloat Banesto.
In April Banesto was acquired by Banco Santander after some Pta780bn in
public and private moneys had been spent on saving it.
Less than four months before Mr Conde's dismissal, JP Morgan had managed a
two-part equity-raising exercise that brought Dollars 775m of fresh capital
into Banesto. Among the new Banesto shareholders was the Corsair fund, a US
portfolio run by JP Morgan which invested Dollars 175m in Mr Conde's bank.
The summer of 1993 saw Mr Conde at the pinnacle of his professional and
social career. He entertained the Spanish royals aboard his yacht.
A few weeks earlier the irrepressible Mr Conde had received an honorary
doctorate from Madrid University and had delivered a lecture on the
responsibilities of civil society to an audience that included fellow bank
chairmen, media moguls, members of the government, ambassadors and King Juan
Carlos himself.
It all ended suddenly when the Bank of Spain moved against Mr Conde. What
has happened between Mr Conde's dramatic removal from Banesto and the formal
accusation delivered to the Madrid high court is that a tale of bad banking
has become one of fraudulent financing.
Last December the Bank of Spain said it had acted against Mr Conde because
of 'gross negligence' in the running of Banesto. In June the Bank of Spain
reported that Banesto's problems appeared to have been based on issues that
went well beyond mismanagement.
Two weeks after he was ousted from Banesto Mr Conde rejected the Bank of
Spain's evaluation of Banesto's loan portfolio and claimed that he was on
course fully to restore the bank's balance sheet under a rescue plan agreed
with JP Morgan. In September Mr Conde published a book that restated these
claims and added new ones: his downfall had been plotted by those in the
establishment who feared his political ambitions.
However over the past months the public prosecutor, with the aid of two Bank
of Spain inspectors and of the new team running Banesto, has built up a case
which alleges that Mr Conde and his associates enriched themselves at the
expense of Banesto's shareholders. Members of the separate parliamentary
inquiry into Banesto's collapse, and who are due to issue their report soon,
say they have reached the same conclusion.
Banesto's present chairman Mr Alfredo Saenz told the parliamentary
commission last month: 'In Banesto there have been cases in which money has
not been lost; it has disappeared and somebody has it.'
Unravelling Mr Conde's business dealings in Banesto will occupy judge Garca
Castellon for months. The judicial proceedings will backtrack on a trail
that started in 1987 when Mr Conde and a partner sold their bulk chemicals
company and used the the proceeds of the Pta65bn disposal to buy into
Banesto, making Mr Conde chairman.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Economic Watch: Dutch industrial production
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial production in the Netherlands rose a seasonally adjusted 2.1 per
cent in September from a year earlier, according to official figures.
Uncorrected output rose 1.8 per cent. However, the seasonally adjusted data
indicate a slight month-on-month decline of 0.3 per cent to an index of
119.2 in September from 119.6 in the previous month, due largely to
relatively low production in the food, tobacco, alcohol and petroleum
sectors.
EU industrial production was up in August for the seventh consecutive month,
the Eurostat statistical office said yesterday. The production index,
adjusted for working days, was up 6.5 per cent compared to the same month a
year earlier.
Prices of consumer goods and service in Poland rose by 2.9 per cent in
October against the previous month, bringing inflation in the first 10
months to 32.4 per cent. The government has been predicting a 32 per cent
rise over the year, compared with 35 per cent in 1993.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Labour pulls rug from under Reynolds: A new coalition is
possible in theory but general elections are the more likely option

The dramatic events yesterday in the Dail, the Irish parliament, leave
Ireland facing a period of political uncertainty and cast new doubt over the
future of the Northern Ireland peace process.
The resignation of Mr Dick Spring, the deputy prime minister and Labour
party leader, and his fellow ministers brings the prospect of early general
elections and the break-up of the 22-month-old Fianna Fail-led government.
It will be viewed in London, in particular, with deep concern.
What is all the more surprising is that this is a government with the
largest majority in the history of the Irish Republic, a track record of
fiscal and monetary rectitude and the fastest economic growth record of any
member of the European Union.
What is more, the coalition, largely through the determination of Mr Albert
Reynolds, the prime minister, has achieved what he rightly claims is the
'biggest breakthrough in Northern Ireland in 25 years' in helping to secure
the IRA's ceasefire.
With the Dail still in a state of shock, attention will shift today to
President Mary Robinson's residence in Phoenix Park.
The political odds are that Mrs Robinson, who made history as the country's
first woman president, will make history again by refusing to grant Mr
Reynolds a dissolution of parliament. Earlier this week she sought
consultations with the head of the Bar Council. Under the constitution the
president can refuse to dissolve the Dail if a prime minister has ceased to
retain majority support. That palpably has now been demonstrated.
The current thinking is that President Robinson would give the parties in
parliament a fixed period, probably a week, to form a new coalition. If
unsuccessful, the government would be forced to go to the country.
As far as the peace process is concerned, all parties, as Sir Patrick
Mayhew, the UK's Northern Ireland secretary, repeated on Tuesday, are
publicly committed to the search for peace as outlined by both governments
in the Joint Declaration.
However, while the hatching of a new government continues, officials say the
negotiations on the framework document to provide a durable peace will have
to be put on hold. In such a limbo, there are growing doubts whether London
will decide to bring Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, into exploratory
discussions by Christmas.
If elections turn out to be unavoidable, it could be well into the new year
before a new administration is in a position to pick up the negotiating
baton on the Northern Ireland peace process.
Irish politics it seems has a cruel way of repeating itself. Just two years
ago an earlier coalition between Fianna Fail and the Progressive Democrats
broke up, on that occasion over allegations relating to the Beef Tribunal,
the investigation into the misuse of official export credits.
The row between Mr Reynolds and Mr Des O'Malley, the then PD leader, forced
an early general election. It seems acutely ironic that the Labour party's
strong showing in that election, securing 33 seats, was due directly to the
anti-Fianna Fail vote. That the party ended up in coalition with Fianna
Fail, the first such coalition in Irish political history, was never
envisaged.
If Mr Reynolds survived that row, it is inconceivable he can survive the
current attacks. Already yesterday there were calls for his resignation.
Last night the name being widely canvassed to replace him was the finance
minister, Mr Bertie Ahern - ironically the only minister who remained on the
front benches together with his party leader throughout his political
ordeal.
In the Dail, party managers were last night weighing up the options. For
Fianna Fail, even with a new leader, a general election would be the only
way back. For Labour, the calculation seems more complicated.
One choice is to try to cobble together a coalition with Fine Gael and one
or other of the Democratic Left or the Progressive Democrats. Current
parliamentary strengths would give a narrow arithmetic majority in the
166-seat legislature.
The possibility is discounted by some politicians who point to Mr Spring's
frosty relations with Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader. Even at the
height of his indictment of Mr Reynolds, the Labour leader could not resist
scoring a few points at Mr Bruton's expense.
The other consideration for Mr Spring is that Labour held six cabinet
portfolios in the last government. It is hard to envisage that a rainbow
coalition would provide the party with so much visibility.
And in bringing the crisis to a head, Mr Spring has almost certainly counted
on the prospect of early polls, believing that Labour's performance and the
issue of public accountability would play out well for the party in a
general election.

FT  17 NOV 94 / EU jobs agency launched

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is today launching a European Union-wide
computerised employment agency, designed to assist companies and workers in
the creation of an integrated labour market. Known as Eures, the programme
will give job seekers specific vacancy details from each member state backed
up by information on living and working conditions and problems such as
accommodation, contract law and different levels of taxation and social
security. The programme, which workers can use in 1995 to search for jobs,
has an annual Ecu7.5m (Pounds 5.9m) budget. It is starting modestly with a
data bank of around 600 job vacancies from employers seeking recruits beyond
their national borders but the organisers hope a growing number of companies
will use Eures in their cross-border recruitment plans.

A US warship was yesterday monitoring separate naval exercises in the Aegean
organised by Greece and Turkey, in a show of Washington's concern over a
possible clash between the two Nato allies. From yesterday, when the new UN
law of the sea came into force, Greece maintains it acquired the right to
extend its territorial waters from six to 12 miles. It says it has no
immediate plans to exercise this option. Turkey, which has repeatedly warned
that any such move would trigger a war, is holding manoeuvres this week in
international waters near the Greek island of Lesbos. About 100 miles to the
south the Greek navy is in charge of an exercise held every year, involving
ships and aircraft from other Nato countries.

<TEXT>
The European Commission is set to crack down on levels of benzene in petrol
because of growing health concerns. Mr Prudencio Perera, a senior official
of DG11, the environment directorate general, said the Commission had been
disturbed by the findings of a recent survey in Brussels which detected
particularly high levels of benzene near some petrol stations. He told a
Financial Times conference in Amsterdam that although benzene emissions were
not currently regulated, there was 'mounting evidence concerning its
carcinogenic potential' and that he would be 'surprised' if Commission
proposals due next year on new fuel standards for the European Union
currently under study would allow companies to maintain the current 5 per
cent content level for benzene. The Commission was likely to follow
guidelines now being prepared by the World Health Organisation. Last month a
study by a parliamentary committee in the UK was critical of benzene in
super unleaded petrol.

Following last minute lobbying by the German government, European
telecommunications ministers are today hoping to reach agreement to allow
competing telephone networks across the continent by the beginning of 1998.
A spokesman for Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the German post minister who will chair
the Brussels meeting, said he was 'very optimistic' agreement could be
reached after Spain and Portugal dropped their reservations.
The ministers agreed last year to liberalise basic voice telephony services
in 1998, but it has been more difficult to reach agreement on the networks.
The Commission, hoping to speed up the deregulation of infrastructures,
takes the view that so-called alternative networks - energy and rail
networks for example - should be liberalised as early as next year, but
certain member states are wary of such a timetable. Germany has warned that
it will press ahead with its own liberalisation unless 1998 is agreed as a
suitable date on which to liberalise both the alternative, and the
traditional monopoly networks.

Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister, will retain his post in the
new cabinet to be announced today, according to officials from his Free
Democrat party. The FDP is junior partner in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
governing coalition. Mr Klaus Kinkel, FDP leader, will remain foreign
minister, and Ms Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, also from the FDP, is
expected to keep the justice portfolio.
Mr Rexrodt, a supporter of greater liberalisation and privatisation, has
suffered a string of recent failures to push through structural changes.
These include his inability to reach consensus among industry and local
councils to deregulate the energy sector, his failure to scrap a law
restricting the ability of high-street department stores to lower prices,
and his unsuccessful attempts at relaxing the country's inflexible shopping
hours.

A sharp improvement in Germany's cash position has helped cut the new
borrowing requirement of the public sector by about two-thirds this year,
the Bundesbank said yesterday in its monthly report. The turnround is in
line with statements by Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, that the high
federal budget deficit, which soared after reunification, was falling
significantly. In the first 10 months the public sector borrowed DM32bn
(Pounds 13bn), against DM101bn in the same period of 1993, as the
government's credit needs were reduced by its more favourable cash position.
The government's cash deficit totalled DM22.7bn in the January-October
period, down from DM48.5bn. Net new government borrowings were down to
DM17bn from DM66.5bn in the 10 months. Pressure on Mr Helmut Kohl's
government to continue the tougher line on spending has come from industry
and the Bundesbank. This week Mr Kohl said the government would cut
bureaucracy, reduce the share of public sector spending in the economy and
strive to privatise more state assets. Concern over high levels of state
spending has been a main concern of the Bundesbank in trying to hold down
money supply expansion. It has long argued that the high cost of financing
east Germany's reconstruction should be matched by spending curbs in the
west. Although the earlier steep rise in M3 has slowed sharply, the
Bundesbank is still determined to reduce it further.

FT  17 NOV 94 / European Commission leader plays Hamlet: 'To run or not to
run' for the French presidency? That is the question for Delors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jacques 'Hamlet' Delors has six weeks to decide whether to run or not to run
in the French presidential election next spring.
This week, the European Commission president said that, if his decision was
negative, he would tell the Socialist party 'before Christmas' to give it
time to cast around for another candidate. He may not have intended so
precise an answer but, having given it, he knows that silence beyond
December 25 will be taken as affirming his interest in the Elysee, thereby
increasing the pressure on him to run.
Punters would be ill-advised to bet on the result of what Mr Delors calls
his 'very difficult' decision. Insiders are divided. One close and longtime
collaborator predicted that, despite Mr Delors' steady rise in the polls and
stream of Socialist endorsements, he will not run because 'he has no taste
for the monarchy' that is the Fifth Republic's presidency.
Yet Mr Pierre Mauroy, former prime minister, said this week the groundswell
for a Delors candidacy was beginning to push the decision out of the man's
control; Mr Mauroy is running for re-election as mayor of Lille with Mr
Delors' daughter, Martine, as his deputy.
Most personal factors point the 69-year-old Mr Delors towards taking a break
after a decade of running the EU executive. These include a back problem and
a desire to follow up his latest book One Man's Unity with further tomes.
But set against this is mounting Socialist pressure. Mr Michel Rocard, who
would have been the presidential candidate had he not led the party so badly
in the European parliament elections last June, said this week that the
candidacy of someone 'for 10 years out of French public life, and therefore
less battered by it' was 'an historic chance'.
Talk of 'history' appeals to Mr Delors, who has made a bit of it himself in
Brussels, and he in turn is proving appealing to the public. In an Ifop poll
to be published by L'Express magazine, he again leads Mr Edouard Balladur,
the prime minister, and a field of eight other possible candidates in a
hypothetical first round.
But is Mr Delors popular enough? Virtually every poll, today's Ifop survey
included, shows that in a two-man run-off he would beat Mr Jacques Chirac,
the mayor of Paris, but would be beaten by Mr Balladur. The latter, however,
might give further ground, particularly if he continues to lose any more
ministers to the sort of political funding scandals with which Mr Delors -
by virtue of being abroad - can hardly be associated.
More of a conundrum for Mr Delors is, if he were elected, how and with whom
would he govern? As he told French radio this week in English in his best
Maurice Chevalier accent, 'Zat is ze qvestion'.
Faced with relatively small conservative majorities in parliament, President
Francois Mitterrand was able to use the momentum of his 1981 election and
1988 re-election to dissolve parliament and win left-wing majorities there.
But a President Delors would be confronted with the enormous majority the
RPR-UDF centre-right coalition won in 1993 when it gained 80 per cent of the
parliament's 577 seats.
'Delors would have to dissolve parliament, because the result of new
elections could not possibly be worse than the present one for him,' says Mr
Olivier Duhamel. This Sorbonne political scientist believes the most likely
outcome would be the Socialists and their MRG radical allies forming a
working majority with support from CDS centrists. The latter are at present
within the UDF federation and the Balladur government.
Mr Delors denies his new book amounts to a presidential programme. But
virtually everything in it - belief in European integration, a strong
currency, a wish for workers to restrain pay demands in the interest of
competitiveness and of society as a whole - could not be better tailored to
appeal to France's centrists and christian democrats.
A Delors victory could even produce, in Mr Duhamel's opinion, a 'grand
coalition' of left and right, with other pro-European elements of the shaky
UDF federation following the centrists into coalition with the Socialists.
It is hard to imagine a large number of RPR Gaullists going that way. But Mr
Jacques Chaban-Delmas, veteran Gaullist in whose prime ministerial cabinet
Mr Delors once served, has said he hopes Mr Delors will run.
So far, however, there is nothing remotely resembling a 'military
organisation' ready to roll into electoral action for Mr Delors, says Mr
Francois Hollande, a former Socialist deputy who runs the 'Temoins'
discussion club established by the Commission president two years ago. This
club of 2,000 members, plus two smaller political clubs he set up earlier,
together with some 15 local Delors-for-president committees around the
country, form a tiny network, outside the party.
But unless the polls are completely wrong, many more French people are ready
to roll up their sleeves for Mr Delors - if he gives them the word.

Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic appealed yesterday for international

Nato ambassadors considered declaring the enclave a total exclusion zone but
took no final decision. However, Nato aircraft swooped low over the area
after the Serbs fired a converted surface-to-air missile which landed near
UN peacekeepers. Troops loyal to Mr Fikret Abdic, the maverick Moslem leader
who opposes the Sarajevo government, were reported yesterday to be crossing
into Bihac, a UN spokesman said.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Bonn criticised on citizenship

<TEXT>
Germany's opposition Social Democrats and groups representing the country's
6.8m foreigners have described the recent compromise agreement by Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's coalition government to reform the citizenship law as
'hypocritical' and 'absurd'. The agreement envisages granting dual
nationality to the third generation of children and only until the age of
18, after which time they would have to choose a single nationality.
In a survey published by DPA, the German press agency, representatives from
Hesse state, which is governed by the SPD and the Greens/Bundnis 90, said
they would try to push the Bundesrat, or upper house, into making access to
citizenship easier. The SPD nominally controls 41 of the 68 seats in the
Bundesrat, enough to block legislation from the Bundestag, or lower house.
The criticism by the SPD and the federal agencies responsible for the
interests of foreigners signals the first implicit attack on the Free
Democrats, the junior partner in the coalition.

FT  17 NOV 94 / UK risks losing millions in EU aid
</HEADLINE>

Britain risks losing European Union aid worth up to Ecu674m (Pounds 525m),
intended to retrain workers in frontline industries, because it is refusing
to apply for it, the European Commission confirmed yesterday.
Senior Commission officials warned that the UK would not be allowed to 'opt
out' of this policy, which is intended to lift EU competitiveness, and to
which Britain's partners are committed.
The UK government's refusal to draw down its full EU aid entitlements comes
as it faces a potentially damaging revolt by right-wing Conservative MPs
because of planned increases in UK and other member states' contributions to
the Union's budget.
The aid Britain risks foregoing comes under the so-called Objective 4 of the
European Social Fund. This policy, agreed by all member states in mid-1993,
is designed to boost the skills of workers in industries being restructured.
Previously, Social Fund money was aimed exclusively at young and long-term
unemployed, while Objective 4 targets workers in threatened industries in
order to prevent them from becoming unemployed. The UK regards this switch
in funding as part of a French-inspired Commission effort to build up an
industrial policy by subterfuge, and wants to be allowed to spend all Social
Fund money on the jobless.
The Commission yesterday agreed on a share-out of Objective 4 funds for the
UK's partners, but confirmed that it was 'holding in reserve' finance for
which Britain had submitted no programme.
Britain is entitled to a total of Ecu3.37bn under the Social Fund in
1994-99. Under the Commission formula, about 80 per cent of this would go to
training the unemployed, and 20 per cent to Objective 4 - in the UK's case,
therefore, some Ecu674m.
The UK has asked for 95 per cent of its full Social Fund entitlement in
1994-96 - the first half of the scheme - but purely for funding training for
the jobless and ignoring Objective 4. Brussels has allowed this through,
while withholding the 5 per cent remnant worth Ecu80m.
But it is insisting that the UK redress the balance towards the Objective 4
programme in the second half of the scheme, in 1997-99. Brussels officials
say they are prepared to be flexible, allowing Britain to spend perhaps no
more than 10 per cent of its Social Fund grant on retraining employed
workers.
But Mr Padraig Flynn, EU social affairs commissioner, made clear yesterday
that 'all member states should implement Objective 4'.
'Flexibility in dividing up the spending does not extend to opting out,' he
warned.
Mr Flynn would not spell out publicly the consequences for Britain if it
continued to boycott the retraining policy, beyond stressing that 'we have
no indication we are going to get a programme from the UK' to take up its
Objective 4 entitlements.
Britain has traditionally got the largest single share of the EU Social
Fund. In 1989-93 it received Ecu2bn out of the Ecu7.4bn total; its full
entitlement of nearly Ecu3.4bn in 1994-99 stands against a total of Ecu14bn
parcelled out to all member states.
The Commission retains a portion of the Fund for programmes it runs itself.
These include the Adapt scheme for upgrading industrial skills across the
Union, from which the UK should get Ecu250m in 1994-99. Commission officials
see virtually no difference between Objective 4 and the Adapt programme.
'It's puzzling that (British) ideological differences don't appear to extend
that far,' one Brussels official remarked yesterday.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Balladur wants shorter presidential terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who is expected to stand in presidential
elections next year, yesterday suggested shorter terms for French
presidents. He also proposed greater use of referendums in a programme to
make France 'more democratic'.
In a long article in yesterday's Le Monde - the nearest he has come to
producing a manifesto in his undeclared candidacy for the Elysee - Mr
Balladur suggested suspending corporate contributions to political parties
and politicians for a three-year trial period.
However, speaking later before the National Assembly, he ruled out
suggestions, even within his own government, of a government reshuffle to
forestall further resignations. In the past four months, three ministers
have been forced to resign just before magistrates placed them under formal
investigation in political funding scandals. 'In the present climate, any
minister leaving the government would be suspected of doing so for reasons
connected with ..the law,' he said. 'I do not have the right to inflict such
a moral penalty.'
In his article, Mr Balladur disclaimed the idea that he was suggesting
constitutional and political reform purely because France was entering its
presidential election year. Such issues should be discussed more than just
every seven years, he said. One reason for shortening the seven year
presidential term was to 'allow the people to arbitrate more frequently on
the great national questions'.
The ill health of 78-year-old President Francois Mitterrand, in the last
year of his second seven years, has underscored a widespread desire for
reform. But Mr Balladur reflected the division of opinion among politicians
in saying that he was open to either reducing the term to five years or
limiting presidents to a single term.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Ukraine falls into line on nuclear arms
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ukraine's parliament yesterday ratified the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
and closed a chapter in the country's hesitant moves to give up for good
nuclear weapons inherited from the Soviet Union.
The long-awaited vote, passed by a wide margin, looks set to improve often
strained relations with the west and Russia. It also marks a significant
political victory for President Leonid Kuchma a week before his US summit
with President Bill Clinton.
Ukraine will formally accede to the 1968 treaty as a non-nuclear state once
security assurances from the US, the UK, France and Russia are, as expected,
given at next month's CSCE summit in Budapest. Mr Hennady Udovenko, foreign
minster, said 'guarantees of political independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity' are all but assured from the four NPT nuclear states
.
The former Soviet republic's ratification also is crucial because Moscow and
Washington have delayed carrying out strategic arms reduction treaties until
Kiev ratifies the NPT.
The world's third largest nuclear power, Ukraine last January gave up its
nuclear arsenal under an agreement signed with Russia and the US in exchange
for about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 633m) in nuclear fuel supplies and disarmament
assistance. Parliament ratified the Start-1 treaty in February; NPT was the
last step.
The conservative parliament for three years hedged on ratifying NPT, viewed
by many nationalists and communists as Ukraine's last bargaining chip, but
yesterday's debate was brisk.
'Ratification will make us hostage to politics in other countries - like
Russia,' said Mr Oleh Vitkovich, a rightist deputy.
But, after only a dozen deputies, Mr Kuchma significantly spoke last. He
told the chamber that, as a former director of a nuclear missiles factory,
he found the argument for keeping a nuclear deterrent an 'illusion' held by
'false patriots'.
'By signing this treaty, Ukraine shows we don't blackmail the world
community,' he said.
Although Ukraine inherited 176 inter-continental missiles and 41 strategic
bombers - the warheads are now being transferred to Russia - Moscow
controlled the launch codes and Kiev lacked both the technology and
financing properly to store the weapons or gain control.
Ukraine never made nuclear weapons, only missiles, and never reprocessed
spent nuclear fuel - although hard-liners claimed it boasted the scientific
know-how to do so.
Mr Kuchma warned the deputies that developing Ukraine's nuclear capability
would require up to Dollars 200bn and help from Russia.
The president instead asked for further western aid to dismantle the nuclear
weapons.
On Tuesday, 14 western states and the European Union promised Dollars
234.38m in disarmament aid on top of Dollars 500m already pledged. The funds
are for military conversion, resettling and retraining military personnel,
environmental clean-up, missile dismantlement, non-proliferation safeguards
and nuclear reactor safety.
Earlier this week Mr Kuchma said Russia put further pressure on Ukraine this
week by cutting off nuclear fuel supplies - needed to power Ukraine's five
nuclear power plants - until Ukraine ratified the NPT, according to news
agency Interfax.
Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Krylov yesterday welcomed the
Ukrainian decision. 'This is an extremely positive step, so necessary now
for strengthening security and stability in Europe,' he said.

FT  17 NOV 94 / French attack US policy on Bosnia: Row highlights drifting
apart of US and its European allies

France yesterday stepped up its criticism of US policy in Bosnia, amid a
further cooling of transatlantic relations because of differences over the
war in former Yugoslavia.
At a Nato meeting in Brussels, the US failed to convince its European allies
to take immediate action over the Bosnian enclave of Bihac, where Serb
forces were closing in.
Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, said the US withdrawal from
enforcing the arms embargo against Bosnia amounted to favouring those who
wanted war against those who wanted peace.
Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister, threatened to withdraw French
troops from Bosnia in the event of 'one more step' in the wrong direction.
Mr Juppe will tomorrow host a meeting with Mr Douglas Hurd and Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, his counterparts from the UK and Russia, with the Bosnian crisis -
and their common disappointment with US policy - high on the agenda.
Officials from several European countries said they were concerned by
reports of covert US military aid to Bosnian Moslems and Croats, aimed at
helping them to fight together against the Serbs. This aid is reported to
include training and the construction of small airfields.
However, the battered five-nation contact group on Bosnia - US, Russia,
Britain, France and Germany - has scheduled a ministerial meeting for
December 2, in a sign that efforts to harmonise policy will continue.
Transatlantic differences over Bosnia and other issues have already prompted
some public soul-searching by policy-makers and scholars on how the
US-European relationship can be shored up.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, has suggested that increased
exchanges between civil servants, businessmen and scholars could help
maintain an 'Atlantic community' based on shared values.
A report reflecting the views of businessmen and politicians on both sides
of the Atlantic called this week for a new US-European treaty. It says the
Europeans underestimate the degree to which US and European foreign policy
interests diverge in the absence of a Soviet threat. The report sees a risk
of cleavage as Americans tilt away from Europe to the fast-growing economies
in Latin America and the Pacific, and as both allies become preoccupied with
internal renewal and economic competition.
Though not in any immediate peril, 'the transatlantic relationship founded
primarily on the (Nato) alliance is adrift,' concludes the study by
Transatlantic Policy Network.
The report recommends three steps:
The transformation of the present Transatlantic Declaration into an economic
and political treaty between the EU and US aimed at creating a 'North
Atlantic Free Trade Area'.
Reforming Nato around a partnership between the US and a European defence
pillar. Though the authors suggest further integrating defence and military
procurement in Europe, they found 'no firm foundation' for a coherent
European approach on security matters.
Uniting the annual Nato summit and the biennial US-EU meetings. The aim is
to exploit the Clinton administration's shift toward strengthening the
European defence pillar within Nato.

The US and European Union need to upgrade their post-cold war relationship
through a new political and economic treaty, according to a study by
European political and business leaders.
The report's release coincides with an angry transatlantic row over the US
withdrawal from the arms embargo against Bosnia, and with some public
soul-searching by European politicians over how to limit the damage.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, Britain's defence secretary, called this week for the
establishment of an 'Atlantic community' which would shore up US-European
solidarity on the basis of a shared commitment to democracy, capitalism and
European culture.
While giving few details, Mr Rifkind called for more transatlantic exchanges
between civil servants, parliamentarians, students and industrialists.
He said Europe and North America had a common interest in facing down the
challenges of Islamic extremism in North Africa, economic competition in the
Far East, nationalism in some parts of eastern Europe and international
crime.
However, this week's study says that Europeans are underestimating the
degree to which US and European foreign policy interests diverge in the
absence of a Soviet threat.
The report sees a risk of cleavage as Americans tilt away from Europe to the
fast-growing economies in Latin America and the Pacific, and as both allies
become preoccupied with internal renewal and economic competition.
Though not in any immediate peril, 'the transatlantic relationship founded
primarily on the (Nato) alliance is adrift,' concludes the study by
Transatlantic Policy Network, a non-profit group which brings together
business and political leaders on both sides of the Atlantic.
The report recommends three steps to strengthen linkages between the US and
Europe.
The transformation of the present Transatlantic Declaration into an economic
and political treaty between the EU and US aimed at creating a 'North
Atlantic Free Trade Area' which would cover regulatory co-operation, mutual
recognition of product approvals, standardisation and certification, and
treatment of foreign investment.
Reforming Nato around a partnership between the US and a European defence
pillar. Though the authors suggest further integrating defence and military
procurement in Europe, they found 'no firm foundation' for a coherent
European approach on security matters.
A new process for transatlantic summits which would bring together the
annual Nato summit and the biennial US-EU meetings. The aim is to exploit
the Clinton administration's shift toward strengthening the European defence
pillar within Nato and its support for greater European political
integration built around the Union.
With one eye on the 1996 inter-governmental conference to review the
Maastricht treaty, the report says there is a 'window of opportunity' for
real power-sharing between the US and EU. The onus is on member states,
including Britain, to take further steps to integrate political, economic
and security policies within the EU in 1996.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Chill in the air of US-Soviet relations: Superpower
diplomacy has taken a turn for the worse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not a hot war nor a return of the cold war,' says Mr Georgy Arbatov,
the grand old man of US-Soviet diplomacy and still head of the US-Canada
Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. 'But I do see a worsening of
relations between the US and Russia.'
Mr Arbatov was speaking yesterday two days after President Boris Yeltsin
sounded an ominous note when he said he feared the US Republican
congressional victory would 'embitter' relations between the two states, and
then went on to call for stronger armed forces to cope with a rising threat
of conflict.
It was not an isolated remark. 'There is a growing anti-American,
anti-western mood among our politicians,' says Mr Arbatov. 'The
circumstances of the last election (in December 1993) with the failure of
economic reform pushed upon us by the IMF and others and the growth of
crime, mean that we have a very powerful nationalist wing.'
This has influenced all political rhetoric for over a year - and it is
gaining strength. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the once fiercely pro-American foreign
minister, now attacks the US for failing to respond to his initiative to
persuade Iraq to recognise Kuwait's independence by lifting sanctions, and
for halting the enforcement of the arms embargo against the Bosnian Moslems.
The spreading of Nato into eastern Europe through the Partnership for Peace
has not been accepted, even though Russia itself joined the system. Mr
Sergei Karaganov, a prominent foreign policy adviser, said yesterday that to
'prevent or at least postpone the taking of the decision to increase the
size of Nato' is the main task facing Russian diplomacy at next month's
Budapest Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. This is the body
which Russia wants to promote in Nato's place.
The west and its institutions are no longer objects of official hate, but
they do excite general suspicion: there is little or nothing left of an
earlier feeling of gratitude towards the US and the west in general for
welcoming and assisting the democratisation and reform process.
Mr Arbatov dismisses as 'small change in today's conditions' the Dollars 3bn
in US aid to Russia - and though he admits that President Bill Clinton's
early meeting with Mr Yeltsin in Vancouver in March 1993 was an important
gesture, he believes the US president is now weak and hobbled, and unable to
reach out to Russia even if he wishes to.
Mr Andrei Kortunov, one of the leading younger policy analysts at Mr
Arbatov's institute, agrees that the significance of the US elections is not
so much that the republicans won but that right-wing, isolationist and
strongly anti-Soviet republicans won, like Mr Jesse Helms, thought certain
to be chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee. 'And one must say,
if these people are looking for faults in the way in which aid has been
administered to Russia they will find rich material.'
Mr Kortunov says the understanding extended to Russia by the Clinton
administration - heavily criticised by today's resurgent Republicans for
putting 'Russia first' - will now end. That probably means, for example,
that Russia's constant complaint that it cannot observe the terms of the
Conventional Forces in Europe treaty it signed with some 30 countries,
because it needs to strengthen the armour of its southern forces, will be
unheeded and its breach of the treaty will become a major issue.
Besides, he says, the Republicans will have 1996 in their mind - the year of
the next US presidential elections, and also the year when Mr Yeltsin must
step down, or run again. They will thus, he argues, have much less interest
in supporting Mr Yeltsin. 'They will instead be looking for a relationship
with the next Russian president, in the ranks of the opposition.'
'The problem here,' says Mr Graham Allison, former US assistant secretary of
state for defence and now a consultant to the Defence Department, 'is that
where you have a partisan battle going on between the Republicans and the
president you tend to get attention focused on second and third order issues
between the US and Russia where there will be conflict and people forget
about the first order issues where there are common interests.'
But neither Mr Arbatov nor Mr Allison - with some experience of each other's
defence establishments - believe the chilling need be serious. Mr Arbatov
says that in the Middle East, a historic battleground for states who were in
part superpower proxies, the interests of Russia and the US are firmly for
peace - 'in our case', says Mr Arbatov, 'because we want our debts which
these countries have with us to be repaid'.
'There is a normalisation of the relationship going on,' says Mr Allison,
'and that will continue. There is no need to deny we have different
interests. There is no need to have constant big symbolic events. Our real
state interests dictate co-operation. People in both countries are beyond
thinking of each other as the enemy.'

Ukraine will formally accede to the 1968 treaty as a non-nuclear state once

Ukraine's territorial integrity.
Ukraine's ratification also is crucial because Moscow and Washington have
been delaying implementation of the first and second strategic arms

'As Ukraine takes the final steps to move beyond the nuclear issue,' a joint
statement read, 'its relations with western partners will rise to a new
qualitative level with a focus on political and economic questions and on
Ukraine's closer integration into the west.'
Russia put further pressure on Ukraine this week by cutting off nuclear fuel
supplies - needed to power Ukraine's five nuclear power plants - until
Ukraine ratified the NPT.
Western diplomats called the vote a break-through. 'Ukraine can now be a
full player on the international scene,' one said
The US wanted Ukraine on board to build momentum ahead of next spring's on
NPT renewal, opposed by states such as Nigeria and India.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Brussels payments and welfare to fore in government
programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The measure authorising the increase in the UK's payments to the European
Union and the normal finance bill implementing the Budget to be introduced
on November 29 will dominate the early stages of the new parliamentary
session, Ivor Owen writes.
Social welfare legislation, including the measure to equalise the state
pension age at 65 for men and women by 2020, will also figure prominently in
the programme.
The jobseekers' allowance bill will replace unemployment benefits and income
support. The Crown Agents, a leading international supplier of procurement,
financial management and technical services, features in a restricted
privatisation programme.  This includes increased competition in the gas
industry by allowing domestic customers to choose their supplier, and
transferring the commercial activities of the Atomic Energy Authority to the
private sector.
A hybrid bill will seek authority for the construction and operation by the
private sector of a high-speed rail link between London and the Channel
tunnel.
Other measures include: a bill to save administrative costs in the National
Health Service; an agricultural tenancies bill to make tenanted land more

FT  17 NOV 94 / RJB forecasts profits of Pounds 220m if it buys English coal
regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RJB Mining, the coal company, is telling potential investors it can make
annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 220m by the turn of the century from the
English regions of British Coal which it is negotiating to buy from the
government.
In one of the boldest and most controversial fund-raising exercises in
recent times on the London Stock Exchange, RJB aims to raise Pounds 425m in
a share issue and Pounds 628m as debt.
In private City presentations, RJB and its adviser, Barclays de Zoete Wedd,
indicate that they believe the debt can be cleared by 1998 when existing
electricity contracts end.
RJB, which put in an offer of Pounds 914m to win the government's backing as
preferred bidder for the regions, forecasts annual pre-tax profits of Pounds
220m on turnover of Pounds 1.24bn in 1999. Profits before then will be
Pounds 116m in 1995, Pounds 188m in 1996, Pounds 211m in 1997 and Pounds
186m in 1998.
The amount of money RJB, capitalised at Pounds 157m, needs to raise means
that investors will study its projections closely. Many executives in the
electricity and coal industries believe the company, which bid up to 50 per
cent more than its nearest rival, is taking a highly optimistic view of
markets.
RJB will win the regions if it can raise the money and agree final terms
with the government.
RJB, which yesterday refused to comment, says in its presentation it expects
to sell about 34m tonnes of coal from those regions and sell them at an
average of Pounds 1.32 a gigajoule at today's prices.
Some analysts believe sales around the mid-20m tonne mark are more
realistic. The generators, to which most of the coal will be sold, are
thought to want to buy coal for nearer Pounds 1 a gigajoule and are prepared
to import rather than pay what they believe to be excessive UK prices.
Among other key aspects of the presentation, RJB says:
Costs per tonne can be cut by at least 10 per cent, partly through
streamlining colliery management and increasing equipment utilisation.
The English electricity supply market will require 27.1m-43m tonnes a year
by 1999. Of the Pounds 628m of borrowing, Pounds 528m will be bank debt and
Pounds 100m corporate bonds.
Net assets of the regions are Pounds 902m and projected operating cash flow
over five years is Pounds 1.35bn.
Expected dividend yield is 4.5 per cent initially. Some 95 per cent of
shares will be placed with institutions, with 5 per cent set aside for an
offer for sale, but this could rise to 15 per cent if there is demand.
