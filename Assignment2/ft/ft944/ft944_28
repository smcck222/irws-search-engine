FT  17 NOV 94 / Dublin coalition set to collapse: Spring's resignation as
deputy leader may force Irish poll

<TEXT>
The collapse of Ireland's coalition government seemed inevitable last night
as Mr Dick Spring, the Labour leader, announced his resignation as deputy
prime minister.
He said the other five Labour party ministers would also quit the Fianna
Fail-led government after he accused Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister,
of misleading the Dail, the Irish parliament, about the handling of a child
sex abuse case.
A government confidence motion expected in the Dail this morning is now
likely to be defeated.
The political uncertainty, amid speculation that the country could be forced
to an early elections, has cast a deep shadow over progress on the Northern
Ireland peace process.
With a possible delay in forming a new administration, officials last night
acknowledged the negotiations between London and Dublin on the framework
document for a durable constitution would be put on hold.
There was even the possibility that the crisis in Dublin could cause London
to delay its undertaking to bring Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, into
exploratory talks by Christmas. It almost certainly means the forced
rescheduling of next week's planned Anglo-Irish conference on the peace
process.
Mr Spring's decision came at the end of a day of high political drama in
which Mr Reynolds, in a last-ditch act of political contrition aimed at
regaining Labour support, had admitted a mistake in appointing Mr Harry
Whelehan, the attorney-general, as president of the High Court. Mr Whelehan
has been under fire for his department's failure to act for seven months on
a request from Northern Ireland to extradite a priest later convicted of
child sex abuse by a Belfast court.
Mr Reynolds last night seemed certain to go to President Mary Robinson to
seek an early dissolution of parliament and an early general election.
However, there was speculation that the president would use her powers under
the constitution to force the parties to create a new coalition within the
existing parliament.
One factor is likely to be a wish to do as little damage to the peace
process as possible.
Some elements within Fianna Fail were last night pressing for Mr Reynolds to
be replaced as leader ahead of the confidence vote, on the grounds that a
change might avert defeat. The favourite to replace Mr Reynolds under those
circumstances would be Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister.
Dublin was in a sombre mood yesterday after Mr Reynolds had struggled to
save his political career. In a 45-minute address to the Dail, Mr Reynolds
offered what he called the 'full facts, the unvarnished facts' on the
extradition case. He said he had acted unwisely in the appointment of Mr
Whelehan.
After three adjournments the Dail was in its fourth sitting when Mr Reynolds
conceded his error in the appointment and said he was unware he had been
given misleading information when he made a statement on Tuesday about the
sex abuse case. But Mr Spring said that the new evidence had been in the
prime minister's possession.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Jobs and inflation data give Clarke pre-Budget boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, PHILIP COGGAN and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Better than expected figures for UK inflation, unemployment and the public
finances yesterday provided Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, with a strong
base for a confidence-building Budget in 12 days' time.
The data reduced fears that Britain would need to follow Tuesday's 0.75 per
cent increase in short-term US interest rates with an early rise in bank
base rates from 5.75 per cent.
Interviewed on BBC Radio's The World at One, Mr Clarke said yesterday's
economic news was 'extremely good'. Making clear that there was no automatic
link between US and UK interest rates, he said: 'Our interest rates are
going to be determined by my judgment on what British inflationary pressures
are or are likely to be 18 months or two years out. At the moment we have
things well under control.'
In official statistics for October, government departments announced:
A sharp 45,800 fall in seasonally adjusted claimant unemployment, cutting
the jobless total to 2.52m and the rate to 8.9 per cent, its lowest since
December 1991.
A 0.1 per cent fall in the index of underlying inflation between September
and October, leaving the increase in the retail prices index - excluding
mortgage interest payments - unchanged at 2 per cent in the 12 months to
October. For the second month running, this was the lowest 12-month rate for
underlying inflation since 1967.
A surplus of Pounds 558m in the public-sector finances last month, bringing
the public-sector borrowing requirement to Pounds 19.2bn in the first seven
months of the 1994-95 financial year, some Pounds 7.2bn below the deficit
for the same period of last year.
Economists said falling unemployment, low inflation and the improvement in
the PSBR gave the chancellor a good base for announcing spending cuts and
reduced borrowing totals for 1994-95 and subsequent years in his November 29
Budget. Department of Employment figures also pointed to a rise in job
vacancies and subdued labour costs in manufacturing. Unit labour costs in
the quarter to September were 1.4 per cent lower than in the same period of
1993, the largest fall since records began in 1970.
Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, warned that earnings growth
was still above the inflation figure. 'This is an undesirable situation from
the point of view of maximising employment growth,' he said.
While the underlying rise in average earnings for the whole economy was
unchanged at 3.75 per cent in the year to September, manufacturing and
production earnings rose to 4.5 per cent.
The retail prices index also crept up 0.1 per cent in the month to October,
lifting the 'headline' inflation rate to 2.4 per cent last month from 2.2
per cent in September.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Major threatens election over EU bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major acted swiftly yesterday to quell a revolt among Tory
Eurosceptics by staking his administration's future on a bill allowing
higher contributions to the European Union.
The prime minister startled MPs at the state opening of parliament by
warning that legislation to implement an agreement struck two years ago at
the EU's Edinburgh summit was 'inescapably a matter of confidence'.
The warning that a particular measure in the legislative programme was
sacrosanct is unprecedented in recent times. It leaves Mr Major with no
option but to call a general election if it is defeated or substantially
amended.
The government will publish the bill within the next few days and Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, wants the crucial Commons second reading to be held
before his November 29 Budget. It could complete all parliamentary stages
before Christmas.
The signs last night were that most of those who had threatened to oppose
any increase in payments to Brussels would now fall into step. But a group
of about half a dozen refused to back down publicly.
The decision to pre-empt a revolt, which overshadowed the announcement in
the Queen's Speech of a low-key legislative programme for the next year, was
denounced by opposition parties as a panic move to disguise Mr Major's
weakness.
The speech included plans for nearly 20 bills, ranging from reform of
pensions law to abolition of regional health authorities and the
construction of a high-speed rail link to the Channel tunnel. Most are
relatively uncontroversial.
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, said the government had clearly run out of
steam. He added: 'It has surely come to something when a government can only
secure the passage of its own legislative programme by threatening its own
demise.'
Mr Blair and Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, support the
principle of an agreement which would increase Britain's contributions to
Brussels by an estimated Pounds 250m a year by 1999.
But Labour will seek to amend the legislation to reflect its opposition to
the Britain's social chapter opt-opt. Mr Blair indicated also that if defeat
for the legislation meant a general election, Labour might well vote against
it without damaging its pro-European credentials.
Mr Major insisted: 'There is no room for compromise on this bill. This means
its successful passage - in all its essentials - is inescapably a matter of
confidence because of the agreements . . . with our European partners.'
He added: 'No British government would have credibility in international
negotiations if it failed to implement the agreements it had freely entered
into with its partners abroad.'
The idea of an early confrontation to face down potential rebels was first
raised by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. There was then broad
agreement within the cabinet the government could not afford a repeat of the
struggle over Maastricht.

FT  17 NOV 94 / RJB offered Pounds 914m in bidding to win British Coal
regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RJB Mining, the coal company, put in an offer of Pounds 914m to win the
government's backing as preferred bidder for the English regions of British
Coal, it emerged yesterday.
In one of the boldest and most controversial fund-raising exercises in
recent times on the London Stock Exchange, RJB aims to raise Pounds 425m in
a share issue and Pounds 628m as debt.
In presentations to potential investors, RJB and its adviser, Barclays de
Zoete Wedd, indicate that they believe the debt can be cleared by 1998 when
existing electricity contracts end.
RJB predicts annual pretax profits of Pounds 220m by the turn of the century
on turnover of Pounds 1.24bn. Profits before then will be Pounds 116m in
1995, Pounds 188m in 1996, Pounds 211m in 1997 and Pounds 186m in 1998.
The amount of money RJB, capitalised at Pounds 157m, needs to raise means
that investors will study its projections closely. Many executives in the
electricity and coal industries believe the company, which bid more than 50
per cent higher than the nearest rival, is taking a highly optimistic view
of markets, particularly after 1998.
RJB says in its presentation, copies of which have been obtained by the
Financial Times, that it expects to sell about 34m tonnes of coal from the
regions it is acquiring and sell it at an average of Pounds 1.32 a gigajoule
at today's prices.
Some analysts believe sales around the mid-20m tonne mark are more
realistic. The generators, to which most of the coal will be sold, are
thought to want to buy coal for nearer Pounds 1 a gigajoule and are prepared
to import rather than pay what they believe to be excessive UK prices.
Among other key aspects of the presentation, RJB says:
Costs per tonne can be cut by at least 10 per cent, partly through
streamlining colliery management and increasing equipment utilisation.
The English electricity supply market will require 27.1m-43m tonnes a year
at the turn of the century.
Of the Pounds 628m it plans to borrow, Pounds 528m will be through bank debt
and Pounds 100m through corporate bonds.
Net assets of the regions being bought are Pounds 902m and projected
operating cash flow over five years is Pounds 1.35bn.
Expected dividend yield is 4.5 per cent initially, with a policy of rapid
dividend growth after the debt is cleared.
Some 95 per cent of shares will be placed with institutions, with 5 per cent
set aside for an offer for sale, although this could rise to 15 per cent if
there is demand.
RJB yesterday refused to comment.

The collapse of Ireland's coalition government seemed inevitable last night
as Mr Dick Spring, the Labour leader, announced his resignation as deputy
prime minister. He said the other five Labour party ministers would also
quit the Fianna Fail-led government.
Mr Spring's decision came at the end of a day of high political drama in
which Mr Albert Rey-nolds, the Irish prime minster, in a last-ditch act of
political contrition aimed at regaining Labour support, had conceded his
mistake in the appointment of Mr Harry Whelehan, the attorney-general, to be
president of the High Court.
Mr Whelehan has been under fire for his department's failure to act for
seven months on a request from Northern Ireland for the extradition of a
priest later convicted of child sex abuse.
Mr Reynolds last night seemed certain to go to President Mary Robinson to
seek an early dissolution of parliament and an early general election.
However, there was growing speculation that the president would use her
powers under the constitution to force the parties to create a new coalition
within the existing parliament.
One factor is likely to be a wish to do as little damage to the Northern
Ireland peace process as possible.
After a day of high farce rich in rumour, Dublin was in sombre mood last
night as Mr Reynolds struggled to save his political career. In a 45-minute
address to the Dail, the Irish parliament,
Mr Reynolds offered what he called the 'full facts, the unvarnished facts'
on the extradition case.
He said he acted unwisely in the attorney-general's appointment.
With opposition MPs threatening to reveal new evidence to 'rock the
foundations of the state', it was not until 6.45 that Mr Spring, the
architect of the crisis, rose to speak for the first time in the drama.
After three separate adjournments the Dail, the Irish parliament, was in its
fourth sitting when Mr Reynolds conceded his error in the attorney-general's
appointment.
Amid speculation of a document showing official interference to block the
extradition of the paedophile priest, Mr Reynolds reported that he had
contacted all members of the attorney-general's office except two who are
out of the country. Unionists reassured, Page 9; Editorial comment, Page 21

Telefonica de Espana, Spain's state-run telecommunications group, lifted
consolidated net profit in the first nine months of 1994 by 17 per cent, to
Pta86.61bn (Dollars 68.12m) from Pta73.72bn last time, AP-DJ reports from
Madrid.
Pre-tax profit climbed 11 per cent to Pta104.65bn from Pta94.68bn. The high
growth in net profit is attributable to the declining corporate tax burden,
which is now around 17 per cent of profit.
However, with 7.6 per cent growth in operating expenses, group operating
profits advanced 3.8 per cent to Pta289.7bn from Pta278.98bn.
Telefonica said subsidiaries' contributions to group pre-tax profits jumped
to 15.7 per cent in the first nine months, from 9.5 per cent in the first
half. Iberdrola, Spain's largest private electric utility, pushed up
consolidated net profit in the first nine months of 1994 by 43 per cent to
Pta60.05bn from Pta41.96bn last time.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Nato considers Bihac weapons exclusion zone: Troop
mobilisation prompts US action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US and its Nato allies are considering establishing a heavy weapons
exclusion zone around the Serb-besieged Bosnian town of Bihac, the US
Defence Department said yesterday.
The possibility of such a zone has been raised as forces loyal to Mr Fikret
Abdic, the ousted Moslem leader of the Bihac enclave, are being mobilised to
join a Serb offensive against Bihac, UN officials reported yesterday.
American officials added privately that the US had raised the issue and that
the allies, at a meeting of Nato ambassadors in Brussels, had agreed to look
into the proposal, which could allow allied air power to prevent Serb forces
from overrunning the Moslem-held Bihac enclave in north-west Bosnia.
'There have been discussions of the North Atlantic Council on the
possibility of an exclusion zone around Bihac. No decision has been made.
These consultations and discussions are continuing,' said Mr Ken Bacon, the
defence department spokesman.
But he would not confirm that the US had raised the issue with the council,
Nato's political arm.
Other US officials said that Washington had indeed raised the possibility
with the allies of establishing a 10km heavy weapons exclusion zone around
Bihac.
'It is one of a number of suggestions that has come up for how to deal with
the situation there, and I'd rather not be more specific about it now,' Mr
Bacon said.
'There are a whole series of options you could think of. An exclusion zone
is one.'
UN spokesman Mr Michael Williams, speaking in Sarajevo, said: 'Our estimate
is that Mr Abdic is presently mobilising a force of at least 5,000 from
refugee camps.'
Bosnian Serb forces are reportedly closing in on Bihac. Mr Williams
yesterday confirmed they fired seven Sam anti-aircraft missiles at the Bihac
area on Monday.
About 30,000 civilians and soldiers loyal to Mr Abdic fled the Bihac pocket,
designated a UN safe area, last August after being defeated by Bosnian
government forces.
They lived under difficult conditions in Serb-held lands in Croatia when
Zagreb refused to let them cross into the self-styled Serb state.
Local Serbs have re-armed Mr Abdic's soldiers, apparently preparing an
assault from Croatia, which borders the Bihac pocket.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Helmut Kohl of Germany receives a bunch of flowers in the German parliament
yesterday after he was re-elected chancellor with one vote to spare in a
ballot in the lower house. The presentation was made by fellow member of
parliament Brigitte Baumeister. Watching is the foreign minister, Klaus
Kinkel. Mr Kohl's razor-thin majority is not unprecedented in postwar German
politics. In 1949 the Christian Democrat father figure Konrad Adenauer won
what was then the minimum 202 votes needed to become Bonn's first
chancellor. In 1969, Willy Brandt was only two votes over the minimum and
seven years later Helmut Schmidt cleared the hurdle with only one vote to
spare.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (9): Try a plain vanilla, or maybe a
butterfly
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The astonishing growth of the emerging debt market has given birth to a new
generation of derivatives, says Ms Alexandra McLeod, of Bank of America,
Illinois. Plain vanilla put and call options and structures such as
straddles, strangles, bull spreads and butterflies are some of the exotic
names of products developed in the rocket science laboratories of the
world's leading investment banks

FT  16 NOV 94 / Arts: Three Tall Women - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's a poor sort of memory that only works backward,' the Queen remarked.'
In the first half of Edward Albee's virtually plotless play Three Tall
Women, memory works only backward. The play's three heroines are young (26),
middle-aged (52), and old (92), and they represent potential, achievement,
aftermath. Si la jeunesse savait . . . si la vieillesse pouvait. In Act Two,
however, the play moves through the looking-glass, and memory works forward.
The effect is original, contrived, witty, meandering, touching, impressive,
specious. The play was new in 1991, has received several prizes since its
New York City premiere this February, and now reaches London in an
illustrious new production led by Maggie Smith and Frances de la Tour as
Heroines A and B.
It is the 92-year-old, a rich New England lady at death's door, who is the
centre of the triptych. In Act One, her memory is sliding in and out of
focus (other signs of old age are explicit; the onset of Alzheimer's disease
is implicit); and the other two are her companion and a member of her
lawyer's firm. In Act Two, however, she is nothing but memory; and the other
two are herself at younger ages. The sense that she carries these younger
alter egos inside her is clear, even though the 26-year-old repeatedly
refuses to age into that.
Maggie Smith's creation of the old lady is a marvel of daring and
incisiveness. Early on, she starts to wail - for no very good reason, and
not for the last time - and the accuracy with which her vocal tone and
facial expression capture the peculiar misery of helpless old age is
uncannily fine. Yet within seconds her mischievous wit bobs back, and
moments later her malicious disdain also. She is more autocratic, more
disturbed, more volatile, than Myra Carter in the same role in New York; she
achieves serenity only gradually.
On two or three occasions, she over-employs some comic devices - staccato,
bird-like turns of the raised head, swivellings of the eyes, all as seen
last year in The Importance of Being Earnest - but these are minor blots. In
Act Two, she achieves a quiet and stillness that must rank among the finest
hours of her great career.
Frances de la Tour's performance is without blot, and complements Smith's
with model generosity, dryness, and elegance. Anastasia Hille's performance,
in the junior role, is altogether less accomplished: fussy, restless, silly.
Anthony Page's direction is perfectly paced; Carl Toms's decor and Tom
Rand's costumes are handsome.
Wilde's line, 'The tragedy of old age is not that one is old but that one is
still young', explains part of the feeling that the play creates  - but only
part. For the young woman is so evidently callow beside the older two. The
52-year-old has more compassion, more irony, more resignation; and the
92-year-old is moving towards the final resignation. They speak of family,
losing virginity, marriage, sex, adultery, motherhood, illness - much of
which has not yet happened to the 26-year-old. Interestingly, though the
younger woman is most alarmed at the prospect of disillusion in marriage,
the older women are most troubled by their son (who appears, albeit without
speaking a word).
The play is weaker and slighter than it has been proclaimed. (I confess
that, at its NYC premiere this February, I nodded off more than once - but
put that down to jet-lag. At the London premiere last night, however, I
spotted others yawning or slumbering at the points I had faded before.) The
writing is full of humour, grace, irony, edge; but too often a certain
whimsical preciosity protrudes. Lines are repeated and echoed at times with
a sub-Gertude-Stein effect; non sequiturs and stream-of-consciousness
changes of subject abound as if Albee were imitating effects from Anton
Chekhov, Virginia Woolf, Samuel Beckett, and others. An evening both
rewarding and frustrating.

FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Final stage reached in sale of
BPSM stake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
An 80 per cent stake in Portugal's state-owned Banco Pinto e Sotto Mayor
(BPSM) will be sold today to one of two rival bidders for at least Es25.6bn
(USDollars 162m), Reuter reports from Lisbon.
Mr Antonio Champalimaud, who owned BPSM before it was nationalised in 1975,
and a consortium led by Portuguese investment bank Banco Finantia have
submitted rival bids which will be opened on the Lisbon stock exchange at
0900 GMT.
If there is a difference of less than 5 per cent between the two bids, both
sides will be given 20 minutes to revise their offers.
The government cleared both proposals after vetoing a lone bid by Banco
Comercial Portugues to buy BPSM when it was first put on sale last year,
saying it was too low.
BPSM is Portugal's sixth largest bank in terms of deposits and seventh
largest in terms of assets, but it has an older than average workforce and
needs to set aside large amounts of cash for its pension fund.
The government is offering 80 per cent of BPSM's 30.5m shares in a single
block to the highest qualified bidder at a reserve price of Es1,050 a share.
The remaining 20 per cent of BPSM's capital will be sold off at a later date
to employees and small investors.
Finantia's consortium includes Swiss Bank Corporation, Portuguese groups
Finantipar-SGPS and RAR-Refinarias de Azucar Reunidas, and Mr Jose Candido
Sotto Mayor Matoso, a relative of the bank's founders.
Mr Champalimaud, who has extensive business interests in Brazil, is bidding
through his Portuguese insurance company Companhia de Seguros Mundial
Confianca.
The government offered BPSM for sale at a minimum price of Es1,050 a share
in June after failing to sell the bank at a reference price of Es1,800 a
share last year.

FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T buys interactive computer
games unit

AT&amp;T, the US telecoms group, is to acquire The ImagiNation Network, an
on-line computer service offering games and entertainment, in a move to
expand its involvement in the emerging market for interactive multimedia
services.
The move follows this week's announcement by Microsoft, the world's largest
software company, that it plans a worldwide on-line services network
offering information, communications and entertainment features.
AT&amp;T, which previously held a 20 per cent stake in the ImagiNation Network,
will pay about Dollars 40m for the remaining equity. The network is a
fledgling California venture formed by Sierra On-Line, a computer games
software developer, and General Atlantic Partners, a venture capital firm.
Sierra On-Line will continue to provide interactive games for the network as
part of the sale agreement with AT&amp;T.
Mr Thomas Pomeroy, vice-president of sales and marketing for The ImagiNation
Network, said AT&amp;T's investment would help the network expand its
membership.
The service currently offers PC users a wide choice of computer games, and
subscribers can also join on-line 'chat' sessions, use bulletin boards and
send electronic mail.
About 6.5m consumers use on-line services, an increase of about 33 per cent
since the beginning of this year, according to Simba, a market research
group which is projecting accelerated growth over the next few years. US
consumer on-line service revenues were Dollars 558m in 1993, and are
expected to increase to Dollars 708m this year, it says.
AT&amp;T said The ImagiNation network will become part of a newly-formed
business unit focused on consumer interactive services. The unit will also
include AT&amp;T's recently-launched PersonaLink services for users of PCs and
personal communicators.
Novell said it had entered an agreement with General Instrument Corp to
provide networking services such as access to the Internet, home banking and
home shopping to consumers through cable TV networks, Reuter reports from
Las Vegas.

sonar pact

<TEXT>
Thomson-CSF, the French defence electronics group, said yesterday it had
taken the first step toward creating an alliance with GEC of the UK in the
field of sonars, Reuter reports from Paris.
It said it and GEC had agreed in principle with the liquidators of UK
electronics group Ferranti International that the two companies each take
half of the capital of Ferranti-Thomson Sonar Systems.
The acquisition of Ferranti-Thomson Sonar Systems was a first step in a
larger alliance between the French company and GEC in the sonar business,
Thomson-CSF said.
The alliance will involve putting each company's sonar activities under the
control of a single international holding company, and will require setting
up joint ventures between GEC-Marconi and Thomson-CSF in Britain, France and
other countries.
Under the acquisition agreement, which is being put to regulators,
GEC-Marconi will take 50 per cent of the capital of Ferranti-Thomson Sonar
Systems held by Ferranti International. The rest of the capital is held by
Thomson-CSF.
Thomson-CSF's indirect holding in SGS-Thomson Microelectronics will fall to
around 20 per cent from 23.81 per cent when the Franco-Italian semiconductor
group lists its shares in New York and Paris in December.
Thomson-CSF said the profit from the operation would be booked in the
current year.
From 1995, net profits of SGS-Thomson will be reported in Thomson-CSF's
accounts based on its 20 per cent stake.

prices

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, yesterday said it was
raising the prices of some of its tissue products in the US by up to 8 per
cent because of higher pulp prices, but simultaneously announced an 11 per
cent cut in the price of its Luvs disposable nappies.
The company also said it was turning Luvs into a unisex product instead of
having different types of nappy for each sex. It said the resulting cost
savings, combined with higher volumes flowing from the price cut, should
have a positive effect on profits.
Analysts say Luvs has about 13 per cent of the US disposable nappy market.
Pampers, another Procter &amp; Gamble product, has about 26 per cent,
Kimberly-Clark's Huggies about 30 per cent, and the rest is taken by private
label products.
While Pampers and Huggies vie for the top end of the market, Procter &amp;
Gamble has been repositioning Luvs as a direct competitor for private label
products by lowering its price. Yesterday's move was the latest in a series
of price reductions.
Procter &amp; Gamble also said it was cutting the price of Pampers by about 2
per cent. Analysts said this was to prevent the differential between Pampers
and Luvs becoming too wide. Kimberly-Clark is expected to follow suit
because Huggies and Pampers have for several years sold at virtually the
same price.

FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Kidder disposes of mortgage
bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kidder Peabody, the US investment bank, has disposed of a large part of its
portfolio of complex mortgage-backed bonds. It said yesterday it had hired
an outside firm to advise on the 'management and orderly disposition' of the
rest.
The bond sales mark a reversal of a plan announced in early October to
transfer the bond holdings to GE Capital, another part of the General
Electric group. Since then, General Electric has agreed to sell the bulk of
Kidder's operations to another broking firm, PaineWebber.
Kidder said yesterday its holdings of the securities, known as
collateralised mortgage obligations (CMOs), now stood at Dollars 4bn, down
from Dollars 6.7bn at the end of October. In March, before the company began
its sales, the portfolio was valued at Dollars 16bn.
CMOs are complex derivative-type securities created from pools of
mortgage-backed bonds. They have generally performed worse than other bonds
as fixed-income markets have retreated this year.
Kidder, which said it had hired New York-based investment firm BlackRock
Financial Management to advise on the remainder of the portfolio, yesterday
tried to play down suggestions of a fire-sale. It said it 'plans to continue
to own and manage the portfolio for the foreseeable future, and has no
current plans to immediately dispose of all or any significant part of the
portfolio'.
Fears that Kidder would try to unload the rest of its holdings have helped
to hold back prices in the CMO market for some months.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tele-Communications Inc, the biggest US cable TV operator, moved back into
profit in the third quarter, helped by a contribution from Liberty Media,
with which it merged in August.
On sales up 23 per cent at Dollars 1.29bn, TCI suffered a 21 per cent fall
in operating profit to Dollars 186m. However, after a Dollars 101m
contribution from Liberty and sharply lower tax, it made a net profit of 4
cents a share, compared with a 14 cents loss.
TCI said basic service customers had risen by 5.1 per cent over the past 12
months to 11.3m. However, cable companies' profits have been hit this year
by government-imposed reductions in cable rates.
TCI is withdrawing a planned Dollars 500m offering of preferred stock, due
to difficult equity market conditions.
In late October it said it was in partnership with other cable companies and
Sprint, the long-distance telephone company, to bid for personal
communications service (PCS) mobile phone licences in a forthcoming
government auction.
It is thought the drop in its share price on the announcement may have
contributed to the decision to withdraw the preference issue.

A shareholder vote on the bid battle for Sante Fe Pacific, one of the
biggest US railway companies, has been postponed from Friday of this week to
Friday December 2 because Santa Fe wants more time to consider competing
offers from Burlington Northern, the friendly suitor, and its opponent,
Union Pacific, writes Richard Tomkins.
Last week Union Pacific produced a revised offer for Santa Fe worth Dollars
3.3bn, part of it in cash and all of it payable immediately. Burlington's
latest offer is worth less at Dollars 3.1bn, is an all-share offer, and
would not be payable until the deal had been approved by the federal rail
regulators.

<TEXT>
Celsius, the Swedish defence group, yesterday announced income after
financial items of SKr644m (Dollars 88.4m) for the nine months to September,
a 29 per cent increase from SKr499m in the same 1993 period.
This year's performance reflected a strong operating result and some capital
gains, whereas a year ago it was strong money market returns on the back of
falling interest rates which generated most of the profit.
The improved operating profit of SKr449m, against SKr196m, was due mainly to
rationalisation. On top of this there was a SKr143m capital gain from the
sale of 40 per cent of Safe Partners, an offshore company, in September.
The group expects a full-year profit of around SKr900m.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (24): A pitful of stress and strain -
Health hazards / A look at one of the City's most physically demanding
professions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Warning: derivatives trading can seriously damage your health.
Whether they are scrambling around a trading pit in their brightly-coloured
jackets, wildly gesticulating and shouting prices, or hunched over the
keyboard of a screen-based trading system, eyes glued to the screen in
neon-lit, smoky offices, futures traders have a tough life.
'This is one of the toughest, most physically and mentally demanding
professions in existence, apart from professional sports,' says the floor
manager of a large member firm of the London International Futures and
Options Exchange (Liffe). 'The pressure you have to deal with on a daily
basis can be unrelenting and absolutely merciless.
Being in an environment where hundreds of millions of dollars, pounds or
D-marks change hands each day, where markets can gyrate in roller-coaster
fashion and where a split second can mean the difference between making or
losing fortunes can offer an immense stimulus. 'When you're on a roll, it's
exhilarating, it's like a drug,' gushes one dealer.
But even when traders are on a winning streak, the demands of their jobs are
immense, and often take a heavy toll on their health.
For a start, there are the purely physical side-effects.
In a trading pit, such as the ones found on Liffe, dealers stand in
octagonal, tiered arenas, buying and selling futures contracts through the
use of hand signals, reinforced by vocal price dissemination - hence the
term 'open outcry'.
This exerts high demands on various parts of their anatomies, beginning with
their vocal chords. 'If you're in this business long enough, you tend to go
hoarse - as I have,' rasps one of Liffe's old-timers.
Foot problems also abound. 'When you're standing around all day, you tend to
get swollen feet, callouses and lots of dead skin,' complains one trader.
Orthopaedic shoes are hardly an option. 'If you appear in a pair of
Scholl's, you'll have the Shoe Committee on your back,' he laughs.
The so-called Shoe Committee, a regular source of hilarity for Liffe
dealers, is a self-appointed 'watchdog' made up of floor traders who derive
amusement from keeping 'unsuitable' footwear - such as Doc Martens, brown or
suede shoes - off the floor.
The tight throng of human bodies in the pits also makes them perfect
breeding ground for bacteria, which are transmitted through droplet
infection as dealers shout out prices. 'If one person comes in with a cold,
the next day half the pit will be sneezing and wheezing,' says a trader.
And then there are the odours which inevitably arise when hot, sweaty humans
are packed together in restricted space. 'Bad breath, sweat, and other
unmentionable smells,' sighs a dealer.
In an environment where tensions run high and fully grown men - for only 30
per cent of the floor population (including broking and administrative
staff) are female - jostle for space in small pits, market participants can
come to blows, a not insignificant health hazard considering some of them
are former boxers and many play contact sports such as rugby.
'There are many reasons for fisticuffs,' says a Liffe dealer. For one, he
says, 'working conditions are appalling - we're crowded into the pits like
rats in a small cage and have to perform an exacting function where mistakes
are not tolerated.' What's more, many dealers trade their own money, and
'when they lose money, they can lose their temper', he says. In volatile
markets, these factors can create a highly charged atmosphere where people
may be tempted to use physical violence - a temptation to which some
occasionally yield.
'Heated arguments tend to occur in the more volatile pits, such as bunds and
Italian government bonds,' says Dorian Hart, floor manager on Liffe for BZW
Futures.
However, the price of physical violence in the pits is high: a strict code
of conduct is enforced by close supervision of the Liffe trading floor, and
offenders face harsh fines. Liffe penalises offenders much more heavily than
a court would do for the same offence, with fines for violent behaviour -
which includes pushing and shoving - running as high as Pounds 5,000. The
ultimate sanction for repeated misconduct is suspension from the trading
floor - effectively a one-way ticket into unemployment.
'The exchange comes down very, very hard to ensure that business is not
disrupted,' says a Liffe spokeswoman.
Screen traders face different but similarly debilitating complaints. At
Europe's largest electronic exchange, Germany's DTB, dealers trade futures
and options on stocks and bonds on a screen. Unsourced bid and offer prices
appear on a screen and traders press keys on a keyboard or click a button on
a computer mouse to buy or sell. This means that dealers have to continually
monitor changes in prices, not just in the front-month but also in
back-month contracts, requiring their eyes to rove constantly around the
screen.
'Eyestrain and back strain are typical complaints,' says Karl Haeling, head
of Deutsche Bank's futures and options group in Frankfurt. 'You need to
stare intensely at the screen all the time, the lighting may not be optimal
and the chairs can be uncomfortable.'
Others complain of repetitive strain injuries which can occur when making a
certain movement over and over again. This is a common affliction among
keyboard operators, involving tendon injuries and sometimes chronic
conditions which can lead to early retirement.
In countries where smoking on trading floors is permitted - for instance in
many German banks - dealers often smoke while trading, especially when the
markets are choppy and tensions mount. 'Traders are nervous, nervous people
often smoke, hence most traders smoke,' quips Francois Bloch, a long-time
DTB trader. Obviously, inhaling smoke - be it one's own or that of a
colleague - is a further health hazard.
The psychological impact of the stresses and strains of this job can be as
serious as - if not more so than - the physical side-effects, and
psychological burn-out can lead to a variety of stress-related illnesses.
'You are on edge all day, from the moment the pit opens until the moment it
closes,' says Mr Hart of BZW. 'Often, your brain doesn't get any time to
think, it's purely reactive,' he adds.
This breeds a wide variety of stress-related afflictions, such as eczema,
ulcers, nervous twitches, heart problems and alcohol abuse, says a dealer.
'If people feel they need a drink after work, I call that alcohol dependency
 -although I'm sure not everyone would agree with me,' he says.
Moreover, 'the globalisation of financial markets and the increase in
computer technology makes for longer and longer trading days, which leads to
greater burn-out,' says Deutsche's Mr Haeling. On Liffe's bund contract, for
example, the nine-hour trading day is followed by about 1 1/2 hours of
electronic 'automated pit trading'. The creation of Globex, the 24-hour
electronic trading system jointly developed by Reuters, the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, keeps markets going
around the clock.
There are many ways dealers try to unwind after a long day's toiling. While
some opt for less regenerative pastimes such as drinking or gambling, many
seek to improve their health and stamina with the help of regular exercise.
Cannons Sports Club, a health club located in the same building as Liffe, is
frequented by a large number of dealers who let off some of their steam by
pumping iron or thrashing a squash ball around.
However, for dealers with families it is not always easy to make time for
sports, especially if they have a long journey to work. 'As it is, I spend
12 hours a day away from home - am I supposed to tell my three-year-old kid:
'Daddy would love to play with you, but he has to go and work out',' asks
one dealer.
Alas, many of the City's stress-sufferers do not actually acknowledge that
they feel mentally or physically stretched.
'People who come to us will not necessarily present stress as their primary
problem,' says Dr John Briffa, who runs Cannons' Health Enhancement Centre.
The centre screens clients' health and lifestyles and makes recommendations
on how they can improve their physical and mental well-being.
'Working in the City is inherently stressful, but a lot of people don't
acknowledge that,' he says. For one, he says, it's because 'everyone else is
stressed, so they think it's the norm'.
But even when they are aware of the stress burden, 'there's a fair degree of
machismo in the City that doesn't allow them to admit that they can't cope.'
Although the demands of the job sound daunting, it manages to attract all
types: the huge, broad-shouldered rugby-player types with booming voices;
the small, agile operators; and a growing number of women. 'There is no one
stereotype: the types who survive and do well are at absolute extremes of
the scale,' says Alex Lamb, a former pit trader and now general manager at
Fimat in Frankfurt.
While some still feel that big is best in the open-outcry environment,
traders' physique is not as important as their social attributes, he says.
'A good trader needs a sharp memory, a high degree of numeracy, eyes like a
hawk and strong communication skills.'
Screen traders do not have to be as extroverted as their colleagues in the
pits. 'At the screen, you can be a shy and retiring guy and still wipe the
floor with the rest of the market,' says Mr Lamb.
'In some respects, you could think of it as The Revenge of the Nerds,' quips
Mr Haeling.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (22): Forced on to the defensive -
Profile of Bankers Trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every risk, says the advertisement, deserves a second look.
For Bankers Trust, author of the message, the line must have something of a
hollow ring. This year, the New York-based bank has been forced on to the
defensive in its risk management business - previously one of its
fastest-growing and most profitable areas - by a string of accusations and
lawsuits. Did its ambitious strategy in the derivatives business blind
Bankers Trust to the risks it was running?
One test will be the outcome of the lawsuits against it, in particular a
Dollars 130m claim from Procter &amp; Gamble. The fall-out from that case has
highlighted three areas of risk and raised questions about the bank's
abilities to deal with them.
These are: the risk posed by volatile financial markets, the risk to the
bank's reputation when the complex financial products it deals in turn sour,
and the risk that regulators will take action against the bank specifically
and against the derivatives markets more generally.
Market risk has surfaced in two forms for Bankers Trust this year - as a
dampener on its own trading profits, and as a potential threat to the
risk-management structures it devises for customers. In the first of these,
it can draw comfort from its performance during turbulent world bond markets
early this year.
While the markets were awash with rumours of huge losses at Bankers Trust -
forcing it to take the unusual step of issuing a denial - the first three
months of the year brought a loss of only Dollars 49m from trading and
proprietary position-taking, followed by profits in the following two
quarters which were roughly in line with average quarterly earnings in 1991
and 1992. At a time when many other big traders were taking a bath, from
hedge funds run by George Soros to the proprietary desks of banks such as
Salomon, this counts as a creditable performance.
For its client risk management business - which creates complex derivatives
to reduce corporate or institutional customers' risks to movements in
interest rates, currencies or commodities - the upheaval in financial
markets could have a longer lasting impact. The complex interest rate swap
created for Procter &amp; Gamble in November last year turned sour as US rates
rose.
Bankers Trust is believed to have suffered no market losses, since it has a
policy of hedging its risks in such cases (according to Procter &amp; Gamble,
the hedges used to cover the Dollars 200m swap had a nominal value of
Dollars 3bn - an indication of the huge risks embedded in the instrument).
But the swap left Procter &amp; Gamble committed to paying an interest rate of
14.12 per cent above the commercial paper rate for the next 4 1/2 years,
rather than the 40 basis points below CP rate which had been its target
funding rate.
Whatever the merits of Procter &amp; Gamble's legal claim, it is clear that the
product failed spectacularly.
This highlights the second risk: to the bank's reputation. Arguably, its
ambitions in the derivatives business, where it has a clear lead over most
competitors, blinded it to the operational risks it was running.
The preliminary results of an internal investigation, which has turned up
apparent irregularities in bookkeeping and sales practices in its corporate
derivatives business, suggest that internal controls failed (though it is
far from clear yet whether this supports the legal claims of Procter &amp;
Gamble and Gibson Greetings, which say they were misled about the nature of
the financial instruments they bought).
Meantime, in spite of the bad publicity it has attracted, Bankers Trust's
earnings from the risk management business have held up this year. On
average, income each quarter this year has matched or exceeded the
experience of recent years - despite fall-off in position-taking by hedge
fund and other so-called 'directional' traders.
'The biggest impact this year has been the fall in the market. It is holding
back hedgers and view-takers at the same time,' says Brian Walsh, head of
derivatives, Bankers Trust.
Despite this, greater demand from corporate and institutional customers,
including strong growth in the business in Europe, means that the bank
continues to grow. 'Our risk management advisory teams are very busy,' says
Charles Sanford, chairman of Bankers Trust.
The third risk is still harder to quantify, but could have longer-term
repercussions: that zealous regulators will make the derivatives markets a
less profitable place to do business.
The threat of derivatives regulation from Congress has died, at least for
now. But both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the
Commodities and Futures Trading Commission are looking into the claims
against Bankers Trust - the first clear sign that both agencies, feeling the
heat from politicians, want to establish some jurisdiction over the
over-the-counter swaps markets.
If they are successful, the extra layers of regulation could add to the
costs of derivatives activity. Some dealers complain that the SEC's capital
adequacy rules would hamper the swaps market.
These are risks for the future. In the meantime, Bankers Trust's results for
1994 so far have been remarkably steady - a testament to the success of
diversification and risk management policies designed for just such
eventualities. Even during the turbulent first quarter, the bank's return on
equity reached 15 per cent. It stayed at that level in the following two
quarters.
A bigger challenge will be to lift profitability back to the levels which
had put Bankers Trust among the top-performing US banks since the turn of
the decade. Last year's return on equity of 26 per cent was the fourth
consecutive year the bank had topped 20 per cent.
Matching that will not be easy. Most analysts agree that 1993 was an
exceptional year in financial markets that will not be repeated for some
time. And even matching the absolute level of trading profits of earlier
years will not produce a superior return on capital in the future, given the
much higher levels of capital Bankers Trust now carries.
At the beginning of 1990, the bank's total shareholders' funds were Dollars
3bn: by the end of September this year, the figure had jumped to Dollars
4.5bn. That may make Bankers Trust a better capitalised bank, but it leaves
open the question of how it can grow its profits.
The answer depends in part on whether Bankers Trust can employ its capital
as profitably in future in the proprietary trading. 'We think that (it) will
be a good business again,' says Mr Sanford.
Has the amount of capital committed to the market by hedge funds and the
proprietary desks of banks changed the character of markets, making it more
difficult to identify 'directional' trends? 'No, I don't think so,' says Mr
Sanford. 'There's just more volatility.'

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (23): Case study for business schools
 -Richard Waters re-examines the Metallgesellschaft hedging strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft's disaster in the oil derivatives markets is destined to
remain a favourite business-school case study for years to come.
Was the hedging strategy undertaken by the group's US subsidiary, MG Corp,
fatally flawed from the start? Or was it a panic by the group's supervisory
board in Germany (along with its bankers) that led to eventual 'hedging'
losses of more than Dollars 1bn?
With a batch of prominent US academics pointing the finger at the
supervisory board in recent months, this arcane subject has taken on an
unusual twist - prompting Metallgesellshcaft and its lead banker, Deutsche
Bank, to mount a public defence of their position.
The facts are these. MG Corp signed long-term contracts to supply oil
products to customers in the US at fixed prices. Then it used futures and
swaps to protect itself against a rise in the oil price, which otherwise
might have destroyed the profit margins on the supply contracts.
During 1993 - and especially in the final three months of the year - the oil
price plummeted, hitting the value of the derivative instruments held as
hedges. In theory, that would not have caused a problem over the long term:
if the oil price remained low, the derivatives losses would be balanced by
higher profits on the oil supply contracts over time. But in the short term,
MG had to pay out over Dollars 900m in the form of additional margin on its
futures positions, and extra collateral to counterparties on
over-the-counter swaps.
The result: a liquidity crisis of massive proportions, leading to an
emergency line of credit from banks and a forced unwinding of most of the
company's derivative positions (and, apparently, also of its underlying
supply contracts).
According to the academics, this is where MG went wrong. In a joint paper,
Professor Merton Miller, a Nobel laureate, and Christopher Culp, a graduate
student, argue that the company's 'problem was not with its derivatives
group, but more likely was with its supervisory board and supporting banks
who may not have understood the hedging strategy and forced the premature
liquidation of (its) hedge positions.'
A paper by Culp and Professor Steve Hanke, of John Hopkins University, puts
it more strongly still: MG's 'real operational risk was not that its
supervisory board noticed the 'problem' too late, but rather that it
misdiagnosed the problem entirely.' It is not just the company's board that
is criticised: mistakes by regulators in the US also precipitated the
losses, they claim.
There are three questions at the heart of the case.
First, did futures regulators and the Nymex, where MG bought oil futures,
add to the problems and indirectly force MG to liquidate its holdings? As
the company's liquidity problems emerged in early December last year, Nymex
doubled the company's margin requirements, adding to its cash problems.
Later, it also took away the company's hedgers' exemption, effectively
halving the position limits it was allowed to maintain on the exchange and
preventing it maintaining its hedge positions.
According to an MG spokesman: 'The liquidation was, for the most part,
determined by the unwillingness of OTC counterparties to trade with MG and
the order by the Nymex to trade for liquidation purposes only.'
For its part, though, the Nymex's main concern was to protect the integrity
of its clearing process and prevent MG's losses hitting other members. Could
it really be blamed for failing to extend privileges to a company that had
brought a liquidity crisis down on itself?
The second, and most significant, question is whether, by liquidating its
positions, the Metallgesellschaft board turned what were only paper losses
into real ones.
The unwinding was precipitated by the German group's bankers, who balked at
extending further funding to support the group's hedging strategy.
'This funding problem was the result of MG's creditors not understanding
(its) fundamental financial position,' according to Professor Franklin
Edwards, of Columbia University's business school. 'They should have been
willing to lend against the specific collateral of these (derivative)
contracts.'
Professor Edwards is joint author of a textbook on futures and options with
Ms Cindy Ma, herself a risk manager with MG Corp during the fateful period.
What this argument fails to take account of, though, is the funding costs
that MG would have faced while waiting out the 10 years of its long-term
supply contracts (and, according to the company, many of those contracts
were structured for the bulk of the deliveries to be made right at the end
of the ten-year period). Given its liquidity problems, the company's cost of
funds would have been high indeed.
Also complicating the question was the fact that MG was losing money every
time it rolled over its oil futures contracts. On each rollover date, as it
sold expiring futures contracts and bought new ones to carry the hedge
forward, MG had to pay more for the new contracts than it received for the
old ones (forward prices were higher than current ones, the equivalent of a
positive yield curve).
According to MG, this 'rollover cost' amounted to Dollars 20m-30m in each of
October and November, and would have been Dollars 50m in December.
The third question: should MG really have rushed to unwind its derivatives
positions at what turned out to the be the very bottom of the market? Oil
prices have risen around Dollars 4 a barrel since last December. Assuming MG
had an open position of 150,000 barrels (as stated in a lawsuit brought
against the company by its former head of risk management, Arthur Benson),
it would have reduced its losses by Dollars 600m if it had waited until now
to sell.
According to MG, though, the position it was rolling over in the market each
month was so big that it was distorting the normal equilibrium of supply and
demand. The company says its massive position was equivalent to 85 days'
worth of the entire output of Kuwait. 'It is incorrect to assume,' says an
MG spokesman, 'that the market would have rebounded if the company continued
its scheme.'
There is one other aspect of this sorry tale that deserves note. Having
unwound many of its original supply contracts along with the derivatives, MG
Corp no longer had the same need in the future to buy huge amounts of oil
and oil products to sell on to customers.
It had earlier signed long-term contracts to buy oil products from a US
refining company, Castle Energy, at an agreed margin over market prices (MG
also bought a large minority stake in Castle). In September, MG reached an
agreement to terminate those contracts - at a cost, in terms of the debt and
other claims over Castle it has given up, of around Dollars 500m.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (21): Interest from abroad rises -
Profile of South African Futures Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like most other aspects of the South African financial system, the country's
derivatives market has come under greatly increased international scrutiny
over the past year. And, as they have done after looking over the stock
market and banks, most international observers come away generally impressed
with the range and sophistication of available products.
The bulk of South Africa's derivatives trading takes place on the South
African Futures Exchange, a Johannesburg-based body that celebrated its
fifth anniversary this year. Since its formation, it has grown from a small
organisation, regarded with some suspicion by local banks and brokers, to a
thriving, and rapidly expanding market.
Indeed, Safex's growth has been so dynamic, that at least one local company
has fallen prey to the same trap that snared companies in the bigger
international markets: banking group Sechold was unable to close its
positions at the end of last year and lost R198m.
However, the exchange has largely shrugged off unfavourable publicity
resulting from the Sechold affair, and the monthly value of futures and
options traded on the exchange has risen from less than R5bn as recently as
1992, to a high of R25bn this year.
The bulk of the trade is done by merchant banks and brokerages, which each
account for around 40 per cent of total business, with the rest taken up by
a mix of individuals and other institutions.
Reflecting the market's steady growth, the number of exchange members has
also expanded steadily and now stands at 82, while the price of a seat on
Safex is now around R130,000, comparing favourably with the start-up price
of R35,000 in 1988 and well up on the low of R4,000 reached in 1991.
By far the bulk of the trade on Safex is in equity futures, based on the
main gold and industrial indices on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE).
Indeed, this market has been so successful that Safex ranks in the top 12
international equity futures markets.
The exchange has also recently made representation to the registrar of
financial institutions to begin trading in individual shares. It plans to
focus initially on five blue-chips, including industrial giant South African
Breweries, and mining houses Anglo American and De Beers.
So far, however, despite heavy government lobbying by Safex members,
permission has not yet been granted and there is a strong constituency among
established brokers on the JSE who are wholly against such innovations. The
plan's detractors charge not only that they are unnecessary because the
shares in question are already relatively liquid, but that there is
inadequate surveillance to prevent front-running.
Undaunted, Safex is pressing ahead while also experimenting with a number of
other instruments. Most notably it is planning to replace its lacklustre
dollar gold price contracts, which have failed to excite interest because of
South Africa's lack of direct access to the global spot markets, with
Krugerrand contracts. These would become the first physically delivered
contracts in the country.
There are plans also to sell commodities futures. Although these have
normally been the first options available in most countries, given the
highly regulated domestic commodities market, they have not yet been
possible to implement in South Africa.
However, because of the government's deregulation programme, the exchange
hopes to begin contracts in potatoes and meat on an experimental basis
shortly.
Other more exotic instruments, including trading in currency and interest
rate futures are also available, but have attracted relatively little
attention. The former instrument will have to wait for the scrapping
probably next year of the financial rand, the investment currency that
foreigners have to use to invest in South Africa.
Even without a wide range of derivatives, however, foreign interest is
already substantial, accounting for some 10 per cent of all trade on Safex.
This year, Safex also formally joined the US-based Futures Industry
Association, highlighting its new international profile.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (19): A symbol of modernisation -
Milan Stock Exchange / Andrew Hill discusses the new stock index future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fact that Italians already trade futures on government bonds, but are
only now getting round to establishing a future on the equity index tells
you a lot about Italian markets.
Government bonds have long been the investment instrument of choice for
Italians, particularly for savings. The market is popular and liquid.
But the equity market has been viewed with some suspicion. The fact that a
small number of stocks are quoted - only 210 domestic companies are listed
compared with twice that number in Germany and France, and eight times in
the UK - coupled with a perceived absence of regulation (a law to make
insider trading illegal was only introduced comparatively recently, for
instance), seemed to make it a market for the brave professional.
In that sense, the introduction of a future on the revamped index of most
liquid Italian stocks - the MIB 30 - is being heralded by the stock exchange
authorities as the latest and most important symbol of the modernisation of
the Milan-based market. It is no coincidence that a presentation on the new
equity derivatives market was at the centre of the Italian investment road
show in London and New York. The road show also promoted developments such
as the move to full screen-based trading of equities, and the gradual
transformation from a monthly account system to five-day rolling settlement.
The futures market should be launched 'on or around' November 28, according
to Ettore Fumagalli, who heads the stock exchange's equity derivatives
committee, and the first product will be the MIB 30 index future. The
contract will have a face value of L100m - calculated by multiplying the
base value of the underlying index (fixed at 10,000 points) by the L10,000
value of each index point, which will also be the minimum price variation of
the contract. Trading will take place between 9.30am and 5.30pm (compared
with the equity market itself which, from November 28, will trade between
10am and 5pm). Settlement will be in cash.
Potential traders seem broadly optimistic about the prospects for Italian
equity derivatives. Some 70 Sims (locally registered securities houses) have
signed up to trade on the computerised market. 'I'm very confident,' says
one trader with a foreign bank. 'I'm also happy that a limited number of
companies has requested machines, because, frankly, the requirements of
Consob (the financial market regulator) on capital backing were too low.'
In the next phase, the stock exchange authorities hope to introduce an
option on the MIB 30 index, and then, probably early next year, options on
single shares.
The stock exchange's forecasts on trading volume of the new future are
comparatively modest - daily volume of L412bn, half that of the total
underlying volume, with around 2,750 contracts traded in about 900
transactions - but the exchange says the impact on the liquidity of the
underlying market should be notable. 'There should be a positive effect on
volumes,' agrees Alberto Pasqualone, chief trader at Sigeco in Milan.
In this respect, the introduction of the future comes at exactly the right
time. This has been one of the most volatile years in recent memory for the
Italian market, which has taken its lead from the constantly changing
political scene. Immediately after the March election of a pro-business
right-wing coalition, headed by media magnate Silvio Berlusconi, equities
surged ahead, prompting a string of opportunistic rights issues. But since
June, uncertainty about the coherence of that same coalition, and its
robustness in the face of escalating industrial action, has brought the
stock market back to pre-election levels or lower.
'International investors, who have been extremely active in the underlying
market for the past year or so, have been particularly keen to be able to
use futures and options, either to obtain or hedge their exposure, or to
profit from the volatility of the market,' Mr Fumagalli told analysts during
the London roadshow.
The Italians are eager to emphasise that unlike in some other European
trading centres, both the underlying market and the derivatives market use
the same trading system and come under the same regulatory and management
authority. 'Specifically, we believe that through these advantages, market
participants will benefit from the possibility of creating integrated
information, research and trading systems,' says Mr Fumagalli.
Starting a new market not easy. Other fledgling futures and options markets
have struggled with technical and trading problems - in Belgium, the new
Belfox exchange took nearly two years from its 1991 launch to overcome
teething troubles.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (20): Stability lifts hopes in Brazil
/ Profile of BM&amp;F, Sao Paulo's commodities and futures exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was Brazil's soaring inflation and economic volatility that helped give
birth to Sao Paulo's commodities and futures exchange (BM&amp;F), today the
fifth biggest futures exchange in the world.
And although inflation has recently fallen dramatically, following the
launch of a new currency linked to Brazil's foreign reserves, the BM&amp;F
(Bolsa Mercadorias &amp; de Futuros) has continued to grow as new uncertainties
emerge.
Created in 1986, the exchange has expanded dramatically in recent years. The
number of contracts traded jumped to 60m last year from 45m in 1992, while
during the first nine months of this year contract volume reached 64m and
financial volume was Dollars 754bn.
Market analysts hope that following last month's presidential election of Mr
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who helped introduce the new real currency and is
expected to push for structural economic reforms, Brazil is on the path
towards long-term economic stabilisation.
That process is likely to create sustained economic growth and reverse the
short termism which dominates Brazil's financial system, as well as increase
the assets of pension funds and unit trusts. These factors are in turn
likely to increase demand for derivatives from companies and investment
funds.
But the BM&amp;F has still to overcome problems, including government
restrictions that limit foreign investment and hamper trading links with
exchanges abroad. Also, important areas such as agricultural futures
generally lack liquidity, which is concentrated in just a few contracts,
notably one-day interbank deposit contracts, dollar futures and stock index
futures.
Another problem is the narrow customer base, which is dominated by Brazil's
banks. They generated much of the exchange's growth in their need to hedge
one-day interbank deposit contracts, Brazil's benchmark interest rate.
'There are probably only around 200 customers, nearly all financial
institutions,' says a Sao Paulo banker, adding that most company treasurers
still do not use derivatives because of the short-term outlook prevalent in
Brazil, caused by high inflation. Another reason has been that, despite
inflationary volatility, other areas of the economy used to be relatively
stable.
For example, the central bank used to devalue the local currency on a daily
basis, in line with inflation expectations; but since the new currency was
launched the bank has generally not intervened in the foreign exchange
market, and instead has allowed the real to float against the dollar. This
has created new uncertainties for companies and a growth in dollar futures
trading.
Bankers say the small size of Brazil's over-the-counter market, which
represents about 10-15 per cent of the BM&amp;F's volume, is an indication of
how underdeveloped the use of derivatives by companies is.
But if long-term economic stabilisation is achieved, analysts expect the
balance sheets of companies and financial institutions to lengthen, which
will probably create more demand for hedging. This process has already
begun. Since the real was launched in July, futures contract terms have been
gradually lengthening. Mr Marcos Eugenio da Silva, a University of Sao Paulo
economist, expects the next six months to be a period of adaptation to low
inflation.
He notes that in the pre-real days, when inflation was 40-50 per cent a
month, there was only very short-term liquidity for the key one-day
interbank deposit futures. 'Now that there are fewer worries about
inflation, some interbank deposit contracts are being negotiated for terms
of six months,' he says.
As well as encouraging the lengthening of contract terms, the BM&amp;F is trying
to develop international links, partly to increase the volume of
agricultural futures trading, which currently represents 5 per cent of
contracts, and also to take advantage of Brazil's position as one of the
world's leading agricultural producers.
The exchange would like to attract some of the agricultural futures trading
from Chicago to Sao Paulo, particularly for commodities such as coffee, of
which Brazil is the world's leading producer.
However, the exchange has had limited success in establishing liquidity for
agricultural contracts. Part of the problem, according to Mr da Silva, is
that production in Brazil of commodities such as orange juice, cotton and
sugar cane are concentrated among a few companies, which are often
suspicious of the futures market. He adds that establishing international
links is hampered by Brazil's lack of a stable and convertible currency.
Another problem in creating trading links with foreign exchanges is
government restrictions.
Government restrictions also limit foreign investment in the BM&amp;F. Only
foreign investors who hold shares on Brazilian stock markets can invest in
futures. Foreign investment is mainly in stock index and dollar futures, the
latter for investors seeking to hedge the value of their portfolios, and
represents 7.5 per cent of total investment, according to Mr Lauro de Araujo
Silva, BM&amp;F market relations director.
Liberalising foreign investment would increase speculation and liquidity,
say analysts. They point to the example of Sao Paulo's stock market, where
average daily trading volume has increased tenfold to Dollars 400-500m since
it was opened to international investors in 1991.
'We are seeking ways for international investors to trade here, in the same
way as they do in New York or London,' says Mr Araujo Silva.
The BM&amp;F wants the government to liberalise foreign investment in order to
prevent development abroad of the market for Brazilian stock futures. The US
over-the-counter market already trades futures of the Brazilian stock
indices and basket options made up of a handful of blue-chips.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (16): How borrowers cut funding costs
 -Interest rate swaps / A look at an essential tool of risk management
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
As an essential tool of risk management as well as a means of reducing
funding costs, both exchange-traded and over-the-counter interest rate swaps
have experienced strong growth in recent years and are now widely used by
corporate treasurers.
The amount of interest rate swaps outstanding totalled Dollars 6,177bn at
the end of 1993, according to the International Swaps and Derivatives
Association (Isda), with market growth of 60 per cent last year.
The benefits of using such sophisticated derivative instruments have
doubtless continued to be appreciated by borrowers in this year's difficult
market conditions. With investor sentiment likely to remain bearish and
markets volatile, with business becoming ever more global, and in spite of
heavy losses incurred by some companies on certain derivative contracts, the
growth of the interest rate swaps markets looks set to continue.
An interest rate swap allows counterparties to exchange the risk associated
with borrowing funds at either a fixed or a floating interest rate. For
example, one borrower may be able to raise funds relatively cheaply in the
fixed-rate market. However, he may require floating-rate funds. He can
therefore use a swap to borrow at a fixed rate of interest but exchange the
proceeds with another borrower who has a comparative advantage in the
floating-rate sector.
In this way, corporate treasurers can significantly cut the costs of funding
and at the same time manage their exposure to interest rate movements across
a wide range of currencies. The role of the banks in this equation has
traditionally been to match counterparties with offsetting borrowing
requirements, although as the liquidity of the market has risen, their role
is becoming more that of a market maker, making prices in the different swap
products.
Although most swap trades are between counterparties exchanging fixed- and
floating-rate risk in a single currency, it is also possible to swap between
currencies. This allows borrowers to exploit the comparative advantage they
may have in a particular currency sector. For example, a borrower may raise
fixed interest rate D-Marks but swap them for floating-rate dollars.
According to Isda, there was Dollars 900bn of currency swaps outstanding by
the end of 1993.
A wide variety of swap products can be purchased from and traded on many of
the world's derivative exchanges. Large and highly liquid, the exchanges
allow investors to switch their exposures from one market to another in a
matter of moments. However, being standardised products, exchange-traded
swaps do not always meet users' exact needs. Increasingly, therefore, it is
to the over-the-counter market that corporate treasurers are turning for
their swap needs.
In this market, where the degree of innovation in types of new products has
been staggering, intermediaries such as banks offer products which are
tailored to borrowers' particular requirements.
In an attempt to compete, exchanges have developed more customised exchange
products such as Flex contracts in Chicago. However, to a large extent they
remain eclipsed by the variety and flexibility in terms of maturity and
structure of instruments that the OTC market can offer.
Nevertheless, exchanges continue to play an important role in the swaps
market. This is because of their size and liquidity, and not least because
they are used by corporate managers to hedge their positions in the OTC
market and by the banks, the providers of the OTC instruments, as protection
against their exposure.
One of the main reasons for the rise of the interest rate swaps market has
been the increasing international basis on which business is being
conducted. As barriers between markets, which had forced both investors to
rely on limited domestic sectors, have been removed over the past 10 years,
many large institutions have begun to focus increasingly on investment
opportunities available in new overseas markets. As a result, their funding
needs and their income streams have become more varied.
Alongside these developments have been the technological advancements which
have made almost instant access to these new overseas markets possible. A
greater understanding among users of how derivative products work and a
greater appreciation of the value that they can add has also played a
significant role in allowing the market to develop.
'Corporate managers are becoming more and more comfortable with the concept
of risk management,' said Stephen Compton, head of interest rate derivative
trading at Citibank in London. 'The large corporates are now using swap
products in a far more sophisticated way and are exploiting the instruments'
full potential.'
Bad publicity surrounding the heavy losses on some derivative contracts
incurred by companies such as Germany's Metallgesellschaft, and Proctor &amp;
Gamble, and the charges that some banks are marketing swaps in an
irresponsible manner has done little to dampen market activity. Rather,
according to many market participants, it has focused attention on the
benefits that derivatives have to offer.
'The publicity has been a constructive warning to the market,' said Mr
Compton. 'The result has been a real push to best-practices.'
Germany's Metallgeselschaft had to be rescued by its banks when a trading
subsidiary incurred estimated losses of Dollars 1bn on oil derivatives.
Proctor &amp; Gamble has filed a lawsuit against Bankers Trust after losing more
than Dollars 100m on swaps sold by the bank. P&amp;G claims that Bankers Trust
did not 'accurately and fully' disclose information about the derivatives
contract.
Despite these setbacks, the development of the interest rate swaps market
looks set to continue, particularly in emerging sectors such as the Greek
drachma market, which has witnessed strong growth recently. There will also
be a continued need for sophisticated instruments while market conditions
worldwide remain difficult, which looks likely. What is more, derivatives do
not rely solely on price rises - they can be used to exploit bearish as well
as bullish price movements, so there is no logical reason why activity
should drop off as market conditions worsen.
'The development of the interest rate swaps market will certainly continue,'
said Jim L'Estrange, head of marketing for derivatives in Europe at Citibank
in London. 'Off-balance sheet risk management tools remain the most
efficient way of managing exposures, as well as enabling people to borrow
where it is cheapest and then convert the funds to where they were wanted in
the first place.'

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (17): Down but not out - Hedge funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hedge funds have been blamed for a wide variety of financial market
upheavals ranging from the 1993 breakdown of the exchange rate mechanism of
the European Monetary System to this year's bloodbath in the bond markets.
Yet, beyond the sensational headlines about the big bucks and big egos
associated with this industry, few people have a clear understanding of how
hedge funds work. What is more, although hedge fund managers, like many
other financial market participants, have lost large amounts of money in
this year's market turbulences, talk about the imminent demise of the
industry is premature.
'This year has been an aberration,' says Dixon Boardman, managing director
of Optima Funds, who run some Dollars 650m in multi-manager funds. 'These
people are the great investment brains of the fund management industry, and
a great brain doesn't go stupid overnight. They will rise and shine again.'
As observers try to assess the success rate of the manifold strategies
pursued by hedge fund managers, the debate over what exactly constitutes a
hedge fund continues.
Originally, hedge funds were US equity funds which 'hedged' against market
declines by holding short, as well as long, positions. In recent years,
however, funds started using leverage and derivatives to enhance returns and
taking large bets on the direction of markets. The picture is further
complicated by managed futures funds, which use similar techniques to some
hedge funds but invest only in derivatives, rather than cash securities.
According to estimates by Tass, a London-based research firm which monitors
some 1,500 absolute-return managers, Dollars 75bn to Dollars 80bn are
invested in hedge funds, which number between 800 and 900 worldwide. With a
handful of big players dominating the market, some 35 per cent of that money
is said to be managed by about 1 per cent of the fund managers. Meanwhile,
some Dollars 25bn are under management with about 450 to 500 active futures
managers, according to Tass.
'The expression hedge-fund industry is a misnomer,' says Joseph Nicholas,
president of Hedge Fund Research, a Chicago-based consulting firm. 'It has
become a catch-all for a variety of skill-based strategies, many of which
don't even use derivatives.'
HFR have devised a list of 12 typical investment strategies employed by
hedge fund managers, and track the performance of each of these sectors on a
quarterly basis. These include short-sellers, funds which invest in
distressed securities, emerging markets funds, macro funds, convertible
arbitrage funds, and merger arbitrage funds.
Rather than putting all their eggs in one basket by picking one particular
type of fund manager, many investors choose to spread their money - and
their risk - across a spectrum of management styles by buying so-called
multi-manager funds. These are funds which are invested with a selection of
hedge-fund managers pursuing different strategies.
'We try to blend together a group of these managers and aim to give our
investors a smooth ride,' says Mr Boardman, who runs such a fund. 'In this
year's volatile markets, the multi-manager approach has been vindicated,' he
says, adding:'At Optima, we haven't attended any weddings this year, but Iam
happy to say we also haven't attended any funerals.'
In 1993, most hedge funds, especially those investing in fixed income,
produced stellar performances as the global bond market rally pushed yields
close to historical lows. With billions of dollars to invest, some of the
large global, or macro, participants were unable to take large positions in
equity markets and traded the bond and currency markets, the only ones big
enough to offer the liquidity they needed.
Steep yield curves enticed hedge funds and banks' proprietary traders to
leverage up massively by borrowing money low rates and buy European bonds.
That lucrative game came to an end early this year amid growing signs that
the bond rally was overdone. The tide turned abruptly on February 4, when
the US Federal Reserve raised short-term rates for the first time in the
current cycle, triggering a sharp sell-off in the bond markets and
inflicting heavy damage on the most highly leveraged operators.
'We have had a slow, painful bond market crash which has created an
extremely difficult environment for many people, and huge losses by some of
the big participants have given the hedge-fund industry a reputation it
doesn't deserve,' says Jean-Francois Buisseret, managing director of
Concerto Research, which advises a Jersey-based multi-manager investment
company.
Many macro fund managers also lost money on the mistaken bet that the dollar
would rise substantially in 1994.
Among this year's most widely publicised casualties were three hedge fund
managers referred to as 'the three Davids': David Askin, David Gerstenhaber
and David Weill. At the beginning of 1993, their fund management companies
had combined equity under management of around Dollars 2.5bn; today, after
heavy losses, redemptions and, in one case, bankruptcy, that has dwindled to
around Dollars 70m.
Some of the big macro fund managers, such as Michael Steinhardt, Leon
Cooperman and Julian Robertson, also incurred sharp losses due to their high
exposure to bond markets. According to Tass, macro funds lost between 18 and
20 per cent in the year to end-October.
Meanwhile, many smaller hedge fund managers employing more specialist
strategies managed to protect their downside or even post gains in this
difficult environment. 'About 60 per cent of money under management in hedge
funds showed disappointing results, but in terms of fund managers, only
about 20 per cent did really badly,' says Mr Buisseret.
As he sees it, specialised niche players, rather than the big macro
participants, hold the key to the future. 'I am a great believer in
specialisation; markets are becoming more and more sophisticated and price
movements are increasingly difficult to predict unless you know a lot about
the market you are operating in.'
However, the macro operators should not be relegated to the rubbish heap of
fund-management history, boasting as they do highly respectable long-term
track records.
'Looking back over the past five to 10 years, investors in these funds know
they still did vastly better than if they invested in conventional funds,'
says Mr Boardman.
Indeed, despite their poor performance this year, 'we are staying with the
macro managers and are confident they will recover their losses', says
Michael Goldman, managing director of Momentum Asset Management, which runs
multi-manager hedge funds.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (15): Increasing prices heighten
interest - Commodities / Rapid development of the OTC market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commodities have become a hot topic this year. Explosive price increases in
raw materials such as copper and aluminium, fuelled by renewed economic
growth across most of the world, has triggered interest in how best to take
advantage of these rising prices, while at the same time protecting against
the risks that they represent.
The result has been a rapid development of the over-the-counter (OTC)
commodities swaps market. The exchange-traded market, highly liquid and
transparent and already widely used by many of the large commodity producers
and consumers, continues to expand. But it is to the over-the-counter market
that many new and traditional users of commodity-linked derivatives are
turning.
They are attracted by the flexibility and variety of the instruments offered
by banks in this market. Users can buy tools which allow exposure to
commodities on terms and over maturities simply not available on the traded
exchanges. Exchanges reduce instruments to their lowest common denominator,
which everyone can buy, trade and use, but which do not always correspond to
an investor's needs. OTC instruments, on the other hand, can be tailor-made
to the particular requirements of each individual user.
'There is infinitely more flexibility in the OTC market,' said Martin
Fraenkel, manager of commodity risk management at Chase Manhattan bank in
London. 'This manifests itself in a whole variety of swap, forward and
option contracts with different settlement periods to the exchange
contracts.'
At the same time, users are becoming increasingly aware of the vast array of
instruments available to them. They are also gradually acquiring a greater
understanding and appreciation of the benefits that the instruments can
provide.
'Many users really are looking at the market for the first time,' said Keith
Murphy, vice-president and head of commodity derivatives at JP Morgan in
London. 'They did not know some of the things we are offering could be
done.'
'We maintain relationships with 10 to 15 of the world's largest commodity
producers and around 90 per cent of these are actively hedging their price
risk using the swaps market. We have never been busier,' said one banker in
charge of commodity derivatives at a bank in London.
But it is not just producers and consumers of raw materials that are turning
in increasing numbers to the OTC market. Investors, keen to exploit the
spectacular price increases witnessed in many commodity sectors, are looking
to the OTC market to gain exposure to commodities.
The result has been the arrival in the market of a number of big operators,
such as Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch and other large banks,
offering a variety of instruments pegged to different commodity baskets or
indices.
In addition, a number of investment funds have recently been created. For
example, the BZW commodities trust will invest in various types of OTC
derivative instruments with the aim of outperforming the Goldman Sachs
commodity index. Fleming is to run a natural resources investment trust,
which will get exposure to commodities by buying shares in companies
involved in extracting and processing natural resources.
The thinking behind these innovations is that commodities are now ready to
be treated as an asset class in their own right - to be used by investors as
a way of diversifying their portfolios away from a simple reliance on other
assets such as stocks and bonds, as well as a hedge against inflation and a
play on economic growth.
Commodities tend to rise in price during periods of economic growth, whereas
bonds generally fall in value as inflation and interest rates rise, as has
happened in such dramatic fashion this year.
'There is now a lot of interest among investors in using commodities to
diversify away from stocks and bonds,' said Sohail Jaffer, vice-president in
the financial institutions group at Citibank in London.
'Investors are showing a new interest in metals and other commodities,' said
Mr Murphy. 'They have made a leap of faith and at last they are listening to
what we have been telling them.'
The growth of the OTC market has not detracted from the exchange-traded
market, however. In fact, quite the contrary - many of the users of the OTC
market and the intermediary banks that provide the OTC products have tended
to use the exchanges more and more to hedge their exposures in the OTC
market.
The exchanges, such as the London Metal Exchange, which moved to larger
premises in the City of London at the end of last month, will continue to
play an important role. This is especially true for those investors who
require quick and easy access to their investments. Sabre Fund Management,
for example, a fund which has Dollars 90m under management in commodities,
uses only the exchange-traded market.
'We take an active rather than a passive approach to fund management and
will not want to hold the same position over the course of, say, five years,
but will want to change our positions,' said John Demaine of Sabre. 'So we
use the exchange-traded market for its liquidity and transparency.'
Nevertheless, the development of the OTC market looks set to continue. This
is in spite of the bad publicity surrounding the heavy losses accrued by
some companies, such as Proctor &amp; Gamble and Metallgesellschaft, and the
charges that many derivative products are being marketed in an irresponsible
manner by some banks.
'Recent articles about losses on derivatives have not had a negative
impact,' said Mr Murphy. 'Instead, they have been positive in focusing both
consumers and producers on the pricing risk and on the possibilities offered
by risk management.'
However, further growth in the OTC market is unlikely to be uniform across
all commodity sectors.
'Five years ago the oil swaps sector was booming, but now it has fallen back
a lot,' said one commodity derivatives trader in New York. 'Over the past
two years, the natural gas market has taken over, going from five
transactions a day to 40 transactions a day now, mainly because of the
deregulation of the US natural gas market. So perhaps the next market to
boom will be the US electricity market since this is being deregulated at
the moment.'

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (14): Reaping rewards from
catastrophes - Insurance / Richard Lapper discusses an important new
development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There has seen some important progress in the establishment of a market for
insurance derivatives this year - even though sceptics, especially in the
conservative insurance industry, are numerous.
In October, for example, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBoT) approved the
wordings of four agricultural insurance contracts, which could begin trading
in the first half of 1995.
The same exchange has seen a steady growth in trade in its catastrophe
insurance contracts, albeit from an extremely modest base.
And in the over-the-counter market there has been an increasing amount of
trade in reinsurance policies which incorporate some of the features of an
exchange-traded catastrophe contract introduced in 1992.
Perhaps most important of all, sensing the commercial potential of a new
derivatives market, US investment banks are investing resources in the
business, with specialists changing jobs frequently.
The new agricultural contracts - Illinois soya beans, Iowa corn, Kansas
winter wheat and North Dakota spring wheat - were approved by the CBoT on
October 18 and must now be approved by the authorities in Washington.
The contracts - known as area yield options - provide a means for hedging
against shortfalls in the harvest of particular crops.
Traders select a strike yield for a crop. A holder of a call option might
select a strike of 100 bushels an acre. If the actual yield, as assessed by
the US Department of Agriculture after harvest, was greater than the strike,
the call holder would receive cash. Conversely, a put holder would receive
payment if the crop was smaller than the chosen strike.
Morton Lane, managing partner of Lane Financial, a company that advises
brokers, says: 'It's natural for the CBoT to do this. It means we are
committed to this area.'
Mr Lane, one of the architects of the new insurance-related market, is also
confident about the prospects for the catastrophe reinsurance contracts,
launched by the CBoT in December 1992, despite a slow start. Between May and
September this year some 6,000 national and eastern catastrophe contracts
were traded, 10 times more than in the same period last year.
'It is not enough to satisfy anybody but it underscores there is still
interest,' notes Mr Lane, who explains that most of the contracts are call
spreads, used to limit and isolate a particular layer of risk.
Futures contracts are priced according to moves in a loss ratio, based on
figures for claims and premiums compiled by the Insurance Services Office
(ISO). The settlement price of each increases by Dollars 250 for each one
percentage point upwards movement in the ratio. For example, while a loss
ratio of 20 per cent would give each contract a value of Dollars 5,000, a
loss ratio of 120 per cent would make the contract worth Dollars 30,000.
Typically, buyers pay for an option to buy a futures contract when the loss
ratio exceeds 50 per cent and sell when the ratio exceeds 70 per cent. The
arrangements in effect give protection in the same way as an excess of loss
reinsurance contract.
More importantly perhaps, the ISO loss index has been integrated into a more
traditional reinsurance contract, the loss warranty.
Observers believe that as much as 20 times more business has been traded in
these Chicago-influenced loss warranties in the over-the-counter market than
at the CBoT itself.
A number of reinsurers' underwriting loss warranty products have begun to
hedge their own exposures in Chicago, implying that the same interaction
between OTC and exchange-rated products which has helped fuel the growth of
other markets, could be beginning in this market, too.
Within the derivatives industry, few doubt that a derivatives market will
eventually be established, even though some believe the development could be
long term. Bankers Trust, Citibank, and Morgan Stanley are looking into the
potential.
Most appear to be interested in trading rather than underwriting risk, but
Mr Lane says a number of smaller US investors are considering investment
funds which would be dedicated to selling the reinsurance contracts.
In the insurance industry, too, from where, after all, most initial demand
will come, there have also been some developments. Zurich Insurance, through
its Bermuda-based subsidiary Centre Re, has been an active backer of these
alternative products.
Centre Re owns a chunk of Centre Financial Products, a New York boutique
investment firm. Richard Sandor, chairman of Centre Financial, is a founding
father of the financial derivatives industry and an enthusiastic fan of the
development. 'It is past its infancy and is starting to crawl.'
Insurance and reinsurance brokers, such as Sedgwick, Willis Corroon,
Alexander &amp; Alexander and CT Bowring. are also exploring the market. Andrew
Martin, managing director of Sedgwick Payne Insurance Strategy, concedes
that trading has been slack this autumn and is keen to see modifications to
some of the exchange traded contracts.
In particular, some buyers would prefer to see annual rather than
three-month contracts, to take into account the actual size of a loss which
may not be known for more than six months after the event.
Estimates of claims from the Northridge earthquake in California earlier
this year have continued to climb, nine months after the event itself. This
questions the usefulness of the current contracts, which cover loss events
during a three-month period and are closed after an additional three-month
reporting period.
In the meantime, along with others Sedgwick is working on the development of
a separate UK or broader European loss index, which would allow for the
development of a wider range of products. And Mr Martin remains convinced
that the mismatch between the insurance and reinsurance industry's capital
base and the scale of potential exposures faced by business should continue
to drive interest in derivatives, as a means of attracting new capital into
the business.
A sudden increase in the number of catastrophes could make that mismatch
appear even starker.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (12): Staggering growth of a product
here to stay - Equity derivatives: the futures market has increased in
importance since the crash of 1987
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent furore about the dangers and misuses of derivatives has left
equity futures and options untouched.
Equity derivatives were blamed by some for the stock market crash of 1987.
But the recent derivatives problems have been concentrated in the bond
market, where speculation on lower interest rates caused some corporations
and hedge funds to come unstuck.
In fact, the equity futures market has increased enormously in importance
since the crash. In London, for example, turnover in the FT-SE 100 Index
future has increased from 458,000 contracts in 1987 to 3.1m last year.
While the UK leads the rest of Europe in terms of futures use, it still lags
behind the US where equities futures turnover is 10 times the volume of the
cash market.
Often, the futures markets will be portrayed as leading the cash markets up
or down, although in practice this is probably an unreal distinction.
Nowadays, the two markets are inextricably entwined.
A purchase of the index future, for example, is likely at some stage in the
chain to result in purchases in the cash market to hedge the transaction.
Furthermore, arbitrage keeps the two markets from getting far out of line.
Many investment institutions, which 10 years ago might have looked askance
at the idea of using derivatives, have come to embrace the market. 'Most
equity investors are, by definition, involved in a certain amount of risk.
They realise that derivatives can be used to reduce that risk,' said Mark
Rushton, a director of the investor coverage group at Swiss Bank
Corporation.
If an investor wants to put Pounds 100m into the equity market in a quick
and efficient manner, then the Footsie future is probably the most suitable
vehicle. Options are widely used, but most institutions tend to buy, rather
than write (sell). Buying puts is a common means of insurance against a fall
in the market or in an individual share.
Some institutions do write calls, which gives them extra income but limits
the upside on the security. Writing puts, where the downside is
unquantifiable, is much more rare. But SBC's Mr Rushton said: 'Some
institutions write puts when they have a pot of cash which they are waiting
to invest when the market falls.'
Over-the-counter options are often used when institutions need to hedge in
advance of a particular date, such as a review of their portfolio, which
does not fit in with the fixed contract terms used on the exchanges.
Institutions may also use over-the-counter options to hedge against an
overseas risk, where their portfolio is not particularly correlated with an
index future, for example, if their US exposure mostly consists of small
stocks not within the S&amp;P 500.
The problem with OTC options is, of course, the lack of liquidity, which may
encourage all participants in the market to pay close attention to the
credit risk of their counterparties.
The use of derivatives has also gained a boost from the popularity of
'guaranteed' equity products. These products, sold to private investors,
combine an element of equity exposure with a guarantee that the original
capital will be returned, normally after five years. Institutions which
offer such products usually hedge their exposure via the derivatives market.
The past few months have seen a slowdown in the launch of such products,
perhaps because of the weakness of the UK stock market, or perhaps because
of the rise in bond yields and base rates which started to make other
products more competitive.
The long-term future of guaranteed products will probably depend on whether
the current set of products makes it through the five-year period
successfully. If the guarantees are called upon, they must be fulfilled. A
product failure would be devastating for private investor confidence.
Guaranteed products quietly disguise their link to the world of derivatives.
Funds which more openly embrace the derivatives markets have yet to win over
the private investor; Fidelity, for example, dropped its futures funds
earlier this year.
Private investors are slowly warming to the idea of entering the derivatives
market directly, through the use of options. One development which may
encourage such use is the introduction of rolling settlement, which will put
a stop to one of the favourite habits of risk-minded private investors -
dealing within the account. Options are a natural alternative for such
speculative trading.
Of course, such growth carries its dangers, as shown by the reports of
private investors' option losses following the crash of 1987. There will
undoubtedly be scandals to come, and calls for greater regulation. But the
staggering growth of equity derivatives means that few can doubt such
products are here to stay.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (11): Rights-thinking strategies - New
applications / Laurie Morse examines novel ideas for contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ronald Coase, the Nobel prize-winning economist, once explained that if it
were well understood that trading involved the exchange of rights to certain
things, rather than the exchange of the underlying things themselves, our
universe of tradeable commodities and securities would be far larger than it
is.
The people who structure derivatives strategies understand this uncoupling
very well. Every day they engineer contracts where the rights to certain
returns and their associated risks are disassembled and repackaged to suit
their customers' needs.
Once viewed as exotic, derivative instruments used to manage all sorts of
market risks - interest rate, currency, commodity, or equity - have achieved
widespread acceptance in the financial world. Their primary route of
expansion now is through application in new industries where the concept of
risk management remains a novel idea.
However, other uses for derivatives are evolving, and these new applications
take the craft far beyond managing just market risk. One of these, the
evolution of products used to manage credit risk, has had a troubled start,
though its supporters say it could become a Dollars 1,000bn industry.
Another class of new derivatives focuses on using market forces to allocate
scarce resources. These include secondary markets for trading pollution
allowances that have been issued as part of the US clean air act. Introduced
two years ago as a radical new way to ration pollution while allowing
polluters some flexibility when facing regulatory constraints, these
products also have not lived up to their early promise.
US futures exchanges in some cases are taking the lead in innovation, trying
to expand the risk management capacity of industries as diverse as
catastrophe insurance and electricity generation.
Merrill Lynch, Bankers Trust, and Credit Suisse First Boston took the lead
in the experiment with credit derivatives. In a logical extension of their
success with interest rate and currency swaps, these bankers and brokers saw
their customers had a secondary need: a means to manage the credit
uncertainties in their portfolio.
Managing credit risk has long been the purview of bankers, and the
bread-and-butter of credit rating agencies. Transferring, or trading, credit
risk has been nearly impossible without liquidating the cash instrument in
question.
However, derivative experts say it is possible to keep a high-yielding,
high-risk security in portfolio, and manage the credit risk while still
enjoying an above-market return. Brokers are now willing to write an option
on the difference, or 'spread' on the yield between the high-risk securities
and more secure investment like a Treasury security.
The options insulate the customer if the credit risk of his securities
increases, while the broker who wrote the specialised option neutralises his
exposure by performing an offsetting trade from a global selection of
corporate credit deals. These highly-structured instruments are efficient
only if the broker has access to a global corporate debt network.
To date, credit derivatives' volumes have disappointed their backers, who
say lack of liquidity and efficient pricing are limiting the market.
Making new commodities out of pollution credits, electricity, and even trash
have proved equally frustrating. The US Environmental Protection Agency, in
writing the Clean Air Act of 1990, surmised that reducing nationwide sulphur
dioxide emissions, a key ingredient in acid rain, might be made cheaper and
more efficient if polluters had a set of options to choose from.
The agency assigned each main sulphur dioxide polluter (mostly coal-burning
electricity plants) certificates representing allowable levels of emissions.
If the power generating company chooses to abate its sulphur dioxide output
by switching to cleaner fuels or installing a costly smokestack scrubber, it
is free to sell its excess allowances to another polluter.
Over time the allowances expire, with US sulphur dioxide emissions due to
fall to half of their present levels by 2,000.
Trading experts such as New York-based Cantor, Fitzgerald and the Chicago
Board of Trade tumbled over each other to capture this new market-in-the
making two years ago. However, time and experience have proven that
utilities, quasi-public entities which rarely have to deal with market
forces of any kind, do not make carefree traders.
Although the Chicago Board of Trade has conducted two annual pollution
allowance auctions, and Cantor and other dealers have brokered private
allowance trades, the majority of utilities have banked their allowances and
pursued more costly abatement solutions.
Mike Walsh, senior economist at the Chicago Board of Trade, notes that the
emission allowance program, to be a success, does not require active
trading. 'In fact, it's working very well - companies are switching fuel,
retiring dirty units, and many companies are trading allowances within their
own operations, transfers that don't show up publicly,' he says.
However, the limited trading has dashed hopes for a derivative market in
pollution credits. Mr. Walsh said the Chicago Board of Trade has shelved its
plans to trade pollution allowance futures until a viable primary market
develops.
In fact, the rapid deregulation of the electric power industry in the US may
rekindle interest in allowance trading. However, Mr Walsh and others believe
that electric utilities will first learn to use futures and options to price
and hedge their electricity output as their markets become freer. The New
York Mercantile Exchange, the world's leading energy futures market, has
plans to introduce electricity futures within the next year.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (13): Dark cloud or wake-up call? -
Effects of bad publicity / Patrick Harverson considers the implications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The news emanating from the derivatives market this year could hardly have
been much worse.
Reports of multi-million dollar losses (Procter &amp; Gamble), collapsed
investment funds (Askin Capital Management), companies pushed to
near-bankruptcy (Metallgesellschaft) and high-profile lawsuits (Procter &amp;
Gamble again) have left a nasty stain on the business.
As one corporate treasurer put it recently: 'Derivatives have become a
four-letter word.'
Certainly, the bad publicity surrounding the business has put many
derivatives practitioners - from the bankers that create and sell them, to
the corporate treasurers who use them - on the defensive. It has also
grabbed the attention of regulators and legislators, who have questioned
whether existing supervisory and reporting structures are up to the job of
handling the explosive growth in the over-the-counter derivatives market;
and it has eaten into the profits the big Wall Street banks and securities
houses earn from helping their clients to manage risk.
Yet, amid all the gloom, there are those in the industry who believe the
market has already begun to recover from its mid-summer trough, when
industry analysts said activity at the high end of the market - where the
more complex derivatives are sold - shrank by as much as a third. Bankers
Trust, the most active bank in the business, says that derivatives activity
actually picked up in the third quarter, and that its earnings from risk
management during the first nine months of the year were down only 7 per
cent, compared with the record year of 1993.
Also, a few industry participants believe that some good may eventually come
of all the bad news surrounding derivatives (although, not surprisingly, it
is the bankers who are the most upbeat about the current situation).
Mr Mark Brickell, head of derivatives strategies at JP Morgan, says: 'One
useful aspect of all the publicity in 1994 was that it stimulated firms to
take a second look at their portfolios, to reassure themselves that what
they had was what they wanted. . . That's good for the system.'
Another who sees a silver lining in the dark clouds hovering above
derivatives is Mr Fred Cohen, managing director at Price Waterhouse's
capital markets and treasury practice. He says: 'What we're observing now is
that for the end-user community (the big corporations, insurance companies,
pension funds, foundations and mutual funds), this is a wake-up call. It has
pointed out to them some of the risks inherent in these types of product,
and has given them cause to reassess the quality of their frameworks for
identifying, assessing and managing risk.'
Such is the desire to find grounds for optimism in the market, that some
professionals have actually welcomed Procter &amp; Gamble's lawsuit against
Bankers Trust over a soured interest-rate swap. Although the headlines
surrounding the case are only likely to add fuel to the anti-derivatives
fire currently raging through Congress (where a few lawmakers see
derivatives as the biggest threat to the US financial system since Mr
Michael Milken and his junk bonds), bankers hope that the case will answer
some important questions.
For example, how much responsibility for educating corporations about the
risks involved in using derivative products should lie with the dealer?
Also, how much knowledge and sophistication should the dealer assume on
behalf of the client?
If the courts rule that it was up to P&amp;G - a multinational company with a
long and successful record of operating in the financial markets  - to
ensure that it was fully aware of the risks involved in buying the disputed
contract from Bankers Trust, an important ground-rule may be established.
The upbeat mood among some derivatives professionals, however, cannot
disguise the fact that the market has been bruised by the setbacks of this
year.
Although the problems stemmed primarily from the sharp rise in US interest
rates and the subsequent slump in US and international bond markets - a
development which could hardly be blamed on the derivatives market itself -
such is the leveraged nature of some derivatives (particularly the more
exotic instruments) that the negative impact of rising interest rates has
been greatly exaggerated. The damage inflicted left some users and dealers
nursing huge losses on their investment portfolios, or from botched hedging
strategies.
Consequently, the more conservatively-minded corporate users have been
steering clear of the more complex derivatives in favour of simpler
contracts that are easier to value and which leave the user less vulnerable
to heavy collateral damage from declining markets. 'People are more
sensitive to what they're buying now,' said one derivatives consultant.
Other companies, however, say that they have not changed their policies
toward derivatives, primarily because they claim that they do not use the
complicated contracts that have been the root-cause of many of the problems.
McDonald's, with its huge exposures to currency risk, is one of the biggest
users of derivatives among multinational companies. The fast-food group says
it has continued to use derivatives as it always has - for basic financing
purposes. 'We have always been conservative about derivatives,' says Mr
Chuck Eberling, a spokesman for McDonald's.
One banker at a New York securities house makes a similar point, claiming
that the lawsuits and losses have not unsettled corporate treasurers,
because, in most large companies, the treasurers are well-versed in the
risks of using complex derivative instruments. 'They're not scared off by
headlines. They know from personal experience what's complicated and what
isn't, and which transactions make sense for them.' For every Procter &amp;
Gamble or Gibson's Greetings (another company suing Bankers Trust over
derivatives losses), there are scores of McDonald's, he says.
One clear consequence of the upheavals in the market this year, however, has
been a general reassessment by companies of management's responsibilities in
tracking the use of derivatives. According to Mr Cohen, of Price Waterhouse,
the most important lesson learned this year has been that senior management
and company directors need to be better informed of the risks involved in
derivatives. As Mr Cohen puts it: 'There's been a general acknowledgement
that corporate policies need to be better defined and documented, and that
there should be a clearer statement of the goals, objectives and risk
tolerances of an organisation by its senior management and board of
directors.'
This reassessment has been partly to blame for the slowdown in the pace of
derivatives activity, says Mr Cohen. 'Today, companies are using instruments
with multiple levels of risk, and there is a realisation that there's a need
to have appropriate models and systems to evaluate them.' In most cases,
companies are looking to outside advisers - investment banks or specialist
consultants - to provide the tools for making these evaluations.
One such tool is the 'RiskMetrics' risk management system developed by the
US bank JP Morgan, which is now available to derivatives users. Whether
access to JP Morgan's 'black box' will prevent future derivatives debacles
remains to be seen, but judging by the events of this year, some companies
need all the help they can get.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (8): Of naked dogs and bull spreads -
Emerging markets / A look at exotic ideas for trades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The naked dog basket is not the title of a film showing at your local art
house cinema, nor a contender for next year's Booker prize. It is, in fact,
an idea for a new financial product - one of the latest to emerge from the
'rocket science' laboratories of the world's leading investment banks.
And it provides a graphic illustration of the connections between
derivatives and the emerging markets of Asia, Latin America and Europe. The
basket of dogs is made up of a selection of Brady bonds, issued in exchange
for the rescheduled debts of developing countries.
The dogs are naked because the yield on the US long bond, which in its zero
coupon form serves as collateral for these issues, is stripped from the
return on the Bradies.
The coupon on the 'dogs' is therefore directly tied to the so-called
'stripped spread' - the difference between the US long bond rate and the
yield on the Bradies.
The instrument is one of the most exotic derivatives trades and there has
been limited activity to date.
Nevertheless the wider market in both traded options in distressed and
securitised emerging market debt is substantial. Even though activity has
tailed off to some extent since the upward move in US bond rates in
February, business has grown rapidly over the past two years.
Ms Alexandra McLeod, head of emerging markets at Bank of America, Illinois,
said in a recent paper that the 'astonishing' growth of the emerging debt
market has 'given birth to a new generation of derivatives'.
The notional value of emerging market options traded in 1992 was estimated
at Dollars 15.5bn and there has been significant growth since then, with
institutional fund managers, as well as hedge funds and specialist boutiques
all active in the market.
On offer are plain vanilla put and call options on Brady bonds issued by big
debtors such as Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Mexico and Poland, as well as
the distressed debt of Nigeria and Russia. Increasingly, too, structures
such as straddles, strangles, bull spreads, and butterflies, are also
available.
Overall options trading has now outpaced the growth of the cash market.
'With new participants and broking houses entering the market and increasing
its liquidity, volumes seem to be on an upward spiral,' added Ms McLeod.
Derivatives on emerging market debt were first sold in 1990, when banks
sought to enhance the yield on the debt they were holding by selling covered
calls. 'If a bank had 60 per cent provisions on its Brazilian loans and the
market was at 36, it would be happy to sell a call on its debt at 40, in
order to realise a fee,' Ms McLeod explained.
Since 1993, a liquid market has developed on all principal assets, with high
levels of options activity this year in Venezuelan and Russian debt paper,
reflecting high volatility and political risk in both countries.
One reflection of rising interest was the issue earlier this year by the
Emerging Markets Traders Association of their own master agreement for
over-the-counter options, designed to simplify hedging in emerging markets.
The agreement published in April, was accompanied by six recommended market
practices for options transactions on emerging markets.
Whereas the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master
agreement provides for structures such as collars, straddles and strangles
to be built into OTC agreements, the emerging market documentation is
simpler, and more geared to plain vanilla put and call options.
Equity derivatives have been well known in the Asian markets over the past
decade, according to traders, with the range extending more recently to
Latin American markets. For example, earlier this year the Chicago Board
Options Exchange launched an option on a Mexican stock exchange index, based
on 10 US listed Mexican ADRs and ADSs.
Component stocks represent a range of economic sectors. One of the stocks,
Telefonos de Mexico, is the most widely traded equity option in the US.
On a smaller scale, this year has also seen developments in eastern Europe.
In January, the Austrian stock exchange issued warrants, denominated and
settled in Austrian schillings, were issued, based on baskets of blue chip
Czech and Hungarian equities.
And last month, Citibank announced the launch of a warrant on a basket of 10
Turkish equities, the first ever derivative product on a diversified Turkish
equity portfolio offered to both local and international investors.
Many of the products offer investors the chance to leverage up already
attractive sounding returns in exchange for greater exposure to the risks.
But derivative instruments can also offer investors a safer and more viable
means of entry into the markets. Willy Hemetsberger, vice-president equity
derivatives, emerging markets, at Citibank in London, insists that they can
eliminate problems linked to custody, documentation and settlement.
The primitive character of custody arrangements in Russia, for example,
means that investors may need to travel to a company's headquarters in a
remote Siberian town, for example.
Buying into Russia by means of a derivative whose value reflects that of the
underlying share is a more practicable option. And in highly volatile
markets, derivatives, especially those based on indices or baskets, can help
to diversify risks.
By reflecting the value of indices derivatives can also help investors gain
access to markets that can sometimes be highly illiquid. 'The trick is to
develop products that allow investors to participate. You can guarantee the
downside,' explains Mr Hemetsberger.
And there are increasing signs, too, that within the emerging markets
themselves local companies are becoming active users of derivatives, a fact
reflected in the emergence of a number of powerful local exchanges.
Last year, Brazil's Bolsa Mercadorias e Futuros was the world's fifth most
active exchange, with its interest rate, stock index and gold futures
sitting comfortably among the world's top 30 contracts.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (10): What do they mean by that?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Asset allocation: dividing instrument funds among markets to achieve
diversification or maximum return.
As-you-like option (or chooser option or the call-or-put option) enables the
holder to convert from one style of option to a different style of option
over a preset period of time.
Average rate option (or Asian option): an option in which the settlement is
based on the difference between the given strike and the average prices of
the underlying stock or index on selected dates.
Barrier options: a family of path-dependent options whose pay-off pattern
and survival to the expiration date depend not only on the final price of
the underlying security but also on whether or not the underlying security
sells at or goes through a pre-determined barrier at any time during the
life of the option. Barrier options include:
Down-and-out call/put: an option which expires worthless if the market price
of the underlying security drops below a pre-determined price.
Down-and-in call/put: an option which becomes effective if the market price
of the underlying security drops below a pre-determined price.
Up-and-out call/put: an option that expires worthless if the market price of
the underlying security rises above a pre-determined price.
Up-and-in call/put: an option that becomes effective if the market price of
the underlying security rises above a pre-determined price.
Best-of-two option (or either-or option or alternative option: provides the
option holder with a payoff based on the independent performances of two
separate and distinct securities or indices.
Box options: instead of placing cash in a money market instrument and
generating interest income, equity options are purchased the payoffs of
which create capital gains that can be offset against current capital
losses.
Call option: the right to buy a given stock, commodity, index, or futures
contract at a fixed price on or before a specified date.
Cap: contract between a borrower and a lender where the borrower is assured
that he will not have to pay more than some maximum interest rate on
borrowed funds.
Collar: a floating rate debt contract that establishes both a maximum and a
minimum interest rate to be paid by the borrower.
Commodity swap: a swap in which counterparties exchange cash flows based on
a commodity price on at least one side of the transaction.
Compound option: an option on an option. The holder has the right to
purchase another option on a pre-set date, at a pre-set premium.
Contango: a condition in a futures market where the more distant delivery
months trade at a premium to the near term delivery months.
Covered call: one of the most popular option strategies, using an existing
equity position. Calls are sold on the underlying security with strikes
which are higher than the market price. The strike price chosen limits the
profit a security holder can realise from the position and this strategy is
best used when the holder is fairly certain that there will be little
movement in the security's share price.
Currency swap: an exchange of equal initial principal amounts of two
currencies at the spot exchange rate. Over the term of the agreement, the
counterparties exchange fixed or floating rate interest payments in their
swapped currencies. At maturity, the principal amount is reswapped at a
predetermined exchange rate so that the parties end up with their original
currencies.
Derivative: a contract the value of which changes in concert with the price
movements in a related or underlying commodity or financial instrument. The
term covers standardised, exchange-traded futures and options, as well as
over-the-counter swaps, options, and other customised instruments.
Equity swap: a contract between two counterparties to exchange two different
cash flows over time. During the life of the swap one party agrees to pay
the rate of return on an equity or the equity index while the other party
agrees to pay a floating or fixed rate of interest.
Floor: an aspect of a floating rate debt contract that specifies a minimum
interest rate for a borrower.
Forward: an over-the-counter agreement for a buyer and seller to exchange a
particular good for a particular price at a specified future date.
Futures contract: an agreement between a buyer and a seller to exchange a
particular good for a particular price at a future date as specified in a
contract common to all participants in a market on an organised futures
exchange. Collateral must be posted for performance bonds, and positions are
marked to market at least once a day.
Hedge: a transaction that reduces risk of an underlying security or
commodity position by making the appropriate offsetting derivative
transaction. Hybrid security: a complex security consisting of virtually any
combination of two or more risk management building blocks - bond or note,
forward, future, or option.
Interest-rate swap: the exchange between counterparties of fixed-rate and
floating-rate debt in a single currency.
Lookback option: an option the payout of which is calculated using the
highest intrinsic value of the underlying security or index over the life of
an option. In the case of a lookback call, the highest market price is used
whereas for a lookback put, the lowest market price is used.
Put option: the right to sell a particular stock, bond, commodity or index
at a specified future date at a specified price.
Quanto option (or guaranteed exchange rate option): an option in which
foreign exchange risks in an underlying security have been eliminated.
Risk reversal: this strategy combines the purchase of a put option with the
sale of a call option. The put option preserves the capital value of the
shareholding while the sale of a call option reduces or eliminates the cost
of this insurance, at the expense of giving up some of the upside potential
of the stock.
Swap: a contract to exchange a stream of periodic payments with a
counterparty. Swaption: an option to enter into a swap contract.
Warrant: an option to purchase or sell an underlying instrument at a given
price and time or series of prices and times. It is ordinarily issued for
longer than a year.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Denmark (9): Containers cover the globe - Maersk
Line / Hilary Barnes profiles two of the country's best-known companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The AP Moller group's Maersk Line may or may not be the world's largest
cargo liner shipping service - it depends on the definition. But Mr Vagn
Lehd Moller, vice-president in charge of liner services, accepts the
description 'the most comprehensive' global liner service.
Maersk Line owns 47 vessels and operates a total fleet of 93 vessels. They
operate global east-west services and are active on all three major world
trading routes, the North Atlantic, Europe-Far East and the US-Far East.
The fleet operated by Maersk Line has a carrying capacity of 124,643
containers (at October 1, this year) - more than any other shipping company
except Taiwan's Evergreen. Fourteen of the ships can each carry more than
4,000 containers.
The east-west services are linked at a number of hub ports with north-south
services and 'feeder' services, which leave few geographical areas not
directly serviced by Maersk Line.
AP Moller, by far is Denmark's biggest industrial group, was founded in 1904
by the late Mr AP Moller, whose son, Mr Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller, remains
chairman of the group's twin holding companies, the listed D/S Svendborg and
D/S 1912.
Apart from passenger transport, the group has interests in all forms of
shipping - and also in offshore drilling. It produces oil and gas from the
Danish sector of the North Sea, and operates its own shipyard (the Odense
Steel Shipyard) and its own airline (Maersk Air), as well as manufacturing
and retailing businesses.
The group's structure means that consolidated figures for all its various
operations are not available, but turnover in the oil and shipping
operations under the twin parent companies came to DKr27.6bn in 1993, and
there was a net profit of DKr2.91bn - a good start for Mr Jess Soderberg,
who succeeded Mr Moller as chief executive officer, in charge of day to day
operations, in mid-1992, when Mr Moller turned 80.
In the highly competitive and secretive world of shipping, no one knows
exactly how much the other large operators make, or how. To the irritation
of Denmark's corporate analysts and business journalists, AP Moller keeps
its financial cards close to its chest. No financial information covering
Maersk Line slips out. But the AP Moller shipping operations as a group
consistently report profits.
Maersk Line, founded in 1928, has expanded rapidly since it went into
container transport in the early 1970s.
'The new-building programme for 1995, 1996 and 1997 is in place,' said Mr
Lehd Moller, which indicates that the liner business is still doing well
enough to invest in supplementing its fleet. The fleet is young, with an
average age of about seven years. 'We need high-speed, high-quality ships,'
he said.
Mr Lehd Moller does not see expansion taking place through cut-throat
competition for market-share in a stagnant market. 'As we see it, the global
market for containers will grow in coming years,' he said. 'We believe we
will see growth of at least 6 per cent a year for as far as we can see. More
and more cargo will go into containers. More and more markets will mature.'
He believed that containerisation would spread to relatively under-developed
markets, including east Europe and Russia.
Containers are also becoming more flexible and sophisticated. 'They can
cater for just about anything,' he said. An example was the growth of
refrigerated cargo ('reefer') containers. Maersk Container Industri A/S, the
group's container manufacturing company in Denmark, is planning to deliver
reefer containers, and Maersk Line recently took delivery of 500 20ft and
2,500 40ft reefer containers from Korea's Hyundai.
Maersk Line is the world leader in reefer containers, a fact which probably
means it is a larger carrier of refrigerated cargoes than any of the fleets
of bulk-carrying reefer ships operated by competitors. Reefer containers,
says Mr Lehd Moller, have at least the same reliability and are just as
sophisticated as reefer vessels.
Another business area which is being developed by Maersk Line is known as
'logistics' - in which the ocean shipping company undertakes to provide a
complete transport service from producer (for example, a shoe manufacturer
in China) to the final customer (a shoe retailers in Europe).
'This is building up very nicely,' said Mr Lehd Moller. But it is a very
complicated business. Contracts for Maersk's most complete Three Star
logistics solution, which may involve transporting 20,000 containers a year
for one customer, are numbered in single figures; but it has a much larger
number of somewhat less sophisticated Two Star contracts. This is
value-added business - 'very much so', said Mr Lehd Moller - and requires
considerable investment in the development of systems. 'You don't get paid
immediately,' he explained, and then outlined the complexity of the
operation.
To start with, the shoes must be of the right size, colour and quality. They
must be packed properly. Documentation is carried out, and then customs
clearance. Information systems are required, so that the customer knows
where the goods are and when they will be arriving; and the goods first have
to be transported to a port, then delivered to the stores by Maersk Line's
dedicated train and truck services (which are not owned by Maersk, but are
on contract or charter to it).
Maersk Line is widely acknowledged in the industry as an efficient operator
with high standards of service. An executive at Carlsberg, the Danish
brewery group, recalled attending a reception given by a third company in
Hong Kong. A Maersk Line vessel came into view approaching port. 'Ah,' said
an AP Moller executive, 'it will dock in 11 minutes time, and in exactly 29
minutes the captain will appear here.'
The predictions proved correct - a neat illustration of the group's motto, a
phrase coined by Mr AP Moller: 'Timely attention.'

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Denmark (10): A sound recovery - Bang &amp; Olufsen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bang &amp; Olufsen can be likened to a French chef, says Mr Anders Knutsen, the
group's chief executive: he buys the best-available raw materials in the
market, and his reputation is based on the way he mixes them to produce
exquisite dishes.
The Danish producer of up-market audio and video products does something
similar. It buys much of what goes into its products from outside, but it
puts them together in such a way - with a substantial input of its own
technical flair and software - that the product is exceptional.
If this were a process anyone could do successfully, B&amp;O would not be the
only surviving independent manufacturer in Europe that produces a full range
of both audio and video products. Indeed, a couple of years ago, after the
group had suffered three successive years in the red, B&amp;O's own survival
hung in the balance.
It has staged a remarkable recovery under of Mr Knutsen, who was made chief
executive in the autumn of 1992 after a 20 years with the company. In the
year ending last May 31, the group made a profit of DKr125m, against a loss
in the previous year of DKr42m, and sales were up to DKr2.40bn from
DKr2.12bn.
The first half of the current year is expected to produce an equally good
performance. The financial market's confidence in the group has returned.
The share price, which plunged to around DKr200 in 1992-93, is now at
DKr1,200.
At the groups' headquarters in Struer, a small town in north-west Jutland,
Mr Knutsen attributed its long-term success to 'a unique combination of
technological excellence and emotional appeal' - the emotional, or
aesthetic, appeal arising from the superb design which, more than anything,
has generated a brand-name awareness of B&amp;O products.
To rebut the suggestion that B&amp;O merely presents conventional technical
solutions in brilliant packaging, Mr Knutsen darted from the room to return
a moment later with the insides of two television sets, a standard product
from Philips and a B&amp;O set - a graphic way of illustrating the difference in
complexity and performance between the two sets.
This autumn the company turns another corner with the launch of an ingenious
all-in-one television and video set, known as the Avanta, the first such
product set to reach the market. In typical B&amp;O design, it will grace the
most elegant of drawing rooms, though at a price which less choosy consumers
may find steep.
The recovery in the company's fortunes is the result of a combination of
factors; but one explanation which Mr Knutsen does not accept is that it is
riding high in a cyclical recovery in the market. The Danish market
recovered in 1993, but the other European markets did not. Yet, in Germany,
where the market is still depressed, says Mr Knutsen, the company has this
year boosted sales by 28 per cent.
Clearly, a lot of things have been put right to achieve this kind of growth
in a stagnant market. The starting point was a 'break point' programme
launched in the autumn of 1992. Group employment was reduced by 700 to
2,300. Production was rationalised by centralising the electronics
production and the mechanical engineering operations respectively in one
plant.
The sales and marketing structure was changed, cutting costs substantially.
Direct ordering and direct distribution has been introduced. A retailer in,
say, Madrid places an order, using his personal computer, with B&amp;O in
Denmark. B&amp;O distributes directly from its store. If the model ordered is
not in store, the Danish company undertakes to deliver in five days - two
for manufacturing and three for transport.
Flexible production and low inventories are keywords. The production range
has been broadened, introducing TV sets at the relatively low price of about
DKr10,000, extending through a complete range to surround-sound audio
systems which lighten the pocket by around DKr100,000.
Productivity in the manufacturing divisions of the company improved by 15
per cent in 1993-94 from the previous year, and the aim is a further 10 per
cent improvement this year and next. This is the result partly of a
programme to improve logistics and the production structure, which began six
years ago, but it is also a result of a programme to involve the workforce
to an ever-increasing degree in bringing about production improvements.
Two layers in the management structure were eliminated by Mr Knutsen, so
there are now four, from shop-floor to board of management. Foremen (or
supervisors) and shop-floor workers have been given greater
responsibilities, which has required an intensive process of education and
training. It also involves Mr Knutsen - or Anders, as everyone in Struer
calls him - in a heavy programme. He meets every employee at least once a
year in groups of 50 at a time, which means about 50 meetings annually.
He makes sure that everyone understands the strategic vision and the
management's goals, and he receives direct feedback in the form of questions
and comments. 'It is a hard programme, but it is a good investment,' he
said.
It quickly becomes apparent to a visitor to Struer that the change of top
management has been very important. Mr Knutsen says it himself, explaining
the significance of having a board of management which is in full agreement
about where it wants to take the group and how to get there.
But it is the unsolicited comments from everyone else one meets that are
most telling, from the secretaries and the shop floor upwards. 'The present
directors know what they are doing, and when they take a decision they stick
to it,' observed one secretary.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Denmark (8): In place of redundancy -
Leave-from-work schemes are saving jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It sounds like a trade unionist's dream: to prevent dozens of redundancies
by putting workers on a rota of state-subsidised extra holiday. But for
Copenhagen bus drivers the dream became reality this year, thanks to the
government's leave-from-work schemes designed to cut unemployment and
promote job-sharing.
When the local bus drivers' union faced a cut of several hundred drivers
from the 2,500-strong municipal force, because of privatisation, it adopted
a system already worked out by a fellow union in the rubbish-collection
sector.
Exploiting a programme allowing workers to take up to a year in sabbatical
leave - backed by generous state benefits while absent - the bus drivers'
union worked out a scheme by which its members could take off one week in
every nine on a rotation basis, thus cutting down the numbers of workers who
had to be dismissed.
As a result, some 75 jobs were saved. And each driver participating in the
scheme has won six weeks of extra holiday a year, on top of their normal
paid holiday allowances. While on the extra time-off, each driver gets 80
per cent of the maximum Danish unemployment benefit allowance - which works
out at about DKr2,000 a week before tax.
'I think this is a very good model for helping to break the unemployment
curve by slowly reducing working time,' says Mr Bjarne Hansen, of the
Copenhagen bus drivers' union. He adds: 'Bus drivers are going to Poland, to
Paris and to London on their week off. It is very nice, people really like
it.'
There are, however, mounting voices among employers and right-of-centre
opposition parties, arguing that the leave-from-work schemes are an
expensive and ineffective way of combatting unemployment. They warn that the
programmes, which have proved more popular than anticipated since they were
introduced two years ago, threaten to cause disruptive shortages of skilled
workers in certain areas of the economy.
The sabbatical leave programme exploited by the bus drivers is, in fact, the
least popular of the three leave schemes. Most periods of leave are being
taken under the parental leave and training leave programmes.
Parents of children up to the age of eight years may each take up to a year
off work for each child, separately or together, while receiving 80 per cent
of the maximum unemployment benefit. Under the training scheme, an employee
can take up to one year to undergo work-related education at 100 per cent of
the maximum unemployment benefit. Under an easing of the rules recently,
employers were relieved of the obligation to take on replacement workers.
The government estimated that 20,000 people would take advantage of the
three schemes this year. But demand has soared to the point where 76,000 are
now on leave, and almost as many again are expected to have applications
approved in the course of the year. Of those currently on leave, 45,000 are
on parental leave and 25,000 are on training leave. The vast majority (90
per cent in the case of parental leave) are women. Most are in the public
sector.
Oddly, almost half the leave-takers are unemployed. They are entitled to
take advantage of the schemes, an attractive option because, in effect,
taking leave extends the period during which a jobless person is eligible
for full unemployment benefits. Most controversial has been the rush by
nurses to take advantage of parental leave. Up to 3,000 of the country's
45,000 nurses are on leave, forcing the health service to look abroad -
mainly to Sweden and the Netherlands - to make up the shortages.
Mr Poul Erik Petersen, head of the Danish Employers Association, says the
case of the nurses illustrates the danger of the leave-from-work scheme. He
says it can lead to serious bottlenecks in the labour market, which could
begin to feed inflation into the economy rather than tackle unemployment
which, though statistically, reduced by the schemes is in real terms little
changed. He says skill shortages are also showing up in the furniture and
construction industries.
'The nurses' union is now seeking a 15 per cent wage increase - they realise
how the market economy works,' he says. 'There is a danger that this can
spread to the whole economy.'
The government rejects these fears as being overstated. It is reviewing the
schemes with a view at least to reducing the level of benefits available to
the users of parental and sabbatical leave. But its commitment to leave for
training is solid, as this is a fundamental to its strategy of tackling
unemployment by increasing skill levels in the economy.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (6): Building blocks for traders -
Profile of Infinity Financial Technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks and other traders are all facing the same problem of pulling data
together from all over the world for analysis.
Even a huge central database is unlikely to manage the speeds and volumes of
data required to manage risk effectively. Many of the new wave of products
are based on flexible 'client/server' architecture, which links workstations
to a shared processor. These are unlikely to replace core systems, running
millions of loans, but new risk management systems must be able to interface
with existing systems, and pass values back and forth.
'There's a general trend towards bringing all these systems under one roof,
with commensurate financial activities,' observes Roger Lang, president and
chief executive of Infinity Financial Technology of Mountain View,
California. 'There are two compelling reasons for such a move: to make more
money, and to cut operational costs.'
Infinity's Montage line of products includes development tools and front-end
applications tailored specifically for derivatives trading options. Based on
Unix open systems architecture, they can contribute to the management of
swaps, caps/floors, swaptions, forward rate agreements (FRAs), bonds, money
markets, futures, futures options and foreign exchange. Clients include
Chemical Bank, Chase Manhattan Bank, Sanwa Bank, ABN Amro Bank, Baring
Brothers, and Price Waterhouse. The company claims to be the leading
provider of open systems to the global financial services market.
Unlike C ATS, Infinity sticks to industry-wide tools such as the Oracle and
Sybase databases. Chase Manhattan is building its entire back-office and
transactions processing for derivatives - specifically exotics - using the
Infinity toolset. Analysts believe the attraction is the ability Infinity
clients have of building their own exotics, and being able to process them
downstream.
While Mr Lang dismisses the PC as a potential liability, client-server
architecture, with its emphasis on interconnected personal workstations is
more promising. 'The PC was not the enabling technology that allowed traders
to explore: it was the spreadsheet. But this is a dangerously self-contained
tool, a two-edged sword because it gave rise to innovation, but left pools
of unintegrated data, at the same time 'juxtaposed' to mainframe systems.
Now we have fully networkable workstation environments, whereas before there
was the central monolithic mainframe: two completely different
architectures, achieving the same thing but with a canyon between them. What
client-server and open architecture has allowed is to give power to the
personal workspace so that it can finally rival the power of the mainframe.'
Infinity's approach is to offer a toolset alongside its applications, which
leaves the door open for users to write their own systems, or to create
'building blocks'. Many banks license tools and applications. 'We embrace
the toolkit approach because of the speed of development' says Mr Lang. 'It
means that your expensive technology talent doesn't waste time maintaining
systems written from scratch. In-house talent can concentrate on the
high-priced high-value extras and additions.'
The toolkit also enables programmers to integrate previously disparate
systems. 'In the past ' explains Mr Lang, 'a portfolio might be managed by
different systems, and the only way of bringing together a pool of
transactions would be to build separate reporting facilities. The trend is
now to pool the data under one roof and drive the reporting from a
consolidated set of data.
'Once there is access to consolidated data, a marketer can use the customer
information database, with knowledge of the market movement. A trader can go
to the market looking for specific trades, and hedge that position. A risk
manager can engage in a myriad of analytical and modelling exercises to get
a more intuitive profile of the company's risk, and an operations
professional can streamline all the different clerical processes and
transactions.'

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (7): Traders put up the barriers -
Currency risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM COOPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As many multinationals have discovered to their cost, fluctuating exchange
rates can have a dramatic impact on their fortunes. Japanese carmaker Mazda,
for example, revealed a loss of Y65bn on its foreign exchange transactions
in its 1993/94 accounts. Italian fashion house Benetton, however, achieved a
one-off gain of L50bn from some well-timed currency hedges when the lira
strengthened against the D-Mark by almost 10 per cent in three months last
year.
It is not surprising, therefore, that currency risk is regarded by most
corporate treasurers as a more pressing concern than interest rate risk or
commodity price risks.
An increasingly popular tool for managing foreign exchange risk is the
barrier option which some derivatives dealers say now represents some 10 per
cent of all currency option business. This growing interest in barriers
contrasts with falling demand for aggressively leveraged products. The
derivatives market has grown up this year and the emphasis now is on
'putting your risk where you want it', says Fred Stambaugh, global head of
currency options marketing with Chase Manhattan Bank.
Like the vast majority of currency options, barrier options are
over-the-counter instruments, tailor-made by banks to suit customers'
precise needs or market views. There are four basic types - calls and puts,
each with either a knock-out or knock-in feature.
A knock-in barrier option pays nothing at expiry unless it is first brought
to life as a result of the underlying exchange rate reaching a certain
pre-determined level (the barrier). A knock-out option, on the other hand,
begins life as a standard option but is killed off if the underlying
exchange rate touches the barrier. Because of their uncertain life, they are
generally much cheaper than conventional options. They have particular
appeal to chart enthusiasts who wish to express ideas about support and
resistance levels in their choice of hedging strategy.
Consider, for example, a US company which imports German goods and expects a
bill for DM20 in three months' time. If the importer is happy to pay the
bill at the present exchange rate of DM1.515/Dollars , he would simply buy a
three-month DM call/dollar put with this exercise price. This would allow
him to buy the necessary D-Marks at this exchange rate in three months'
time. Such an option might cost 2.5 per cent of the underlying amount
(DM500,000). It would protect the importer against the dollar weakening
against the D-Mark but, if the dollar strengthened significantly against the
German currency in the next three months, the option could be allowed to
expire unexercised and the DM20m could be bought in the spot market at a
more attractive rate.
A knock-out DM call/dollar put would give the same downside protection but
only until the exchange rate reaches a level at which the importer feels
this insurance is no longer needed. For example, a knock-out option with the
same strike price and a barrier set at D1.60/Dollars might cost only half as
much as the standard option. If, at any time within the three months, the
spot exchange rate touches DM1.60, the option ceases to exist. The importer
could then buy the necessary D-Marks in the spot market at this price and
put it on deposit until needed. The user must be able to react quickly in
the event of the option being knocked out, as the favourable rate may not
last for long.
Despite the undoubted attractions of barrier options, in terms of cost and
flexibility, some company treasurers are wary. 'We can't price these options
ourselves, so I am loathe to recommend them,' says the treasurer at a top UK
company, who declined to be identified. The extra difficulty in explaining
such products to the board is another reason cited by non-users.
Conventional option pricing models are inadequate for the valuation of
barrier options and, although leading banks claim to be able to price and
hedge most of these structures, they admit it is not always easy. The
difficulties are most pronounced when the underlying exchange rate is close
to the barrier level as the option approaches maturity. 'Hedging some of
these options close to expiry is a real nightmare,' says Chase's Stambaugh.
To hedge options which they have sold, banks traditionally take an
offsetting position in the underlying asset, but the size of this position
has to be continually adjusted as the spot price of the asset changes. Close
to the barrier the option value is extremely sensitive to changes in the
spot value of the exchange rate, so big sales or purchases in the underlying
currencies may be needed to keep the position hedged.
As a result, barrier options are generally offered only on the most heavily
traded exchange rates such as dollar/D-Mark and dollar/yen. 'We are not too
keen on doing barrier options where there isn't a continuous spot market,'
says Paul Jackson, head of foreign exchange options at Midland Global
Markets in London.
Hedging of barrier options is one of the hot topics in derivatives research
at present, and a favoured solution by many is to use conventional options
alongside a long position in the underlying asset to offset a short position
in barrier options. This achieves a 'static' hedge which does not need
continually adjusting and thus greatly reduces transaction costs.
As these cheaper hedging techniques become more widely used, barrier options
are starting to be applied to less actively traded currencies.
Another growth area for these structures is in investment products to
enhance yield or to allow investors to express a view on two or more assets
with a single instrument.
Bankers Trust, for example, has been marketing a call option on a basket of
Belgian shares which knocks out if the Belgian franc appreciates by more
than 3.5 per cent against the D-Mark. This is an example of an outside
barrier, in which the barrier asset is different from the asset on which the
basic option is written.
Another popular application in this year's low interest rate environment,
says Midland's Mr Jackson, has been to use two knock-out options to create
structured notes which pay highs returns provided an underlying asset
remains within a certain range. Institutions have been particularly active
in selling such notes. A typical example is a one-year dollar-denominated
bond which yields some 200 basis points more than conventional one-year
paper provided the dollar/D-Mark exchange rate remains within the ranges
DM1.48-DM1.68. Many variations have been sold, with a narrower currency
range allowing greater yield enhancement.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (5): Systems get a new look -
Technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING

<TEXT>
Shut an ex-derivatives trader into a room with two electronics designers and
a financial products engineer. Wait for 11 months. What emerges is a
blueprint for the future of derivatives trading systems, according to the
manufacturer's claims for one new product.
Fun is not the word most people associate with trading systems. But the new
system for modelling financial instruments, FiCAD, promises to be fun to
use, and illuminating about the various risks and relationships in, for
example, trading exotics.
FiCAD is modelled on graphics - computer-aided design (Cad), to be more
precise. Cad is used by architects and designers for creating
three-dimensional models of everything from buildings to computer chips.
Because of its graphical nature, and the ability to deal with 'related'
values, derived from elsewhere, it is the ideal tool for dealing with
exotics, and other complex products that require imaginative handling.
The person proposing this scheme is Rod Beckstrom, a former derivatives
trader at Morgan Stanley International. Despite his MBA from Stanford, it is
likely that no-one would take him seriously if he were not also the founder
and chief executive of the company that claims the lead in software systems
for derivative trading, C ATS - Computer Aided Trading Systems of Palo Alto.
Four years ago the C ATS brainstorming team came up with the idea of
'sketching' the complex relationships that underpin derivatives. They worked
on development for a year - but chose inappropriate technology as the
vehicle, threw it all away, and began again. 'We started coding before we
got the design right,' admits Mr Beckstrom.
Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple Computer and, more recently, of Next
Computer, became associated with the project, and development went ahead
using Next's computer environment and software development tools.
No-one was laughing by the time the FiCAD - Financial Computer Aided Design
 -system was launched in March this year. The idea of dealing with
derivative products through a computerised drawing pad sounds less crazy
when it becomes clear that banks and other users are not being asked to
abandon their existing investments. FiCAD effectively 'bolts on' to
previous, more rigid systems that use older technology and mind sets.
Mr Beckstrom has a track record of backing outsiders that win. In the past
he has made technical decisions that seemed risky, only to watch the rest of
the field follow the trend. When he first envisaged the design of the
original C ATS package in 1986, the underlying principle of cashflow
analysis seemed unconventional in software design, and the hardware choice
of Unix open systems almost outrageous.
Unix, subsequently adopted by many hardware suppliers as a standard
operating environment for shared multi-user systems, was then still emerging
as a standard. It gives end-users a choice of hardware suppliers and the
ability to transfer or upgrade hardware without changing software: hence
'openness'. Users can share data and applications on a Unix network, while
still retaining immense local power through a desktop work station. Unix
operating functions and many Unix applications are written in the powerful
language called C.
C ATS built the first cash-flow-based system in 1986, adopting the best
practice at the time, by representing any part of the value of a payment as
cash flow. 'In 1986 we used the C programming language, and Unix operating
systems on Sun Microsystems work stations,' says Mr Beckstrom. 'It was
heretical at the time, but everyone else followed the architecture. We feel
we have broader cash-flow functionality than anyone, but we've also taken it
to the extreme and tested its limitations.
'The breaking down of instruments into cash flows over time was a useful way
of describing all sorts of contracts, but they didn't describe complex
options and the plethora of new products financial engineers have been
creating - the exotics,' he adds. 'So we had to answer the question: 'if the
lowest level elements of instruments are not cash flows, then what are
they?''
Mr Beckstrom believes they would never have found the answer without 'fresh
blood in the room to penetrate the financial jargon',and it was provided by
James Kleckner, technical director of C ATS, whose experience in simulation
techniques and Cad system Systems) is evident in the techniques used by
FiCAD.
The product uses techniques the IT world has been parading as state of the
art for some time, such as object-oriented programming, and parallel
processing. Parallel processing shares tasks across several computers to
provide higher speed.
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a quick but very flexible way of
developing software programs. The technique produces complex applications
that are nevertheless 'intuitive', very easy for end-users to navigate, and
just as important in the changing world of finance, easy to maintain and
update.
Such OOP programs gather disparate information into consolidated 'objects',
depicted on the computer screen in a graphical 'icon' which can be opened up
(via lists or menus) into its various components and relationships with a
point-and-click mouse. The company is signing up third-party developers who
plan to build FiCAD product offerings.
'We've taken the most dynamic object-technology in the world and applied it
to the most dynamic industry,' says Mr Beckstrom. 'It's totally visual
computing. We're convinced that NeXT is the reference architecture for the
future. You can model any instrument, process it in real time. Our users are
speed freaks, because there's such a value to getting the answer faster than
your competitor. The others are all hoping we're mad but we've been proved
right in the past. It's a risk, but a calculated risk.'
Mr Beckstrom's stance is that banks are throwing away money on developing
old technology, and are in danger of continuing to do so. 'We're not going
to replace those back-office monoliths managing the loan portfolio
overnight. But banks are simply going to be throwing away millions of pounds
on developments that simply will not have the flexibility to accommodate
changes and developments in the market.'
Sun Microsystems (which accounts for 70 per cent of the installed
workstation base in the financial market) has made a commitment to OpenStep
from NeXT and Microsoft is rumoured to be interested. C ATS claims
applications developed in FiCAD will run on Sun Unix today and on Microsoft
Windows 95 when available.
Most people in the industry agree with Mr Beckstrom's assertion that the
primary challenge to systems is that of data integration, even if they would
disagree with much else.
Steve Husk, of ACT Business Systems, a supplier to the derivatives'
industry, notes that there is a need to draw systems together and
consolidate. Organisations seem compelled to spend whatever it costs to
achieve this, and speed - of systems development and of information delivery
 -is vital to a company's competitive status.
The problem driving users towards simple 'graphical user interfaces' (GUIs)
is that dealers have to negotiate complex systems. 'What really matters is
the skill of the dealer,' says Mr Husk. ' Taking a position means taking a
risk, and a good computer system means you can identify the risks. This
makes it doubly important that a system is simple to use, however complex it
is in its functions.' ACT is one of two UK-originated software offerings
that have done well in the derivatives market. The other is SunGard Capital
Markets which took over Devon Systems.
Some organisations are exploring 'neural networks' for the simulation of
risks and the identification of areas of exposure, or even of
under-valuation. The systems simulate human intelligence in gathering data
and analysing it to make connections and propose likely scenarios.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Denmark (6): 'Live strong and die young' - How
happy are Europe's most liberated women? asks Hilary Barnes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A shocking encounter awaited me when I first visited Denmark, as a teenager,
some 40 years ago: an elderly lady who habitually smoked cigars. The distaff
half of the Danish population is still puffing away. About 41 per cent of
women were smokers in 1991, significantly higher than in other European
countries.
Some things have changed over the past 30 years, but not for the better: as
many Danish women as men are now classified as heavy smokers, and while
fewer men smoke now than 30 years ago, just as many women do.
Danish women gained the vote in 1915, before women in any other European
country, and ever since they have made a point of adopting the same social
rights as men as well - to smoke and drink like the men, to choose their
sexual partners as freely as men.
European attitude surveys suggest that Danish women regard themselves as
more liberal and independent-minded than women in other European countries.
Religious considerations do not place restraints on their behaviour. They
are less inclined than their sisters abroad to accept decisions taken on
their behalf by 'authorities', taking little notice, for example, of
official anti-smoking or anti-alcohol campaigns.
Since the 1960s, they have also taken to working like men. The female labour
participation rate in Denmark is almost 80 per cent - higher than in any
other country in Europe except Sweden. Generous provision for institutional
care for children from the age of six months onwards has encouraged a family
structure in which both parents work. The 'housewife' as a demographic
category has virtually disappeared.
Equally extensive facilities for the care of the elderly have freed children
from caring for their elderly parents as well. As a Swedish sociologist once
said of the Scandinavian welfare state: it has freed the individual from the
tyranny of the family.
Ms Anne Knudsen, an anthropologist, recently caused public controversy by
asserting that Denmark has become a matriarchy, in which women dominate
opinion. This, said Ms Knudsen, was not a good thing, as women are too
conservative-minded and hold back necessary change.
How much truth there is in her thesis is difficult to know, but there is a
long way to go before women have achieved equality of influence as measured
by the number of women who reach the top in politics and business. About one
third of the members of the Folketing and of the present Cabinet are women,
and two of the eight parties represented in the Folketing are led by women
(three until last month, when the Progress party's Ms Pia Kjaersgaard was
demoted); but in business, women in top jobs are few are far between.
Perhaps equality is, as a young woman journalist specialising in youth
culture commented at a dinner party recently, as she puffed away at her
third cigarette within the hour, 'coming along nicely.' But emancipation is
not without its costs, which were highlighted this year by a report from the
ministry of health.
The report examined female mortality rates in Denmark in the age group 35-64
year (part of an extensive 16-volume study of mortality rates among both men
and women). Mortality in this age group is still higher for men, at about
700 per 100,000, but while the male mortality rate has fallen from about
850, 30 years ago, the female mortality rate has remained almost unchanged
at about 500 per 100,000.
Particularly striking is a comparison of the mortality rate among Danish
women in the 55-59 age group, compared with women in other European
countries (Sweden, Norway, Holland and France). In Denmark the rate
increased from 811 to 825 between 1955-59 and 1985-89. In the other
countries the rates were much lower, and they have fallen significantly. In
the case of France the rate fell dramatically from 838 in 1955-59 to 472 in
1985-89.
The ministry's report attributed the Danish trend to increased death rates
from heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases, lung cancer, cirrhosis of
the liver, cancer of the breast and suicide. Four out of six of these
conditions are directly related to alcohol or smoking or both.
The number of women aged 35-64 dying from cirrhosis of the liver has doubled
over the past 20 years. Deaths from lung cancer in the 45-54 age group have
risen from about eight per 100,000 in the early 1960s to 35 in 1985-89, and
almost 100 per 100,000 for the 55-59-year-olds. For both age groups, the
lung cancer mortality rate is much lower in the other European countries.
Denmark has always had a relatively high suicide rate, but for women in this
age group it has increased, rising from about 23 per 100,000 of the 35-64
age group in early 1960s to 32-33 per 100,000 throughout the period
1970-1990. There is evidence to suggest that mortality rates, as well as
other life-style problems, are especially high among university-educated
women, the career women who are the spearhead of the push for equality with
men.
A survey of living conditions by the Danish Institute for Social Research,
published in 1992, found, among other things:
Women graduates have a higher mortality rate than women in general, while
male graduates have a lower mortality rate than the average.
The risk of death from breast cancer is 40 per cent higher for women
graduates than for women in general.
Suicide among graduate women is a much more frequent cause of death than
among other groups of women, or among male graduates.
One in three graduate women have no children by the age of 35. One in five
graduates never have children.
Among women in management positions, every other one has experienced a
divorce (one in five for men in similar positions), and one in four
attributes divorce to problems associated with a career. One in five live
alone, compared with only 7 per cent of men in similar positions.
'If the result of all our efforts is stress and death, wouldn't it be a good
idea to return to the good old days?' asked Ms Hanne Dam, a writer on
women's issues, in a leading article in her newspaper Information in August.
'Not at all,' she went on. '. . . It behoves society to provide women with
the opportunity for a worthier life.'
The young woman journalist at dinner, as she puffed her way to a possible
early decease, was even less equivocal: 'Live strong, die young. That's the
Danish women's motto,' she said.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Denmark (5): Dissonant voices raised over opt-outs
 -The country must shortly re-examine its attitude towards Europe. Hugh
Carnegy sets the scene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the next year, Denmark's awkward relationship with the European Union
is likely once again to become an awkward and potentially divisive domestic
political issue.
Most Danes must have hoped that the EU would slide out of the political
frontline for some time to come when they voted in May last year, at the
second time of asking, to accept the Maastricht treaty on European Union.
Denmark had thrown the EU - or the EC as it then still was - into turmoil in
June 1992 by rejecting the treaty in a referendum, threatening to derail the
whole project. A year later, after securing a series of 'opt-outs' on key
Danish objections to Maastricht, Copenhagen managed to save its own blushes
and the blushes of Brussels by winning a Yes vote in a second plebiscite.
But the EU's intergovernmental conference (IGC) in 1996, which will review
Maastricht and set a course for the Union to follow into the next century,
means Denmark's politicians must shortly grapple once more with the question
of the country's role in Europe - and, specifically, reopen the debate on
Denmark's 'opt outs' from Maastricht.
The debate will be influenced by the recent referendum decisions in Sweden
and Finland to join the Union - 22 years after Denmark joined the then
European Economic Community. Danish public opinion is likely to be more
susceptible to deepening the country's integration in the EU once its Nordic
neighbours are also members. The three Nordic applicants (including Norway)
have fully accepted the terms of Maastricht. If, on November 28, Norway also
votes to join, it will strengthen the hand of those arguing that Denmark
should drop its opt-outs.
In order to win the second Maastricht referendum, Copenhagen won the
agreement of its EU partners to opt out of four of the treaty's provisions.
These were the drive towards European monetary union (Emu) and a single
currency; closer defence co-operation (specifically, Denmark reserves the
right not to become a full member of the Western European Union); measures
on European citizenship; and legal and home affairs matters.
The present Social Democratic-led government of prime minister Poul Nyrup
Rasmussen, formed after September's general election, said in its inaugural
policy statement that these opt-outs, agreed at the EU's Edinburgh summit in
December 1992, remained the basis of Danish EU policy.
Mr Ove Fich, the Social Democratic chairman of parliament's Europe
committee, says a contract was made with the electorate last year on the
opt-outs that had to be honoured. He sees no need to reopen the debate on
the exemptions, believing the IGC in any case will concentrate on central
and eastern Europe. 'The main issue will be enlargement - all other
discussions will be seen in that light,' he says.
But there are other voices, both within government ranks and in opposition,
which argue that the Edinburgh opt-outs - although unchallenged by any of
Denmark's EU partners - are unsustainable for Denmark in the face of the
IGC, and that the country should prepare to drop them. The differences are
such that the all-party consultations that Mr Nyrup Rasmussen intends to
hold next year with the intention of achieving a pre-IGC Danish consensus
are set to be fraught.
What makes the issue more difficult is the necessity to hold a further
referendum if any or all of the Edinburgh opt-outs are to be dropped - a
step which few politicians would take lightly, given the experience of 1992.
The strongest advocate of dropping the opt-outs is Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen,
leader of the right-wing Liberal party. Ironically it was he, as foreign
minister at the time, who negotiated the Edinburgh deal. But he did so only
out of political necessity, not because he thought the exemptions were in
Denmark's best interests.
Mr Ellemann-Jensen argues that Denmark should aim to be a 'hard core' member
of Emu (it will be one of the first countries to meet the convergence
criteria for Emu) and, as a member of Nato, should quickly become a full
member of the WEU (it has observer status at present) to put itself at the
heart of Europe's evolving security structures. If not, the country could be
left on the fringes of the EU.
'What we lack is the political courage to go out and tell the Danes: these
are the facts,' he says. 'We are not holding the internal debate to prepare
Danes for what is going to happen at the IGC, and that is dangerous.'
Denmark's new EU Commissioner, Ms Ritt Bjerregaard, a prominent Social
Democrat, is among those within government ranks who thinks that eventually
the opt-outs should be dropped. But she points out the difficulty for a
minority government in adopting such a position when it relies to a large
degree for parliamentary support from the Socialist People's party. The
latter, though not anti-EU, is under pressure itself from the stridently
anti-EU Unity List which won election to the Folketing for the first time in
September.
The Social Democrats also know that many of their own supporters are cool
towards the EU, and are still smarting from a humiliating showing in the EU
parliamentary elections in June when the party slumped to just 15.8 per cent
of the vote.
'Because of this, the government has to be extremely careful,' says Ms
Bjerregaard. 'It says it is sticking to the exemptions - but it is not
promising never to change them.'
Her hope is that the whole range of issues facing the EU will have shifted
sufficiently by 1996 to present a different scenario to Danish voters. For
example, the WEU is likely to be more clearly defined as an integral part of
Nato; enlargement of the EU to the north, and the planned integration of
central and eastern European countries (popular in Denmark) may change the
emphasis on the pace and method of EU integration.
'If we can convince people that lots of things have changed and that we
cannot stand still, then things can be different. There might be many things
to include in a referendum as a result of new negotiations,' Ms Bjerregaard
says.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Denmark (7): Pooling everyone's ideas - A Japanese
technique is helping companies improve productivity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Continuous improvement' - productivity-improving techniques based on the
Japanese Kaizen principle - is increasingly popular in Danish industry.
'In other countries, continuous improvement is practised by some of the
large and well-known companies. What is exceptional about Denmark is that it
is being practised throughout industry,' said Mr Per Bronsholt Nielsen,
consultant at the Federation of Danish Industries, where he has helped to
introduce continuous improvement techniques to a network of 150 Jutland
companies, which is one of four regional groups working with the techniques.
The starting point was a study-tour to Japan by a group of Danish
industrialists in 1987. They visited a selection of the best Japanese
companies, to examine some of the factors which made them masters of
productivity development. The tour resulted in a book, and in the successful
adoption of some of the techniques which had been learned at a handful of
companies, but only in the past two years has the movement caught on.
'We think we have developed something unique by combining the culture of the
Danish firm with organisational development and management tools,' said Mr
Nielsen. 'We have concluded that you cannot make the tools ('just-in-time'
or quality circles, for example) work without taking the culture of the
company into account.'
Kaizen, as adapted to Danish requirements, is called 'employee activated
production development'. The basic aim is to involve everyone in the firm,
from the management down to the shop floor, in a process of improving
productivity by making things work more smoothly and efficiently.
The results have been generally good, in some cases spectacular. One company
achieved a 50 per cent productivity improvement over a period of 18 months.
Many companies report productivity increases of 10 to 20 per cent.
'What has surprised me and many others is that the improvements in
productivity in firms which have been using the technique for several years
are achieved year after year,' said Mr Nielsen.
Using common sense to eliminate errors or inefficiencies in the production
system is one way of describing the intentions of the programme. It works
when everyone in the company contributes, both by pointing to the problems
and by suggesting solutions.
It has caught on so spectacularly in Denmark, Mr Nielsen thinks, because of
an existing culture of co-operation between the management and the workforce
in Danish industry, at both industry and company level. Danish labour
relations are regulated by law, but legislation is rarely imposed unless
with the joint agreement of the employers and the trade unions; and almost
everyone - the companies and their employees - is a member of either an
employer association or a trade union.
'At company level, it is part of the culture that we talk things over.
Labour conflicts are rare,' said Mr Nielsen. 'We also have a generally high
level of education among the employees, and they are not afraid of raising
questions about the way things are done, especially not the younger
generation.'
When the idea of employee-activated production development is being launched
by a company, it is common for a consultant from the Federation of Danish
Industries to join a consultant from the Metal Workers' Union in explaining
to employees what the idea is all about.
'If we can convince the workforce that this process helps to improve working
conditions for employees as well as productivity, that jobs become more
interesting and the employee's influence is increased, then everyone is
happy,' said Mr Nielsen.
The movement had spread fast through networking - another process which
works well in Denmark, because companies listen and pass on their own
experiences, so that colleagues, and even competitors, can learn, he added.
The Federation of Industries started the process by bringing together a
small group of companies, whose managements met to discuss their experiences
several times a year. When the news is good, it spreads rapidly and more
companies want to hear how they can benefit from the process.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Denmark (4): 'Coin' cards now used in 27 towns -
Towards a cashless society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Danes have passed an important milestone on the road to the cashless
society. They have established the world's first national fully functional
'electronic purse' system, using pre-paid smart cards to replace cash in
vending machines, payphones, canteens, laundries and parking meters.
After trials in 1992 in the town of Naestved, about 70km south-west of
Copenhagen, the development of a national pre-paid card system, known as
Danmont (literally translated: Dan-coin) began last December. The service is
now available in 27 towns, and transactions are increasing rapidly. They
were up by 32 per cent to 191,419 from the first to the second quarters of
this year, and by 46 per cent to 280,394 from the second to the third
quarters.
The use of pre-paid cards is not new. What is new about the Danish system is
that it is not a closed system (involving, for example, only the payphone
customer and the phone company), but an open system.
There are many card issuers and many service providers, and the card-holder
can use the card for all the various services on offer, such as payphone,
canteen, newspaper dispenser, laundromat - even, in central Copenhagen, at
10 plug-in points for re-charging the batteries on electrically-operated
cars. A debit is made each time the card is used. At present, the card
expires when there is no credit left. Re-chargeable cards are the next step.
They have already been developed and are working in Danmoent's laboratory,
but they will not be introduced until final agreement has been reached on a
European technical standard for smart cards. The system is still in its
early days. The number of transactions is tiny, compared with the millions
which take place every day using money and other credit card systems.
The card has been introduced initially in selected areas, usually in a
vicinity where there are schools and other educational establishments, and
where a large number of young people are present.
Mr Henning N. Jensen, managing director of the Danmoent operating company,
believes that it will take from five to seven years for consumers to become
accustomed to the system, but well before the end of the century he expects
that 50 per cent of the population will be using pre-paid cards for most of
the daily transactions they now make by cash.
Mr Jensen is a hard person to catch. International interest in the Danish
system is so intense that he and many of his staff spend much of their time
abroad, advising would-be electronic-purse operators on how to set up a
system. So far, no one else has, on this scale, and that, says Mr Jensen, is
related to the fact that few other countries enjoy such a system of close
co-operation between the banks, and between the banks and the telephone
companies, as Denmark does.
Denmark also operates one of the most successful debit-card systems, the
national Dankort system, which, since its inception in 1982 for use at
retail level, has reduced the number of cheque transactions from 280m a year
(1986) to under 100m in 1993.
One of the essential factors for the success of the system was the ability
of the banks and savings banks to agree to the establishment of a
single-card system, using the clearing system, PBS, which is owned jointly
by all 170 banks and savings banks, some of them quite small.
Debit-card systems have been far less successful in countries where the
banks have tried to set up competing systems, Mr Jensen noted. Almost every
adult now has a Dankort, and it is accepted by virtually all retailers,
restaurants, hotels, cinemas, and theatres. There were many initial
difficulties in introducing the Dankort system, and considerable scepticism
about its future, but within seven years it was in general use.
This is the span of time which Mr Jensen believes will be necessary for
Danmoent to become accepted. The system is a logical extension of the
existing payments infrastructure. Danmoent itself is owned jointly by the
PBS (ie, by the banks) and KTAS, the Copenhagen telephone company, on behalf
of all the phone companies, whose transmission facilities are essential to
the system.
Danmoent itself is a tiny organisation of only 18 people. As the system
operator, it is responsible for laying down the standards for the hardware,
such as terminals, the integrated-circuit cards themselves, and for
surveillance of the clearing and security systems, and finally for marketing
the system. But Danmoent is not, and has no ambition to become, an equipment
producer or supplier. There is complete independence between card issuers,
such as a phone company, and service providers, such as a laundromat.
Similarly, there is independence between service providers and equipment
suppliers, which means that an independent laundromat operator, who does not
issue his own card, can nevertheless install a terminal and thus gain access
to the system.
In fact, this is what has happened, according to Mr Jensen. The dominant
suppliers of washing machines quickly realised the advantages of the Dankort
system (one of them is that there is no cash around to attract thieves) and
introduced terminals and cards; but other laundromat owners were able to
install the same terminals, which accepted the same cards, receiving payment
through the Danmoent clearing system, thus staying competitive with the
business round the corner from them. It will be some time before Danmoent
becomes profitable, because this will require a very large number of
transactions.
Meanwhile, the cards are being used as an advertising medium, an extra way
of earning money - and the expired cards have become collectors' items.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Denmark (2): Welfare costs take their toll - The
economy / Fears of inflation have receded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Compared with many European countries struggling to overcome recession and
high budget deficits, Denmark is in good economic shape.
This year, gross domestic product is set to grow by up to 4.5 per cent after
a long period of stagnation or recession, spurred by a fall in interest
rates late last year and a fiscal stimulus this year and last from the
government.
In 1995, the pace of growth is expected to slow to around 3 per cent, due to
the recent reverse in the interest-rate trend and budgetary tightening,
which will check this year's surge in private consumption. But there are few
worries about this, as the slower pace of growth has helped to calm fears of
inflationary overheating.
Inflation has risen along with the pick-up in the economy to a current
annual rate of around 2 per cent, but the finance ministry predicts that,
over the rest of the decade, it will stabilise around an average of 2.3 per
cent.
The loosening of fiscal policy over the past two years has skewed the public
finances somewhat, leading to a general government budget deficit projected
this year to be more than 4 per cent of GDP. But a tightening of the state's
belt in the budget for next year will see the deficit decline towards 3 per
cent in 1995.
Exports continue to grow, sustaining a surplus on the balance-of-payments
current account equivalent to more than 2.5 per cent of GDP, and holding
down Denmark's once-alarming net foreign debt to well below 30 per cent of
GDP. The country is well on course to reach its target of meeting, by 1996
or 1997, all four criteria for inflation, public-sector deficits,
public-sector debt and interest rates laid down by the European Union as
conditions for achieving European monetary union.
'In sum,' the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development
pronounced in August, 'having eliminated most of the imbalances built up in
the 1980s, the Danish economy seems set for a period of expansion, based on
monetary and exchange-rate stability, relatively sound public finances and a
favourable business climate.'
There is, however, one outstanding blot in this otherwise bright picture.
Denmark has suffered for some years from high levels of unemployment. This
year, unemployment stands at just under 12 per cent of the workforce.
Without any doubt, unemployment poses the biggest challenge to the future
structure and health of the Danish economy.
The country, like its Nordic neighbours Sweden, Norway and Finland, has a
highly developed state welfare system. But the burden placed on the system
by the costs of high unemployment puts it under considerable strain.
Although Denmark's public finances are 'relatively sound', they have been
kept in this condition by the biggest tax burden in the OECD, equivalent to
50 per cent of GDP. Paying some of the world's most generous unemployment
and other welfare benefits has pushed up public expenditure to the
equivalent of more than 60 per cent of GDP - second only to Sweden among the
24 countries in the OECD.
Mr Mogens Lykketoft, the finance minister, readily acknowledges that, unless
unemployment can be significantly reduced, the Social Democratic-led
government's primary aim of maintaining the welfare system will be put in
jeopardy.
'If you look at the next five to 10 years, if we are not able to change the
(budget) deficit into a surplus through a substantial increase in
employment, the conclusion must be that we cannot afford the welfare
system,' Mr Lykketoft said in an interview. 'There would have to be a
reduction all over - and a reduction in living standards. We have a high
level of ambition on social services, but it depends on growth.'
The return to growth over the past year has produced a surge in new jobs,
leading the finance ministry to predict that the unemployment 'curve' will
at last begin to turn down. It forecasts that unemployment will fall below
11 per cent next year to around 10.5 per cent. Its aim is for the creation
of 215,000 new jobs between this year and 2000, reducing unemployment
(coincidentally) to the same level of 215,000, or between 7 and 8 per cent
of the workforce.
Mr Lykketoft emphasises that the new jobs must come from the private sector.
He has already introduced cuts in income taxes, shifting the burden in the
direction of indirect 'green taxes' on energy, water and packaging. He is
committed to keeping the public finances and inflation under strict control.
The government is looking at measures to increase the obligation on the
unemployed to take up vacancies. Above all, when it comes to labour-market
measures, it is seeking to upgrade skill and qualification levels within the
workforce, aiming for high-skill, high-wage jobs to solve unemployment,
rather than low-skill, low-wage jobs.
However, many economists and industrialists question whether the
government's strategy will succeed. They say that most of the jobless - more
than 75 per cent - who are long-term unemployed are not susceptible to
significant skill enhancement. They strongly criticise schemes such as the
controversial 'leave from work' programme - which allows employees
state-subsidised time off for retraining, parental leave or sabbatical leave
 -as an indulgence which risks causing labour bottlenecks and, ultimately,
inflation.
Critics argue that, instead, there should be a thorough overhaul of the
welfare benefits and labour market systems to price people into work. With
the minimum wage at DKr67 an hour and maximum unemployment benefits at
DKr132,000 year, they say the basic incentive to work is lacking for many.
'Nowhere in the world can you find a system where people can continue on
benefits at such a level that the wages they would receive for a job are
lower,' says Mr Poul Erik Petersen, head of the Danish Employers
Association.
But for the time being at least, the government is committed to a path that
does not alter the fundamental structure of the existing labour and welfare
system. 'There is more or less a consensus in Denmark that we should not put
adult Danes on lower minimum wages,' says Mr Lykketoft. 'That means we are
excluding some kinds of job, but they are not the main road to increased
employment. The ambition is to give people more qualifications to give the
possibility of jobs at higher levels.'

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (4): Shift away from US continues -
The future of futures trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ten years ago, when 95 per cent of the world's futures trading occurred in
the US and London's Liffe was considered an 'emerging market', Chicago's
futures visionaries believed the route to global expansion was through
electronic connections.
Their vision of a single global after-hours trading system anchored and
governed in Chicago, uniting a confederation of trading countries across
time zones, has not materialised. Instead, a host of competing futures
exchanges have blossomed across Europe and Asia, and continue to emerge in
economies as diverse as China, South Africa and Peru.
Last year, for the first time, more futures contracts traded abroad than in
the US. This year, as the world's top 10 ten futures exchanges again topple
volume records, the geographic shift in market share away from the US
continues. Futures Industry Association data show that for the first nine
months of this year, US futures and options exchanges had a cumulative
volume of 498.2m contracts, while the rest of the world combined had traded
594.8m during the same period.
Listed derivatives trading outside the US is growing at a rate of 54.8 per
cent this year, compared to the US growth rate of 28 per cent. On a
percentage basis, the biggest gainers in are exchanges that have been in
existence for fewer than five years.
Surprisingly, despite the proliferation, relatively few alliances have been
forged between futures exchanges. The robust growth in derivatives trading
has allowed each exchange to develop independently, while demand for futures
products outside domestic time zones has proved lighter than imagined.
Reuters' costly experiment with a global electronic trading network, Globex,
has demonstrated that day-to-day demand for after-hours access to financial
futures contracts is meagre. However, such systems are still invaluable
because they provide escape routes during times of crisis. Futures' industry
experts say that just knowing contracts can be exited after regular business
hours gives traders a kind of insurance policy that significantly reduces
market, credit, and political risk.
Grand visions for Globex have fizzled out, with only the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange and France's Matif still contributing to the system. However, other
sorts of bilateral co-operations are being developed, and during the next
decade may evolve into powerful trading blocs.
The future of futures trading, it appears, may follow the example of the
CME's 10-year-old mutual offset agreement with Singapore, rather than the
Globex model. The CME/Simex arrangement allows financial contracts, such as
the CME's Eurodollar futures and options, to trade interchangeably in
Chicago and Singapore.
The newest cross-exchange futures co-operation is Matif's link with
Germany's DTB. Matif's liquid contracts and DTB's excellent technology have
the potential, over time, to create a formidable alliance, and give Matif an
after-hours alternative to Globex, should Reuters discontinue that project.
Gerard Pfauwadel, Matif's chairman, has said he will also consider joint
ventures with Europe's smaller, fast-growing exchanges in Spain, the
Netherlands, and Switzerland. However, building such links is a treacherous
business, since they require co-operating exchanges to put aside competitive
differences and harmonise rules that can differ dramatically from country to
country.
Loose electronic links that allow exchanges to market into different time
zones are forming for two specific products: government bond futures and
energy derivatives. The Chicago Board of Trade, London's Liffe, and the
Sydney Futures Exchange are examining the technological feasibility of
linking their existing after-hours computers so their respective government
securities products could be available electronically to traders at the
partner exchanges.
Along a similar vein, the Sydney Futures Exchange recently agreed to list
its energy products on Access, the after-hours computer trading system
operated by the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Unlike Matif, Liffe sees its expansion opportunities outside Europe. It is
in talks with Simex to distribute its eurodeutschemark futures contract, is
exploring co-operative arrangements with Tokyo's Tiffe for a euroyen
product, and has an agreement with the Tokyo Stock Exchange where Tokyo's
opening price is used to settle Liffe's Japanese Government Bond contract.
These talks, and those Liffe is conducting with the CBOT, are in such
preliminary stages, however, that results are difficult to predict.
A secondary force, the trend toward international harmonisation of
regulations governing futures trading and co-operation between regulatory
agencies worldwide, is smoothing the way for these sorts of links This trend
was set in motion during the early days of Globex development, and continues
as world futures trading expands.
While potential links between various futures exchanges are interesting for
competitive reasons, they are merely a sideshow to the main event. Most of
the world's futures are traded in open outcry during regular business hours.
The world's four largest futures exchanges - the CBOT, the CME, Liffe, and
Matif - are all riding the crest of an interest rate derivatives boom that
has brought unprecedented growth to their trading floors. It now appears
that boom is levelling out, with the International Swaps and Derivatives
Association reporting a slowdown in the past 12 months, particularly in US
dollar-denominated transactions.
Although some exchanges still grumble that the over-the-counter markets are
stealing business, most now recognise that the bank markets are their best
customers. The CME, a prime example, has seen volume double in the past five
years, and seat values rise to near Dollars 1m, primarily because its
eurodollar pits provide a hedging haven for off-exchange interest rate
derivatives transactions. Growth in the contract ramped higher this year on
volatility generated by Federal Reserve credit tightening.
Eurodollar futures and options during the first nine months of this year
comprised 64.7 per cent of the CME's total volume, compared with 45 per cent
in 1989. While the CME's business shows no signs of slackening, its future
is unusually vulnerable to a slump in the bank swaps market.
CME competitors such as Liffe have more diversified product portfolios which
make them less dependent on the long-term fortunes of a single product.
However, even those exchanges will have to cope with a rapid maturation of
the markets that underpin their products and a consequent flattening in
their growth curves.
The only futures exchanges that have not shared equally in the swirling
success of derivatives this year are those devoted primarily to physical
commodities. Although money managers have rediscovered commodities as an
asset class, their effect on exchange volume has been spotty - New York
orange juice and coffee futures, for example, have thrived as a result of
Wall Street's recent attention, while some other commodities have escaped
notice.
To strengthen their positions, a number of commodity exchanges have quietly
consolidated. The largest of these consolidations was in New York, where the
Comex merged with the Nymex to create the biggest commodity exchange in the
world. Equally significant has been the gradual combination of Japan's
broadly-fragmented physical exchange markets.
In Europe, China, and Russia, new exchanges are developing to help manage
risk in agricultural commodities that have recently been released from
centrally-planned pricing.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (2): Bankers breathe a little easier -
The regulatory debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year ago, the regulatory environment surrounding the derivatives business
appeared fraught with danger for the banks and derivatives houses which were
prospering from the surge in the market for derivative instruments.
At the time, central banks and finance ministries were just beginning to
come to terms with the growth of the derivatives business, and the
possibility that this growth threatened the stability of the global
financial system. As the inquiries into the business dug deeper, and the air
thickened with warnings of impending catastrophe, Wall Street bankers
trembled at the prospect of big regulatory guns being brought to bear on
their market.
Today, the regulatory climate has changed dramatically, and the bankers are
breathing a little easier. Fears that various national and international
authorities would impose strict new regulations on banks and securities
firms' derivatives activities proved unfounded, and a consensus among
regulators has been established. They now mostly agree that derivatives
enable companies to better manage their financial risks and to lower the
costs of their borrowings, and that new rules governing banks and securities
firms' activities are unnecessary.
Regulators believe that their attention is best focused on making sure that
dealers and users of derivatives properly report, account for, and disclose
the full extent of their activities, and that dealers have the capital to
support their derivatives businesses and possess the appropriate systems to
measure the risks they are taking.
So close, in fact, have regulators in the US moved towards the industry
position that derivatives play a positive role in business and finance, that
they now stand side by side with the banks and securities houses against a
common foe - Congress.
The fear among US bankers and regulators alike is that if lawmakers
introduce legislation tightening federal regulation of derivatives dealers,
the market's growth could be badly undermined. As Joseph Lynyak, head of the
American Bar Association's banking committee on derivatives, says: 'The
question is whether they (the legislators) are going to throw the baby out
with the bath water, and perceive derivatives to be such a problem that they
over-regulate the business to the point where they destroy the market.'
Since the summer, regulators have been telling lawmakers at a series of
Congressional hearings on derivatives that present regulation of the market
is adequate, and that their efforts to improve self-regulation within the
derivatives business is preferable to legislation that could lead to
over-regulation.
There is an ironic twist to the regulators' new, more conciliatory approach
to derivatives. They have become more supportive of the derivatives
community at a time when it has been struggling to overcome the debilitating
impact of a reversal in interest rate trends worldwide and a loss of
confidence by some derivatives users following a string of well-publicised
losses and lawsuits - the sort of developments which in the past might have
persuaded regulators to take immediate action to rein in banks and dealer
firms' activities.
It was the wave of bad publicity that swamped derivatives earlier this year
which emboldened Congress to tackle the market head on.
Over the summer, several influential lawmakers drafted legislation granting
banking and securities industry authorities broad new regulatory powers over
the derivatives market.
Although regulatory officials have already said they are opposed to
derivatives legislation, the leaders behind the various initiatives -
including Henry Gonzalez, Jim Leach and Edward Markey, all senior members of
important House of Representatives' banking and finance committees - appear
determined to proceed with their efforts to tighten derivatives supervision
when the new Congress convenes early next year.
Their ambitions, however, are greeted with scepticism within the industry,
which is adamantly opposed to any kind of legislation. Of the lawmakers'
plans for 1995, Robert Bench, managing partner for Price Waterhouse's
regulatory advisory practice in Washington, says: 'They are expected to
reintroduce legislation in the new Congress, but what's curious about it is
that there does not seem to be any support for legislation beyond (a few)
individuals.'
While the regulatory community in the US has been opposing attempts on
Capitol Hill to introduce new rules for derivatives, it has also been busy
promoting better self-regulation among derivatives dealers and users by
drafting recommendations for improving reporting, accounting and disclosure
standards within the industry.
Among the authorities that have issued recommendations along these lines, or
that have begun inquiries into derivatives disclosure, are the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (the Treasury's bank regulating arm), the
Securities and Exchange Commission (which oversees securities firms), the
Commodity Futures Trade Commission (which regulates exchange-traded
derivatives), and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (which wants
companies to disclose more about their derivatives holdings).
Of the SEC and CFTC's investigations of derivatives, Mr Bench says: 'The
degree to which the inquiries may lead to, if not necessarily legislation
then some kind of defining regulation, remains to be seen.' Mr Lynyak,
however, believes the regulators will continue to favour a policy of
self-regulation. 'What you are going to see is probably some minor
accounting changes, clearly some securities disclosure changes, and some
capital requirements arising from the Basle committee.'
The Basle committee of the Bank for International Settlements, meanwhile, is
at the heart of international efforts to improve regulation, reporting and
risk management in the derivatives business.
In July, the Basle committee and the International Organisation of
Securities Commissions (IOSCO) jointly issued guide lines stressing sound
internal risk management for derivatives trading by banks and securities
firms, and last month the Basle committee weighed in again on the need for
dealers to disclose more about the various risks inherent in their
derivatives activities, and on the need for dealers to maintain up-to-date
systems for measuring those risks.
The Basle committee's work with IOSCO is part of a co-operative effort among
international regulators to align reporting, accounting, disclosure and
capital standards worldwide. Yet, establishing widely-recognised
international standards is one of the toughest tasks facing the industry.
Inevitably, different national regulators have different views on how to
respond to growth in the derivatives market.
At a recent IOSCO meeting in Tokyo, for example, clear policy differences
emerged between the regulators in Japan, which want tighter supervision of
the market, and those in the US and the UK, which do not want to impede
international capital flows or financial markets' innovation and favour a
lighter tough at the controls.
Arthur Levitt, chairman of the SEC, hinted at the exasperation that the more
laisser-faire oriented regulators were feeling in Tokyo when he said:
'There's greater progress being made in other countries, and I wish we could
all get in the same place at the same time.'

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Denmark (1): Economic strength is put to the test
 -Hugh Carnegy and Hilary Barnes see a weakened government trying to cut
unemployment, defend a costly welfare system and clarify its attitude to
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Denmark's Social Democratic prime minister, pulled
off a remarkable political conjuring trick in September.
Although his coalition suffered what amounted to a stinging reverse in the
general election - with one member-party failing to win re-election to the
Folketing - Mr Nyrup Rasmussen nevertheless returned to power at the head of
a weakened but relatively secure three-party government.
By exploiting Denmark's fragmented parliamentary jigsaw of nine parties, Mr
Nyrup Rasmussen was able to side-step a surge in support for the right-wing
Liberal party, securing the establishment of a minority Social
Democratic-Radical-Centre Democrat coalition with the backing of two
left-wing groups, the socialist People's party and the Unity List.
As the restored prime minister set about continuing his dogged twin task of
attempting to lower Denmark's 12 per cent unemployment rate, while defending
its extensive and expensive welfare system, it was left to an eccentric
independent candidate in the election to liven up an otherwise dull contest.
Mr Jacob Haugaard, a well-known comedian, became only the third independent
to win a seat in the Folketing since 1915. His party of 'Consciously
Work-Shy Elements' polled 23,200 votes in the city of Arhus, with its
promise of tailwinds for cyclists, more boyfriends for single mothers and
more gifts from Father Christmas.
The success of Mr Haugaard, clad in his suits sewn from old sacks, amounted
to more than just a frivolous side-show in the election. Like all good
satirists, he made a pointed comment about Denmark as well as raising a
laugh.
The country has grown used to two-thirds of the adult population receiving
their incomes from the government, either as dependants on the welfare state
or as employees of the government itself. But although the economy is
performing more strongly than most in Europe, unemployment poses a long-term
threat to Denmark's comfortable system of state hand-outs and safety-nets.
The opposition, spearheaded by the Liberals under Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen,
the party's combative leader, has argued strongly that reforms to trim the
welfare state are needed to create the conditions for significant employment
growth. The Liberals won 13 more seats in the election, to hold 42 out of
the 179 Folketing seats. But their Conservative and Progress party allies
lost seats, dashing the chances of a right-of-centre government.
Instead, the Social Democrats and their allies, promising to sustain and
even enhance the welfare state, hung on to power, despite the loss of seven
of the SDP's 69 seats and the ousting from parliament of the Christian
party, previously a government member.
The result was hardly a ringing endorsement of Mr Nyrup Rasmussen, a rather
colourless leader whose central stance since he became prime minister in
early 1993 has been a defensive attachment to the welfare system. But the
electorate appeared to be willing to give him a further opportunity to
achieve the daunting target of turning around unemployment without having to
give up the benefits that flow from the state.
What, then, is the government's strategy for meeting these expectations?
The first step is to enact a 1995 budget that trims a budget deficit which
has grown over the past two years following a relaxation of fiscal policy
made to help stimulate the recovery. The government's budget proposal aims
to reduce the general government (including local authorities) financial
deficit next year to close to 3 per cent of gross domestic product, the
upper limit set by the European Union in the Maastricht treaty as one of the
covergence criteria for European monetary union.
A more restrictive fiscal stance will be one of the factors holding down
1995 GDP growth to around 3 per cent, compared with expected growth of up to
4.5 per cent this year. But the government recognises that it must reduce
the share of GDP accounted for by public expenditure - at 60 per cent,
second only to Sweden in Europe - to ensure the national debt, interest
rates and inflation are kept under control and conditions for steady
employment growth secured.
To do this, it is likely to seek support for its budget from the Liberal and
Conservative parties, rather than from its left-wing allies. 'We had support
from the Socialist People's party to form a government. But we have told
them from the beginning that, in respect of the budget, there will be no
step out of line from the guidelines we have set for a reduction in
expenditure and a reduction of the deficit,' says Mr Mogens Lykketoft, the
finance minister.
The government has also set in train a tax reform to lower the country's
high income tax rates, shifting the burden towards so-called 'green' taxes
such as higher petrol prices, increased taxes on CO emissions and other
similar measures.
At the same time, it is looking to active labour-market policies to reduce
unemployment. It is committed to ensuring that collective wage agreements,
in the two-year wage round due to be negotiated over the next few months,
are moderate and exert no upward pressure on annual inflation, which is
currently running at around 2 per cent.
But the core labour market strategy is to enhance skills levels and promote
job-sharing, rather than to dismantle Denmark's high minimum-wage and
benefit levels. This year, the government's main response to unemployment
has been to promote a 'leave from work' scheme which allows people
state-subsidised time off from work (up to one year in every five) to study,
rear their children or simply take a break. At present, more than 75,000 are
on such leave.
The right-of-centre opposition and most business leaders are highly critical
of this approach, saying it has little real effect on unemployment and can
even create labour shortages in some sectors. Most notably, the health
services have been forced to look abroad for nurses to compensate for the
absence on parental leave of some 3,000 of the country's 45,000 nurses.
The government's critics argue that it is unrealistic to expect that
training schemes can lever most of the unemployed - some two-thirds of whom
are long-term unemployed - back into jobs. 'You cannot make a computer
programmer out of someone who is a potential doorman,' commented one senior
Danish economist.
Instead, they call for measures such as lower unemployment benefits and
lower minimum wages to price more people into work. Without that, they say,
Denmark will not be able to generate the service-sector and small-company
jobs growth that the government is seeking to lead the way to lower
unemployment.
Despite the minority position of the government, however, it seems likely to
be able to survive, thanks to the lack of a realistic alternative coalition.
Mr Ellemann-Jensen hopes to woo the Centre Democrats back into the
Liberal-Conservative camp (the three parties were in coalition during much
of the 1980s). But the party shows no sign of being prised loose from the
present government, at least until after the next general election.
In the meantime, an issue which may strain the government is Denmark's
relationship with the EU. Next year, Mr Nyrup Rasmussen faces the task of
formulating the country's position for the EU's 1996 intergovernmental
conference which will review the Maastricht Treaty on European union.
Denmark only approved Maastricht in a referendum last year after it had
secured agreement from its EU partners to opt out, if it so chooses, from
key provisions covering EMU, the formulation of a common defence policy, EU
citizenship and some legal matters.
Many Danish leaders, including some senior Social Democrats, are beginning
to argue that Denmark should be prepared to drop these exemptions in order
to play a full role in the EU's development, a step that would require a
further referendum. But the Socialist People's party and the Unity List -
the latter a fiercely anti-EU organisation - are resisting such a move. Mr
Nyrup Rasmussen's hope of achieving a consensus position going into the IGC
looks forlorn.
However, the clear referendum votes in Sweden and Finland, Denmark's Nordic
neighbours, to join the EU should help the prime minister, as their
membership will establish a strong Nordic presence in the Union and bolster
support for the EU among Denmark's notoriously sceptical electorate. The
effect will be further reinforced if Norway, in its referendum on November
28, also votes to join.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (1): Caution called for on the road
ahead - After the shocks which followed the increase in US interest rates,
bankers and traders are optimistic about the prospects for growth / A look
at a hazardous year for the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The financial hurricane which swept through the world's financial markets
this year has rocked the rapidly growing derivatives industry. Falls in the
dollar and world bond markets have triggered or coincided with news of
multibillion derivatives-related losses by a string of large international
companies.
Yet, eight months after the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates,
bankers, traders and even corporate buyers are sanguine about the potential
for continuing growth in derivatives products - in spite of estimated losses
of more than Dollars 6bn by corporate users over the past 18 months, a flood
of adverse publicity, two legal cases and the prospect of more litigation to
come. And there is a general welcome for the increased emphasis on
disclosure, transparency and accountability which has ensued in the wake of
this year's troubles.
The fall in the bond market, triggered by the increase in short term US
interest rates, is the single economic factor to have done most damage, with
heavily leveraged investors in over-the-counter products such as structured
notes particularly badly hit.
'The last few years have seen a bull market for interest rates. People
thought these low rates were going to continue and got things out of
perspective. The froth built up,' points out Paul Spraos, publisher of Swaps
Monitor, a specialist newsletter.
Two buyers of interest rate products - Gibson Greetings and Procter &amp; Gamble
 -have already sued Bankers Trust, which sold them the products. In the
biggest case Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer products giant, in October
launched a suit seeking damages of more than Dollars 130m.
Procter &amp; Gamble suffered losses from a complex interest-rate swap contract,
under which it agreed with the bank to exchange payments in the future based
on the interest rates prevailing at the time.
The wider economic turmoil had a knock-on effect elsewhere, with increased
volatility in equity markets and a rise in commodity prices, again upsetting
the projections of buyers, investors and traders.
And the unexpected decline in the dollar has also led to some losses.
Publicity has also been attracted by losses such as those incurred by
Metallgesellschaft, the German engineering company, which was hit by a fall
in the oil price, especially during the last three months of 1993. An MG
trading subsidiary was forced to unwind expensive hedges designed to protect
it against a rise in price.
Bankers are quick to point out that businesses which simply invested in cash
markets have been hurt this year and they say that changes in accountancy
practices and the increasing tendency of banks to mark the value of the
assets to prevailing market values has exaggerated some of their trading
losses.
However, they accept that some of their business has been hit. Figures from
the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, the industry body, show
that the notional value of swaps and other over-the-counter (OTC) deals
outstanding reached Dollars 8,475bn in 1993, an increase of 58.5 per cent
over 1992. But following last year's surge in derivatives turnover, growth
in the OTC market could slow this year.
Although few figures are available Mr Spraos reports a sharp fall in the
highly lucrative structured notes market, with activity running about a
third of last year's level. Indeed, bankers are quick to concede that the
appetite for structured notes has declined. One leading banker suggests the
overall value of over-the-counter transactions could fall by more than 15
per cent this year.
However, the story has been far from completely negative. It is widely
accepted that the number of transactions could easily equal last year's
figures, although the unit size of each individual transaction may fall.
Economic volatility has increased interest in many categories of products,
including the simpler less complex products traded on futures and options
exchanges. Exchange traded volume rose sharply in the first six months of
the year. The most impressive growth came from Tokyo International Financial
Futures Exchange (Tiffe), where in June monthly volumes broke through the 4m
level for the first time, overall volume doubling compared with the same
period last year. Europe's three largest exchanges saw volume increase by
more than 40 per cent in the first half.
Bankers are optimistic about sales of some categories of more complex
products. This year has seen the launch of a number of funds which invest in
OTC commodities products and other financial instruments whose value is tied
to commodity prices.
There is confidence in some quarters about the prospect for equity-based
products, particularly in emerging markets where index-based products offer
a solution to problems such as settlement and custody. This could be
especially important in more primitive markets such as Russia. 'A structured
solution might give you control of these risks,' says Barry Davies, head of
equity derivatives at Morgan Stanley. A number of houses are also keen to
promote products based on credit risks. 'People have less clear-cut views on
the direction of interest rates, but a clearer view on the evolution of
spreads. As a result, derivatives linked to spread have become popular among
investors,' says Yves de Balmann, chairman of Bankers Trust International in
London.
More broadly though there is some confidence that the uproar over losses may
leave some positive effects, especially if - as many in the industry now
hope - the threat of tougher external regulation has receded.
A series of reports by multilateral and governmental organisations as well
as postmortems into the losses at individual companies, have served to focus
attention on accountability and disclosure.
A report by the G-30, a group of senior bank executives, published earlier
this year - suggest the speed of the market's development has in some cases
left behind less sophisticated end users, for example.
'The G-30 report (and a separate report by the US General Accounting Office)
all spell the same thing to me. There needs to be accountability of senior
management. Both client and investment bank have to be fully aware of what
is going on in their organisation,' concludes Mr Davies.
'Boards have not always been aware of the magnitude of the risks they have
been running. A long stretch of successes made people sloppy,' says
Jean-Christian Cheysson, managing director of Credit Suisse Financial
Products.
Bankers have responded by emphasising the need for their clients to adopt
effective risk management procedures and argue that there is now an emerging
consensus among the industry, buyers and regulators about the need for
better information flows and reporting, including a global standard for
disclosure. In early October, JP Morgan took the unprecedented step of
making a component of its 'black box' - the daily data on interest rates,
including money markets, swaps, and government bonds, and other market
statistics, and the methodologies it uses to measure them - available free
of charge to anyone who wants them. By establishing a benchmark for risk
management, through the launch of this Riskmetrics system, Morgan hopes that
it can help improve the overall health of the market.
There are also signs that the industry is making some progress in developing
better ways of accounting for derivatives. Increasingly the focus for these
efforts are the risks arising from adverse movements in the markets rather
than the risk of default by counterparties in the over-the-counter market,
so-called 'credit risks'. The International Swaps and Derivatives
Association is working on new disclosure guidelines which would take these
market risks into account, possibly by the adoption of the concept of value
at risk, which estimates how much an investment portfolio can lose over
time.
'I think we are making good progress,' concludes Mr Kurt Viermetz,
vice-chairman of JP Morgan. 'Participants are learning in terms of
transparency and statistics. But the learning curve is very steep for the
whole market around the globe.'

FT  16 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Buy programme drives Footsie through
3,100 - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was virtually all good news yesterday for a London stock market
celebrating a series of specialist deals, including a Pounds 500m share
buy-back by one of the leading FT-SE 100 stocks, a huge buy programme, a
highly successful bought deal and a series of excellent company news items.
Added to that heady cocktail was another strong performance by Wall Street,
which gained ground shortly after the opening yesterday ahead of the outcome
of the crucial Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington. Wall
Street shrugged aside another batch of economic data from the US indicating
strong growth in the economy.
At the close of trading, and with no news from the FOMC meeting available to
the market, the FT-SE 100 Index fulfilled recent market optimism, sweeping
confidently through the 3,100 barrier and closing a net 40.1 higher at
3,135.4.
Second-line stocks shared in the buoyant mood of the market, the FT-SE Mid
250 ending 22.6 stronger at 3,560.7. And there was a general air of optimism
around City trading desks, with dealers adopting the view that, within
reason, the UK market would take whatever was thrown at it by the Federal
Reserve.
'If we get 50 basis points, the market will say it is already in the prices;
if we get 75 or even 100 points, the bond market will love it and we will
hang on to their coat tails,' was the view of one top trader in London,
although he cautioned that the market would definitely not appreciate an
absence of movement by the Federal Reserve. The rate rise of  3/4 percentage
point was subsequently announced.
The overall bullish view was reinforced by a surge of activity in
derivatives markets, where turnover was said to have been the heaviest since
mid-September.
Turnover expanded rapidly throughout the session to reach 961.4m shares, the
highest seen for many weeks, with non-Footsie stocks accounting for an
unusually low 39 per cent of the total.
Dealers picked up the scent of a big market operation before the opening and
prices across the board were marked better at the outset, when the FT-SE 100
was around 10 points ahead.
News that Boots had sent its broker SG Warburg into the market to buy in
around 10 per cent of its shares drove Boots sharply higher until the
buy-back operation was satisfied. Boots' move came 24 hours after it sold
its pharmaceuticals division to BASF, the German chemicals company.
At the same time, AMP Australia, the life assurance group, sold its 3.2 per
cent holding in Hammerson to Smith New Court, the UK securities house, who
quickly placed the stock in the market, taking a 3p a share turn in the
process.
While these deals were being unwound, Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank,
moved in to execute a Pounds 160m-plus buy programme, spanning the FT-SE 100
and 250 indices. These three big operations accounted for more than 270m
shares, or 28 per cent of turnover in the market yesterday.
At its best, just before the close, the FT-SE 100 was more than 42 points
up, with dealers reporting only light profit-taking towards the close.
Company trading reports provided numerous features, including De La Rue, the
banknote printing group, whose shares sprinted to an all-time high after
excellent results, while PowerGen fulfilled even the most optimistic
dividend forecasts. General Accident was the one real disappointment in the
market as the steep fall in the insurance group's net asset value, and
middle of the range third-quarter profits, left the market unimpressed.
The best performance among the FT-SE 100 stocks came from Standard
Chartered, viewed by many chartists as in the initial stages of a big upside
break; dealers noted heavy turnover in Standard shares.

FT  16 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: GA disappointment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The third-quarter figures season for the insurance composites ended with a
whimper of disappointment as General Accident's results included shock paper
losses from its market investments, particularly in the US.
The group has invested heavily in US long bonds, the area of government debt
hit severely by growing concern over inflation. In spite of underwriting
profits up at Pounds 321.6m from Pounds 206.5m previously, GenAcc revealed
its investment portfolio had fallen by between Pounds 100m and Pounds 150m
over the third quarter.
Those unrealised losses were primarily responsible for pushing GenAcc's net
asset value down to 410p from 545p at the end of last year. And with no news
of a Fed Rate rise in market hours to dampen down inflationary concern, the
shares were trading at an unsustainable premium of around 38 per cent at the
start of business yesterday. They were marked down 19 to 565p by the close.
Cable group BICC put on 2 at 355p in heavy 7.4m turnover following a
3m-share agency cross by broker James Capel.
Mobile communications group Vodafone added 3 1/2 at 221p as a powerful
institutional two-way pull in the shares ahead of next Tuesday's interim
results triggered turnover of 14m.
Leading diversified industrial group BTR was the second most heavily traded
Footsie stock, with 27m shares dealt on the back of a powerful institutional
two-way pull. BTR gained 5 1/2 at 311p.
Lonrho, the international trading conglomerate, put on 3 at 159 1/2 p in
turnover of 8.7m, adding to the rise over the past two weeks since joint
chief executive Mr Tiny Rowland announced his departure.
British Gas jumped 9 to 303 1/2 p ahead of third-quarter figures due today.
Turnover in Eurotunnel hit 7.1m shares in Paris - 5.5m more than its nearest
rival in the French activity charts - and generated enough excitement to
push the stock a further 14 higher in London to 284p. London turnover was
4.1m. The shares have risen by more than 40 per cent in five weeks.
BOC added 10 at 720p after the company released full-year results at the
high end of analysts' forecasts. Hoare Govett lifted its current year
forecast by Pounds 30m to Pounds 395m and moved from a hold to a buy.
Mining group RTZ rose 20 to 859p in the registered shares, with dealers
saying Cazenove, which never comments on market talk, had issued a buy note
to clients.
SmithKline Beecham was restrained initially by news that its acquisition of
Diversified Pharmaceutical Services was being examined by the Federal Trade
Commission. However, the shares recovered to close 6 better at 426p.
PowerGen advanced 8 to 559p after a better than expected 26.6 per cent
increase in the interim dividend. Many anticipate that PowerGen will
announce a share buy-back scheme soon.
Sentiment in PowerGen boosted shares in National Power, which reports
interim figures tomorrow. The stock appreciated 7 1/2 to 503p.
A recommendation by James Capel supported Southern Electricity, which moved
forward 5 to 822p.
Among drinks stocks, Scottish &amp; Newcastle benefited from a Nomura
recommendation, adding 11 at 513p.
The Boots buy-back prompted the return of speculation that Great Universal
Stores would make a similar move. GUS rose 17 to 571p.
Turnover in property group Hammerson jumped to 17m after Smith New Court
carried out a bought deal in which it placed a 3.2 per cent stake owned by
life assurance group AMP Australia with a variety of institutions. The
shares closed 5 off at 341p.
Elsewhere in the sector, a sharp increase in interim profits boosted Great
Portland Estates 6 to 189p.
Unlisted Ramco Energy, which services the petroleum and marine industries,
jumped 35 to 255p after announcing that an agreement with the State Oil
Company of Azerbaijan had been ratified.

FT  16 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: De La Rue jumps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in cash rich De La Rue, the bank note printer, hit an all-time high
as the market responded to a sparkling set of interim results. Profits of
Pounds 72.8m were boosted by a far higher than forecast input from its
printing machine subsidiary, and compared with forecasts of Pounds 65m to
Pounds 67m. The interim dividend was raised by 6 per cent.
The stock also received a fillip from the lively start to the National
Lottery - De La Rue is one of the five companies in the Camelot consortium
which runs the Lottery. The shares jumped 31 to 1034p, although some
analysts were beginning to wonder if their premium rating is beginning to
look a little demanding. Paper group Portals, one of De La Rue's principal
suppliers, rose 37 to 725p.
However, Racal, another of the Camelot partners, failed to share in
yesterday's lottery fever, sliding 11 1/2 to 235 1/2 p late in the afternoon
as a sizeable line of stock hovered over the market. Turnover in the stock
totalled 2.4m.

FT  16 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Boots in Pounds 500m buy-back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market spotlight fell on Boots after the consumer products retailer
surprised the market, early in the day, with a Pounds 500m scheme to buy
back its own shares.
Turnover by the close had reached a hefty 214m shares, making it by far the
day's most actively dealt stock, as it registered a rise of 12 at 525p.
SG Warburg, the company's broker, bought a short 10 per cent of the Boots
shares for cancellation, with the lowest price paid being 528p and the
highest 535p.
The market had expected the buy-back, although several researchers had
indicated that they thought the company was only likely to make this move
after the UK budget later this month.
Warburg encountered little difficulty in acquiring the desired block of
shares. Dealers suggested that there had been many willing sellers, with one
retail specialist report-ing estimates that Warburg could have bought as
much as 30 per cent of the group's issued share capital.
Yesterday's move followed confirmation on Monday that Boots is selling its
pharmaceuticals division to BASF, the German chemicals and drugs group, for
around Pounds 850m. One analyst said the combination of the two developments
left the company 'flexible to make an acquisition'.
Meanwhile, analysts expect the selling institutions to pump their newfound
cash back into the retail sector.

FT  16 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures moved ahead strongly for the second day running, but it
was the surge in activity that mostly caught traders' imaginations, writes
Jeffrey Brown.
The number of contracts dealt in the FT-SE 100 December contract soared to
19,792 during pit trading in heavy two-way business. Monday's volume was
8,545.
At the 4.10pm official close, December stood at 3,151, up 50 points for a
two-day advance of 78 points. The premium to the cash market was around 16
points, or roughly twice the fair value premium.
There was a substantial 20-point premium to the cash market throughout
almost the whole session, with the upward pressure only tailing off in the
final hour of trading.
December reached a peak of 3,158 just after 3pm, and on the way up broke
through a number of chart resistance points, notably 3,130 and 3,150.
Traders took encouragement from the way trade sizes widened, although with
the December contract dipping to 3,148 in late, screen trade, talk of a firm
platform for today's session began to look slightly premature.
Traded option volume expanded to 44,538 contracts from Monday's 31,163, with
FT-SE and Euro FT-SE activity accounting for just under 25,000 lots. British
Gas was the busiest stock option.

FT  16 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico falls 1.1%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexican stocks were hurt by political worries in connection with the
investigation surrounding the assassination of Mr Jose Francisco Ruiz
Massieu, secretary general of the ruling Institutional Rev-olutionary Party
(PRI), in September. At the close the IPC index was down 27.49 or 1.1 per
cent at 2,459.15.
The market turned negative after the man leading the investigation, Mr Mario
Ruiz Massieu, brother of the murdered official, accused two senior PRI
officials of trying to hinder his inquiry.
Investors were also concerned about the increase in US interest rates by the
Federal Reserve, fearing that this could lead to a repatriation of US funds.
Heavily weighted Telefonos de Mexico opened higher but quickly joined the
losers, shedding 0.22 per cent.

FT  16 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow volatile in wake of rate
increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US shares reacted wildly to the Federal Reserve's announcement yesterday
afternoon that it would raise the Federal Funds target rate by 75 basis
points to 5 1/2 per cent, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.37 at 3,826.36. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.01 at 465.03, while the
American Stock Exchange composite was 0.11 easier at 448.61 and the Nasdaq
composite 0.88 firmer at 769.02. Trading volume on the New York SE was 340m
shares.
Immediately after the Fed's announcement, the Dow shot up more than 23
points on the heels of a rallying bond market. But the index dropped
substantially as the long bond returned to its pre-announcement level, the
Dow falling 21 points before rebounding somewhat.
A broad consensus of economists expected an increase of about 50 basis
points, to 5 1/4 per cent, so the Fed's move caught some off guard.
Interest rate increases are generally bad for the markets, because they
deter corporate borrowing. Some economists attributed falling share prices
to signals from the Fed that it might move to raise the interest rate target
again in the near term. 'Today's tightening is hardly going to represent the
definitive end,' said Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers.
Share prices were mixed among the banks, which tend to be particularly
sensitive to interest rate changes. Gainers included Chemical Banking,
Dollars  1/8 up at Dollars 36 1/2 , and Chase Manhattan, Dollars  1/2 ahead
at Dollars 36 3/4 . Declining were NationsBank, down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars
47 3/4 , and BankAmerica, Dollars  1/8 lower at Dollars 42 1/4 .
Microsoft, the software maker, saw its shares increase Dollars  1/8 to
Dollars 64 5/8 on news that it would launch a new, on-line service to be
available in 35 countries. Digital Equipment was up Dollars 1 at Dollars 33
5/8 on news that it would manage the client/server network for Microsoft.
ADRs of British Telecommunications, which will help carry the new service,
closed unchanged at Dollars 61 3/8 .
Whirlpool increased by Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 53 after announcing that it
would streamline operations by cutting 3,200 jobs in its European and North
American operations and closing two North American plants.
Two retailers gained ground on reports of strong third-quarter earnings.
Home Depot put on Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 47 3/4 and JC Penney Dollars  7/8
at Dollars 47 3/4 . Dayton Hudson dropped Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 80 5/8 in
spite of a strong earnings report.
Canada
Toronto stocks finished softer after early strong gains were wiped out by
the US interest rates rise, and traders said they expected choppy trade to
continue.
The TSE 300 index shed 8.29 points on the day at 4,168.90 after putting on
more than 20 points initially. An analyst said investors either had to step
outside the market (yesterday) or be strapped in and have a very strong
stomach.
Volume totalled a moderate 59m shares valued at CDollars 698.5m and
declining stocks outscored rises by 471 to 266.
Among interest rate-sensitive issues, the real estate sector was hardest
hit, sinking 46.05 to 2,152.66. Another seven of the 14 sub-group indices
fell, including transport, down 47.19 to 4,495.18. Golds lost 24.15 at
9,679.98 in spite of higher bullion prices.
Newbridge Networks climbed CDollars 2 1/4 to CDollars 46 3/4 after Merrill
Lynch upgraded its rating on the stock to near-term above average.
Vitran jumped CDollars 1 1/8 to CDollars 9 on news that it has acquired a US
freight carrier, the Overland Group of Companies, doubling the size of the
company.

FT  16 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Second section
outperforms as Nikkei index recovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bargain hunting and arbitrage buying supported share prices and the Nikkei
225 average gained ground in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index closed 130.23 up at 19,391.68 after fluctuating in a narrow range
between 19,432.59 and 19,314.76. Brokerage dealers and domestic institutions
purchased shares, but foreign investors turned net sellers.
Sentiment stayed subdued, with many investors remaining cautious ahead of
the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting, and volume eased from 229m
shares to 219m.
The Topix index of all first section stocks firmed 10.82 to 1,528.64 and the
Nikkei 300 moved forward 2.10 to 280.80, while rises outnumbered falls by
738 to 219, with 205 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
eased 1.06 to 1,259.44.
Traders said speculative investors, discouraged by the low volatility in the
first section, explored the second section and the over-the-counter market.
A branch manager at Nikko Securities said he would recommend that clients
focus on small-capitalisation stocks on the second section and in the OTC
market backed by strong earnings growth. The second section index climbed
35.25 or 1.7 per cent to 2,147.11.
Privatisation issues, which had been battered by recent profit-taking,
staged a rally. Reports that the government had abandoned the plan to list
West Japan Railways in the current fiscal year cheered market participants.
Japan Tobacco recouped Y30,000 at Y991,000 on buying by corporate investors,
breaking out after six straight sessions of decline. Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone gained Y12,000 at Y876,000.
Brokers, which have been hurt by the recent drop in the stock market,
advanced. Nomura Securities rose Y60 to Y1,930 and Nikko Securities Y30 to
Y1,030.
Steels and shipbuilders were actively traded but finished mixed. Nippon
Steel, the most active issue of the day, moved up Y3 to Y385 and Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries added Y9 at Y749. NKK dipped Y4 to Y276.
High-technology stocks were firm. NEC improved Y20 to Y1,180 and Hitachi Y4
to Y974. Sony rose Y30 to Y5,780, but Matsushita Electric Industrial receded
Y10 to Y1,530 in spite of strong consolidated earnings growth.
In Osaka, the OSE average put on 143.89 at 21,437.47 in volume of 58m
shares. Aoyama Trading, the men's suits maker, rose Y120 to Y2,420.
Roundup
Senior markets, in particular, were inspired by Wall Street's overnight
gains and prospects following an expected rise in US interest rates.
Jakarta, hosting the APEC summit, was closed for the second day in
succession before reopening today.
HONG KONG rose 2 per cent, the Hang Seng index climbing 186.74 to 9,565.66
and turn-over more than doubling to HKDollars 3.91bn from Monday's
four-month low of HKDollars 1.78bn.
However, the view remained that the US situation offered trading, rather
than investment, potential. Concerns over US inflation data and rates trends
over the longer term were expected to linger after the US credit tightening
move widely expected yesterday.
Recently weak banks and property shares attracted the most attention, with
HSBC, the most active stock, appreciating HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 91.25,
Sun Hung Kai Properties HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 58.25 and Henderson Land
HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 49.90.
KUALA LUMPUR reported strong retail and institutional buying as the KLSE
index rose 25.43 or 2.4 per cent to 1,069.74, its largest single-day gain in
more than three months.
Volume swelled to 299m shares, its highest in four weeks, from Monday's
132m. Brokers said the market had factored in a 50 basis-point increase in
US interest rates, but that a larger rise could put some pressure on the
market.
Meanwhile, Baring Securities market strategist Mr Alan Butler-Henderson said
in his Tiger Talk monthly that the Malaysian market would have the 'best
bounce' after any US interest rate increase.
BANGKOK surged as the market finally discounted expectations of a rise in US
interest rates, and the SET index closed 19.01 better at 1,496.85 in heavy
turnover of Bt8.69bn.
Buying interest emerged initially in the finance sector, and spilled over to
some property issues.
SINGAPORE ended off intraday highs, the Straits Times Industrial index
finally standing 14.24 up at 2,341.18.
Foreign held bank shares were firm, Overseas Union Bank foreign gaining 25
cents at SDollars 8.75, United Overseas Bank foreign 20 cents at SDollars
16.30 and Overseas Chinese Bank foreign 50 cents at SDollars 15.80.
WELLINGTON was led down by forestry stocks Fletcher Challenge and Carter
Holt Harvey as the NZSE-40 index retreated 11.98 to 2,042.63. Fletcher
finished 14 cents off at NZDollars 4.12 after some forecasters downgraded
their expectations, and Carter slipped 6 cents to NZDollars 3.78 in
sympathy.
Workers at Fletcher Challenge Canada's three British Columbia pulp and paper
mills voted on Monday in favour of strike action over working conditions,
which would not have helped the stock's tone, said brokers.
SYDNEY's All Ordinaries index rallied 15.0 to 1,941.4, with brokers noting
bargain hunting in resource stocks following the heavy selling in this
sector in the previous few days.
Among the day's best performers, BHP moved ahead 20 cents to ADollars 19.10,
CRA 18 cents to ADollars 17.84 and MIM 6 cents to ADollars 2.54.
In the media section, News Corp was down 4 cents at ADollars 5.34 after
losing an early gain, but Fairfax advanced 12 cents to ADollars 2.72.
KARACHI sagged at the close as market sentiment remained depressed by fears
of ethnic violence in Karachi, political uncertainty and shortage of funds.
The KSE 100-share index fell 18.67 or 0.9 per cent to 2,178.91.
SHANGHAI's A share index declined sharply after Beijing denied reports that
it planned to allow pension funds to be invested in the domestic market. The
index dropped 29.8 or 3.9 per cent to a day's low of 724.55.

FT  16 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa ends mildly firmer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Johannesburg registered mild gains, with trading seen to improve
late in the day after a lethargic morning session. Brokers remarked that
turnover had been slow before rising towards the close, although individual
share price movements had been restricted by the Federal Reserve's FOMC
meeting.
One of the features was a rise in the price of bullion, which lifted the
golds index a modest 4 points to 2,168, a gain matched by the overall index,
which closed at 5,865 after trading in a narrow 10-point range throughout
the session. Industrials showed the best performance, advancing 14 to 6,808.
Among the most heavily traded stocks yesterday, De Beers recovered from a
softer start to finish unchanged at R99.75 and Anglos was 50 cents better at
R243.50.
Elsewhere, Gencor put on 5 cents at R15.20, Minorco relinquished 50 cents to
R107.50 and Richemont softened 25 cents to R38.50.
CG Smith, the industrial group, lost 50 cents at R18.25 in spite of the
release of year-end figures showing earnings up by 13 per cent to 106 cents.

FT  16 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Most bourses higher
anticipating US rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most bourses advanced on the prospect of a US rate rise after Continental
market hours. Zurich begged to differ, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT appeared to extend itself ahead of today's holiday, the Dax index
closing the session 21.46 higher at 2,110.75 and creeping up further to
2,112.21 by the end of the post bourse. But, said Ms Barbara Altmann at B
Metzler in Frankfurt, the market was more nervous than it looked.
Turnover picked up to DM6.6bn, from DM4.4bn on Monday. The big gains were in
banks, on an improving bond market and on the feeling that the sector had
seen the worst of this year's bad news; and in carmakers, reflecting the
limited recovery in the dollar and a degree of short-covering.
Schering responded to good prospects for its BetaSeron multiple sclerosis
drug, rising DM28 to DM995 by the end of the day; and Veba continued to
respond to last week's progress report with a gain of DM7.50 at DM532.50.
Underperformers included Volkswagen, relative to other carmakers, with a
gain of DM3 at DM459 after recent outperformance; and Siemens, the only Dax
stock to lose ground on the day, with a decline of DM1.70 to DM622.50.
PARIS saw turnover increase to a more satisfactory FFr3.4bn as the CAC-40
index improved 13.45 to 1,954.53.
Eurotunnel topped the list of most active stocks, with some 7m shares
traded, and put on FFr1.35 or 6 per cent at FFr24.00. Brokers reported that
most of the buying seemed to come from the domestic retail side with no
substantial business from institutions.
In contrast, Euro Disney was marked down 35 centimes or 3.6 per cent to
FFr9.30 in strong volume of 1.6m shares as worries surfaced that it might be
replaced as a constituent of the CAC-40 index by Renault.
Among automotive stocks, Peugeot shrugged off domestic reports of a decline
in quality control to close with a gain of FFr1 at FFr828. Michelin added 80
centimes at FFr216.80.
Thomson-CSF rose 90 centimes to FFr154.90 as SGS-Thomson, the French-Italian
semiconductor manufacturer, said that it would list 21m shares in Paris and
New York in an initial public offering. Thomson-CSF indirectly holds 23.81
per cent of SGS-Thomson and will see its stake fall to around 20 per cent
following the IPO, which will run from November 21 to December 8.
LVMH advanced FFr15 to FFr863 following nine month sales figures released
late on Monday.
ZURICH was unable to make much progress as interest rate sensitive banks and
insurers came under pressure, although Ciba's confirmation that it was
seeking a minority stake in Chiron, the US biotechnology company, provided a
focus.
The SMI index picked up late in the day to finish 1.0 higher at 2,591.9 as
some investors reflected that Sweden's vote in favour of EU membership, and
expectations that Norway would follow suit on November 28, had turned a
spotlight on Switzerland's increasing isolation within Europe.
Ciba added SFr7 to SFr753 with some analysts arguing against a deal with
Chiron, unless the Swiss group was assured of ultimate majority control.
However, Mrs Birgit Kulhoff at UBS, who saw substantial benefits for Ciba
from a link, noted that the companies had different corporate cultures and
said it was important for Chiron's future success that it retained its own
identity.
Among the financials, CS Holding lost SFr12 to SFr558 and Swiss Re, which
has risen by 40 per cent over the last two months, gave up SFr7 to SFr705 on
profit-taking, with heavy selling by one private bank reported.
Holderbank, on the upward path since its strong profits forecast 11 days
ago, was a beneficiary of switching from the financials. The shares rose
SFr14 to SFr1,049.
AMSTERDAM made ground, a number of solid gains coming to notice as the AEX
index rose 3.29 to 412.21.
KPN, the telecommunications group, rose to a new year's high, adding 50
cents to Fl 55.80. The newly privatised group has benefited from broker's
upgrades recently, and is seen to be one of the most attractively priced
telecoms stocks in Europe.
Futher strong support was seen for KNP BT, the paper and packaging company,
up 70 cents to Fl 51.00 on expectations of good third quarter results, due
on Friday.
Hoare Govett was confident that the results would be positive, with
operating profits expected to show a recovery in paper and graphic systems,
but a decline in paper merchanting, office systems and packaging.
Other good gains were seen in chemicals with Akzo Nobel and DSM putting on
Fl 2.20 and Fl 2.30 respectively to Fl 201.20 and Fl 139.30.
MILAN's attention turned back to politics with today's confidence vote on
pension reform, and news that the unions had called a general strike for
December 2 pulling prices back from early highs. The Comit index was 3.40
higher at 643.53 but the late weakness was reflected in an 11-point fall in
the Mibtel index, to 10,253.
Against the trend, RAS, the insurer, picked up L726 to L19,411 with some
large buy orders noted ahead of the launch of its L2,300bn capital increase
tomorow.
MADRID said flatly that a 50 basis points Fed rate rise would justify
yesterday's 3.51, or 1.2 per cent gain in the general index to 305.24; less
than that, and the market would be vulnerable; more, and it might rise
further. Block trades bloated turnover to Pta37bn.
COPENHAGEN was higher for the fifth consecutive day with the advance
supported by a firm bond market. The KFX index rose 1.27 to 95.24.
Rising bond prices brought buyers back into bank stocks, which fell heavily
last week.
DUBLIN was depressed by the Irish political crisis following the
government's handling of a child sex abuse case, the ISEQ overall index rose
only 0.74 to 1,804.07.
WARSAW duly dropped to a new 1994 low, its sixth successive decline taking
the Wig index down 355.1, or 4.9 per cent to 6,880.8. The market was said to
be flooded with sell offers, and turnover rose 42.4 per cent to 576bn
zlotys.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Fed lifts US short-term rates by 75 basis
points
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Federal Reserve yesterday raised US short-term interest rates by 75
basis points, the sixth monetary tightening this year, writes Philip Gawith.
In a move described by analysts as the most widely expected interest rate
increase in history, the Fed lifted the Federal Funds rate to 5.5 per cent,
from 4.75 per cent, and the discount rate to 4.75 per cent, from 4 per cent.
The dollar gained a pfennig on the news, standing at DM1.5558, from DM1.5445
before the Fed's announcement, at the New York close. Against the yen it had
reached Y98.75, from Y98.2. The Fed's move came around 19.30 GMT.
Analysts described the dollar's response as fairly muted, reflecting the
fact that higher interest rates had already been discounted in the market.
The increase was slightly more than traders had expected, with most
participants expecting the Federal Funds rate to rise by 50 basis points.
Mr Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in New York,
said the statement which accompanied the move had been entirely
non-committal about whether a further tightening of policy could be expected
next month. He said there was an 'innuendo' in the decision to raise rates
by 75 basis points, which suggested that the Fed might wish to avoid another
move in 1994. Futures markets were discounting short-term rates rising to
around 6 per cent by the year-end.
Although US interest rates have now risen above those in Germany, Mr
Weinberg said the problem for the dollar remained huge capital outflows. He
said a rally in the dollar required that economic growth slow below 3 per
cent, and that there be no signs of inflationary pressure. This combination,
he added, did not look to be at hand. 'We are at least a quarter or more
away from any possible remission period for the dollar.'
As to the short-term outlook. looking back at previous Fed tightenings this
year, Mr Brian Durrant, economist at broker GNI in London, noted that
Dollars /DM typically jumps 0.75 to 1 pfennig on the news, but subsequently
surrenders these gains within three days.
The Irish punt has shown some weakness in recent days, as uncertainty about
the survival of the ruling coalition has raised the prospect of an early
general election. The punt closed at IPounds 1.0187 against sterling, from
IPounds 1.0189. For the past few months it had traded in the IPounds 1.01 to
IPounds 1.013 range.
But Mr Jim Power, senior economist at the Bank of Ireland in Dublin, said
concerns about political instability were 'totally overdone'. Although
elections were by no means assured, Mr Power said that even if there were to
be a new government, 'we can be guaranteed that economic policy will be
virtually identical to what we have had so far'.
He said no politician would have the nerve to challenge the economic policy
consensus, which was 'largely dictated by the Maastricht convergence
criteria'.
Although the punt and sterling track each other closely, Mr Power said the
recent decline in sterling had not been a factor in the weaker punt. Rather,
this reflected the political uncertainty, and the fact that interest rate
differentials across the yield curve had moved too much in favour of
sterling.
The Swedish krona slipped back towards the level it was at before the Sunday
referendum, which voted in favour of joining the EU. After rising towards
SKr4.65, from SKr4.75, against the D-Mark in the first bout of
post-election, the krona has since given back most of its gains. It closed
in London at SKr4.736, from SKr4.712.
The French franc recovered some of its recent loss to end at FFr3.437/D-Mark
from FFr3.440. Mr Malcolm Barr, international economist at Chemical Bank in
London, said recent franc weakness, on alleged uncertainty surrounding next
year's presidential elections, had been exaggerated. 'Even a Delors victory
does not have much policy implication,' said Mr Barr. From a financial
market perspective, he said, there was little to choose between the likely
candidates.
In its daily activities the Bank of England cleared, at established rates, a
Pounds 500m shortage in UK money markets. Overnight money traded between 3
3/4 and 5 per cent.
Sterling weakened slightly against the D-Mark and the dollar, finishing at
Dollars 1.5826, from Dollars 1.5849 against the latter. It has now fallen
nearly 4 per cent from a high around Dollars 1.64 at the beginning of the
month.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia digs into platinum and
palladium stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia is digging deep into its precious metal stocks to reap the benefits
of record world-wide platinum and palladium sales this year, according to
Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum group metals marketing
organisation.
JM suggests that platinum demand will rise by 7 per cent to a new peak of
4.32m troy ounces in 1994, driven up by the requirements of producers of
anti-pollution car exhaust catalysts and jewellery makers. Palladium sales
are expected to rise by 12 per cent to 4.735m ounces, thanks to a
substantial increase in demand from Japan's electrical industry.
Russia, the world's biggest producer of palladium and the second-biggest of
platinum, is stepping up exports to provide much of the extra metal. JM in
its interim review of the markets suggests that Russian sales of platinum
will jump by 17 per cent from the 1993 level, to 800,000 ounces, while its
palladium sales are expected to be more than 20 per cent ahead, at 2.9m
ounces.
These export levels can be sustained only from stocks, suggests Mr Jeremy
Coombes, the JM precious metals division's general manager, marketing.
Russia's platinum group metals are by-products of nickel production by the
Norilsk combine and JM says Norilsk's output has fallen by about a half from
the peak (estimated at between 800,000 and 1.2m ounces) reached in the late
1980s.
'Since there is little prospect of increased production from Norilsk in the
near term, future sales will depend on the size of the stockpile and the
readiness of the Russian government to make metal available to the market,'
says Mr Coombes. Only a very few Russian officials have any idea of the size
of Russia's stocks and how long they may last.
In 1991 a deluge of Russian metal caused great disturbance in the platinum
market but this year Russia 'is carefully tailoring platinum sales to meet
demand, so its extra exports are causing no great concern,' Mr Coombes says.
The Russians do not want to see palladium's price go too high - it recently
reached its highest point for five years - because they fear this will
encourage substitution by other metals, particularly nickel, he explains.
'So Russia will not let the palladium price race away, but it will want to
see how high it can drift up.'
JM makes no palladium price forecast but it concludes that there will be a
slight surplus this year. It suggests demand will increase from 4.215m to
4.735m ounces, while supply will rise from 4.26m to 4.87m ounces.
Platinum supply is forecast to fall slightly, from 4.39m to 4.385m ounces,
while demand is expected to rise from 4.03m to 4.32m ounces. This means that
the platinum surplus, 360,000 ounces last year, will shrink to only 65,000
ounces in 1994.
Better fundamentals and the interest of investment funds in platinum (as
part of a general move into commodities this year) has helped buoy up the
price, JM says. It expects sentiment towards platinum to remain positive as
further advances in demand result from sustained economic recovery around
the world and that this will continue to support the price in a range of
Dollars 400 to Dollars 450 an ounce during the next six months. Platinum was
fixed in London yesterday at Dollars 416.85.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: American prospectors look
southwards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US mining companies are acting on their threats to move most of their
exploration efforts to Latin America because of the constraints they claim
are put on their activities in their own country.
So for the first time Latin America is emerging as the most favoured area
for mining exploration, jumping from third place in 1993 to top this year.
At the same time spending in the US is falling, according to the latest
annual survey of mining exploration expenditure by Metals Economics Group,
the Canadian consultancy.
Total expenditure budgeted for this year by the 151 companies surveyed by
MEG is up by a net USDollars 206.4m from the 1993 level to Dollars 9.13bn -
the second successive annual increase and conclusively reversing the trend
for budget cuts seen at the end of the 1980s and in the early 1990s.
MEG says its survey covers about 80 per cent of world-wide expenditures. The
consultants attempt to exclude from the totals any portion of diversified
company budgets devoted to energy minerals, iron ore or aluminium-related
exploration.
Companies with budgets totalling Dollars 2.05bn give a geographic split of
their spending. MEG says this shows 26.5 per cent (Dollars 543.7m against
Dollars 331m in 1993) will be spent in Latin America, with Chile the
most-favoured country followed by Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela and Peru.
Meanwhile, spending in the US, which has ranged between Dollars 340m and
Dollars 350m, is dropping below Dollars 325m this year, marking 'the first
time that the perceived constriction caused by the more stringent US
regulatory environment has actually manifested in company budget
allocations'.
Of the Dollars 9.13bn of total spending covered by the survey, 56.4 per cent
(Dollars 1.2bn) is going towards gold exploration, up from 49 per cent
(Dollars 925m) in 1993. Base metals exploration is down to 31 per cent
(Dollars 660.3m), from 35 per cent (Dollars 669m). Some 57 per cent of base
metals expenditure is being directed this year at copper.
Grassroots spending - as distinct from exploration at or near existing mine
sites - is accounting for 53.5 per cent (Dollars 1.1bn) of the total.
MEG says junior companies are back in force this year and it was obliged to
change its cut-off for budgets included in the survey to Dollars 2m instead
of the Dollars 1m used in previous years. It estimates that about 85 junior
companies not included in its survey may be spending between Dollars 1m and
Dollars 2m each on exploration for non-ferrous metals and minerals this
year.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Base metals prices slip from
highs - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Base metal market business slackened at the London Metal Exchange and prices
slipped from their highs to close mixed when some speculator profit-taking
emerged.
Three months COPPER, which peaked at Dollars 2,770 a tonne in the morning,
closed at Dollars 2,754.50, up Dollars 3.50 on balance.
ZINC's three months delivery price had touched Dollars 1,200 a tonne for the
first time in more than two years. But it could not erode resistance above
that level and steadily backtracked to Dollars 1,189.50 at the close,
Dollars down Dollars 2.75.
Supported by another large drawdown from LME warehouse stocks, three months
ALUMINIUM rose to Dollars 1,895 a tonne early on and threatened to test
recent four-year peaks above Dollars 1,900. But it too retreated, closing
Dollars 7.50 down on the day at Dollars 1,875.50 a tonne.
At the London Commodity Exchange, COFFEE futures continued the recent slide.
The January position touched Dollars 3,320 a tonne before closing at Dollars
3,349, down another Dollars 54.
'There is not a blind bit of interest from industry,' commented one dealer,
adding that lower than expected retail demand in the last quarter had
sidelined industry buyers.
COCOA futures rallied from early lows to end sharply higher following New
York's bullish trend, dealers said. The March position closed at Pounds 981
a tonne, up Pounds 14.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Accidents add to coal market
supply tightness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD MCCLOSKEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
World steam coal supplies have been hit by a series of severe and largely
unconnected accidents over the last few weeks that has added an extreme
constraint to what had already become a very tight market.
Two derailments on the coal line to the South African export terminal at
Richards Bay at the beginning of October, which looks likely to cut exports
by 2m tonnes this year, have been followed by heavy rainfall in Colombia's
Guajira region. In South Africa the derailments, linked to a break-up of the
wheels on some of the rail cars, led to declarations of force majeure by
three exporters, Trans-Natal, RandCoal and Amcoal.
The Guajira downpour in Colombia led to a sharp slowing in production at the
El Cerrejon mines and long delays at the Puerto Bolivar loading port. While
the operators of Cerrejon North - Carbocol and Intercor - are expecting
throughput to be down 500,000 tonnes this year, Prodeco, operating the
neighbouring Cerrejon Central, has declared force majeure on all shipments.
Then last week it became clear that one of the loaders operated by
Colombia's other major exporter, Carbones del Caribe, had tilted at
Barranquilla, forcing the company to switch to other port facilities.
A couple of years ago the coal market, such was its overcapacity, could have
taken all this in its stride. But this year poor performance by the Polish
exporters and very robust demand levels in Asia have created severe
shortages in both coking and steam coals.
These events have coincided with the start of negotiations for annual
pricing on contracts into Europe and Asia. Already there have been some
extremely large rises reported - up to Dollars 9 a tonne, cif, for one
Australian supplier into Europe and Dollars 9, fob, for Carbones del Caribe
for two of its customers.
While it is too early to see a trend emerging in the market - not least
because one US exporter, Ashland, has agreed an extremely low - Dollars 2 -
rise with the Netherlands' utility GKE - it is clear that the Australians
and the Colombians have very high ambitions for the 1995 market.
The South Africans, too, have set out their stall and are seeking prices in
excess of Dollars 30 a tonne, fob Richards Bay, and have already signed
agreements at around Dollars 30.50 fob with Belgium's Electrabel. These
prices compare with some as low as Dollars 19.50 for sales into the Danish
market for this year's contracts.
Into this already stressed market are about to come two major tenders - one
for 4m tonnes from the Italian power company Enel and one for unlimited
tonnage for 1995 delivery for National Power in the UK. This latter is
expected to be broken into three sections: for imports; for UK-produced
coal; and for coal falling outside the specifications that National Power
normally demands of its suppliers.
Many will see this surprise tender from National Power (which could net up
to 2m tonnes) as the company's first response to the proposed sale of
British Coal's three regions to only one coal producer, RJB Mining. National
Power is known to be extremely irritated at having to swap one monopoly
supplier (British Coal) for another and is anxious to hedge against being
too dependent on one source.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Producer hedging seen capping
gold price above Dollars 400
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rising interest rates are encouraging more gold mining companies to hedge
their future production and this appears to be putting a 'cap' on any price
rise above USDollars 400 a troy ounce, according to the World Gold Council.
North American producers can now lock-in prices of about Dollars 410 an
ounce for deliveries one year forward, the WGC points out. In Australian
dollar terms, forward premiums look even more attractive, it reports in its
latest quarterly Gold Demand Trends publication.
Interest rate increases have pushed one-year gold contangos (premiums for
future delivery) to above 5 per cent.
The WGC also points out that, when the gold price tested the top end of its
Dollars 370-Dollars 395 range 'heavy trade selling was encountered and the
price fell back'.
Countries monitored by the WGC, a promotional organisation financed by some
gold mining groups, account for an estimated 75 per cent of world demand. In
these areas, third-quarter gold demand was 6.2 per cent above the 1993 level
at 593 tonnes. But for the first nine months, demand was down 6.4 per cent
at 1,690.9.
Mr Roger Murphy of the WGC's gold economics service in Europe, pointed out
that demand was very high in the first half of 1993 because the price was
perceived to be exceptionally low. There had since been a rise of about 20
per cent and latest figures indicated demand was stabilising.
If the third-quarter trend continued for the rest of 1994, gold consumption
for the full year would come close to the 1992 record of 2,473.6 tonnes.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: Short-lived rally in US Treasuries after
rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury prices were extremely volatile yesterday afternoon as the market
struggled to interpret the implications of the Federal Reserve's
announcement that it would increase the target for its Federal funds rate.
Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/32 at 93
23/32 , yielding 8.047 per cent. At the short end of the market the two-year
note fell  1/8 to 99 19/32 , to yield 7.081 per cent.
The long-bond yield fell below 8 per cent immediately after the announcement
that the Fed's open market committee had voted to boost the target rate by
75 basis points to 5 1/2 per cent.
Most analysts had expected an increase of at least 50 points and believed
the markets had already accounted for a 50-point increase. The news that the
Fed had increased the target rate by more than expected was taken as a sign
that it was willing to continue a tough stance against inflation.
But the rally was short-lived. Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon
Brothers, the securities house, said the initial rally was more surprising
than its later return to near pre-announcement level. 'A move of this
magnitude had certainly been contemplated by most market players,' he said.
'There is ample justification for the market to be somewhat better than
pre-announcement levels because the Fed has shown more anti-inflation
resolve than previously,' Mr Lipsky said.
'There is little justification for any significant rally at this time
because, until economic growth shows clear signs of deceleration, the bond
market remains vulnerable to disappointing inflation figures,' he added.
The Fed cited the highest capacity utilisation figures since February 1980
as its main reason for the increase. Earlier, it had announced that the
economy was using 84.8 per cent of its capital stock for the production of
goods, and a 0.7 per cent increase in industrial production.
Economists had anticipated a 0.6 per cent increase in industrial production
and capacity utilisation of about 84.8 per cent, but the actual figures were
considered generally in line with expectations.
Bond prices dipped early in the morning following the announcement that
retail spending for October had grown by 1.1 per cent - analysts had
expected an increase of about 0.6 per cent - but bounced back later in light
trading as traders awaited an announcement on interest rate policy. European
government bond markets drifted higher yesterday as investors waited for the
result of the Federal Reserve meeting in the US.
Mr Simon Maggs of IBJ in London said: 'Trading has been very thin ahead of
the FOMC meeting, but European markets will be moving on the back of that
meeting tomorrow.'
Most markets followed German government bonds upwards, although Italy
registered a fall as investors took stock of the difficulties the government
is having in enacting budgetary reforms.
German bunds broke through an important resistance point at 90.50 and the
December bund futures contract ended at 90.69, up 0.41 on the day, in light
trading.
Mr Karl Haeling at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt said: 'Breaking through that
point makes it very tempting to get bearish.'
However, he pointed out that if there were a rally in bunds, investors were
likely to shift into US Treasuries.
UK government bonds followed bunds up in thin trading and the December long
gilt future closed around 102 1/8 , up  13/32 . The yield spread over bunds
was 135 basis points.
A Pounds 250m tranche of 8 3/4 per cent Treasury stock due 2017 was
exhausted in afternoon trading. The bonds were supplied at 102.28, the Bank
of England said.
The tranche was one of four tap stocks announced on November 4. Two others,
a Pounds 250m tranche of 8 1/2 per cent stock due 2005 and Pounds 100m of 2
1/2 per cent index-linked stock due 2000 have already been exhausted.
Another Pounds 100m tranche of 2 1/2 per cent gilts due 2024 has not been
sold out.
While the sale of the tranche suggested demand for gilts, some analysts
believed the bonds had been bought by market-makers and would continue to
hang over the market until sold on to investors.
A raft of UK data is due out this morning, encompassing figures on
government borrowing, inflation, employment and wages, as well as the
minutes of the September 26 monetary policy meeting between Mr Kenneth
Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the
Bank of England.
The yield on the 10-year Italian bond rose by 4 basis points to 11.91 per
cent. Mr Adrian James at NatWest said this was due to worries over budgetary
change. 'Clearly the populace is unhappy about the pension reform,' he said.
The yield on the benchmark 11-year Swedish bond fell to 10.84 per cent from
10.88 per cent. Mr Simon Maggs at IBJ said the markets 'believe the
honeymoon is over for Swedish bonds'.

<TEXT>
Lazard Investors is to launch an Indian equity fund this week in conjunction
with BK Birla, the Indian business group, and the Bombay-based merchant bank
Creditcapital Finance Corporation, in which Lazard holds 40 per cent.
Lazard Birla India Investment Trust (LBIIT) hopes to raise Dollars 100m for
the fund, which plans to invest primarily in shares in companies listed on
one of India's stock exchanges, securities offered by Indian companies on
global markets, and in privatisation issues and IPOs of Indian companies.
Shares in the fund, which is to be listed in London and Mauritius, will be
sold from tomorrow at Dollars 1 each, with a minimum investment of Dollars
5,000. For every five shares investors will receive one warrant to buy
further shares at Dollars 1 on February 28 in any year between 1996 and
2005.
Mr Adrian Evans, a managing director of Lazard Brothers and chairman of the
LBIIT, expects two-thirds of the fund to be placed with institutional
investors.

FT  16 NOV 94 / International Bonds: Italy announces terms of Y450bn euroyen
offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Republic of Italy's long-awaited euroyen offering will consist of three
tranches, of Y125bn of three-year, Y200bn of 10-year and Y125bn of 20-year
bonds, the Italian Treasury said last night.
The three-year tranche is likely to carry a coupon of 3 7/8 per cent, the
10-year tranche a coupon of 5.0 per cent and the 20-year tranche a coupon of
5.5 per cent, market sources said.
The deal, due to be launched early this morning, will be lead-managed by
Daiwa, with Nomura as joint book-runner on the three and 20-year tranches.
The three-year tranche is targeted mainly at Japanese retail investors,
while the 20-year tranche hopes to find demand among Japanese institutional
investors, Daiwa said.
Daiwa hopes that the 10-year tranche will excite some interest among Asian
investors outside Japan and among European investors.
The offering, the third time Italy has tapped the yen market this year, is
likely to complete its foreign borrowing programme for 1994.
The Hellenic Republic is also rumoured to be close to launching its global
dollar offering, which is expected to focus on the five-year area.
Joint-lead manager Salomon Brothers was last night unable to comment on the
size and terms of the offering.
With market attention occupied by the outcome of the US Federal open market
committee meeting and by a series of new US economic statistics, there was
little new issuance in the eurobond market yesterday.
In the Dutch guider sector, Asfinag, the sovereign Austrian financing
authority, launched a Fl 300m offering of eight-year bonds, priced to yield
20 basis points over Dutch government bonds.
About Fl 150m of the offering was bought by Dutch institutions, lead manager
ABN Amro said, with Belgian retail investors also showing some interest.
The proceeds were swapped into floating-rate Austrian schillings.
In the dollar sector, Sampo Corporation launched a Dollars 50m offering of
seven-year bonds offering a coupon of 2.75 per cent and callable after five
years.
Japan's Electric Power Development Company is rumoured to be poised to tap
the dollar sector with a Dollars 300m offering of five-year bonds, IBJ is
said to have the mandate to lead the deal.
In the Luxembourg francs sector, the Republic of Portugal launched a LFr2bn
offering of bonds due January 2005, lead-managed by Kredietbank.

FT  16 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Sanctuary finds home in the
US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The successful private placement of Dollars 75m of senior debt with four US
institutional investors by Sanctuary Housing Association brings a new type
of borrower to the US capital markets.
'It is a horse of a different colour,' explained Mr Conrad Owen, assistant
director in Hambros Bank's bond division.
The bonds, which mature in 2011, were issued at 120 basis points over the
interpolated US Treasury bond rate. Proceeds were then swapped into
sterling, raising the equivalent of Pounds 47.9m. The use of an independent
AAA-rated swap counterparty was described as a 'key aspect' of the deal.
Exact terms were not disclosed but the funds were achieved at terms
'competitive to those available to Sanctuary in the UK', said Mr Owen.
In recent deals in the UK, housing associations have borrowed long-term
funds at 150 to 170 basis points over equivalent gilt rates.
However, funding has frequently been difficult to obtain, said Mr Owen.
Banks are prepared to make loans over five to seven years, while the UK
debenture market will look at deals of 20 to 25 years.
'Between this range, funding has really not been available in appreciable
quantities from any UK source,' said Mr Owen.
Government backing for housing associations was seen as positive by
investors, said Mr Owen. UK housing associations have obtained 50 per cent
of their funding from a government grant since 1988.
The government stake is subordinate to private financing. 'This was an
important element in the sale pitch. It was a big issue,' explained Mr Owen.
In addition US institutions were impressed by the low level of rent arrears
and vacant property which Sanctuary boasts, in common with other housing
associations.
Mr David Knowlton, director of finance at Sanctuary, said he had little
doubt that US investors will be keen to do further transactions and hoped
'other associations are able to tap in to what is undoubtedly a major source
of funding'.

FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: What it is and what it does
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A repo is, in essence, a loan agreement between two parties, in which bonds
act as collateral.
The institution which owns the bonds sells them to the counterparty and in
return receives cash. At a set date in the future, the original bond owner
agrees to buy back the bonds for a set sum. The buy-back sum will be higher
than the original cash amount, with the difference reflecting the rate of
interest on the loan.
Both parties, in theory, can gain from this transaction. The original bond
owner gets finance at a cheaper rate than if it had borrowed without using
collateral. It can also raise cash without missing out on a potential rise
in the bond market.
Meanwhile, the lender receives interest at a better rate than if it had just
deposited the cash with a bank, and has the comfort of the bonds as security
for the loan. If an interest payment is made on the bond during the repo's
life, it will automatically be received by the counterparty. Normal practice
is for the counterparty to pay it back to the original owner.
A repo market would allow investors to go short of gilts, that is, speculate
that prices are due to fall. Investors go short by selling bonds they do not
own. To do so, they need to be able to deliver bonds to the buyer. They
could do this in a repo market by borrowing bonds and agreeing to sell them
back at a future date.
For the investor going short, this is a cheap way of financing a speculative
position; for those lending the bonds, this is a way of earning extra income
on their holdings.

<TEXT>
Sumitomo Realty and Development, a Japanese property developer, saw sales
and profits plunge in the first six months to September due to sluggish
sales of high-margin condominiums, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
Non-consolidated recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax -
fell 44.4 per cent to Y2.8bn (Dollars 28.7m), while sales nosedived 52.4 per
cent to Y90.4bn. After-tax profits plunged 68.2 per cent to Y1.2bn.
Part of the decline in revenue was attributed to the fact that in last
year's first half the company made a one-off sale of properties as it cut
its real estate inventories.
Operating profits rose 2.7 per cent to Y20.8bn as the company eliminated
Y8.1bn in aid to its financial subsidiary last year.
For the full year to next March, it forecasts a 13.3 per cent fall in
non-consolidated pre-tax profits to Y7.5bn on a 28.6 per cent drop in sales
to Y200bn.

Yamaha Corp, the world's largest maker of musical instruments and the leader
of Japan's Yamaha group of companies, yesterday announced a 110 per cent
rise in its unconsolidated recurring profits - before extraordinary items
and tax - to Y6.15bn (Dollars 63.4m) for the six months to September, from
Y2.92bn a year ago, writes Our Financial Staff in London.
Net profits rose 149 per cent to Y3.05bn from Y1.22bn last time, as sales
edged up 2.8 per cent to Y176.95bn from Y172.14bn.
The dividend is held at Y3 per share.
Yamaha said its higher recurring profits resulted from both increased sales
and its restructuring efforts.
For the full year to March, it forecasts recurring profits of Y4bn, up 83
per cent on last year's Y2.19bn, and net profits 237 per cent higher at
Y2bn, against Y593m, on expected sales up 4 per cent to Y330bn from
Y316.18bn.

<TEXT>
Telecom Italia, Italy's state-controlled telecommunications operator, has
won the second round of a legal battle with a smaller competitor attempting
to break the company's monopoly in business services, writes Andrew Hill in
Milan.
Telsystem, a small Milan-based company, wants to lease lines from Telecom
Italia to construct virtual voice and data networks for business users, and
has asked Italy's anti-trust authority to examine the case.
Pending a full decision, Telsystem won an interim injunction with a Milan
court last month obliging Telecom Italia to lease lines. That injunction has
now been overturned for what Telsystem described as procedural reasons.
Telecom Italia says it favours liberalisation in the sector - in line with
EU rules which have yet to be implemented in Italy - but only if properly
co-ordinated. Telsystem, which says its financial situation is gradually
worsening, is pinning its hope on the outcome of the anti-trust
investigation, expected next month.

Japan's leading commercial banks will post disappointing earnings for the

'Tough conditions are continuing,' said Mr Toshio Morikawa, president of

months to the end of September, as a result of poor profit margins. He
blamed sluggish lending at home and increases in US interest rates for the
difficult conditions.
Mr Morikawa added that write-offs of non-performing loans would continue to
erode pre-tax and net profits for the entire banking sector.
Japan's 21 leading banks have seen profits decline for four consecutive
years and are expected to report another fall for the current full-year.
They are scheduled to announce their half-year results on November 24.

FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Investors hope Clarke will open
market in UK repos - The Bank of England is set to issue a consultation
paper about a gilt repo market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDLEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the UK's chancellor of the exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, presents his
budget on November 29, gilt market participants hope he will announce the
establishment of an open market in the UK for gilt repurchase agreements, or
repos.
Although the UK has a limited repo and bond lending facility, pressure has
been mounting for a system which would enable all market participants freely
to borrow and lend government bonds between each other.
Government bond markets in other countries, including the US, France and
Germany, have well-developed repo facilities. However, although London is
the European centre of non-dollar repo business, the sterling sector has yet
to see an all-encompassing repo system.
This may soon change. The Bank of England has spent the last year in close
consultation with gilt market makers (Gemms) about a fully-fledged gilt repo
market and is set to issue a consultation paper shortly. Many believe this
will coincide with the Budget.
The UK has two types of gilt repurchase agreements. First, there are the
Bank of England's fortnightly money market repos, under which the Bank lends
two- and four-week funds to the market against the security of gilts. This
facility is limited to banks with eligible liabilities of more than Pounds
1.5bn, (Dollars 2.46bn), building societies, discount houses and Gemms.
Alongside these, the Bank runs a system of stock borrowing and lending via a
handful of stock exchange money brokers (SEMBs), accessible only to Gemms.
This allows Gemms to finance their bond holdings and go short of stock, and
enables investing institutions to lift their investment returns by earning
income on the stock they lend.
This system has the advantage that the Bank of England can monitor daily the
level of stock borrowing. However, many operators complain the system is
inflexible and unfair to market participants who are not Gemms.
'An open repo would generalise the stock lending system that exists now, but
it would allow everyone to have the same access to the facility, rather than
just market makers,' says Mr John Shepperd, at Yamaichi International, one
of the 21 Gemms. 'A repo system would put the gilt market on an
international standard - the UK is idiosyncratic in not allowing it.'
Observers say an open gilt repo market would have several advantages. 'Repos
would make the financing of long positions and covering of short positions
more efficient, and thus add to the liquidity of the overall market,' says
Mr Danny Corrigan, head of repo trading at NatWest Markets. 'In other
markets, repos have enhanced liquidity,' he says.
Such an increase in liquidity could attract more overseas participants,
broadening the range of investors. 'A lot of foreigners would be happier
trading gilts if there were a repo market,' says Mr Brian Plaistowe, at
Nomura.
Many say the increased liquidity arising from a system of open repos could
reduce market pricing anomalies, such as between high- and low-coupon
stocks. Some say it could lead to a reduction in gilt yields, easing the
government's cost of funding. 'Additional liquidity will lead to tighter
bid-offer spreads and reduce the funding costs for the Treasury,' says Mr
Corrigan.
'If a gilt repo market allows more effective cash management by corporates
and financial institutions, this should benefit the economy on a wider
view,' adds Mr Ifty Islam, UK economist at Merrill Lynch.
Some argue that the establishment of an open repo market would require a
change in the taxation of gilts, requiring gross payment of gilt income
rather than the current system of paying dividends net of tax. This could
result in a loss of tax revenue for the government in the first year because
tax payments would be deferred, and the Inland Revenue might find it more
difficult to collect all the tax due.
Mr Kevin Adams, UK bond strategist at BZW, says a repo market need not
necessarily be accompanied by a change in the tax regime. 'It is not clear
how big a consideration tax actually is - a large number of gilt investors
suffer nil or very low effective tax rates.'
Although most observers say the benefits of repos override the
disadvantages, the risks should not be ignored.
Repo participants face two types of credit risk: security and counterparty
risk. The security risk is probably small, given that most such bonds are
government securities with low default risk, but operators will have to pay
close attention to the credit risk of their counterparties.
According to Mr Islam, the Bank of England may be worried that 'by extending
the range of institutions that can short gilts beyond the Gemms, over whom
they have substantial influence, to others, most notably hedge funds, over
whom they have much more limited power, they may lose control of the
markets'. There may be concern about the effects of greater participation of
leveraged investors on market volatility, he says.
Such concerns mean that, if the UK authorities decide to set up a repo
market, the Bank may follow a cautious strategy in implementing it.

FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Shell confirms key role for
Woodside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MELBOURNE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Woodside, the publicly-quoted Australian oil and gas company, is to remain
an important part of Shell's upstream operations in spite of recent changes
in Woodside's ownership structure.
Mr Ric Charlton, chairman and chief executive of Shell Australia, said
yesterday that Shell had no intention of reducing its interest in Woodside,
which gives Shell enlarged access to the North West Shelf, Australia's
largest oil and gas project.
Earlier this month, Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian resources group,
severed its ties with Woodside by selling its remaining 10 per cent
interest. This consisted of 4.5 per cent owned directly and half of an 11
per cent stake owned jointly with Shell.
Shell also sold its half of that stake, rather than have to own it with a
new partner. This reduced Shell's stake from 40 per cent to 34.27 per cent,
prompting speculation that it was planning a gradual divestment. But Mr
Charlton was enthusiastic about prospects for the North West Shelf project
based around the liquefied natural gas plant at Karratha.
Woodside is the operator of the project, in which Shell also has a one-sixth
direct interest. Other acreage owned by Woodside off Australia's north-west
coast provided opportunities for expansion of production of oil and liquid
petroleum gas, and further capacity would come on stream over the next two
years. Mr Charlton said Woodside had recently made a promising oil find in
the Timor channel.
Mr Charlton said Shell Australia's restructuring had left it more robust,
and closer to its target of a 15 per cent return on capital employed.
Last year, Shell Australia earned 9.3 per cent on capital, which Mr Charlton
said was unsatisfactory. Since then, the company has floated off its metals
interests in a new public company, Acacia, and cut its workforce by
one-fifth. The resulting savings will help reduce gearing from 42 per cent
in 1993 to 15-20 per cent by the end of this year.
Shell has modernised Geelong, one of its two refineries in Australia,
raising its already dominant share of the domestic gasoline market. The
company's strong cash position will enable it to take advantage of purchase
opportunities.

<TEXT>
Yamaha Corp, the world's largest maker of musical instruments and the leader
of Japan's Yamaha group of companies, yesterday announced a 110 per cent
rise in its unconsolidated recurring profits - before extraordinary items
and tax - to Y6.15bn (Dollars 63.4m) for the six months to September, from
Y2.92bn a year ago.
Net profits rose 149 per cent to Y3.05bn from Y1.22bn last time, as sales
edged up just 2.8 per cent to Y176.95bn from Y172.14bn.
The dividend is held at Y3 per share.
Yamaha said its higher recurring profits resulted from both increased sales
and its restructuring efforts.
As previously reported, Yamaha said it took an extraordinary loss of
Y14.70bn in the first half in order to merge a money-losing Hokkaido resort
development company with another subsidiary. The company said it sold
Y14.66bn of marketable securities to offset the loss.
For the full year to March, Yamaha is forecasting recurring profits of Y4bn,
up 83 per cent on last year's actual Y2.19bn, and net profits 237 per cent
higher at Y2bn, against Y593m, on expected sales up 4 per cent to Y330bn
from Y316.18bn.
On the Tokyo stock exchange yesterday, Yamaha shares closed Y40 higher at
Y1,250.
The interim results were announced after the market had closed.

This lifts net profits for the first nine months 238 per cent to Bt2.44bn
from Bt1.02bn last year. However, the latest figures have been lifted by a
previously-announced extraordinary gain of Bt840m.
Advanced Information Services, the cellular telephone subsidiary, reported
third-quarter profits of Bt400m lifting nine-month profits to Bt1.18bn from
Bt 628m. Another unit, United Communications, saw its third-quarter net
profits rise to Bt576m from Bt62m by unexpectedly strong mobile phone
subscriptions. Nine-month profits stand at Bt1.44bn.

Australian Mutual Provident, the large Australian life insurance group which
owns the Pearl and London Life in the UK, yesterday said it was appointing
Mr Gary Traill, formerly chairman of the Gadens Ridgeway law firm, to the
new post of general counsel.
One of the tasks facing Mr Traill will be a re-examination the option of
'demutualising' the AMP - that is, turning it into a company owned by
shareholders.
Mr Ian Salmon, the AMP's previous managing director, indicated that this was
not a possibility, but Mr George Trumbull, who moved from Cigna in the US to
take over the top job at the AMP earlier this year, has indicated that
demutualisation will be reconsidered.

Separately, the company announced that Mr Frederic Hamilton, founder of the

FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Japan postpones privatisation of
JR West
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese government yesterday shelved until next year the flotation of
West Japan Railway (JR West), the latest in a series of embarrassing
setbacks to its privatisation programme.
Mr Shizuka Kamei, transport minister, said the flotation would have 'adverse
effects on the stock market' if it took place as scheduled, in the current
tax year to March.
He feared the value of the company, one of seven established from the 1987
break-up of Japan National Railways, 'may not be recognised adequately'.
The stock exchange believes the listing will take place after the company's
annual results next June.
The postponement was seen by Tokyo stockbrokers as a government recognition
of the market's dislike of its unique pricing system for new issues, in
which the price is decided at a pre-offer auction among a restricted number
of large investors.
This contrasts with the book-building system, used for most international
equity issues, where professional advisers set the price after consulting
the main institutional buyers.
Critics of the Japanese equity pricing system say it tends to set prices too
high, a factor in the flop of the latest privatisation, of Japan Tobacco,
the cigarette making monopoly, last month. The finance ministry was left
with 280,000 Japan Tobacco shares after small investors spurned the issue.
It traded yesterday at Y991,000 a share, well below its Y1.438m issue price.
As a result of the Japan Tobacco experience, the finance ministry has
launched a review of the method of pricing flotations.
The delay to JR West's privatisation will leave another shortfall in the
finance ministry's revenues this year. They have already been depleted by
lower than expected income tax revenues.
However, the ministry is accustomed to the unexpected where privatisations
are concerned. The 1990 stock market collapse forced it to delay reducing
its stake in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, still at 65.6 per cent, to the
targeted 50 per cent. For the same reason, the government delayed the
flotation of East Japan Railway, the only rail operator to have been
privatised so far, for a year until 1993.

FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Schering-Plough wins approval
from FDA for anti-allergy drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Schering-Plough became only the second company in the US to win approval for
a prescription drug which combines an antihistamine with a decongestant,
strengthening its position in the growing market for anti-allergy products.
Claritin-D, which was cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration late on
Monday, will compete with Seldane-D, a Marion Merrell Dow drug. Launched in
the US in August 1991, Seldane-D had sales of Dollars 142m last year.
The basic form of Claritin, which does not contain a decongestant, has
become one of the fastest-growing new products for Schering-Plough. Sales of
the drug around the world, together with sales of Claritin-D in those
countries where it already has approval, grew to Dollars 380m in the first
nine months of this year, from Dollars 295m in the whole of 1993.
Schering-Plough estimates that 14m of the 35m hay fever sufferers in the US
also experience congestion as a significant symptom, and therefore could
benefit from the new drug.
Both Claritin and Seldane are non-sedating drugs, which unlike traditional
antihistamines do not induce drowsiness in patients. According to IMS, a
research firm, the total market for such drugs last year was worth around
Dollars 1bn.

FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: FTC takes a second look at
Merck's purchase of Medco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Merck, the biggest drugs maker in the US, confirmed yesterday that its
Dollars 6.7bn acquisition of Medco Containment Services was being reviewed
by anti-trust regulators, more than 10 months after the deal was completed.
The Federal Trade Commission is also looking into the Dollars 2.3bn
acquisition earlier this year of Diversified Pharmaceutical Services,
another pharmacy benefits management company, by the Anglo-US drugs group
SmithKline Beecham.
The reviews mark a new interest by regulators in the way some drug
manufacturers in the US have bought control of distribution companies.
Both companies said they believed they had already satisfied any concerns
that the regulators may have.
'We are confident that this review, as was the case with the FTC's review
performed last year, will demonstrate the pro-competitive effects' of the
Medco acquisition, Merck said.
The Dollars 4bn takeover by Eli Lilly of PCS, another distributor, was given
FTC clearance two weeks ago, but only after a consent agreement with the
regulators which laid down several conditions.
This agreement was seen at the time as an indication of the FTC's renewed
interest in the area, in spite of the fact that it had earlier cleared the
Merck and SmithKline deals.
In a statement on the Lilly decision, the two FTC commissioners who backed
the deal in a 2-1 majority decision warned: 'We remain concerned about the
overall competitive impact of vertical integration by drug companies into
the pharmacy benefits management market.'
In spite of its earlier approval for the deals, the FTC has the power to
review Merck and SmithKline's activities to see if they have led to any
breach of anti-trust laws.
The agreement with Lilly has been seen in the drugs industry as a blueprint
for the sort of conditions that the regulators may try to impose on the
other companies. The main elements of this were a 'firewall', to prevent
pricing information about other drugs sold through the distributors being
leaked to Lilly, and a requirement for Lilly to maintain an 'open formulary'
under which customers can continue to receive any pharmaceuticals through
PCS's drug plans.
Both Merck and SmithKline said they already met both of these requirements.
'We believe any agency concerns are already addressed by the manner in which
Medco conducts its business,' Merck added.

FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: US stock funds remain in favour
 -Rising rates have not deterred investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although the increase in US interest rates this year has taken its toll on
stock and bond markets, the equity mutual fund business in the US has held
up remarkably well.
The hundreds of billions of dollars which flowed into stock funds during the
early 1990s as rates tumbled have not flowed out again because rates have
reversed course.
Yesterday, the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy again, and left the
door open to further rate increases in the future. Analysts, however,
believe investor confidence in stock funds will not be seriously undermined
by the increasingly unfavourable interest rate environment.
So far this year both short and long-term interest rates have risen sharply.
The rate on overnight bank loans has climbed to 5.5 per cent from 3 per
cent, and long-term interest rates (as measured by the yield on the 30-year
government bond) have jumped to 8.1 per cent from a low of 5.8 per cent.
Also, the stock market has performed poorly - the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index has fallen just under 1 per cent so far this year.
Yet, in spite of rising rates and flat share prices, individuals and
institutions have continued to favour equity funds over other forms of
investments. In the third quarter, net new sales of stock funds averaged
Dollars 10.5bn a month, slightly higher than the Dollars 10.4bn a month rate
recorded in the same three months of 1993, the year sales broke all records.
Money continues to flow into stock funds at rates comparable to last year
because of several factors, including changing demographics among investors.
In the past few years, millions of 'baby boomers' born in the 1950s and
1960s have reached middle-age and have begun to save more of their income to
pay for their children's education and their own retirement.
As relatively sophisticated savers, many have chosen to invest in stock
funds, which they believe guarantee the best return of any form of
investment over the long-term. A year of rising interest rates and a dull
stock market is not going to persuade these investors to take their money
out of funds.
As Mr Richard Hoey, chief economist at the Dreyfus investment fund group in
New York, says: 'There is a portion of the market where there's an
underlying demand to invest in assets for longer-term reasons.'
Another factor is the continuing popularity of foreign stocks. With share
prices flat at home, more investors are looking to benefit from the growth
potential of overseas markets by investing in international equity funds
offered by US money managers. Mr Todd Schapera of the Boston-based Scudder
investment group says that significant amounts of money have continued to
flow into its international equities funds in recent months.
For the industry as a whole, net new sales of international funds have been
averaging Dollars 2.7bn a month so far this year, up from Dollars 1.6bn a
month in the same period of 1993.
A third factor supporting demand for stock funds has been the lack of an
attractive alternative. While short-term interest rates have risen from
their 30-year lows of late 1993, returns on short-term investments remain
meagre by historical standards.
Bank certificates of deposit and money market mutual funds today yield no
more than 4 per cent to 5 per cent, while some stock funds have been able to
provide investors with returns as high as 9 per cent or 10 per cent. They
have been able to do this by avoiding interest rate-sensitive sectors and
concentrating on stocks of companies whose performance is closely tied to
the economy
As for long-term bond funds, they have been hit hard by the rise in interest
rates, which provoked the biggest bond market crash in a generation. As bond
prices plummeted, investors rushed to take their money out of bond funds to
protect the value of their principal. In the third quarter, bond funds
suffered net outflows of cash at the rate of Dollars 3.5bn a month.
Although some of that money will have gone into stock funds, much of it
appears in the last month or so to have gone into money market funds, where
investors are willing - at least temporarily - to live with the low returns
in exchange for the knowledge that their capital is relatively secure. Total
assets in money market funds held steady at around Dollars 580bn between
January and September this year, but suddenly jumped in October to more than
Dollars 616bn.
Mr Roger Servison, managing director at Fidelity Investments, the largest
mutual fund group in the US, says the total of money market fund assets
should climb even higher as the year progresses. 'People are looking to
protect their principal until they feel that long-term rates have settled
down . . . What we've seen in our own market surveys is that most investors
feel interest rates are still going higher.'
Yet, Mr Servison says that at some stage interest rates will peak, and when
they do investors may begin to look at bond funds again, hoping to lock in
high yields after having escaped the worst of the slump in bond prices. This
could lead to some switching of money from stock funds into bond funds.
Determining when the current cycle of interest rate increases will end,
however, will not be easy given the Fed's reluctance to discuss future
policy. Although many Wall Street analysts believe that the central bank's
latest rate increase could be the last tightening for a couple of quarters,
investors are unlikely to want to bet on them being right just yet. As Mr
Servison said before the Fed raised rates yesterday: 'The Dollars
64,000-question is - Will the next move be enough to change investor
expectations?'

FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Chip maker set to raise Dollars

SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian semiconductor manufacturer, has announced
plans to raise up to Dollars 480m through the issue of shares on the New
York and Paris stock markets.
The operation is a significant step in the development of the semiconductor
group, which was formed in 1987 through the merger of state-owned groups
Thomson Semiconductor of France and Italy's SGS Microelectronics.
Analysts in Paris said the issue of shares, which will represent about 20
per cent of the company's enlarged capital, would reinforce its balance
sheet and could mark a step towards privatisation.
The decision to raise capital on the stock market follows a strong
improvement at the company, which is Europe's second largest semiconductor
manufacturer. Last month it reported net profits of Dollars 166.1m for the
six months to the end of July - more than for the whole of the previous
financial year. Sales for the current financial year are expected to rise by
about 20 per cent, compared with the Dollars 2bn recorded in 1993. The debt
to equity ratio stood at about 25 per cent at the end of July.
Profits at SGS-Thomson have been boosted by the upswing in the international
semiconductor market and by reduced financial charges following two capital
increases of Dollars 250m last year. The company's principal products
include semiconductors for telecoms, computers and control systems. Its main
markets are Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Under the terms of the issue, 21m shares will be offered. Just over 13.6m
will be offered to investors in the US and Canada, with the balance being
offered in other countries.
In addition to listings on the New York and Paris stock exchanges, the
shares are expected to be quoted on Seaq International. SGS-Thomson is also
considering a quotation on Telematico, the Italian screen-based dealing
market.
The shares are to be priced at between Dollars 21 and Dollars 23. Morgan
Stanley will be global co-ordinator and lead manager of the issue, with
Banque Indosuez and Lehman Brothers as co-global co-ordinators.

FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Big US retailers advance sharply
in third quarter
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three of the biggest retailing groups in the US - JC Penney, Dayton Hudson
and Home Depot - yesterday reported strong increases in earnings for the
three months to October.
Their results coincided with the latest monthly report from the US Commerce
Department showing that retail sales rose by 1.1 per cent overall in October
and by 0.6 per cent excluding the volatile auto sector. Both figures were
much higher than expected.
JC Penney, enjoying a third consecutive year of strong sales and record
earnings, increased third-quarter net income by 24 per cent to Dollars 274m
from Dollars 221m, excluding an extraordinary charge in the year-earlier
period. Earnings per share, excluding extraordinary charges, rose to Dollars
1.04 from 83 cents.
The increase was flattered by a one-time tax charge the previous year:
pre-tax profits were up rather less, by 13 per cent. The gain also reflected
a 9 per cent increase in sales revenues, which the company attributed to
better targeting of goods in its stores and catalogue.
Dayton Hudson, owner of the Target and Mervyn's store groups, saw a surge in
net income to Dollars 67m from Dollars 43m, with fully diluted earnings per
share rising to 83 cents from 53 cents. Total revenues rose by 9 per cent to
Dollars 5.05bn, while same-store revenues increased 3 per cent.
The company said Target had continued its strong performance, and Mervyn's,
which suffered difficulties last year partly because of the sluggish
Californian economy, had improved from a low base. The department store
division, however, had come in slightly below expectations, with operating
profits unchanged.
Home Depot, the biggest home improvement retailer in the US, reported a 36
per cent surge in third-quarter net income to Dollars 141m from Dollars
103m, with earnings per share rising to 31 cents from 23 cents.
Sales revenues rose by 40 per cent to Dollars 3.2bn, while on a comparable
store-for-store basis they rose by 9 per cent. During the quarter the
company opened 15 new stores, including 13 in the US and two in Canada.
Tiffany, the US jeweller, increased net income to Dollars 4.7m from Dollars
3.3m on sales up from Dollars 135m to Dollars 160m. It said the figures
reflected strong retail sales growth in the US, where same-store sales were
up 12 per cent, and in Japan.

FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: ABB plans to sell off telecoms
equipment unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-based industrial group, is planning to sell off
its telecommunications equipment manufacturing arm, ABB Nera.
An initial placing will be made with a group of institutional investors
before the rest of the company is floated on the Oslo stock market early in
the new year.
ABB has been progressively concentrating on its core business of electrical
engineering. Mr Asbjorn Birkeland, Nera's managing director, said yesterday
the sell-off was in the interests of both companies. The unit would retain
its existing management and would find it easier to raise funds for
expansion as an independent company.
Formed in 1987, Nera has been growing at an average 20 per cent a year, he
said.
Based in Bergen, Norway, Nera employs about 1,450 people and claims to be
one of the largest manufacturers of equipment for satellite-based mobile
communications.
Last year it turned over NKr2bn (Dollars 29.8m), with profits before tax of
about 5 per cent of sales. Some 80 per cent of sales are made outside
Norway. It has manufacturing agreements with AT&amp;T of the US and has worked
on projects with Sweden's Ericsson.

FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Difficult third term for
Portuguese banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Third-quarter results for Portugal's banks were the worst for almost a
decade. The once-buoyant sector has been hit by recession, tougher
competition and a collapse in bond trading profits.
Of the 12 banks that have posted results for the first nine months, nine
have recorded a decline in net earnings, compared with the same period last
year. State-owned Caixa Geral de Depositos (CGD), the biggest bank, is the
only one of the top ten to report a profit increase.
Competitive pressures have intensified since liberalisation of the
previously state-dominated sector began in the mid-1980s. As a result,
financial margins - the difference between the rates at which banks raise
funds and lend to customers - have fallen to an average of 3 per cent from 7
per cent in 1989.
This has hit one of the main sources of bank earnings. Mr Miguel Namorado
Rosa, an economist with Banco Comercial Portugues, calculates revenue from
financial margins for the banking sector as a whole at about Es620bn
(Dollars 4.8bn) in 1994, Es84bn less than last year.
Two years of recession to mid-1994 have squeezed bank profits. Credit to the
private sector is forecast to grow by 8.5 per cent this year, down from 13.3
per cent last year. Non-performing loans are increasing as a proportion of
total credit and deposit growth has been almost stagnant since 1992.
Banco Totta e Acores, which posted the biggest drop in earnings among the
top five banks, blames a 16 per cent increase in provisions against bad debt
for a 21.6 per cent slide in net profits to Es14.9bn.
Bankers expect business to deteriorate further in the last quarter before
beginning to pick up, with an economic recovery forecast for 1995.
Banks are estimated to have lost nearly Es90bn this year as a result of a
sharp drop in interest rates on government debt securities. The combined
loss from lower margins and trading losses is more than the sector's total
1993 profit of Es172bn.
But the real impact of the bond markets' collapse may not yet have emerged
because many Portuguese banks register bonds in their investment portfolios
at purchase value and fail to report trading losses in their accounts.
The fall of only 1.7 per cent in non-consolidated pre-tax earnings for Banco
Portugues do Atlantico, the second biggest bank, might have been
considerably larger if such losses had been fully reflected in results, one
Lisbon stock market dealer said.
Analysts also said some banks 'window dress' results by domiciling credit in
offshore centres to escape provisioning requirements, and generally
underprovision for credit risks, although meeting their legal obligations.

<TEXT>
Celsius, the Swedish defence group, yesterday announced income after
financial items of SKr644m (Dollars 88.4m) for the first nine months, a 29
per cent increase from SKr499m in the same 1993 period.
This year's performance reflected a strong operating result and some capital
gains, whereas a year ago it was strong money market returns on the back of
falling interest rates which generated most of the profit.
The improved operating profit of SKr449m, against SKr196m, was due mainly to
rationalisation.
On top of this there was a SKr143m capital gain from the sale of 40 per cent
of Safe Partners, an offshore company, in September.
However, the overall result was dragged lower by bond market turbulence,
which dramatically lowered the returns on the group's money market
portfolio. The result was a sharp drop in financial income for the period to
SKr52m from SKr303m.
The group expects a full-year profit of around SKr900m.

FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: BCI quiet as Ambroveneto
deadline passes
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banca Commerciale Italiana, the Milan-based bank, appears formally to have
abandoned its attempt to gain control of Banco Ambrosiano Veneto, its quoted
competitor.
BCI had hoped to acquire a 15 per cent stake by yesterday, as the basis for
a formal L7,000-a-share offer for a 50.1 per cent stake in Ambroveneto. But
the self-imposed deadline passed yesterday without comment from BCI.
Ambroveneto announced that its main shareholders - controlling a majority of
the shares - had rallied to its defence on November 5, only three days after
BCI revealed its intention to bid for control.
Crediop, a subsidiary of the Turin-based San Paolo banking group, and Credit
Agricole, the French bank, agreed to buy the 13.52 per cent stake offered to
them by a group of small Veneto banks, and renew the shareholder syndicate
of which they are members. BCI had hoped to buy the Veneto banks' stake.
Ambroveneto's shares closed yesterday at L4,354, up slightly on the opening
price of L4,314.
BCI, which would have paid about L1,750bn (Dollars 1.1bn) for half of
Ambroveneto, raised about L1,575bn with an issue of shares and warrants
earlier this year. Conversion of the warrants before the end of next year
would bring in a further L787bn. There is speculation the bank will use
these funds on alternative expansion plans.
BCI's neighbour and rival, Credito Italiano (Credit), is still awaiting a
decision from the Bank of Italy on whether it can go ahead with its planned
bid for control of Bologna-based Credito Romagnolo (Rolo).
The central bank last week approved Rolo's proposal for a defensive merger
with the group which controls the savings bank, Cassa di Risparmio in
Bologna. Cariplo, the Milan-based savings bank, is watching the situation in
case the merger does not go ahead.

FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Ciba may seek 50% holding in
Chiron

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ciba, the Swiss chemicals and drug company, has confirmed it is in talks to
acquire a 'significant' minority stake - believed to be just under 50 per
cent - in Chiron, the US biotechnology company.
The deal would include the transfer from Ciba to Chiron of assets valued by
analysts at around Dollars 1bn.
Neither company would comment in detail, and both stressed the transaction
might not take place. However, Ciba said the deal would involve giving
Chiron its diagnostic business and its half-share of Biocine, a vaccine
manufacturer jointly formed by the two companies in 1987.
Analysts speculated that the diagnostics company, Ciba Corning Diagnostics,
might be valued at Dollars 800m. The half-share in the vaccines venture,
which has vaccines in development against hepatitis, herpes and Aids, might
be worth more than Dollars 150m, they said.
Neither company would comment on reports that Ciba planned to buy just under
50 per cent of Chiron at Dollars 100 a share.
Mr Samuel Isaly, of the Wall Street research firm Mehta and Isaly, said he
believed Ciba would buy 13.4m shares in the open market and have a further
13.4m issued to it by Chiron, in return for around Dollars 1bn in assets and
Dollars 300m in cash. That would involve Ciba in a cash outlay of around
Dollars 1.6bn.
The link between the companies was 'a hand-in-glove fit', Mr Isaly said,
especially in diagnostics. Ciba has a worldwide marketing network for its
diagnostics business, in which the biggest product is its ACS 180 machine
for early identification and monitoring of diseases.
Chiron has developed new DNA-based technology to measure quantities of
viruses such as hepatitis and HIV, but does not expect it to reach the
market until 1996.
Chiron's shares fell Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 71 1/2 early yesterday, having
leapt on Friday on rumours of the deal.

FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Fall in loan losses obscures
poor result at Swedish bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES

<TEXT>
A big fall in loan losses enabled Svenska Handelsbanken, one of Sweden's
leading commercial banks, to boost profits to SKr3.18bn (Dollars 438m) from
SKr1.28bn in the first nine months.
However, the 148 per cent improvement obscured a poorer performance in the
bank's underlying results, in the face of weak loan demand and narrower
margins.
Its result before loan losses was down 19 per cent at SKr5.3bn, largely
because net interest income was 14 per cent lower at SKr6.45bn.
The main feature of the results was a SKr3.1bn fall in loan losses to
SKr2.14bn. The recovery in the Swedish economy on the back of lower interest
rates has led to a sharp improvement in the business climate, to the benefit
of all the country's banks.
Even so, Handelsbanken's loan losses as a percentage of total lending still
amount to 1 per cent - four times the level in the late 1980s. Mr Arne
Martensson, chief executive, believes the figure could fall to 0.5 per cent
next year.
Mr Martensson was also optimistic about underlying prospects, saying the
third quarter had shown the first clear signs of a rise in loan demand for
more than two years. He expects the momentum to be maintained following
Sweden's endorsement of EU membership in Sunday's referendum.
He said the bank had ploughed much of its surplus liquidity into bonds,
expanding its portfolio to SKr103bn from SKr64bn in the last year. 'These
funds are only being parked until loan demand rises,' he stressed.
The bank made a nine-month profit on bond trading activities, despite the
turbulence in money markets. The result, however, was much lower than a year
ago. A SKr3.5bn unrealised deficit in its bond investment portfolio has hit
the bank's equity, but not the profit and loss account.
Problem loans were SKr7.36bn at the end of September, down 41 per cent from
the last year.

FT  16 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Tokyo SE eases rules for
foreign company listings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Tokyo Stock Exchange yesterday announced a series of measures designed
to make Japan's lacklustre stock market more attractive to foreign
companies.
Mr Mitsuhide Yamaguchi, president of the exchange, said the proposed new
rules, which could take effect as early as next January, were aimed at
removing the principal obstacles to a Tokyo listing, especially for Asian
companies.
During the last year a succession of Chinese enterprises have listed on the
Hong Kong and New York stock markets where the rules are much less rigid.
The Tokyo reforms are aimed specifically at private, former state
enterprises of China and other Asian countries.
Mr Yamaguchi said he expected the changes to pave the way for more than 200
Chinese and east Asian companies to join the exchange in the next few years.
The easing of listing requirements means the current stipulation that
companies must be listed on their own national stock exchange before
receiving a Japanese listing will be scrapped, as will the rule requiring a
minimum one-year moratorium after a privatisation.
The minimum asset requirement for companies wishing to have their shares
traded in Tokyo will be cut to Y10bn (Dollars 102.6m) from Y100bn. Also, a
stipulation that companies have at least three years' annual profits of Y20m
is being changed to a requirement of profits averaging Y2m over the three
years before a listing. Companies will also no longer have to have a minimum
of 10,000 shareholders.
The new rules are expected to be approved by the exchange's governing body
next month, and could be in place by January.
Foreign companies in Tokyo yesterday welcomed the measures. 'There is no
question that privatised businesses in emerging markets desperately need
access to a highly liquid market if they are to realise their potential
growth,' the chief executive of one large financial institution said. 'These
measures will facilitate that.'
However, the changes are not expected to improve prospects much for
companies already listed in Tokyo.
In the last year, at least seven overseas companies, including most
recently, British Gas, have announced plans to delist from the TSE. The
total number of foreign shares listed on the exchange has fallen from 127 in
1991 to fewer than 100 today.
Most companies that have left Tokyo in the last year have complained of the
collapse in share-trading volumes and exorbitant trading commissions.

FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Amer buys Atomic to expand
sports side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amer of Finland is strengthening its position as the world's second-largest
sports equipment group by buying Austria's Atomic group for Sch900m (Dollars
83.6m).
Atomic collapsed into bankruptcy in September after several years of losses.
Amer, however, believes it can revive the company's fortunes, partly because
of overlaps with its own activities.
The purchase will increase the Finnish company's commitment to its core
business, while expanding its sports operations.
Atomic, the world's second largest manufacturer of alpine skis, has an 8 per
cent share of the ski equipment market. It also ranks as Austria's biggest
producer of equipment for alpine and cross-country skiing and in-line
skating.
Its marketing names include Atomic, Dynamic, Koflach, Ess, Colt and Oxygen.
Mr Seppo Ahonen, Amer chief executive, said Atomic had a strong market
position in Europe and Japan. 'It operates globally, balancing the seasonal
fluctuations of our present sporting goods businesses,' he said.
Amer is a diversified company which combines sporting goods with car sales,
tobacco processing, and printing and publishing.
However, the group wants to concentrate more on sporting and leisure goods.
Sports equipment as a percentage of total sales will rise to 60 per cent
following the purchase, compared with 48 per cent now.
Atomic, with annual sales of FM700m (Dollars 150.6m), has eight subsidiaries
in Austria, Canada, France, Switzerland and the US. Around 56 per cent of
sales are generated in Europe, 24 per cent in Japan and 19 per cent in North
America.

FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Asset sales hold Volvo on course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The rapid drive back to big profits this year by Volvo's car and truck
divisions may have caught most of the attention, but a significant
contribution to the Swedish manufacturer's nine-month surplus of SKr12.7bn
(Dollars 1.75bn) came from a non-core asset disposal programme that has only
just begun.
The net gain on asset sales in the first nine months contributed SKr4.2bn -
or nearly one-quarter of the pre-tax profit - as Volvo began a strategy of
focusing on core motor vehicle operations, adopted following the collapse
late last year of a plan to merge with France's Renault.
These sales helped produce a marked strengthening of Volvo's financial
position over the period. Net debt has been driven down from SKr14.5bn at
the end of last year to SKr700m at the end of September, while the group's
equity-to-assets ratio has risen from 21 per cent to 30 per cent.
This has put Volvo well on the road to achieving the financial strength it
needs to underpin the long-term development of its car and truck businesses,
now that it is not sharing costs with Renault.
The target set for the assets disposal programme by Mr Soren Gyll, chief
executive, earlier this year was an equity-to-assets ratio of 50 per cent.
That target looks as though it will be comfortably exceeded as the biggest
plums in the Volvo assets pie have yet to be sold. This year, Volvo sold its
interests in Cardo, an industrial holding group, to the Wallenberg empire
for a capital gain of SKr2.6bn; Custos, an investment company; Norway's Saga
Petroleum; Cultor, a Finnish sugar producer; and Hertz, the car hire group.
Still to come, however, are Volvo's residual holding in Renault; its
wholly-owned subsidiary BCP, a food and beverages producer; its 27.5 per
cent stake in Pharmacia, one of the world's top 20 pharmaceutical companies
by sales; and its Swedish investment bank Alfred Berg.
At the recently-announced privatisation price for Renault, Volvo's 20 per
cent holding is worth around FFr8bn (Dollars 1.5bn). At present market
prices, Volvo's share in Pharmacia is worth around SKr9bn. Volvo is wary of
putting a price on its remaining assets, but some estimates have reckoned
the BCP, Pharmacia and Alfred Berg sales could raise between SKr40bn and
SKr45bn gross.
Mr Gyll wants to complete the disposal programme by the end of 1996. Under
an agreement with the Swedish government, which is the other main
shareholder in Pharmacia, Volvo cannot sell its holding in the company until
January 1996 at the earliest.
Most attention is therefore focused on how and when Volvo will sell off BCP,
a company with turnover in the first nine months of SKr15bn and operating
profits of SKr1.6bn. Volvo is understood to favour a direct sale to a
corporate buyer, rather than a flotation. It says it has been in discussions
with up to 30 potential buyers, although the only company so far to declare
publicly its interest is Nestle, the Swiss food group.
If there is no flotation, the most important issue will be whether BCP is
split up or sold as a whole. Its main components are Swedish Match, a
beverages division which makes Pripps beer and Ramlosa mineral water, and a
food division with a big market share in Sweden.
Volvo says price will dictate whether BCP is broken up or sold intact.
When the asset disposals are complete, Volvo will certainly be a cash-rich
motor company. Then it will have to show that it can achieve the same strong
returns on the money in its car and truck operations as it did in its
diversified investments.

FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: PowerGen sizes up ventures -
Generator looks overseas to honour commitment to regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PowerGen is considering joint ventures with other European companies as a
means of honouring a commitment to try to dispose of 2,000MW of plant.
Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive, said putting some generation plants into a
European grouping was one of a series of options under consideration as a
means of meeting the commitment to the electricity regulator.
Mr Wallis was speaking as the generator reported interim pre-tax profits of
Pounds 118m (Pounds 108m) on turnover of Pounds 1.14bn (Pounds 1.27bn) for
the half year to October 2. Earnings per share were 10.8p (9.71p) and the
interim dividend is 5p (3.95p).
Mr Wallis said that PowerGen had examined the possibilities of selling plant
to UK companies and was now looking at options involving overseas concerns,
including asset swaps and forming joint ventures in which PowerGen would
have a minority stake.
He said that a demerger, whereby a company could be split off from PowerGen
with 2,000MW of plant, looked unlikely. 'A company of that size would be not
be big enough or viable enough on its own,' he said.
'The overseas option now looks the best for us, although we have not ruled
out a UK buyer,' he said.
PowerGen also announced the confirmation of its second significant overseas
project. It is to be lead project developer of a 900MW power plant at Tapada
in Portugal. Mr Wallis said the company's stake would be more than the 22
per cent it has in its German generation project at Schkopau.
The total cost of the Portuguese project would be about Pounds 300m plus
interest charges during its construction, with about 80 per cent financed
from debt and 20 per cent by equity.
The company is also looking at projects in India, China, Malaysia and New
Zealand.
Among developments in the UK, Mr John Rennocks, finance director, said coal
stocks were down to 9.2m at the end of the period from 13m in March. He
expected them to be 5m by the year end and 3m by March 1996.
The total number of employees fell by 200 to 4,185 during the six months,
but Mr Wallis said the main push on staff numbers had finished.
COMMENT
Other companies faced with falling market share and the imminent sale of a
40 per cent shareholding would probably be feeling uncomfortable. Not so
PowerGen. Moving from its position as the second to the third largest
generator in England and Wales has its compensations as market share is now
below 25 per cent. That decreases the likelihood of a MMC referral should
the company be unable to reach terms for selling off 2,000MW by the end of
next year. Profit growth may have slowed but, with dividend cover so high,
there is nothing to stop PowerGen increasing dividends by 16 to 20 per cent
in the next two years at least, especially if overseas expansion goes to
plan. The shares are trading on a yield of 3.4 per cent, assuming a full
year dividend of 15p - up 18.6 per cent. That is a high rating in a highly
rated sector but the fundamentals look strong.

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Casket dips to Pounds 1m as demand falls
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Casket, the bicycle and clothing manufacturer, saw a 52 per cent drop in
pre-tax profits for the six months to end-September, from Pounds 2.13m to
Pounds 1.03m on turnover up from Pounds 51.8m to Pounds 60m.
The profits fall was blamed on lower than anticipated demand for UK-produced
bicycles and a Pounds 607,000 operating loss in the Heidemann Fahrrad German
bicycle manufacturing operation, acquired last November.
The pre-tax figure was also hit by increased interest charges of Pounds 1m
(Pounds 730,000), partly attributable to Heidemann's additional working
capital requirements.
The reorganised clothing side more than doubled operating profits to Pounds
972,000 (Pounds 365,000).
Earnings per share fell to 0.68p (1.89p), but the interim is maintained at
0.4p.

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Credit Lyonnais offshoot withdraws from UK
banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The retrenchment of Credit Lyonnais, the lossmaking French bank, has led to
one of its subsidiaries withdrawing from the UK.
Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland, a Rotterdam-based unit, has agreed to sell
its two branches in London and Manchester and about Pounds 100m of assets,
more than half of the UK loan book.
The purchaser is Singer &amp; Friedlander, the UK merchant bank, which is
seeking to develop its operations in Manchester and in trade finance. 'It is
a nice extension to what we are doing and should produce a modest
improvement in our profitability,' Singer &amp; Friedlander said.
Offices in the UK were only peripherally involved in CLBN's most spectacular
loss, on a Dollars 888m (Pounds 541m) loan to Mr Giancarlo Parretti to buy
the MGM film studio.
CLBN said most of its loans were performing and its performance bettered
that of the UK clearing banks. Singer has nevertheless refused to take on a
significant portion of CLBN's UK portfolio.
Credit Lyonnais itself recently experienced a setback in the UK when Health
Care International, operator of a luxury hospital in Glasgow, went into
receivership after borrowing Pounds 30m from it.
CLBN's contraction mirrors that of its parent, which recently announced the
withdrawal from UK retail banking and the closure of half of its corporate
banking branches.
Credit Lyonnais has one of the largest pan-European branch networks and the
new management has indicated no wholesale withdrawal. However, reviews have
been ordered into operations in Belgium, Spain and Italy.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Symonds Engineering, the sheetmetal and toolmaking specialist, swung back
into the black in the six months to September 30 as the benefits of its
restructuring programme came through.
Concentration on customers requiring higher added value products generated
improved margins and resulted in turnover expanding 52 per cent to Pounds
3.21m (Pounds 2.1m) and transformed losses of Pounds 126,000 into pre-tax
profits of Pounds 174,000.
HBH, the toolmaker acquired for Pounds 560,000 in March, was successfully
integrated, according to Mr Rod Ackrill, chairman, and made a 50 per cent
contribution to profits. 'HBH has given us a strengthened client base and
increased capacity.'
Earnings per share emerged at 1.3p (losses of 1.27p) and the interim
dividend is restored with a 0.25p distribution.

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: New contracts and sales expansion lifts
Ushers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ushers, the Wiltshire-based brewer, yesterday published its pathfinder
prospectus and reported a 35 per cent rise in pre-tax profits in the year to
October 31.
The pre-tax line rose to Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 7.76m) on turnover up 12 per
cent to Pounds 54.7m (Pounds 48.8m), as the company attracted new brewing
contracts and increased sales of Ushers beers through its estate of 466
pubs.
The company, bought from Courage by a team of former Grand Metropolitan
managers for Pounds 71m in 1991, is expected to have a market value of about
Pounds 100m from the placing and open offer.
Mr Roger North, chief executive, said: 'Our work since the buy-in has
improved volumes and profits. We have new customers for our contract brewing
business and we are making good progress in upgrading the quality of the
tied estate.'
Operating profit at the brewing and wholesale division rose 20 per cent to
Pounds 7.72m (Pounds 6.42m), while the estate division reported operating
profit up 8 per cent to Pounds 7.54m (Pounds 6.96m).
Ushers' current brewing contract with Courage will fall from 210,000 barrels
this year to 50,000 in 1997.
The brewer hopes to replace the Courage volume with new contracts, which are
expected to rise from 8,000 to 40,000 barrels in the current year.
It also hopes to lift sales of Usher brands to its tied estate, where
margins are five times higher than the Courage contract. Volumes sold
through the estate increased 10 per cent since the company established its
own distribution and telesales systems in April.
Cash raised by the flotation will be used to clear the brewer's existing
debt of Pounds 35m, on which interest rates have been fixed within a band.
Interest costs in the year to October 31 stood at Pounds 4.82m (Pounds
5.62m).
It will also free the brewer to double its estate of tied pubs, which offer
a 21 per cent return on capital.
The main shareholders are Schroder Ventures and Swiss Bank Corporation. The
directors do not intend to sell their shares, and are likely to own about 8
per cent of the equity after flotation.
The share price is expected to be announced on December 1, with dealings
beginning on December 15.
The flotation is sponsored by NatWest Markets and the broker is NatWest Wood
Mackenzie.

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: GA shares drop 19p as net assets fall
sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in General Accident, the Scotland-based composite insurer, fell 19p
yesterday after results showing the group's net asset value had been hit by
poor performing world financial markets and a weak dollar.
The drop in the share price to 565p, against a rising market, came despite a
jump in pre-tax profits in the first nine months of 1994 to Pounds 321.6m
(Pounds 206.5m).
Net assets per ordinary share fell to 410p, against 545p at the end of last
year. GA blamed conditions on world equity markets and the weak dollar, but
Mr John Chester, insurance analyst at SG Warburg, said the figures also
reflected the high proportion of long term US bonds in its portfolio.
Earnings were boosted by a strong performance in the UK, particularly on
property insurance. Total premium income increased to Pounds 3.8bn (Pounds
3.7bn).
GA's underwriting profits confirmed the buoyancy of the UK insurance market,
though Mr Nelson Robertson, group chief executive, acknowledged that the
favourable conditions were unlikely to continue.
He said GA was prepared, if necessary, to see segments of its businesses
contract if competition was particularly fierce, in order to preserve its
profitability.
For example, the group has decided not to promote heavily sales of private
motor insurance via GA Direct, its direct selling operation which continues
to serve about a fifth of GA's motor policy holders, because competitors are
cutting prices to unprofitable levels.
However, GA has succeeded in expand its household insurance business.
Premium income on personal household insurance policies jumped 25 per cent
to Pounds 267.4m in the first nine months, while personal motor premium
income fell 5 per cent to Pounds 182.7m.
Similarly premium income from commercial property policies increased by more
than 20 per cent, but commercial motor premium income shrank by 8 per cent.
GA also bucked the trend in the UK life industry, increasing new annual
premiums by 3 per cent to Pounds 40.9m and single premiums by 46 per cent to
Pounds 375.7m.
Mr Robertson said GA expected its Pacific and east Asian operations to
provide growth opportunities and the group is looking for possible small or
medium size acquisitions in the region.
However, GA's overseas underwriting results remained lacklustre. US and
Canada reported underwriting deficits of Pounds 94.4m (Pounds 107.2m) and
Pounds 54.4m (Pounds 26.1m) respectively in the first nine months. Mr
Robertson blamed the figures on the impact of catastrophe losses.

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Cedardata advances 34% to Pounds 1.34m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cedardata, the supplier of financial accounting and commercial computer
software which came to the market in February, raised pre-tax profits by 34
per cent from Pounds 998,000 to Pounds 1.34m for the six months to September
30.
Turnover grew 43 per cent to Pounds 3.73m.
With earnings per share at 2.8p (2.3p), the company has declared an interim
dividend of 1.05p - this compares with a forecast of not less than 0.64p.
Mr Sidney Cordier, chairman, said the company obtained two significant
contracts during the period, one of which necessitated the supply of low
margin computer hardware, in addition to cfacs software and services.

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Charles Sidney 17% ahead to Pounds 2.87m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Charles Sidney, the Mercedes-Benz truck and car dealer, outstripped the
German group's performance across the UK as it lifted pre-tax profits 17 per
cent from Pounds 2.46m to Pounds 2.87m in the year to August 31.
Mr Raymond Edwards, chairman, said the group was looking for acquisition
possibilities involving other manufacturers.
He said the year had been spent making sure that shareholder value,
excluding newly incurred central costs, rose satisfactorily. Further, Mr
Edwards wanted the South Yorkshire business bought from the receiver and
Aberdeen and Dundee Motor Group to be integrated.
That done, he said discussions had been taking place with a view to making
relationships with other manufacturers of trucks and cars, both specialist
and volume. He was wary of spending too much and would avoid companies which
used debt for trading.
Turnover grew to Pounds 72.2m (Pounds 55.8m) with Aberdeen and Dundee
contributing Pounds 6.16m to sales and Pounds 235,000 to operating profits
of Pounds 2.84m (Pounds 2.44m). The group said that after adding back Pounds
450,000 of central costs, underlying profits from trading rose 38 per cent
to Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 2.4m).
Profits from trucks advanced 24 per cent to Pounds 2.17m on turnover of
Pounds 43m (Pounds 35.1m) and cars contributed 61 per cent more at Pounds
1.11m on turnover of Pounds 29.2m (Pounds 20.7m).
Mr John Ross, managing director, said that cars had risen so sharply largely
because of the impact of the C Class, the replacement for the 190.
As average profit per unit fell about 5 per cent across the group, Mr Ross
said the high-margin after-sales and parts operations had become more
important.
Earnings increased to 8.3p (7.9p) per share and a maiden final dividend of
2.3p makes a total of 3.5p.

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: British Biotech cancer drug enters last
stage of trials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Biotech, the UK's biggest biotechnology company, has begun the last
stage of clinical trials on batimastat, its most important drug.
If the trials are successful, the anti-cancer drug will be submitted for
regulatory approval in Europe 'by the end of the first quarter of 1996'.
Approval could follow later that year.
Batimastat's success in earlier trials this year triggered a sharp rise in
the share price. It had risen from 360p at the start of August to 586p
yesterday.
The drug blocks the action of enzymes which allow cancers to grow by
destroying the connective tissue between healthy cells.
This method of treatment differs from conventional drugs, which kill some
healthy cells as well as cancerous ones.
The last stage of testing, Phase III, is the most difficult for any
potential drug. It involves large numbers of patients - 300 for batimastat -
who will be treated in a 'double blind' trial where neither doctor nor
patient knows whether they have received the drug or a placebo. Batimastat
is being tried on patients suffering from abdominal cancers such as ovarian
cancer.
Phase I trials are on healthy volunteers to look for side effects, and Phase
II are on small groups of patients to find the best doses.
Several US biotechnology drugs have failed this year at Phase III.
British Biotech has also started Phase I trials on the follow-up to
batimastat, BB-2516. It is an improvement over batimastat in that it can be
taken orally rather than by injection.

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions bolster Great Portland -
Property group sees rental growth although tenant demand remains sporadic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Acquisitions following its 1993 rights issue helped Great Portland Estates,
the UK's sixth largest property company, announce interim pre-tax profits
ahead from Pounds 16m to Pounds 21.4m.
Since its preliminary announcement in June, Great Portland has bought four
freehold office investments for Pounds 26m, a portfolio of seven properties
in Cardiff and Plymouth for Pounds 19m, and a pre-let warehouse development
in Bury, Lancashire for Pounds 9m.
These are expected to increase net rental income by Pounds 4.25m during a
full year.
However, Mr Richard Peskin, chairman, said that demand for space from
tenants was still patchy. 'Tenant demand is sporadic. Although, with
development activity still low across the industry, we are optimistic that
rental growth is on the horizon,' he commented.
Net rental income for the six months to September 30 rose from Pounds 40.1m
to Pounds 44.8m. Only 3 per cent of the portfolio remains unoccupied,
reducing rental income by about Pounds 2.75m.
The company has continued to dispose of unlet space. Its vacant development
at 39-41 Charing Cross Road was sold for more than Pounds 5m, 20 per cent
higher than book value.
The rights issue raised Pounds 95m. At the half-year stage, gearing stood at
62 per cent, although the property portfolio is only revalued at the year
end. Mr Peskin said he would be comfortable with gearing of up to 90 per
cent if acquisition opportunities arose.
The company's main development project is 160 Great Portland Street, London,
where it is building 80,000 sq ft of office space behind an existing facade.
The building should be ready for occupation next autumn.
After refurbishment costs and administration expenses, operating profits
were Pounds 39.8m (Pounds 35m). Net interest charges amounted to Pounds
19.2m (Pounds 18.6m) and earnings per share were 5p (4.3p).
The interim dividend is increased to 2.9p (2.7p); the company intends to pay
a final dividend of 5.85p, making a total for the year of 8.75p, against 8p.

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Stagecoach pays Pounds 8m for Scottish bus
holding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stagecoach, the UK's largest bus group, yesterday announ-ced its eighth
acquisition of 1994, with the Pounds 8.3m purchase of a 20 per cent stake in
SBH, the holding company for Strathclyde Buses, Scotland's leading bus
operator, writes Simon Davies.
Stagecoach will pay Pounds 1.5m cash, with the remainder in new shares. In
addition, it is to sell SBH 18 new buses, which Stagecoach had previously
considered using on new routes in Glasgow in direct competition with its new
partner.
Mr Derek Scott, finance director, said: 'We have made no secret of the fact
that we need to be in the major urban areas of Britain.'
He said the SBH tie-up could open the way for a larger stake at a later
stage, but that SBH might alternatively consider a flotation, providing a
potentially profitable exit for Stagecoach.
SBH was formed from a management buy-out from Strathclyde Council in 1993,
and it recently expanded through the Pounds 11.3m purchase of Kelvin Central
Buses, a large competitor in Glasgow, creating a group with Pounds 86m
annual turnover.
The group owns 1,330 vehicles and employs 3,700 staff. SBH said it
approached Stagecoach, as it was looking to raise capital from the sale of a
minority stake, so that it could compete with the larger listed groups while
retaining independence.
However, the Office of Fair Trading said it would look into the deal, given
Stage-coach's position as Scotland's third largest bus operator. There is an
ongoing OFT inquiry into the SBH takeover of Kelvin.

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: James Dickie doubles as margins improve
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Acquisitions and reorganisation in the previous period underpinned a strong
full-year performance at James Dickie, the engineering components
manufacturer.
On turnover ahead 31 per cent to Pounds 21.7m, pre-tax profits for the 12
months to August 31 doubled from Pounds 678,000 to Pounds 1.35m.
The shares rose 11p to 166p.
Mr Hugh Jack, chairman, said the company also benefited from increased
volumes at its main customers. Margins improved despite continuing
difficulties in passing on costs.
The order book was well ahead on a year-on-year basis: 'Management is
investigating ways of overcoming capacity constraints which we may come up
against later in the year if our order book continues to grow further,' he
said.
A proposed final dividend of 2.5p brings the total to 3.5p (2p), covered 4.4
times by earnings of 15.3p (8.4p) per share.
The company intends to move from the USM to the Official List.

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Dublin expansion lifts Break for the Border
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
August's Pounds 5m acquisition of Marino helped lift pre-tax profits at
Break for the Border Group, the restaurateur and nightclub operator, from
Pounds 140,000 to Pounds 259,000 in the six months to September 30.
Turnover expanded from Pounds 1.95m to Pounds 3.46m.
Mr Robert Gunlack, chairman, said that in their first two months within the
group, Marino's Dublin outlets had traded successfully, contributing
operating profits of Pounds 254,000 and 'fully justifying the directors'
expectations at the time of acquisition'.
The integration of the Dublin operations, including the introduction of an
improved system of financial and operating controls, was proceeding smoothly
and yielding immediate benefits, he added.
Sales in Dublin in October and the first two weeks of November were in line
with sales in August and September, Mr Gunlack said.
Sales for the group's London outlets in October continued to be affected by
the partial closure of the Argyll Street cafe.
However, the refurbishment was now complete and party bookings were
currently significantly higher than last year.
Fully-diluted earnings per share advanced from 1.04p to 1.49p and the group
is paying a first interim dividend of 0.33p.

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Fleets of cash boxes on wheels - Simon
Davies analyses the bus companies' race for acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's biggest bus groups are involved in a race against time.
Declining passenger numbers mean that - in the absence of initiatives to
encourage urban public transport - acquisitions are the easiest route to
meaningful profits growth.
The fragmentation of the old government-owned National Bus Company into 90
new companies in 1987 has been rapidly reversed by the private sector.
Stagecoach yesterday made its 10th acquisition in a year, at a total cost of
Pounds 120m.
Many analysts believe that by the turn of the century there will be four or
five large operators, assuming they avoid political backlash over the
creation of private monopolies.
The source of pressure for acquisitions was underlined by the latest
Department of Transport statistics, issued last week. These showed a decline
in passenger numbers every year in the past decade, in spite of efforts to
improve efficiency and service since privatisation.
The most up to date figures, charting the year to April 1994, show a fall of
105m in the number of passenger journeys to a total of 4.37bn. This is 23
per cent down on the 5.65bn journeys undertaken in 1984.
Given this unhelpful macro-economic picture, operators have had to focus on
controlling costs and buying less efficient operators. The four listed bus
companies have responded with enthusiasm, making 20 substantial acquisitions
in the past year.
This has proved fortunate for the government, as it coincided with the
privatisation of the 10 London bus operators. Nine of these have been sold,
with four going to listed companies and the remainder to management
buy-outs.
Mr Martin Higginson, economic adviser to the Confederation of Passenger
Transport, says: 'The listed companies are making acquisitions because
profits from the core businesses cannot expand rapidly.' However, given the
increased muscle of the listed companies, bargains are hard to come by. As
Mr Higginson says, 'those who made a move in the earliest days of
privatisation got good bargains. Now, they are having to pay fair market
value.'
The operators argue that there are substantial efficiencies to be stamped on
an industry with decades of public sector fat, and that takeovers are the
best means of advancing the efficiency drive.
Buses are cash boxes on wheels, with predictable revenue streams and a cost
base which offers big economies of scale.
By renewing the fleets, new management has been able to reap the benefits of
buying in bulk, and of reduced maintenance costs on vehicles.
The extent of this trend was demonstrated by bus manufacturer Trinity
Holdings, which in the first half of the year received Pounds 33m of orders
from Stagecoach and Badgerline, the two largest listed bus companies.
Badgerline plans to buy 450 buses a year in 1995 and 1996 to replace ageing
buses that are in turn sold on to developing countries at or above book
value.
Management structures have been simplified and employment agreements
renegotiated. The net result has been a leap in profits, with all the listed
companies expected to announce profits growth above 50 per cent this year.
However, acquisitions have provided the main thrust for increases and Mr
Brian Souter, chairman of Stagecoach, expects that 'there will be a flurry
of acquisitions which will go a bit further and then fizzle out'.
Recent management buy-outs of bus groups will probably become targets for
acquisition at a later stage, but the prices are rising.
Mr Souter says there is potential organic growth left in bus companies
through management efforts to improve fleet usage, routes and the quality of
service.
He also suggests that UK companies should look beyond the Channel. 'In the
longer-term, the overseas markets are where the privatisation bargains are
going to be.'
Growing competition is making life harder for the bus companies and politics
could create further difficulties.
The Office of Fair Trading has already launched a number of investigations
into potential monopolies within the bus system. Stagecoach, the largest UK
operator with close to 12 per cent of the market, has borne the brunt of
these, with 20 investigations by the OFT since 1989 and three adverse
rulings.
The recent scuffle in Darlington - where the council-owned operator went out
of business, complaining that Stagecoach had 'swamped' the city with free
buses - suggests that political concerns over competition will remain.
The bus companies counter that competition comes from the car and that this
will ultimately dictate ticket prices, rather than the existence of other
operators.
At the same time, they are hoping that the government will help tilt the
playing field against the motorist.
The recent Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution favoured a push to
persuade motorists to convert to public transport. The government has also
spoken in favour of such a strategy, although little has yet been done.
But the great hope of the bus operators is that growing congestion in the
cities will force action. There are already signs of local government
initiatives to improve bus services, such as bus lanes. But it will take
much more to reverse the trend of declining passenger numbers.
Mr Ballinger, managing director of Go-Ahead, said: 'Ultimately we see our
future in the urban areas, where we see changes in policy inevitably
arising.'
However, management will soon start to face the increasing challenge of
eking out growth from static revenues.

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Relaunch paying off at upbeat First Choice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in First Choice Holidays, the former Owners Abroad group which
re-launched itself in August in an attempt to regain market share, rose 2p
to 121p yesterday following an upbeat statement from the company.
In an announcement issued prior to an analysts' visit to its key operational
centres at Gatwick and Manchester today, Mr Francis Baron, chief executive,
said: 'We are very encouraged with the performance of the group since the
launch of our new brand structure.'
First Choice estimated that its market share in the period since the
relaunch had been more than 15 per cent. 'We are comfortably on track to
meeting our stated objective of a minimum 1 per cent increase in market
share for the year,' Mr Baron commented.
The group's share of the summer market had fallen from 16 per cent in 1992
to an estimated 12 per cent this year prior to the relaunch.
Mr Baron said yesterday that summer 1995 bookings had remained strong in a
weak market. The group had now sold 275,000 holidays for next summer,
representing a 30 per cent increase over last year, while market share was
currently exceeding target.
Mr Baron said that after a slow start, winter bookings for the UK market had
picked up well and the group had sold 245,000 holidays - a 4 per cent
increase. This programme, launched in May, is still under the old brand
structure.
The summer 1994 programme ended in line with expectations, with total
passengers 1 per cent lower at 1.6m.

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Export growth lifts European Colour by 64%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
European Colour continued its pattern of more than doubling pre-tax profits
with a 64 per cent rise from Pounds 521,000 to Pounds 856,000 for the six
months to end September, making the fifth successive half year of
organically generated growth.
Turnover was up from Pounds 7.75m to Pounds 8.51m.
Mr Henry Finchett, chairman of the chemical colour manufacturer, said much
of the growth had come from 'concentrating upon Europe'. This had 'generated
29 per cent sales growth' and taken exports to more than a third of
turnover.
Earnings per share came out ahead at 1.9p (1.16p) and the interim dividend
is increased to 0.575p (0.35p).

The group, which holds 3 per cent of Scantronic shares, said it had 'no

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: US automotive recovery helps Wilshaw to
Pounds 2.24m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recovery in the US automotive industry helped lift interim profits at
Wilshaw, the specialist metals and distribution group, by 65 per cent.
The company announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.24m (Pounds 1.36m) for the
six months to September 30, on turnover up by 26 per cent to Pounds 22.6m
(Pounds 18m).
Mr Guy Askham, chairman, said increased demand for magnets in cars helped
the specialist metals division to more than double operating profit to
Pounds 989,000 on turnover of Pounds 7.73m.
The company is spending Pounds 500,000 building a new facility to
manufacture bonded magnets for computers, electronics and small electric
motors.
The distribution division, which sells tractor parts, reported operating
profits up 40 per cent to Pounds 1.61m on turnover of Pounds 12.2m.
In April the company acquired Agripieces, the French distributor, for Pounds
1.75m in shares. This contributed Pounds 290,000 operating profit.
Earnings per share rose to 1.62p (1.05p).
The interim dividend is raised from 0.2p to 0.25p.

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: UK housebuilding rise behind Marshalls
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Marshalls, the West Yorkshire-based building materials
group, jumped by 40 per cent from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 15.9m in the six
months to September 30, assisted by a sharp rise in UK housebuilding.
Increased investment in commercial and industrial construction as the UK
economy improved also helped first-half sales, said Mr Andrew Marshall,
chairman.
About a quarter of group turnover, which rose by 22 per cent to Pounds
124.8m (Pounds 102.2m), is generated by the UK and US housing market,
including sales for repair and maintenance.
UK housebuilders, which started work on 12.5 per cent more homes during the
first nine months of this year compared with the corresponding period in
1993, have been winning market share in a generally sluggish UK housing
market.
The increased activity has enabled building materials producers to raise
prices for some products, particularly bricks, while increased sales volume
has assisted margins.
Marshalls' share price rose 6p to 146p yesterday on the profits
announcement, which followed a 64 per cent increase at the pre-tax level in
the previous 12 months.
The interim dividend is increased from 1.25p to 1.5p. Earnings per share,
fully diluted, rose from 4.72p to 6.5p.
UK operating profits from stone and concrete products, mainly for paving and
flooring, rose by 30 per cent to Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 9.78m). The division
was helped by a 20 per cent rise in turnover, of which price increases
accounted for only a small part.
US losses for stone and concrete declined from Pounds 240,000 to Pounds
58,000 helped by 'useful sales' from the Florida-based Paver Systems.
UK clay products profits more than doubled from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 3.42m
helped by a sharp rise in brick prices and higher sales.
Net debt at the end of September stood at Pounds 13.5m, equivalent to
gearing of 10.4 per cent.
COMMENT
Marshalls' share price had out-performed the sector by 30 per cent prior to
yesterday's results. It is a well run company, but will find it very hard to
maintain recent growth rates. UK margins are already at the top end,
although they could rise a little more, but further significant improvement
may depend on increased sales volume - or perhaps an acquisition or two,
given the strength of the balance sheet. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 30m would
put the shares on a prospective p/e of more than 11.5, which is rich enough
for the time being.

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: CE Heath hit by direct line costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of entering the direct line insurance business and accounting
vagaries at an Australian associate depressed profits at CE Heath for the
six months to the end of September.
The pre-tax figure fell from Pounds 14.9m - inflated by a Pounds 3.25m
exceptional item - to Pounds 6.37m. Turnover on continuing operations was
little changed at Pounds 81.5m (Pounds 81.5m).
Heath's Premium Search telephone broking business incurred losses of Pounds
1.6m during its first four months of operation, with Mr Peter Presland,
chief executive, forecasting that the full-year deficit would be about
Pounds 4m. He anticipated that the business, which is likely to employ up to
400 people, would move into profit in 1996.
Mr Presland denied that the company had left it too late to enter the direct
line market. 'There is a big market out there for this kind of service and
it is going to get bigger as more and more people look for their insurance
needs away from the high street.'
CE Heath International Holdings, the group's Australian associate in which
it holds a 23 per cent stake, saw its profit contribution drop from Pounds
6m to Pounds 1.2m. The company blamed the fall on the halving of its stake,
and Australian accounting rules which make the company reflect all
investment gains and losses in its profit and loss account.
Losses from the New York underwriting business widened from Pounds 450,000
to nearly Pounds 1m, although the company added that the subsidiary's book
of agricultural business had been sold and the losses would not recur.
Profits from the computing services division rose 26 per cent to Pounds 2.7m
(Pounds 2.14m).
Earnings per share dropped 46 per cent to 5.9p (10.9p). The interim dividend
is maintained at 5p. The shares rose 13p to 232p.
COMMENT
Heath's chunky dividend, currently yielding nearly 9 per cent, should limit
any downside for the shares. However, in the short-term it is difficult to
see where any sustained earnings growth is likely to come from. With its
broking operations under pressure, underwriting contributions declining and
the direct line service in its formative stages, it is only the fairly
limited contribution from computer services which can be counted on. Worth
holding for the yield, and on the off-chance a predator might swing into
view.

<TEXT>
Shares in Sims Food Group climbed 6p to 87p yesterday as the meat processor
and supplier turned losses of Pounds 1.26m to pre-tax profits of Pounds
1.21m in the six months to September 30.
Strong demand in the fast food sector helped to lift sales by 4 per cent on
continuing activities, although overall turnover fell 10 per cent to Pounds
134m (Pounds 149m).
Mr John Stone, chairman, reported that 'we are enjoying improved trading
conditions in all our divisions as input prices have eased and consumption
has increased'.
The Milton Keynes-based company reported retail sales up 9 per cent to
Pounds 88.8m, following a 40 per cent reduction in slaughtering capacity
last year.
Volumes at the core wholesale hamburger business rose 10 per cent to lift
manufacturing sales 9 per cent to Pounds 16.4m.
The catering division reported sales down 14 per cent at Pounds 23.7m, as
meat costs rose higher than expected.
Earnings per share were of 2.1p, compared to losses of 3p. The interim
dividend is maintained at 2p.

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Restructuring charge hits BOC - Decline to
Pounds 253m despite strong growth in gases division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp rise in gas prices and volumes in the final quarter helped BOC's
turnover increase by 8 per cent in the year to September 30. However, an
Pounds 85m restructuring charge and a Pounds 16.6m loss on disposals left
pre-tax profits down at Pounds 253m, against Pounds 338m.
Mr Pat Dyer, chief executive, said the economic climate was right for more
gas price increases in the US. US gases plants were running at close to full
capacity and some competitors had been rationing products.
Group turnover advanced to Pounds 3.48bn (Pounds 3.24bn) generating
operating profits of Pounds 435m (Pounds 421m). The gases division accounts
for 71 per cent of sales and achieved a 9 per cent increase in operating
profits to Pounds 332m, with a fourth quarter gain of 20 per cent to Pounds
88.2m.
Increasing sales volumes had raised profit margins. Most of the price of
each extra bottle of gas sold goes straight to the bottom line because
capital costs changes little with output.
Mr Dyer said that average prices had fallen slightly because customers were
on contracts that offered discounts for higher volumes.
He added, however, that the recent surge in US prices indicated that there
could be price rises elsewhere in 1995.
BOC's second biggest division, healthcare, continued to suffer from the
expiry this year of patent protection on the anaesthetic gas Forane. Its
market share in the US had fallen from 'almost 100 per cent' to less than 35
per cent and the price had fallen by more than one-third.
Healthcare's turnover fell 2 per cent to Pounds 568m (Pounds 577m) and
operating profits dropped 37 per cent to Pounds 54.6m (Pounds 86.2m).
Mr Dyer warned that further competitors were likely to challenge Forane
within months. Forane's replacement, Suprane, continued to grow and had 35
per cent of the US market.
The healthcare division's performance in Europe was hurt by a product recall
of Suprane vaporisers, costing Pounds 5m by the year end.
The company's third division, vacuum and distribution, registered strong
growth thanks to the buoyancy of one of its main customers, the
semiconductor industry.
Turnover grew by 20 per cent to Pounds 435m and operating profit increased
55 per cent to Pounds 51m.
The exceptional charge, announced in January, left earnings per share at
23.82p (42.97p). Excluding the charge, earnings were 43.87p.
BOC announced 1995 dividends of 12.4p for each half, to make a total of
24.8p - a 7 per cent increase.
BOC shares rose 10p to close at 720p.

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Y-TT head calls for joint Channel 5 bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ward Thomas, chairman of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television, yesterday
appealed to the ITV companies to make a joint bid for the new Channel 5.
Although individual ITV companies are limited to a maximum stake of 20 per
cent, there is apparently nothing in the rules to prevent them making a
joint bid.
'I think the most sensible thing would be if a consortium of ITV companies
combined to bid for Channel 5. The BBC has two channels. Why not ITV?' Mr
Thomas asked.
The Yorkshire chairman also announced a return to profit for the company in
the second half after serious problems last year with its advertising sales.
In the current 15-month period, pre-tax profits for the six months to
September 30 were Pounds 4.7m, cancelling out a Pounds 4.6m loss in the
first half and leaving profits for the year at Pounds 111,000 (Pounds 7.9m
losses). Turnover amounted to Pounds 225m (Pounds 237m) generating operating
profits of Pounds 59.9m (Pounds 35.8m) for the 12 months.
Mr Thomas, who has made it clear he would like to be part of a Channel 5
application, said Yorkshire's advertising revenue was starting to grow.
The Yorkshire chairman also said he had tried to persuade the government to
privatise Channel 4.
'I am one of those trying to encourage the government to think about the
privatisation of Channel 4,' said Mr Thomas, who added that Pounds 1.5bn
could be raised. This could mean Pounds 1bn for the government and the rest
could be used to reduce the total bid money ITV must pay to the government.
Privatisation, however, seems unlikely.
Yorkshire, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a 14 per cent
stake, said the drive to cut costs continued. It had cost of sales and
operating expenses of Pounds 81.6m in the second half, down from Pounds
94.8m, while programme sales remained strong.
'We will produce for anybody. That is where our business can expand and why
we have to be cost effective,' Mr Thomas said.
Earnings per share for the six months amounted to 6.2p and for the 12 months
to 0.1p (11.1p losses). At the end of the 15-month period to December 31 the
directors will give 'serious consideration' to proposing a dividend.
The shares rose 6p to 395p.

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: St James's Place 17% ahead at Pounds 16.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
St James's Place Capital, the financial services group run by Lord
Rothschild and Sir Mark Weinberg, turned in half-year pre-tax profits 17 per
cent higher at Pounds 16.5m, against Pounds 14.1m.
However, net assets per share showed a decline from 86.3p at the year-end to
84.1p, although this was an 8 per cent improvement from the 77.5p of a year
ago.
In volatile market conditions, profits from dealing in investments jumped
from Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 10.6m, reflecting the group's management of
its short-term investments. However, profits of Pounds 9.7m from the holding
portfolio of investments, the group's longer-term play, were turned into
losses of Pounds 2.2m as the market indices turned down.
Fund management income more than tripled to Pounds 3.2m (Pounds 1m).
In the life assurance business, Scottish Amicable has taken over the
administration of J Rothschild International Assurance. The group said that
it was 'actively seeking further marketing arrangements with banks and other
institutions' in a number of countries.
Plans to set up a new venture to buy and manage life assurance companies,
announced in September, were being advanced. SJPC is putting up some Pounds
30m of the Pounds 100m capital fund for Life Assurance Holding Corporation,
with a further Pounds 40m coming from New York Life and Scottish Amicable.
The remainder is being sought from other institutions.
Mr Ron Bell, chief accountant, said that with the volatility and uncertainty
surrounding the world's bond and equity markets, the company preferred to
concentrate its investments on specific companies rather than exposure to
markets in general.
Earnings per share fell 27 per cent to 4.3p (5.9p).
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p.

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Rap to float with likely Pounds 17m tag
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two former BTR directors are bringing a rubber and plastics distributor to
the market next month which is expected to be valued at about Pounds 17m.
Rap, which distributes industrial products such as hoses, gloves, gaskets
and uniforms, is hoping to raise about Pounds 4.6m in an institutional
placing. About Pounds 2.1m of the net proceeds will be used to redeem
preference shares and the balance will provide working capital to fund
expansion largely through acquisition.
Rap's chief executive is Mr David Emmett, former general manager and
director of BTR Farington, and joint leader of Rap's management buy-out from
Haden MacLellan Holdings in 1991. He is joined on the board by Mr Lionel
Stammers, former joint head of BTR's European division, who is a
non-executive director.
Since the buy-out, Rap has increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 496,000 in
1991 to Pounds 1.22m in 1993. Sales have risen in the same period from
Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 19.3m. However, the sharp rise in profits and sales
was helped in part by acquisitions in 1993.
In its pathfinder prospectus published yesterday, the group forecast pre-tax
profits for 1994 of not less than Pounds 1.7m.
The company said sales had increased largely because of greater activity in
its market sectors. Margins had improved through operating efficiencies.
Rap trades from 23 outlets, which are mainly close to industrial areas. Its
businesses include distribution of industrial and safety products, supply
and servicing of conveyor belts and import and wholesale of gloves.

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BSkyB says piracy could undermine float
confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television consortium, has admitted
in a High Court affidavit that piracy could undermine confidence in its
flotation unless rigorously tackled.
Last week BSkyB was granted a High Court injunction, under copyright
legislation, against Mr Bill Leach and Mr Russell Craven, trading as BSB
Electronics.
The small electronics company was alleged to have been using regional
newspaper advertisements to sell a device it was claimed could switch on
BSkyB smart cards whether the holder had paid their subscriptions or not.
Another blocker device was claimed to be able to prevent the satellite
company deactivating the cards.
The largest proportion of BSkyB's revenues are earned by broadcasting
channels, such as Sky Sports, which can only be viewed by subscribers who
have a card to unlock the signal.
The BSkyB case was that unless the defendants were stopped, the satellite
company, in which Pearson, owners of the Financial Times currently holds
17.5 per cent, would suffer 'substantial and unquantifiable loss'.
This was spelled out in the affadavit as:
a loss, perhaps accelerating, of current and potential subscribers;
the possible loss of agreements and intended agreements with independent
broadcasters;
possible loss of confidence in BSkyB's impending flotation. BSkyB's
pathfinder prospectus, valuing the company at between Pounds 4bn and Pounds
4.6bn was published on Monday.
The legal document also says that BSkyB has come across a few examples of
pirate 'period 9' cards - the more sophisticated cards introduced in May to
wipe out piracy.
The cards were knocked out by signals broadcast over the air.
Ms Sharon Southwell-Gray, BSkyB's deputy head of legal affairs, says in the
document that some of the individuals and companies involved in piracy have
sophisticated resources. 'I believe it is only a matter of time before
pirate period 9 cards become available,' she conceded.
In its pathfinder document, BSkyB says pirate devices range from counterfeit
cards to 'blockers' designed to upgrade genuine cards.
The directors say they are not aware of counterfeit cards still functioning,
and add that blockers were not in wide circulation.
Apart from over-the-air anti-piracy measures, BSkyB would continue to
replace its cards periodically.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A winding up order was issued on November 9 against Waterglade International
Holdings, the property development group, its directors announced yesterday.
Liquidators will be appointed shortly to the subsidiaries.
Shares in Waterglade were suspended on October 10. On October 19 the
directors reported that a rescue plan was impossible, given the group's
financial situation.
Liabilities are Pounds 29m. The directors do not anticipate that any funds
will be available for shareholders.

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Hydro gets Pounds 10.5m value from placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The placing shares in Hydro International, which is coming to market, have
been priced at 80p, valuing the maker of control systems for storm water
control and sewage separation at about Pounds 10.5m.
Some 4.63m shares are being placed by Allied Provincial Securities. Of
these, 4m are new and the balance are being sold by Mr Tim Lamb and Mr Bob
Smisson, founding directors and chief executive and deputy chairman
respectively.
Mr Lamb and Mr Smisson are being paid dividends totalling Pounds 200,000,
conditional on the listing. The board does not intend to declare a dividend
for the year to December 31: subsequently a dividend policy will be
introduced 'broadly reflecting growth in the group's underlying profit'.
Of the Pounds 2.75m raised in the placing, some Pounds 2.3m is to be used
marketing Hydro's products, investing in information technology,
constructing a further test facility, and recruiting additional staff,
particularly in research and development.
Mrs Elizabeth Kennedy, a director in Allied Provincial's corporate finance
department, said that Hydro was a development type company, though not a
'blue sky' company, in that it has patented products bringing in revenue and
profit. In 1993 it made Pounds 156,000 on Pounds 4.1m turnover and in the
six months to June 30, profits were Pounds 154,000 on Pounds 2.4m turnover.
She said that the pricing therefore fell between what the company thought it
was worth and what the institutions were prepared to pay. Ten 'mainline'
institutions have taken shares, including Scottish Amicable, Friends
Provident and Legal &amp; General.
Mrs Kennedy said Dollars 3.7m (Pounds 2.25m) orders from Columbus, Georgia,
had acted as one of the triggers behind Hydro's decision to come to market.

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: De La Rue advances to Pounds 73m - Record
banknote production behind better than expected 10% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Record banknote production helped De La Rue, the security printer, payment
and transaction systems group, report better than expected interim profits
yesterday.
Pre-tax profits increased by 10 per cent to Pounds 72.8m in the six months
to September 30, up from Pounds 66.1m a year earlier when profits were
boosted by a Pounds 9.5m exceptional profit on the sale of the group's
Brazilian operations.
In the wake of the announcement analysts upgraded their full-year profits
forecasts and the shares closed up 31p at a new high of Pounds 10.34p.
The results were underpinned by a 20 per cent increase in operating profits
to Pounds 52.2m on turnover from continuing oper-ations up 21 per cent to
Pounds 324m
Pre-tax profits were also helped by higher net interest receipts of Pounds
6.9m (Pounds 5.7m) and a significant increase, from Pounds 7.3m to Pounds
13.7m, in the share of profits of De La Rue Giori, the group's Swiss-based
banknote printing equipment associate.
Mr Jeremy Marshall, chief executive, said the results, 'demonstrated De La
Rue's strengths across all our sectors'. He said banknote production was at
a record for a half year with strong demand from a broad range of customers.
The security printing continuing operations contributed Pounds 31.2m (Pounds
24.9m) to operating profits on turnover of Pounds 130m (Pounds 89.9m),
buoyed by an unusually high volume of 'bonanza' banknote printing undertaken
on behalf of countries which had been unable to meet demand from their own
state-owned presses.
The group also generated sales of Pounds 25m for work completed on state
printing works projects, although it said it was taking a conservative
approach to recognising profits from this source.
The transaction systems division, which made profits of Pounds 4.5m (Pounds
2.5m) on turnover of Pounds 41.3m (Pounds 29.7m), also had 'a very
encouraging first half'.
Profits from the payment systems operations, which sell cash handling
equipment, edged ahead to Pounds 16.5m (Pounds 16m) on turnover of Pounds
155m (Pounds 149m).
Earnings per share increased by 13 per cent to 28.1p (24.8p). Excluding
non-recurring items, earnings advanced by 32 per cent. The interim dividend
is raised by 17 per cent to 7p (6p).
COMMENT
With the exception of the payments systems division, De La Rue's results
were impressive - even though they benefited from a number of atypical
factors. Second half growth is unlikely to match that achieved in the first
six months, but full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 150m now look possible,
producing earnings of about 57.6p. Profits from the mature core businesses
should be solid over the next few years, but the group's performance in the
longer term looks less certain. Without a large acquisition it could be
difficult to maintain the momentum. Such concerns have yet to be reflected
in the shares which are trading on a prospective p/e of 18 and have
outperformed the FT-SE-A All-Share index by 35 per cent this year.

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help lift Sedgwick to Pounds
78.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sedgwick, the international insurance broker, yesterday announced increased
pre-tax profits of Pounds 78.7m in the first nine months of 1994, buoyed by
acquisitions and good growth in its international retail broking business.
Pre-tax profits for the first nine months of 1993 were restated at Pounds
66.1m. Earnings per share increased from 8.8p to 9.1p.
Total brokerage and fees rose to Pounds 663.3m in the first nine months,
against Pounds 551.2m. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, an underlying
increase of 1 per cent in brokerage and fees was matched by a underlying
increase of 1 per cent in expenses.
Mr Sax Riley, chief executive, said underlying growth in retail brokerage
and fees had been maintained at an annual rate of 5 per cent or more in
North America, Europe and the Asia/Pacific regions.
However, overcapacity in the London insurance market and competition from
overseas had curbed the performance of Sedgwick Payne, the group's
specialist insurance operation. Brokerage and fees at Sedgwick Payne showed
only a modest increase to Pounds 134.2m (Pounds 133.9m) in the first nine
months.
Mr Riley said Sedgwick's attempts to broaden the range of consultancy
services it can offer and reduce the proportion of commission-based income
were on course.
Sedgwick Noble Lowndes, including the employee benefits consultancy the
group acquired last year, reported underlying pre-tax profits of Pounds 14m
in the first nine months.
The group's results were broadly in line with expectations and Sedgwick's
shares closed unchanged at 147p.
Pre-tax profits in the UK increased to Pounds 37.5m (Pounds 30.1m).
Continental Europe also saw an increase to Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 7.5m). There
was a slight dip in US profits to Pounds 28.3m (Pounds 29.5m).

FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Reasons why float had to be pulled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BrightReasons, the owner of Pizzaland, has become the latest new issues
casualty.
The company announced yesterday that its share offer would be 'delayed'.
Its brokers had advised that the shares would have to be offered at a price
that its management was not prepared to accept.
The decision follows the sudden postponement of the share offer for New
Look, the women's wear chain, after fund managers had shown limited interest
in the offer.
BrightReasons had planned to raise about Pounds 35m from investors in an
offer that would have valued the group at between Pounds 60m and Pounds 80m.
The money was to have paid down debt built up in expanding restaurant
chains, which include Pastifico, Prima Pasta and Pizza Piazza.
Despite the recent stock market recovery, brokers UBS Securities advised
that this valuation was not possible.
BrightReasons was adamant that it was in no hurry to float and that the
issue would go ahead once market conditions were more favourable. The
company's said its recent trading performance had been 'extremely strong'.
It has been a difficult period for new issues. This year has broken records
for both the number of companies and the size of offerings. However, a
number of flotations have been followed by disappointing trading statements
and institutional interest has waned.
Property group London Capital Holdings was the first issue to be pulled, in
May. It was followed by a number of others, including British Printing
Company, Life Style Care, General Cable and Telewest, which has recently
resuscitated its share offer.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Volvo recovers on surge in sales: Truck and car operations
spearhead group recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo, Sweden's biggest manu-facturer, yesterday reported a 12-fold leap in
profits in the first nine months of the year. Surging sales for its cars and
trucks and big capital gains consolidated the company's dramatic recovery
from recession.
Pre-tax profits reached SKr12.7bn (Pounds 1.3bn), compared with SKr1.06bn in
the same period last year, as sales rose to SKr112.2bn from SKr73.5bn.
The result was boosted by the inclusion of BCP, the food and drinks group
now fully-owned by Volvo, which added SKr15.2bn to group sales and SKr1.6bn
to group operating profits of SKr6.6bn.
The bottom line was also inflated by SKr4.2bn earned by the sale during the
period of non-core assets, in line with Volvo's strategy of concentrating on
motor vehicle production following the breakdown last year of a plan to
merge with Renault of France.
But both the car and truck divisions continued a significant recovery under
way throughout this year, driven by growing demand in their main US and
European markets. Volvo managed to bring its new flagship 850 car model and
FH truck series on to the market just as recession in its main markets was
coming to an end.
Unit car sales rose 18 per cent to 269,600, pushing up the value of sales to
SKr52.8bn from SKr39.8bn and producing a leap in operating profits to
SKr1.95bn, from SKr10m.
Truck sales, benefiting from a recovery in demand in all main markets except
Germany, grew faster, with worldwide unit sales rising to 49,400, a jump of
38 per cent over the same period last year. Sales totalled SKr37.3bn,
compared with SKr27bn, while operating profits rose to SKr2.7bn from
SKr183m.
However, Mr Soren Gyll, chief executive, struck a warning note. 'While the
improvement in earnings in our core operations is gratifying, it is not yet
adequate,' he said.
He expressed satisfaction with the truck performance, saying the operating
margin stood at 7 per cent. But he warned that the car division, with an
operating margin of 4 per cent, had been held back by higher costs caused by
a change in production and foreign exchange hedging which restricted the
benefits from the devaluation last year of the Swedish krona.
'A doubling (of car division profits) is required. An operating margin of 7
per cent is judged to be adequate for continued expansion,' Mr Gyll said.
He also said that the strong demand for trucks and cars had led to delays in
deliveries of as much as six months as Volvo hit capacity ceilings. 'We are
working hard to correct this problem,' he said.
Volvo is investing SKr390m to raise truck capacity to 50,000 a year outside
the US by next July.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Inflation is not dead but has moved elsewhere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is long-run price stability here at last? HSBC's London chief economist
Roger Bootle is celebrating with a 70-page study called The End of the
Inflationary Era. Because HSBC Greenwell is one of London's leading bond
houses he can be excused for trumpeting favourable news for fixed income
investors. But his arguments may be in some respects misleading.
He seems to be overimpressed by the recent inflationary slowdown in the UK
and in one or two other former black spots for price stability such as
Australia and Italy. But looking more broadly at western economies the real
breakthrough was achieved in the mid-1980s, when average consumer price
inflation in the Group of Ten countries fell to 2.3 per cent in 1986. Only
this year has inflation declined to that level.
German inflation has deteriorated and that in the US has barely improved,
although in countries such as Japan and Canada, inflation has fallen to
levels where it is effectively non-existent.
With the global economy now growing rapidly there is a risk of another
cyclical upswing in inflation. Last time the UK and Sweden led the way with
inflation of around 10 per cent in 1990, and even Switzerland spoiled its
image with 6 per cent.
Elsewhere in the world inflation is as prevalent as ever. It is running at
27 per cent in China, and at hyper-inflationary rates in parts of eastern
Europe and Latin America. How can we be sure that the infection will not
spread, perhaps stimulated by rising commodity prices?
Bootle cites various powerful economic trends, such as rapid technological
progress, growing competition from Third World manufacturers and chronic
labour surpluses in the western economies. These are all interesting themes.
But are they really responsible for eliminating persistent postwar
inflation? Bootle surely underplays the monetary indicators which in the
past have been crucial in signalling inflationary risks.
It was the link with gold that kept the value of money steady over the
centuries. After the second world war inflation was persistent rather than
rapid, despite the significant inflationary potential of the post-gold
Bretton Woods system. The main reason for the moderation was that credit
creation was firmly controlled in most countries. Once that changed in the
1970s the genie of inflation was out of the bottle.
Recessions in the mid-1970s and early 1980s cooled the fever, but countries
that subsequently suffered renewed credit binges let the side down: the UK,
the Nordic countries, at one stage the US, also Japan; and eventually
post-unification Germany lost its grip, too, in the early 1990s.
Most of these later credit excesses have boosted financial asset prices
rather than general inflation. Asset price surges are readily reversible, so
there has been a painful banking hangover and private sector indebtedness
remains high. In 1986, when general inflation was low, broad money growth in
the US, Japan and the UK was surging at between 9 and 16 per cent. Now the
money growth is 2 to 5 per cent. This is the clearest pointer that low
inflation is here to stay. Any worries now focus on Germany.
Both borrowers and lenders have learned expensive lessons from the excessive
reliance upon short-term credit during the 1970s and 1980s. There has been a
increase in the role of the long-term capital markets, both by governments
and industry. In the US, in particular, sections of banking activity - such
as mortgage lending - have been extensively securitised. It is these trends
which inflation-watchers need to track, rather than developments in
technology or inflows of cheap goods.
Capital markets are restricted, however, by their reliance on finite flows
of savings, whereas banking systems can create new credit almost without
limit. The global recovery has therefore quickly come up against resistance
from high real interest rates.
The danger signals will come if bond market financing is seen to have become
too expensive, in which case there may be increasing resort to banks and in
particular to the monetisation of public sector debt.

FT  16 NOV 94 / PowerGen boosts dividend by 27%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PowerGen, the electricity generation company, yesterday provided a fillip
for shareholders, including the government, by announcing an interim
dividend rise higher than expected, at 26.6 per cent.
Shares in the company rose 8p to 559p. National Power which announced its
half-year results on Thursday, also rose, by 7.5p to 502p.
PowerGen said it had benefited during the half year from a 3 per cent
increase in national electricity demand and 'above average' performance of
its two new gas-fired power stations.
Market share was higher than expected, at 24.5 per cent, although for the
first time in any half Nuclear Electric, the state-owned company, produced
more electricity than PowerGen.
PowerGen also announced an agreement had been finalised to make it the lead
project developer for a 900MW gas-fired power plant in Portugal.
It also ruled out more buy-backs before the government's sale in February of
its 40 per cent stakes in PowerGen and National Power.
'The market conditions are not right,' said Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive.
This is likely to be welcomed by some potential investors who would have
viewed with anxiety the effect of buy-backs on the share price in the run-up
to the 40 per cent share sales.
The dividend rise to 5p (3.95p) for the six months to October 2 comes at an
awkward time politically as the Labour Party has gone on the offensive over
some payments to shareholders by privatised companies.
PowerGen's 9.3 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 118m (Pounds
108m) would have attracted little attention but the dividend rise will fuel
criticism of the industry.
PowerGen said that the dividend rise was partly due to its previously stated
policy of decreasing dividend cover to between 2.5 and 2.7 times and partly
due to introducing a more 'appropriate balance' between dividends in the two
halves of the year.
Mr John Rennocks, finance director, said: 'There is no intention to increase
the full-year payout by the same amount.'
Mr Rennocks said market share next year would be 'markedly below' 25 per
cent.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Boots buys back Pounds 508m of shares: Retailer free to
consider acquisitions as unions seek assurance on sale of arm to BASF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boots, the retailer, yesterday spent Pounds 508m on buying back its shares
on the stock market. The sum represents 60 per cent of the money it hopes to
receive from the sale of its prescription drugs business to German chemical
company BASF.
The share buy-back leaves Boots' management free to concentrate on
acquisitions in over-the-counter (non-prescription) drugs, probably in
Germany. 'We are in talks with many companies and merchant banks,' said the
company. Once the BASF sale is completed, Boots will have about Pounds 500m
in cash, although it refused to say whether this had been earmarked for its
acquisition programme.
The buy-back came as BASF sought to reassure employees of their future under
new ownership. Boots trade unions had feared that BASF, which has a drugs
unit of its own, would seek to cut costs by trimming the division's
5,750-strong workforce, of which 1,600 are in the UK.
BASF said it wanted to integrate the Boots operations in collaboration with
Boots management. 'We are not simply saying 'You must march in our
direction',' it said.
Mr Ernest Bullimore, a regional organiser for USDAW, which represents about
2,000 Boots employees in Nottingham, the company's home town, said: 'It's
inevitable there will be job losses. Manufacturing is the area where we're
going to have the losses.'
From what the union had gleaned, he added, 'the German company is keen to
take on the research and development but whether they'll want to take on all
the manufacturing isn't clear'. Yesterday BASF said 'it would not be a
surprise for us to have R&amp;D in the UK'. There are 575 Boots R&amp;D staff in the
UK and another 295 in other countries.
Boots will tell union officials on Friday that 'virtually all' the
pharmaceuticals division's employees will be transferred to BASF and that
the Germany company will decide on their long-term future.
The interests of Boots smaller shareholders had prompted it to buy back
shares rather than pay a special dividend. A dividend would 'simply have
transferred cash to shareholders, favouring those institutions who are tax
exempt. The buy-back favours all shareholders,' said the company.
New light was shed yesterday on Boots' thinking behind the decision to sell
its prescription drugs business to BASF rather than a management buy-out
team. BASF was in a position to move quickly, while there were some doubts
at Boots over the financing structure for the City-backed MBO team. Boots is
understood to have feared that talks with the MBO consortium would have been
'protracted'.

FT  16 NOV 94 / MAM calls halt to accepting 'soft commissions'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury Asset Management, the UK's largest fund management company, has
decided that from next January it will no longer accept 'soft commissions' -
free goods or services - from brokers it agrees to channel business through
around the world.
MAM's move comes as regulators in the US, UK and Hong Kong are scrutinising
the rules on soft commissions out of concern they can lead to a subtle form
of bribery which harms the interests of the clients on whose behalf funds
are managed.
Fund managers may pay more for securities than they ought to in order to
generate the agreed level of business.
In the UK, the move is likely to heighten pressure on MAM's competitors to
adopt a similar stance as pension fund clients seek greater transparency in
fees they pay to their fund managers.
'We have seen and very much felt the move towards clean fees,' said Mr Colin
Clark, marketing director at MAM. He said that MAM has taken a tough line on
soft commission for several years and that the value of services which they
receive under soft commission arrangements is 'under Pounds 2m' per year.
Imro, the UK self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, has
recently issued a discussion document which proposes restricting the types
of goods and services which fund managers can accept under soft commission
arrangements.
'Regulators internationally have felt there was scope for abuse around the
boundaries,' said Mr Robin Clark, director of monitoring at Imro. 'It is one
thing to accept (soft commissions) for research and another for travel to
warm sunny climates,' he said. Earlier this year, Imro fined a division of
Abbey Life for allowing its fund managers to accept free travel to the US
and Asia under soft commission arrangements. Under soft commission
arrangements, brokers agree to the provision of such things as research,
performance measurement services, Reuters or Bloomberg screens in exchange
for a fund manager's guarantee that a minimum amount of business will be
executed through the firm. Soft commission services are typically those
which fund managers would normally have to pay for out of their own pocket.
It would be considered an abuse to use soft commissions to pay for office
furniture, rent or entertainment expenses.
Imro intends to issue guidelines banning fund managers from accepting
certain goods and services paid for by commissions with strings attached.
In Hong Kong, where the use of soft commissions is widespread, the
Securities and Futures Authority has provoked outcry among the broking
community by announcing it would undertake a similar review of soft
commission arrangements. The US has recently increased disclosure
requirements for mutual fund managers who accept services with strings
attached and is under pressure to do more.
A difficulty is enforcing restrictions on foreign business.

The Stock Exchange's plan for a junior stock market risks being undercut by
a rival scheme unveiled yesterday by the European Association of Securities
Dealers. The main difference is that the EASD plan is commercially
motivated. Since its backers will be required to risk their own capital, it
will be marketed vigorously. EASD is already targeting entrepreneurial
groups across Europe. The Stock Exchange plan for an Alternative Investment
Market, by contrast, was a response to the outcry when it decided to close
the Unlisted Securities Market. So far AIM has no clear focus, beyond being
a home for companies unsuitable for the exchange's main market. There may,
of course, be room for both markets. But the bigger question is whether
there is room for either. EASD has shown that companies want to raise
capital through such a market. Now it must convince shareholders to invest
through it.

FT  16 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Buy-backs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 500m spent by Boots buying back its shares may look large. But
given that the group is due to receive Pounds 850m from selling its
prescription drugs business and is highly cash-generative, the sum is
actually quite modest. Boots should end the current financial year with
nearly Pounds 600m net cash. Even so, it is something that Boots has acted
at all. Too few British companies - Reuters and most regional electricity
companies being the notable exceptions - have been prepared to shrink their
equity bases and so boost earnings per share. In the US, companies regularly
buy back shares even when already geared. Buy-backs are less common in the
UK partly because institutional investors are not as aggressive in pushing
for them. But part of the explanation is also that rights issues can be
nerve-racking for companies: since raising equity is traumatic, it is not
surprising that managements are reluctant to hand it back.

FT  16 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: BOC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The slow, steady progress of industrial gas companies tends to look less
than exciting during a cyclical upturn. During the fourth quarter, operating
profits at BOC's core gases operations rose an underlying 13 per cent, a
modest increase compared with the rest of the chemicals sector. That helps
to explain the company's 15 per cent underperformance against the sector
over the past two years.
But the qualities of gas companies start to shine near the peak as cyclical
companies' earnings growth decelerates. BOC's steady progress should be
sustained long after that despite continuing price pressures. BOC has been
aggressively cutting costs and busy improving its product mix. But most of
the earnings growth will be driven by strong volumes. The industrial gas
market expands almost twice as fast as GDP and BOC is heavily exposed to the
fast-expanding Asian economies.
The stock is at a price earnings premium to the market for 1995 of about 20
per cent. In the near-term BOC has little chance of outperforming. But its
resilience will look increasingly attractive by 1996 when the market's
earnings growth is expected to slow to about 5 per cent.
BOC's biggest headache remains its pharmaceuticals business which is small,
risky and provides no compelling synergy with the rest of the group. There
is no urgency to dispose of the operation because its new anaesthetic drug
should compensate for the decline in its old product. The long-term danger
is that like Boots and Fisons it will find little significant in the
research and development pipeline. If the right price is offered, BOC would
do well to exit.

FT  16 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Chrysler
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kirk Kerkorian's call for higher dividends and an end to anti-takeover
defences at Chrysler is unlikely to presage a bid for the company. Mr
Kerkorian's move seems motivated less by the desire to flush out a predator
than by frustration with the valuation accorded the group's stock. Despite
its earnings recovery, Chrysler's shares have performed poorly this year and
now stand at only four to five times expected earnings for 1995. This p/e
ratio is about a third of the average for US companies - too low even
allowing for the highly cyclical nature of the automotive industry.
At issue is the way in which the group's management disposes of the
plentiful cash generated as the industry nears its peak. Mr Kerkorian would
like more to be transferred to the company's owners. Dividends have yet to
return to the level of the late 1980s. Insofar as pressure from Mr Kerkorian
induces a more generous pay-out policy, perhaps accompanied by a share
buy-back, it is to be welcomed by investors. The management's desire to
husband cash is prudent. But with Dollars 6.6bn of liquid assets at the end
of the third quarter the company can afford to be more generous. Mr
Kerkorian is also right to criticise the bid defences in place at Chrysler.
Given its record, Chrysler's management need have nothing to fear from a bid
 -and should have no qualms about dispensing with 'poison-pill' defences.

FT  16 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Red meat for the markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The bond and currency markets have been demanding red meat. Yesterday the US
Federal Reserve gave it to them. The 75 basis point rise in interest rates
may not have been the full one percentage point that many wanted, but it was
more than the 50 basis point rise that almost everybody expected. The Fed's
action should help slow down the US economy, so minimising the risk of
inflation taking off. The size of the increase also means the Fed will
probably have a reasonable chance of delaying further rises beyond the end
of 1994.
The immediate reaction from the markets was positive; the yield on the long
Treasury bond ended the day down slightly at 8.047 per cent. Other markets
across the globe are likely to take their lead from Treasuries. The dollar's
current value should be underpinned and bond yields outside the US fall.
Equities should be carried higher too. Still, one wonders whether the
positive mood will last. So far this year, the markets have taken the view
that the Fed has acted too little too late to combat inflation. Unless they
are convinced that the Fed is now 'ahead of the curve', they will be back
for more red meat before long.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Fears over share security deter investors in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fears that factory officials may tamper with share registers are emerging as
an impediment to foreign investment in Russia.
The head of a leading western fund manager said the custody of shares by
factory bosses 'is the single largest deterrent to western investment'.
She added that big investment banks were keen to expand in Russia but not
without 'proper settlement and custody of shares'. Russia was the worst of
the world's emerging markets in terms of offering investors security for
their share purchases.
The sole document that establishes ownership over shares in Russia is the
register of shareholders in a particular privatised enterprise. Legally,
share registers of companies with more than 1,000 shareholders must be held
by independent registrars, but many of Russia's largest companies directly
control their own registers.
'It is a totally insecure system,' said one western investment banker in
Moscow. 'It goes without saying that there's a conflict of interest when the
factory controls the shareholders' register.
Foreign investors are concerned that the system is being abused by factory
directors who might be tempted to rid themselves of unwanted new owners by
deleting them from the share register.
Mr David Reuben, president of Transworld, the London-based company which
dominates the Russian metals' trade, alleges share tampering took place last
week at the Krasnoyarsk Aluminium Smelter, one of the world's largest
aluminium producers.
'The 20 per cent stake in the company (which could be worth as much as
Dollars 300m) owned by our proxies was simply erased from the register,' Mr
Reuben claims. 'The Russian law is a complete disaster. Shareholders are
completely at the mercy of the factory managers.'
According to Mr Vladimir Lysyn and Mr Sergei Sukholinski-Mestechkin, Mr
Reuben's Moscow business associates, the alleged share tampering became
clear last Tuesday, when they travelled to Krasnoyarsk for a shareholders'
meeting. Mr Lysyn says that when he and his colleague arrived at the factory
gates they were turned away by armed guards and told their names no longer
appeared on the register.
Mr Sergei Petrushin, director of the securities department at the
Krasnoyarsk Aluminium Smelter, confirmed that the shares held by
Transworld's proxies had been struck from the share register, which is
directly controlled by the factory. But he contended that the shares had
been improperly purchased in the first place.
'We made a mistake in May by including them in the share register and now we
have corrected it,' he said.
Russian bankers say this insecure share registry system has spun off a
mini-industry in the sale of shares by brokers who do not actually own them.
The unfortunate buyers learn they have been deceived only when they try to
add their names to the official register and discover that either the broker
or the vendor does not exist.

The Budget is set to make the leap from battered despatch box to information
superhighway.
Scarcely will Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, have sat down after
delivering his speech on November 29 than the full text of his remarks will
be ready to speed round the globe courtesy of the Internet, symbol of the
wired society.
The Internet, a semi-official, self-regulating system of networks which
connects about 7,000 databases and 2m computers, is emerging as the de facto
information superhighway.
Up to 25m people worldwide will be able to tap into Treasury computers,
examine the chancellor's arguments in detail and download paragraphs that
interest them. Most Internet users are in the US, but more than 1m Britons
now have the computer, modem and software which guarantees them access to
the world's largest computer network.
The Treasury was vague about the number of people who might benefit from
access to Mr Clarke's words at the speed of light. But it thought some
Internet users were academics, researchers or accountants with an interest
in UK fiscal policy.
The Budget on the Internet is one of the first consequences of a Treasury
plan to use the latest technology to promote more open government.
The Treasury intends to publish news releases, ministers' speeches, minutes
of the chancellor's monthly meeting with the governor of the Bank of England
and reports from the panel of independent forecasters (the 'Wise Men') on
the Internet as a first step towards more comprehensive public exposure.
The service will be free of charge and available to anybody with Internet
access.*
The chancellor will not be able to follow suit. He has access to the
Internet neither at home nor at the office.
The Daily Telegraph launched an electronic version of its newspaper
yesterday. The Electronic Telegraph is available on the Internet from 7am
every day.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Reynolds voices 'deep regret' in attempt to save coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday launched a
last-ditch attempt to hold on to his premiership by expressing 'deep and
genuine regret to the Irish people' over the mishandling of a child abuse
case that has led to a crisis for his Fianna Fail-led coalition.
His undertaking that the bungled extradition of the priest accused in the
case 'will never be allowed to happen again in this country' bought a
24-hour delay in a confidence vote now scheduled for today.
As Mr Reynolds' Labour party partners last night considered whether to
accept his explanation, the future of the 22-month-old coalition hung in the
balance.
Mr Reynolds' future depends largely on the response today of his deputy, Mr
Dick Spring, the Labour leader and foreign minister, who is considering
joining opposition parties to force a general election.
This would come at a critical point in the Northern Ireland peace process as
the UK and Irish governments are working on a framework document to provide
a durable constitution for Ulster. While the paramilitaries' ceasefire has
held for 10 weeks, their participation in the political process is by no
means assured.
In an atmosphere of tense expectation in the Dail, Mr Reynolds attempted to
appease Labour concerns over his appointment of Mr Harry Whelehan, the
attorney-general who allegedly delayed the priest's extradition, as
president of the High Court. In a special debate, he fell short of an
outright apology to Mr Spring but said he was committed to restoring trust
with his Labour partner.
Mr Reynolds urged the House not to let 'a single judicial appointment'
jeopardise 'the biggest breakthrough in Northern Ireland in 25 years'.
In an appeal to Mr Spring, the prime minister paid tribute to the Labour
leader's role, affirming that 'the success of these negotiations will
underwrite the future of this country and history will record Dick Spring's
essential contribution to that success'.
Labour party backbenchers responded with disappointment. In spite of Mr
Reynolds' announcement of immediate reforms in extradition procedures, they
felt he had not adequately explained the attorney-general's seven-month
delay in extraditing the priest involved in the case.
Labour left the House early to evaluate Mr Reynolds' statement. Mr John
Bruton, leader of Fine Gael the main opposition party, accused Mr Reynolds
of acting as 'a political bully' in the row.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Mr Greenspan takes charge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sensible it may have been. Surprising it was not. With the Congressional
elections now behind him, few doubted that Mr Alan Greenspan would decide to
raise US interest rates at yesterday's Federal Reserve Open Market Committee
meeting. In the end, he did a little more than many expected.
The three-quarter point rise in both the discount rate and the rate on
Federal funds - the largest increase since 1980 - will not please everybody.
But Mr Greenspan is not there to please. He is there to keep inflation
broadly stable, as the US recovery matures. To date, there is little to
suggest that he has got much wrong.
The Federal Reserve chairman is attempting a difficult feat with highly
imperfect tools. Mr Greenspan would like to engineer a 'soft landing' for a
healthy economy, now well into its fourth year of expansion. The five rate
rises since the beginning of the year, which preceded yesterday's change,
have so far failed to bring the annual rate of growth in real GDP, currently
3.8 per cent, to the 2.5 per cent historically associated with stable
inflation.
News of another rise in factory operating rates in October did little to
dispel investors' belief in the economy's underlying vigour. Before
yesterday, they have increasingly condemned Mr Greenspan's efforts as
lethargic, especially in light of persistent downward pressure on the
dollar. Yet the fact that interest rate changes have most of their effect a
year or two after the event makes this judgment a lot easier to assert than
to prove.
Mr Greenspan has been slower to raise interest rates in the current upturn
than his predecessor in the early 1980s. But, if one were judging by history
alone, one would have to call this year's tightening pre-emptive.
There is only anecdotal evidence of a pick-up in consumer prices, which grew
at an annual rate of 3 per cent in September, little above its cyclical low
of 2.7 per cent. Growth in the narrow measure of money supply, one of the
more useful forward predictors of inflation during the 1980s, has fallen
steadily over the past year, to a mere 1 per cent annual rate.
This anaemic narrow money growth has come with stronger expansion of lending
and rapid job creation. Clearly, many of the old rules for gauging future
inflationary pressures no longer apply. Unfortunately for Mr Greenspan, he
has had to improvise, before an unusually attentive - and critical -
audience in Washington and the financial markets.
Over the past several decades, the real rate on Federal funds has averaged 2
per cent. Yesterday's rise - the largest single increase Mr Greenspan has
sanctioned in his career as Federal Reserve chairman - took it significantly
above that level, for the first time this cycle. It is unlikely to be the
last increase that Mr Greenspan is required to make in the months ahead.
With luck, however, his uncharacteristic decisiveness will curb future
inflation as well as his market critics.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Timely escape from the sidings: British Rail privatisation
is getting back on track after the signalworkers' strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The little train was quite exhausted. He had only a very little coal left in
his boiler. When that was gone he would not be able to travel any further.
He would just come to a stop, until someone came and pushed him into a
siding, where he would get older and older and rustier and rustier and
nobody would remember him.
Seven months after British Rail began implementing the legislation intended
to privatise its activities, many travellers and some would-be investors are
beginning to wonder if BR faces the same gloomy fate as the hero of Graham
Greene's story The Little Train.
BR privatisation appeared to have been shunted into a siding after this
summer's signalworkers' strike highlighted the losses that train operators
could suffer through disruption in the rail network. The lack of visible
progress in shaping a railway fit for life in the private sector added
further to that appearance.
But appearances deceive. Talk to the BR managers busily preparing to mount
management/employee buy-outs of the companies that run trains and a very
different picture emerges. Visit one of the numerous conferences arranged to
explain the privatisation process and the attendance list attests to the
strong interest from the commercial sector. There is a lot going on behind
the scenes, and continued interest from potential investors.
The government has set the managers in charge of privatisation a demanding
timetable. Nearly 100 businesses are up for sale over the next two to three
years. These range in estimated value from around Pounds 1m, for the small
manufacturers of timber sleepers and concrete bridge beams, to between
Pounds 2bn and Pounds 4bn for all three of the companies that will lease
rolling stock to train operators.
Mr David Blake, managing director of the 20-strong BR unit in charge of the
sales, acknowledges the timetable is challenging. But he hopes that the five
merchant banks working on the sales will find buyers for its heavy
maintenance workshops, Red Star and the Freightliner container business by
next March.
The 14 companies that carry out track maintenance and repairs - with
combined sales of more than Pounds 1bn and a workforce of 30,000 - should
all be in the private sector by December 1995.
But many hurdles remain before it will be possible to describe the
privatisation as a success.
The profit and loss accounts of the first businesses to be put up for sale
revealed some unexpected horrors, previously hidden inside BR's byzantine
accounting systems. For example, when the Red Star parcels business was
first put up for sale in June 1993, it revealed losses of Pounds 9m on a
Pounds 43m turnover. Not surprisingly, it failed to find a bidder and has
since undergone a thorough restructuring in preparation for sale by the end
of December.
And the signalworkers' strike has almost certainly dashed hopes of an early
flotation on the stock market for Railtrack, the BR company set up to
operate the track and most stations. With an estimated market capitalisation
of Pounds 3bn-Pounds 3.5bn, the company would be one of the top 100 quoted
companies and join the FT-SE 100 Index.
The government still hopes for a flotation before the next election. But
Railtrack is the part of BR that causes others in the business the most
concern, thanks to its power to impose unreasonable charges and conditions
on those who wish to run trains on its tracks.
Mr John Swift QC, the rail regulator, is currently consulting the industry
on the access agreements to be signed between Railtrack and train operators.
It is clear that he sees the need for curbs on Railtrack's monopoly.
He questions the Treasury's method of valuing Railtrack's assets, with
100-year-old viaducts having been valued on a modern replacement basis. He
also challenges its requirement for a return on those assets of 5.1 per
cent, rising to 8 per cent, when commercial rates of return have been
falling in line with lower inflation. Railtrack may be charging too much for
access because of these rules, he implies, burdening the train operators
with higher costs.
Until the framework for track charges is finalised, it will be hard to
proceed with privatising BR's passenger train businesses. They are to be
privatised by selling franchises to run passenger services for periods
expected to run for between seven and 10 years.
Franchising allows the government to bring private sector disciplines into
the passenger railway while maintaining government subsidies to businesses
that will struggle to make a conventional profit. But it imposes a hideously
complex task on Mr Roger Salmon, the former merchant banker who is director
of passenger rail franchising. He now has to negotiate the myriad contracts
between the different players in the industry, including the train
operators, the rolling stock leasing companies and Railtrack.
Mr Peter Field, managing director of South West Trains, estimates that he
has paid his lawyers for 3,000 hours of work on the 200 legal agreements he
needs to operate trains services in his region. It is clear that moving from
a single monolithic railway system, where procedures are controlled by memo
and the rule book, to one of contracts between independent companies is
proving time-consuming.
Mr Salmon says his task is to ensure that the risks of running a railway are
shared fairly and that the companies involved have sufficient performance
incentives. His ideal is a set of 'self-policing' agreements, which
encourage the parties to work together to solve problems rather than
resorting to the courts.
He aims to ensure that the sale of the first half dozen companies is
completed by the end of 1995, with more than half of the passenger railway
network in private hands by April 1996.
He hopes that the train operating companies should be able to present
potential investors with their first set of audited accounts, covering the
12 months ending March 1995, in the middle of next year.
Although it will be some months before the passenger franchises are formally
offered for sale, the current managers, for the most part long-term BR men,
are eager to ensure that their companies emerge the victors when the
franchises are put up to competitive bidding.
After many years spent juggling their costs they now see an opportunity to
exert, for the first time, a significant influence on their revenues.
ScotRail, for example, has launched a promotional campaign which should
provide up to 1m customers with free or reduced price travel. South West
Trains has upgraded its London to Southampton service to a 20-minute
'shuttle', while Gatwick Express has signed up the airlines to sell its
tickets before the plane even lands at Gatwick.
But while the operators see this as a way of creating closer links with
their customers, critics of rail privatisation fear it is further proof of
the risk of breaking up the national network. Gatwick Express has already
been taken to task by Mr Swift for favouring its services above those of its
two competitors at Gatwick station.
For the designers of the new railway age, one of the main aims of the
contracts that they are now drawing up is the prevention of fragmentation.
Their grand project is the engineering of a structure and system that will
ensure that decentralisation works - that the railways perform as an
effective whole. This, they hope, will remove the need for costly changes
later, when the private sector makes its bids for, or is actually running,
the railways.
Only a system that can achieve a balance of risk and market strength between
the near 100 companies that will provide railway services after
privatisation will remove the danger of some parts of BR, at least, ending
up rusting in the sidings.

This is either taking recycling too far, or shows remarkable insouciance in
the face of adversity. Some of Ukraine's increasingly worthless interim
Karbovanets banknotes are now being turned into toilet paper.
A Dnipropetrovsk papermill - about 500km east of Kiev - is turning 35 tonnes
of old banknotes into loo-rolls every month. One dollar currently fetches
about 135,000 karbovanets on the streets of Kiev, against 50,000 in
mid-September. 'We get top quality paper from the banknotes. Only the colour
 -blue, pink or green - gives away what it once was,' says Vladimir
Vereshchak, the mill's director.
It no doubt gives a cynical population some measure of satisfaction, anyway.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Apparently Malaysia has a problem with stray dogs. About 1m of them are
plaguing life, despite the official extermination of 205,000 since 1990. Dog
bite cases rose from 73 in 1990 to 95 in 1992, with two human fatalities in
the last year.
Grim stuff. But things are not that much better back in the UK, where the
problem is not so much stray dogs as an exploding rat population. The 1993
National Rodent Survey - carried out by the Chartered Institute of
Environmental Officers - shows that since the last survey, 20 years ago, rat
infestation has grown by 40 per cent.
Nice to know that something has prospered under the Tories.

The Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum in Indonesia hardly set the
world alight, despite the presence of more than 500 hacks and assorted
national leaders. But Indonesian president Suharto did manage to pull one
trick.
Bogor, the site of the conference, is known for its downpours and the
president was worried that Apec's great and not-so-good might get drenched
when lining up for some serious photo-opportunities. So a rain man, or
pawang hujan, was hired, and told to pray for dry weather.
Sure enough, Bogor's skies were grey but there were no downpours. 'We told
him (the pawang) that if it rained we wouldn't pay him,' said an Indonesian
official. Better than some incentive schemes on offer in the vicinity.

Heaving Helmut Kohl back on to his throne as German chancellor yesterday was
easier said than done.
In order to avoid any last-minute slip-ups, deputies were ordered to report
at 9am sharp, an hour before the Bundestag vote. Six erstwhile missing
deputies made it in time for the vote.
One almost didn't. A pale Roland Richter, a new CDU deputy, careered into
the Bundestag at 10.44 - two minutes before voting ended. He apparently
looked a good deal paler after Wolfgang Schauble, the party's parliamentary
leader, had finished with him.

Douglas Hogg has at least two reasons to celebrate his wife Sarah's stepping
down as head of prime minister John Major's policy unit.
Douglas, a minister of state at the foreign office, will be delighted that
Sarah will now occasionally come home; her Downing Street work frequently
occupied as many as 16 hours a day.
And maybe his own career will get a boost. Hogg never had a chance of a seat
at the cabinet table while Sarah was in Number 10: too nepotistic.
But if the attorney general, Sir Nicholas Lyell, gets chopped as a result of
the Scott report on the arms-to-Iraq affair, Douglas must be in with a
chance.
Along with Sarah goes Jonathan Hill, Major's political secretary. But the
shadow of Sir Tim Bell, Baroness Thatcher's image-maker and chairman of PR
firm Lowe Bell, still looms. Hill was previously a Lowe Bell employee; he is
returning there as a consultant.
Hill's post is being taken by Howell James - one of Bell's closest friends.
And when he was at Capital Radio, James employed Bell's wife, Virginia.
Nice to see Major sticking by family values.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Observer: Hands off Argentina
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Today Argentina gets out the red carpet for the UK's Duke of York, the first
official royal visitor since the end of the Anglo-Argentine Falklands war in
1982.
Prince Andrew, a helicopter pilot in that war, today re-inaugurates in
Buenos Aires a statue of 19th century British statesman George Canning,
which had its hands lopped off by anti-British protestors in 1982, when the
statue itself fell.
Disagreement lingers over what exactly happened to the statue, once toppled.
The British say Canning was stored away. Argentina's federation of war
veterans says the 'great English thief' was 'deposited in the murky waters
of the River Plate as an act of repudiation against British imperialism'.
And what of Canning's hands? Have the originals been re-affixed, or are they
tucked away in a Buenos Aires apartment? 'You can rest assured that it will
not be a statue without hands,' is the signal from the Foreign Office.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are various reasons why the government of one sovereign state might
wish to give Pounds 234m to that of another, as the UK promised Malaysia it
would in 1989.
There might be general considerations of foreign or trade policy: Malaysia
is a country of growing wealth and influence, whose government, headed by a
notoriously prickly prime minister, has important contracts in its gift.
That gives Britain an interest in keeping him sweet. Or again there might be
a specific interest in securing a particular contract, in this instance a
Pounds 1.3bn arms deal. We know that such a linkage was explicitly made in a
protocol signed, but subsequently repudiated, by Lord Younger, then defence
secretary.
The UK's modest overseas aid budget, however, has a more restricted
application. An act of parliament says that the primary purpose of money
disbursed under this heading must be the economic benefit of a foreign
country or welfare of its people.
That still allows a considerable latitude. The Malaysian government claims
to be convinced that the Pergau dam will benefit the country and add to its
people's welfare. The British government could, in theory, have agreed. How
ministers must wish that Sir Timothy Lankester, then permanent secretary at
the Overseas Development Administration, had done just that, instead of
advising the foreign secretary, then as now Mr Douglas Hurd, that funding
the dam was an abuse of the aid programme.
It is rather to their credit that Sir Timothy's career does not seem to have
suffered: he now heads the much larger Department for Education. But his
authoritative view on Pergau remains on file, and last week the High Court
decided that in overriding it Mr Hurd broke the law.
There the matter should have ended. Clearly Britain cannot now get out of
paying Malaysia the money it has promised. Equally clearly, that money
should not come out of the meagre aid budget, which is badly needed for more
deserving causes. It must come from somewhere else - the obvious place being
the defence budget. So much of this is already devoted to keeping British
arms manufacturers in business that an extra Pounds 234m would hardly be
missed, whereas that sum could still meet the basic needs of quite a few
people in the world's poorest countries.
Alas, that conclusion is apparently not so obvious to British ministers.
Treasury officials, presumably so instructed by their political masters, are
now examining a scheme whereby the payment to Malaysia would come out of the
Treasury's contingency fund, and the ODA budget would be cut by a
corresponding amount. Thus the letter of the High Court's judgment would be
respected, its spirit flagrantly and deliberately ignored. Such is the
humility and respect for the law which Conservative politicians have learnt
during 15 unbroken years in office.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Personal View: Better deal for personal pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WARWICK LIGHTFOOT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year's budget is expected to introduce greater flexibility over when
people with personal pensions in the UK must buy an annuity, probably by
allowing them to postpone the purchase until the age of 75 rather than on
retirement.
It would be better to remove the obligation to buy an annuity altogether.
This would transform personal pensions into a flexible savings vehicle for
retirement, similar to the American individual retirement account, and would
give people greater choice.
Whether an annuity is an appropriate investment for an individual depends on
factors that are impossible to forecast: how long a person will live, the
rate of inflation, and the future performance of investment portfolios.
The income from an annuity is initially greater than the income from a
conventional portfolio. This reflects actuarial assumptions about mortality
rates and the use of capital. In effect, early deaths finance higher initial
benefits.
Inflation, however, erodes the real value of an annuity. The cost of
indexing an annuity is expensive.
Even if prices are stable, economic growth and rising returns on equities
mean that, over 10 to 15 years, the return on an investment portfolio will
overtake the income from an annuity. The combination of inflation and
economic growth has a lethal effect on the relative attraction of opting for
an annuity. But under present pension rules, you do not have a choice - you
have to buy an annuity.
Also, you have no control over the capital and an annuity dies with you.
There is nothing left for your heirs. If you live a long time, you benefit
from the flow of annuity payments, but you will not be able to dispose of
capital before or after your death. This does immense damage to the dignity
and independence of very elderly people.
The official rationale for the annuity rule is threefold. First, the Inland
Revenue is anxious to tax the capital sum. This is reasonable, given that it
is accumulated tax free. The principal reason for retaining the annuity rule
at 75 appears to be the Revenue's tax concerns.
The Revenue is familiar with taxing annuities; it has had virtually 200
years' experience of doing so. It is possible to find alternative
arrangements to tax the accumulated sum without obliging people to buy an
annuity. Excess pension contributions are already, for example, taxed at 35
per cent.
The second reason for the annuity rule is the social security department's
concern that people who have received tax relief should not be in a position
to 'blow' the accumulated capital and end up on income support. Obliging
people to take an annuity prevents that from happening.
But this concern can be resolved by requiring people to retain sufficient
capital in a segregated account to generate enough income to keep them off
income support. The annuity rule is not necessary. The proposals in Social
Security Secretary Peter Lilley's pensions white paper demonstrate that it
is irrelevant. This is because people will be allowed to defer the annuity
until they are 75, but will only be able to take out an annual income
equivalent to that of an annuity.
The third justification, however, is that an annuity is the only way of
guaranteeing someone an income until death. This is based on the premise
that, even where individuals make seemingly adequate provision to support
themselves through an investment portfolio, the returns may prove erratic.
This argument ignores problems such as credit risk, timing and the level of
interest rates that attach to annuities.
It also neglects the impact of inflation, which can result in a person who
lives for a long time ending up needing income support anyway. Someone in
their 90s, for example, who retired with an annuity equivalent to male
average earnings - a remarkable achievement, given that pensions are only
normally expected to provide around two-thirds of final salary - would now
be living on the princely sum of Pounds 1,000 a year.
The Revenue's instinct is that there is something wrong with people having
the freedom to choose how to invest funds that have been accumulated in a
tax-privileged form. Instead, they ought to do what the Revenue thinks best
and finds most convenient.
It is a profoundly collectivist reflex. Like all collectivist approaches, it
has the effect of impoverishing the people it is intended to assist and, by
depriving them of control over their capital, it contributes to a lack of
dignity and independence in old age. The chancellor and the secretary of
state for social security should go the whole hog and end this iniquitous
actuaries' tontine.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Apec and Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is it plausible that the mixed bag of countries represented at the summit of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum will actually attain 'free and
open trade . . . no later than 2020'? The answer must be no. Yet the fact
that they have even made this commitment is intriguing.
The question is what precisely has been decided. Apart from the broad
commitment to liberalisation and the call for specific proposals to be
advanced next year, there is only the agreement that industrialised
countries should liberalise by 2010 and the rest by 2020. All else remains
obscure.
What, for example, is meant by free trade or by Apec's 'opposition to the
creation of an inward-looking trading bloc that would divert from the
pursuit of global free trade'? How can liberalisation be pursued within the
region, while ensuring that the result is 'not only the actual reduction of
barriers among Apec countries but also between Apec economies and non-Apec
economies'?
Any kind of discriminatory arrangement within so large a part of the world's
economy would be undesirable. Why, for example, should Malaysia discriminate
against Bangladesh in favour of the US? Yet non-discriminatory
liberalisation within Apec would almost certainly be impossible, because of
the concern about free-riders. The only escape from the dilemma would be
global negotiations. But it would be unsatisfactory for such negotiations to
be launched only after Apec had already decided its own position, since the
rest of the world would then be presented with a 'take it or leave it'
negotiating pos-ition.
The right way for any global negotiation to proceed is globally. Ideally,
therefore, Apec should be a catalyst for global negotiations and neither a
substitute for such negotiations, nor an independent forum. The only outside
entity capable of insisting upon this is the EU. But, first, it must commit
itself to that notion and, more broadly, to engagement with the rising
economies of East Asia.
Before that, the EU has to ratify the Uruguay Round, something that should
now be possible after yesterday's ruling by the Court of Justice on the
powers of the Commission and the member states. If the EU is to be an
effective negotiator, it will also have to develop a modus operandi for
negotiations in areas of mixed competence. If nothing else, the outcome of
the Apec summit should encourage it to do this swiftly. Otherwise it may
find itself ignored, because it will be judged too intractable a negotiating
partner.
The promising aspect of Apec is the momentum it should impart to global
liberalisation. How that momentum will, and should, be guided is, however,
obscure. The essential prior step is ratification of the Uruguay Round. Then
the priority must be further global progress. It is up to the EU, as the
major player outside Apec, to give voice to that wider interest.

FT  16 NOV 94 / The hard work is still to come: Kohl must control a
fractious coalition government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY and MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At 11.13 yesterday morning, a hush fell over Germany's Bundestag. Mrs Rita
Sussmuth, the speaker, had returned to her seat. 'Look, there go the flowers
 -he's made it,' a cameraman whispered. Seconds later Mr Helmut Kohl rose
out of his front row seat to acknowledge an ovation from the massed ranks
behind him. There was not a flicker of emotion from the opposition benches.
Mr Kohl had made it. By the skin of his teeth - with just one vote more than
the 337 he needed to have an absolute majority in the 672-seat assembly - he
had been elected chancellor for a fifth term.
That was the easy part. The tough time is still to come. For the next four
years, Mr Kohl will have to keep control of a tired and fractious coalition,
with a majority of just 10 votes in the Bundestag, and a hostile majority in
the Bundesrat, the second chamber of the German parliament where the 16
states are represented.
He must do so with a budget that is already seriously overstretched, a
continuing drain of funds to support the collapsed economy in east Germany,
and a soaring public debt burden that is set to exceed DM2,000bn, or some 62
per cent of gross domestic product, in 1995.
Much of what Mr Kohl intends to do is spelt out in his agenda for the coming
legislative period, a 49-page document agreed in record time between his
Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its more conservative Bavarian sister
party the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the Free Democratic party (FDP),
since they won their narrow victory in the October 16 general election.
The focus is clear: it includes reducing the budget deficit, cutting public
expenditure and creating jobs to counter the rise in long-term unemployment
in west Germany as well as the east.
But implementing this agenda may well expose the cracks in the coalition,
particularly since the government's majority now depends on its weakest
partner: the FDP, led by Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, saw its
support slump from 11 per cent to 6.9 per cent in the election and now needs
to assert its independence to regain support. Tax reform, and the whole
effort to reduce the budget deficit, may prove the first test.
The previous government's medium-term fiscal plan envisaged a decline in the
deficit from 4.4 per cent of GDP in 1993 to less than 1 per cent of GDP in
1998. Such a reduction would lead to a decrease in the public debt ratio,
from the peak of 62 per cent in 1995 to 57.5 per cent in 1998. This would
allow Germany to fulfil the requirements for entering the European monetary
union.
Mr Thomas Mayer, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank,
says 'this desired deficit reduction would require keeping the annual
average increase in total government expenditures to 2.4 per cent in
1995-1998', compared with a predicted nominal growth rate of 5.25 per cent a
year over that period.
That will be tough enough to achieve. But the need for expenditure restraint
will be greatest for the 11 west German states, to allow for above-average
spending growth of the five east German states to fund high infrastructure
and social spending. Since most of the states are dominated by the
opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), Mr Kohl will be forced to strike
bargains with the Bundesrat to push through all the cuts he needs.
The FDP is already chafing at the re-imposition of the so-called solidarity
surcharge from next January 1, a 7.5 percentage point addition to income tax
designed to raise an estimated DM28bn for investment in eastern Germany.
This will curb the deficit, which Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister,
admits will still total DM64bn this year.
But in keeping with its liberal, tax-cutting traditions, the FDP tried to
negotiate a deadline by which the surcharge would be scrapped. It had to
make do, instead, with an annual review, and the issue is certain to strain
relations between the coalition partners. 'How long can the taxpayer
tolerate high taxes?' asked a liberal deputy.
The SPD, for its part, is already challenging the coalition's other taxation
policies. The biggest bone of contention is the way in which the government
will finance an increase in the income tax threshold - demanded by the
federal constitutional court - so that no tax is paid below subsistence
level. Achieving this means a rise in tax-free income from DM5,060 to
DM12,000, at a cost, according to Mr Waigel, of DM15bn. An independent
commission, which he appointed, argues the cost of raising the tax threshold
will be closer to DM40bn.
And the three coalition partners have yet to explain how the government will
implement cuts in social spending while finding the money to finance their
election promises. Two commissions have been appointed to assess what needs
to be changed.
One will examine the range of welfare benefits to see whether they are
necessary; the other is to determine what can be done to encourage the
long-term unemployed to return to work, even if the jobs are low-paid.
Neither is expected to report until 1996 and the coalition programme
contains few hints about how money can be saved before then.
Cuts in social spending remain a priority for German industry which still
complains about the burden of social security contributions. To underline
its concerns, the employers' federation presented an ambitious programme to
restructure the social security system just two days after the October
election.
But Mr Kohl knows the issue remains divisive within his own CDU, and faces a
battle to push social spending cuts through the Bundesrat. The SPD nominally
controls 41 of the chamber's 68 seats - enough to block most legislation. In
practice, the states in the Bundesrat rarely vote on purely party political
lines. But it will still take all the government's tactical skills to
outmanoeuvre the SPD.
There are political tensions as well. The SPD, the Greens, and the Party of
Democratic Socialism, the one-time East German Communist party, will seize
every opportunity to exploit the government's tiny majority, and especially
to detach the FDP from its coalition partners.
One tense issue is certain to be the government's campaign against organised
crime. This would include installing electronic surveillance and bugging
devices in homes, something which the liberals oppose. It was dropped from
the coalition's agenda because of bitter disagreements between the partners.
Given the vulnerability of the FDP, which exposes the fragility of the
coalition, it will be left up to Mr Wolfgang Schauble, parliamentary head of
the CDU/CSU faction, to impose not only party discipline across the ranks,
but also to weaken the opposition by dividing it. He has already made
tentative overtures to the Greens. Last week, it was the CDU, and not the
SPD, that elected Ms Antje Vollmer, a senior member of the Greens, as one of
the Bundestag's four deputy speakers.
'The last thing Mr Kohl wants is a united opposition whose policies might
appear attractive to the FDP,' said a close colleague of the Chancellor.
'Given this weakened majority and a strong SPD in the Bundesrat, I just
wonder if this government has enough political will to push through its
policies,' said Mr Mayer.
Mr Kohl only just made it yesterday. He has gone before parliament five
times since 1982 to be elected chancellor - yesterday's margin of victory
was his smallest ever. That in itself augurs badly for the coming four
years. His greatest strength, though, remains his ability to surprise. He
may do so again.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sustainable pay rise, not minimum
wage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From PHILLIP OPPENHEIM MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Monks, secretary general of the Trades Union Congress, indicated
in his letter (November 14) that the union movement is considering seriously
its policy on a national minimum wage.
We in government share Mr Monks's wish for there to be a sustainable
increase in levels of pay. However, Mr Monks and his colleagues have failed
to tell us how they would handle the implications of a minimum wage on
differentials. Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU engineering and electrical
union, has already indicated that his union would oppose any squeeze on pay
differentials.
The unhappy experience of a minimum wage in Spain and France emphasises the
need for pay to be determined between employers and workers in the light of
their particular circumstances. This enables increases in pay and investment
to be sustained through increased productivity.
The only way to ensure sustainable increases in pay in the UK is to boost
our economic competitiveness by achieving monetary and fiscal stability. One
only has to look at the increase in productivity since 1979 to see that we
have made progress in this field, but we must ensure that this progress
continues.
Our success with this policy can be illustrated by the fact that the real
take-home pay of a single man in the bottom 10 per cent of the full-time
wage distribution is 23 per cent higher than in 1979. Under the last Labour
government, it fell by 1 per cent.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Conflict of interest: The US move on Bosnia disregards
broader strategic goals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Monday's meeting of foreign and defence ministers of the Western European
Union was an object lesson in the current acceleration of history.
The occasion was supposed to break ground in two ways: with a first
substantive debate on the development of a distinctively European defence
policy; and with a first joint session with ministers from eastern Europe.
In the event, both these innovations fell flat, because they were
over-shadowed by another bit of history-making that was not supposed to be
on the agenda: uproar and agitation at the US decision to break ranks over
the UN arms embargo on Bosnia.
This American decision may not, perhaps, make much practical difference to
the effectiveness of the embargo or to the war in former Yugoslavia. But no
one can disguise the potential political damage that it could inflict on the
transatlantic relationship.
First, this conflict goes symbolically to the heart of the future of the
Atlantic alliance. The US has on many previous occasions pursued military
policies which the Europeans did not like: the Vietnam war, for example, or
the bombing of Libya. But this is the first time that the US has
deliberately engaged in strategic conflict with the European allies in the
European theatre.
What makes this so worrying is what it says about American attitudes towards
the alliance after the end of the cold war. That relationship must mean much
less to the Americans than we used to be told if they are prepared to
jeopardise it for the sake of what they have so little reason to hope will
be a 'fairer' war in Bosnia.
The second cause for concern is that the US move seems to have been made in
disregard of bigger geo-strategic objectives. By any rational assessment,
the west ought to give a higher priority to the general strategic
relationship with Moscow than to a unilateral and unpredictable intervention
in the Bosnian war.
But the Russians also have an essential practical role in international
efforts to deal with the Bosnian war: the west persuaded them to join the
five-nation 'contact group', precisely because outside pressure had much
less chance of persuading the belligerents to settle without co-operation
from the Russians, traditional allies of the Serbs.
These strategic considerations are now in jeopardy. Any lifting of the arms
embargo on the Bosnians will provoke a parallel lifting of the embargo on
the Serbs, either overt or covert; the Russians will be under domestic
pressure to help their Serbian proteges; and the anti-western camp in Russia
will be strengthened. It is hard to believe that this adds up to an
advantageous strategic bargain for the US, for the sake of an intervention
in Bosnia whose effects must be marginal.
It is certainly not a good strategic bargain for western Europe. The
over-riding priority of the members of the European Union just now is to
work out, ahead of the Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) in 1996, a new
European architecture for the post-cold war world. By now, there is fairly
common agreement that this must include the expansion of the EU to include
the countries of eastern Europe. But there is so far no consensus whether
this means a loose and floppy organism with opt-outs galore (the British
vision), or a tightly integrated structure with a semi-federal 'hard core'
(the German model). This conundrum will be much more difficult if western
Europe also has to deal with a bigger war in the Balkans.
And yet the row over Bosnia has one large compensation: it should ensure
that future discussions of the new architecture for Europe take account of
the fact that the transatlantic relationship is now unavoidably different
from what it was during the cold war.
The UK government's argument for a loose, floppy, amoeba-like organism has
rested on the assumption that Nato, the American leadership of Nato, and the
Anglo-American 'special relationship' would all go on as before. That
assumption has been crumbling in the face of the facts; now it is no longer
tenable. In the post-cold war world, the transatlantic Alliance is losing
its pulling-power on policy in Wash-ington.
Some European diplomats minimise the US move away from the arms embargo,
under the pretext that it was imposed on President Bill Clinton by Congress.
Yet the fact is that Clinton himself has been at odds with Europe over
Bosnia; and if the latest move was imposed by the old Congress, just wait to
see what the new one will do. The chances are it will be more hostile to
Russia, more hostile to the UN and all the constraints of multilateral
diplomacy, and more impatient with what it sees as the wimpish Europeans.
This cannot fail to have repercussions on the 1996 debate. All European
countries would much prefer the Americans to lead the alliance as before,
because that would save them so much trouble; above all, it would exonerate
them from taking charge of their own destiny. But if the alliance has become
less central to US policy, as is inevitable, then it must also become less
central to European policy. You cannot follow a leader who does not want to
go anywhere you want him to go.
The Americans have just raised the stakes for the 1996 European negotiation
in ways they may not have expected. If the EU expands to the east, it will
need a real foreign and security policy: the combination of the east
Europeans inside, and the Russians outside, will make it almost unavoidable.
It will become inevitable if the west Europeans come to believe that their
strategic objectives and those of the Americans are no longer the same.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: State of US healthcare no threat to
Canadians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms CAROL CLEMENHAGEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Fredric Steinberg of Atlanta, Georgia (Letters, October 24),
expresses great concern that Canadians will have nowhere to go for treatment
'if US healthcare goes down the socialised road to medical oblivion'.
Do please let me allay Mr Steinberg's fears: in spite of all the
American-based propaganda he may have heard to the contrary, Canada's health
system, like the Canadians who use it, is alive, well and thriving. Yes, we
are working to improve elements of our health system and we are certainly
faced with cutbacks in publicly-funded health programmes. However, Canadian
governments, healthcare providers and the general public remain firmly
committed to the principle of financially unimpeded access to healthcare as
a building block for the continued well-being of our population.
Irrespective of the future state of our American neighbour's health system,
Canadians can continue to look forward to first-rate care within our own
borders without regard to an individual's ability to pay. We sympathise with
the uninsured Americans who do not now seem likely to share that privilege
and security in their own country.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, In his review of Sir James Goldsmith's book, The Trap ('Trapped in a
protectionist world', November 10), Martin Wolf states that 'if we are all
concerned about unemployment and the distribution of the gains from growth,
the best and most politically honest policy is direct, rather than indirect,
assistance to the workers'.
However, before any assistance is given, would it not be a good idea to
remove the barriers to employment? After all, what is the point of
simultaneously discouraging an activity and then trying to assist it?
Put another way, why levy tens of billions of pounds on employment and then
try to encourage it by handing a tiny fraction back, at the same time trying
to delude everybody that the net result is assistance?

FT  16 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Little evidence of poor performers
being prime takeover targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr TIM JENKINSON and Professor COLIN MAYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In a recently published book, Hostile Takeovers: Defence, Attack and
Corporate Governance (McGraw Hill), we report that there is little evidence
that targets of takeovers are poorly performing firms experiencing either
earnings or dividend reductions or below average stock market performance.
Reviewing the book (FT Review of Business Books: 'Handle with care',
November 2), David Wighton suggests that, during periods of rising earnings,
companies with below average growth rather than declining earnings and
dividends may also be legitimate targets of bids. Even if this were true, it
simply does not apply: more than 80 per cent of the targets where we report
no evidence of poor performance actually experienced earnings increases
above the market average.
In regard to stock market returns, Wighton suggests that anticipation of
bids may have inflated targets' share prices, causing poor performance to be
disguised. We specifically avoid this problem by allowing poor performance
to be revealed up to two years before the bid: 70 per cent of the targets
with above average stock market performance outperformed two as well as one
year before the bid.
Contrary to the impression created by the review, the book is not primarily
about performance; others have provided more detailed evidence in support of
the above. Instead, the book examines the strategies employed by raider and
target company. The detailed case studies reveal that hostile bids are
frequently motivated by strategic objectives of the raider rather than poor
performance of targets. It is a pity that the review of the book makes no
mention of one of its main observations, and that is the few defences which
targets can employ once, in particular, cash bids have been launched.
The book argues that shareholders should be able voluntarily to implement
takeover defences, as they commonly do in virtually every country outside
the UK, on the grounds that a large group of dispersed shareholders may be
unable to commit to particular corporate policies in the absence of such
self-denying ordinances. On the basis of evidence from several recent
studies, the burden of proof that the UK should have the most liberal
hostile takeover market of any country in the world, including the US, now
rests firmly in the hands of those who wish to establish that no
consequential damage is imposed on target companies. Tim Jenkinson,

Sir, 'Sweden gives clear Yes to EU' said your headline (November 14). No, it
did not. It gave only a very dubious Yes. Nearly half the voters (47 per
cent) said No.
Your story describes Finland's vote as 'decisive approval'. In fact 43 per
cent voted No in the Finnish referendum. Neither country has accepted EU
membership wholeheartedly.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Arts: Harnoncourt and more - South Bank Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Sunday at the Royal Festival Hall the Philharmonia concluded its cycle of
Beethoven symphonies under Nikolaus Harnoncourt with the Ninth, prefaced by
the C minor piano concerto. The soloist in the latter should have been
Martha Argerich, but her place was taken by the 22-year-old Till Fellner,
the Viennese winner of last year's Clara Haskil competition: tingling with
musical intelligence, light-fingered and agile, but a touch self-effacing
still.
Brio was notably absent from Harnoncourt's opening Allegro con brio, which
may have left Fellner slightly at a loss. The first orchestral statement was
briskly up-tempo, but in Harnoncourt's hands the music soon became dour and
square-cut: not a good springboard for the soloist. In the Largo Fellner
hoped that thoughtful sincerity would do duty for full-blooded projection,
but it didn't. Only in the Rondo did he and Harnoncourt find a common
ground, where the young pianist could show his real promise, mettle and wit.
In the 'Choral' Symphony, Harnoncourt's rigorous attention to phrasing and
voicing paid off handsomely. Chiefly on the stringed instruments - I was
astonished that he tolerated the horns' and timpani's smudgy dotted-triplets
when he had demanded such sharp precision from his strings; yet the Scherzo
was a model of urgency. The Allegro had been just as lithe, though it lacked
some ballast: for Beethoven's gravity, six double-basses are simply too few
in the Festival Hall.
The great Adagio was all temperate, studied density, though my companion
repined at Harnoncourt's turning it into 'a mere Andante'. Difficult: we
know that 18th and 19th century Adagios went faster than they have done in
the last 50-odd years; but how far we should adjust our sensibilities to
historical rectitude is a moot point.
With the sterling Philharmonia Chorus in the Finale, Hans Peter Blochwitz (a
late substitute) stood out among the soloists for style and brightness,
sturdily abetted by Luba Orgonasova and Ann Murray. Stephen Roberts's
baritone was disappointing. Harnoncourt took the visionary passages with a
kind of measured breathlessness - no mystical haze, but controlled awe; and
he raced away at last to an honest, inspiriting close. As highly calculated
performances go, this one was rewarding far beyond the norm.
There had been a pre-concert concert at 6 o'clock, the second in the
Philharmonia's 'Music of Today' series: an excellent bonus in principle, but
this time a damp squib. Instead of the music originally announced, by Heine
Goebells and Michael Torke, we got one piece for 14 players by James
MacMillan. As the orchestra's Visiting Composer, he runs the series.
The Exorcism of Rio Sumpul is a bleeding-heart response to something that
happened in the Third World in 1986, in the spirit of many pieces by Nigel
Osborne and MacMillan's teacher John Casken. Supposedly, helicopters of the
El Salvador military came to shoot out a peasant village; miraculously
nobody was killed; then the parish priest and children, and soon everyone
else, took up 'a strangely comical dance' of relief and devout thanks. Not a
bad scenario; but MacMillan's lengthy spoken introduction mentioned only
what would anyway be obvious, the little ensemble sounded shy and wan in the
big hall. The music fell of the intensity he promised.
Two nights earlier, the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group,
Electro-Acoustic Sound Theatre and student choirs (under Jonty Harrison)
gave their all to the 1972 'Europa-version' of Stockhausen's Momente in the
Queen Elizabeth Hall. It used sometimes to be taken for a momentous work,
but it paled on re-acquaintance. It came from one of Stockhausen's crazier
periods, when his marital life was undergoing fission. What the innumerable
short-breathed 'moments' of the music could not convey - erotic rapture,
mostly - is meant to be stuffed into the spoken texts and giggles. Though
the dominating soprano, Angela Tunstall, was superbly equal to every demand,
the score now seems a patchy thing for its length, propped up by
music-theatrical whimsy. There is much better Stockhausen than this
autobiographical silliness.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Arts: Getting to the heart of the matter - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most notable television event of the past week took place on Sunday
night at Sadler's Wells Theatre in London where a packed house watched a
marvellously clear print of the 1924 movie epic The Iron Horse, John Ford's
two-hour version of the construction of America's first trans-continental
railroad 'from sea to shining sea'. Though it is 70 years old and silent,
this archetypal western, which was accompanied by a new score for full
orchestra, written and conducted by John Lanchbery, was one of the
highlights of the London Film Festival. So in what sense was it a television
event?
The story began 14 years ago when the British Film Institute and Thames
Television presented Kevin Brownlow's superbly restored version of Abel
Gance's 1927 silent masterpiece Napoleon. Thames TV paid for Carl Davis to
write a new score which was played by the Wren Orchestra in the Empire
Theatre, Leicester Square. The event began at 10.30 in the morning and ended
at 5.30 when it seemed as though the applause would go on for ever. I was
not alone in asking when it would be possible to repeat that astounding
seven-hour experience, and in time further performances were given in
Britain, France, and the US. Then Channel 4 screened the movie for a
national audience in Britain.
Since then Kevin Brownlow and David Gill have continued their meticulous
work on classics of the silent cinema. Thames TV maintained their support
and encouraged Brownlow and Gill to make memorable documentary series about
the early days of Hollywood, and, when Thames lost its broadcasting licence,
Channel 4 took over the baton. Memorable restorations have included The
Thief Of Bagdad and The Wind. British television is now seen as the driving
force in the historic restoration of the silent cinema to its rightful
place.
This latest offering, The Iron Horse, foreshadows most of Ford's later
preoccupations: the frontier spirit, the renegade white man in league with
evil redskins (as Brownlow warned Sunday's audience, there is something here
to offend practically everyone nowadays), man braving a huge and dangerous
landscape, the lone Pony Express rider in a mad gallop to catch the
thundering train and gain a safe haven, the fight in the saloon. Today they
may seem like cliches but not, surely, in 1924. The experience of watching
this movie on television when Channel 4 transmits it nationally in 1995 will
not be the same as watching it in a theatre with an orchestra, but it will
be so much better than never seeing it at all.
The week's second most notable television event was also provided by Channel
4, this time in the Without Walls series which commissioning editor Waldemar
Januszczak is steadily expanding from its original arts base into the widest
conceivable - and admirably provocative - 'culture' magazine. Last week the
first half was devoted to a tough and sceptical reappraisal of Calcutta's
angel of mercy in Christopher Hitchens' polemical item 'Hell's Angel: Mother
Teresa'. Hitchens' argument is now widely known: that, although treated as a
saint, Mother Teresa seems much given to fraternising with right-wing
extremists, dodgy when it comes to relieving the suffering of those in her
care, and remarkably effective at increasing the misery of the world's poor
by opposing birth control.
It was a brave broadcast because the hysterical reaction from the huge and
influential religious lobby was wholly forseeable. Before this sort of
programme can get on the air you have to have people throughout a
broadcasting organisation (in this case from chief executive Michael Grade
to producer Tariq Ali) who believe that freedom of speech means the freedom
to say what the majority do not already believe. The last time this happened
in television was when Hugh Greene ran the BBC, and there were ructions
then, too.
This time Channel 4 rushed to give a voice to the religious lobby in Right
To Reply and chairman Roger Bolton sternly demanded to know of Hitchens and
Januszczak where was the 'balance' in their programme, as though he had
missed the fact that theirs was the first attempt in years to counter the
tons of unbalanced adulation weighing down the other side. Moreover, where
was Bolton when we really needed him, during all those decades when
religious proselytisers were pouring out their unbalanced programmes full of
unsubstantiated stories about supernatural beings who would 'save' us all?
Indeed, since such programmes continue, why is Bolton not regularly issuing
stern challenges to the people in dog collars to achieve balance, to bring
in level headed rationalists alongside the preachers and happy clappers to
remind viewers that the evidence for risings from the dead, the afterlife,
holy ghosts and so on is precisely nil?
The third most notable television event of the week was ITV's Open Fire, a
sort of drama-documentary ('based on the true story . . .') about a man
named David Martin. Since he is now dead, having hanged himself in prison,
most of us would probably never have heard of him had he not been the man
whom the police thought they were shooting when they actually shot Stephen
Waldorf as he sat in a yellow Mini in a London street in 1983. Anyone who
knows even a little about the Waldorf affair must have asked 'How did the
police get themselves into such a state of panic that they pumped that many
rounds into the wrong man?' By telling the story of Martin, writer/director
Paul Greengrass has provided a credible answer to that question. It showed
Martin as a violent, gun-toting, transvestite bank robber and expert lock
picker who, understandably enough, terrified some of the policemen who were
pursuing him.
Of course it is difficult to know whether Martin was really as startlingly
good looking in drag as actor Rupert Graves made him. It is hard to know
whether he really exulted in violence as was shown here, and hard to know
what his sexual proclivities were, assuming he knew himself. But however
questionable the details, Open Fire suggested one coherent and believable
version of what could have happened. In the process it provided the
opportunity for Graves and the remarkable Kate Hardie (unforgettable as the
teenage runaway in Safe) to give outstanding performances as Martin and his
girl friend Sue. Open Fire was almost certainly as close to the truth of
1983 as Iron Horse was to the truth of railroad building in the 1860s, at
least in the sense of emotional truth - and that, surely, is largely what
the Hitchens programme was about too.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Arts: Simple ideas come off best on the Fringe - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
If you want to see a really sparkling first play, pick Nick Gross's Peaches
at the Royal Court's Theatre Upstairs. This has authenticity written all
over it, yet the touch remains light throughout. The background is the
numerical explosion of Britain's student population. Here are semi-educated
young people at university, at first just messing about, drinking and
dancing, then ultimately looking for jobs and a place in the real world.
The university is Leeds, suitably far north, but still only a few hours
drive from the seemingly magnetic pull of London.
Driving plays a large part in the piece. The scenes where students drive and
talk in cars up and down the M1 are beautifully done - almost to the point
where you think that Peaches might have been made for television. Yet this
is the trick: the play is so well written and so well done that it works on
stage.
In a succession of short scenes Grosso uses surtitles to indicate the
location and the characters. Far from being trendy, the men are frankly
reactionary. 'Peaches' is the word for women which, as one of the men says,
is what the male students think about all the time, even if they
occasionally talk about something else. They regret that so many of the
women have turned gay, vegetarian or vegan. One of the women may even have
found a job on Channel 4.
Grosso writes without bias or preaching. He simply shows the students as
they are. Some education has clearly rubbed off on them, though they try to
conceal it. For instance: 'Do you know Raymond Chandler?' 'You mean the one
who played for Fulham?' Or 'what's that book about the future - 1973? They
had to change the title.' The men live in the past.
There are also social nuances even among students trying to be egalitarian.
Watch the embarrassment when Frank (Ben Chaplin) goes off to a girl friend's
country house and finds he doesn't like the country.
The play has a pedigree. It comes from the Studio of the Royal National
Theatre, where they do intensive rehearsing and experimenting. The work pays
off. Not a line nor a movement in this piece is lost. Under James
Macdonald's direction and David Roger's design, there is marvellous
attention detail. Note the cows outside the country house and, better still,
the pigeons outside the window of a London flat.
Yet it cannot be quite true that the National Theatre can make a good
production out of almost anything. The writing has to be there in the first
place. The only trouble with Peaches, which perhaps owes something to the
influence of television, is that it lasts for only 75 minutes.
Beware of plays that try to be too clever. One good idea is usually enough.
At the Gate Theatre Maria Irene Fornes has an excellent idea at the start of
The Danube: it could be sustained throughout, but distractions get in the
way.
The piece plays around with foreign language teaching. It is Budapest 1938.
On the board is Unit One: Basic sentences. A visiting American talks to some
locals in that slow stilted style that goes with learning a new language.
'Are you a Hungarian?' 'No, I am an American.' The conversation moves on:
'What do you eat for breakfast, as a rule?'
There are some promising developments. A Hungarian father (Simeon Andrews)
muses that some say that German is the language of the future, but that
others say that it is English. The father has a marked preference for German
cigarettes. Since this is close to the eve of the second world war, all that
is appropriately ominous.
Then The Danube shoots off all over the place. As a programme note puts it:
the play 'soon departs from chronologically (sic) realism'. The notes also
refer to nuclear fall-out from north eastern Kazakstan, pollution in
Budapest and the London suburb of Putney, as well as the alleged misdeeds of
the mining company, RTZ. Certainly the characters begin to suffer from
respiratory and other diseases, yet nothing is very clear.
Meanwhile, the play continues in its language lesson format, eventually
reaching Unit 14. This is a useful dramatic venture in itself. It shows how
the language of the text books is not always so different from the language
people speak if they lack individual self-expression. It could be further
explored. Ms Fornes throws away the chance by trying to do too much.
One other slight cavil. Short plays seem to be catching. The Danube lasts
only 80 minutes. There is, however, one joy. Hannah Miles makes her first
professional appearance as the Hungarian daughter. Previously she had played
Hedda Gabler at the Guildhall school. She has great poise, and is clearly an
actress to be watched. Direction is by Nancy Meckler for the Shared
Experience Theatre.
At the Cockpit, John Constable's Tulip Futures suffers even more than The
Danube from seeking to be too clever. It may sound a good idea to write a
play about the financial market in Dutch tulips in the 17th century measured
against the market for art: it is a piece about relative values. Yet good
ideas are not always inherently dramatic: it helps to have characters,
feeling and wit. Still, the piece is redeemed by a splendid last five
minutes when the characters in the original portraits speak from their now
elevated position in the National Gallery. Abigail Morris directs and there
is a remarkably ambitious set, perhaps too big for this theatre, designed by
Tom Piper.

Is it my age or do contestants in University Challenge (8.30pm BBC2)
demonstrate a horrible vacuum in what used to be termed general culture? But
then we live in an age when what was once called general knowledge is
dismissed as trivial pursuits. Neither of the youngsters in Lifeswaps (7pm
BBC2) would make the team as they change life styles (bohemian versus
libertarian). They're about as interesting as the tabloid hack and Woman's
Hour reporter: not much contrast, given Woman's Hours recurrent obsessions.
The ex-Sun man's simulated sex for Radio 4 differs little from his calling's
usual preoccupations. And the appalling Lily Savage, a relic of 1950s
working-men's club naughtiness, should swap lives with a Hebridean crofter
forthwith. After a fascinating start this series is spluttering into
irrelevance. Who cares if Manchester's trendy clubbers are shocked when
their hip DJ is replaced by 'Gatley's mobile disco legend, Norman Tinsel'?
The Dying of the Light (8pm ITV) is much more worthwhile, a
drama-documentary about the charismatic aid worker shot in Somalia, Sean
Devereux.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: Why markets are ignoring the
issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most City analysts ignore environmental pressures on companies because they
cannot price the impact. Half do not trust information published by
companies on their environmental performance and two-thirds think the
current standard of reporting is inadequate.
These are some of the findings of a survey of 85 top Extel Financial-rated
analysts working in 28 sectors. It was conducted by researchers NOP on
behalf of the charity Business in the Environment (BiE) and funded by Extel
Financial.
Most analysts feel the bulk of environmental issues are moral or emotional
and are therefore irrelevant to their job of making rational assessments.
Sixty-one per cent said the subject was of no interest to their clients,
although a third had received requests from clients for more information,
especially in the utilities and natural resources sectors.
Three-quarters of those surveyed do not see the environment as a competitive
issue within the business sectors they cover, but most feel the environment
will become more important in the next 10 years. Analysts under the age of
35 are better informed about environmental issues than their older
colleagues.
Analysts thought that company-produced environmental performance reports
should be externally verified to be credible.
Meanwhile, a separate report, sponsored by Greenpeace, suggests that
investors do not take adequate account of environmental factors when valuing
companies, at least in the carbon fuel sector, which includes coal, oil and
gas.
The author Mark Mansley, an investment analyst, argues that the financial
markets are underestimating the risk that global warming will lead to
dramatic measures by government to curtail carbon fuel consumption. These
measures could include carbon taxes and limits on demand.
'Climate change presents major long-term risks to the carbon fuel industry,'
he says. 'These risks have not yet been adequately discounted by the
financial markets. The risks increase the longer it takes to develop
adequate policy responses to the threat of climate change.'
Mansley says that most carbon fuel projects, being very large, take longer
than 10 years to pay back, meaning their viability depends on events in the
distant future. Typically, markets respond to events only as they become
visible, and investors could not be certain that they could sell their stock
once the risks of global warming began to materialise.
Until this discount had been made, investors should avoid heavy exposure to
the oil, gas and coal sectors. Mansley says investors would do better to put
their money in alternative energy companies because they offer greater
growth prospects than carbon fuel industries. Diversification in this
direction would also offset some of the risks of climate change.

FT  16 NOV 94 / People: Cockshaw becomes chief exec - again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Alan Cockshaw, 57, (far right), chairman of Amec, is to take on the role
of chief executive following the announcement that John Bateson, 53, (right)
is to take early retirement after seven years at the helm of the engineering
and construction group.
Bateson, who has worked for the group for 25 years, will retire at the end
of March 1995. Sir Alan, who has worked in tandem with Bateson for over 20
years, said yesterday that Bateson had always said he wanted to go in 1995.
Sir Alan characterised Bateson's departure as nothing more than a
'straightforward retirement'. He said he was 'very sorry' to lose Bateson
but understood that he wanted to devote more time to his family's caravan
park business. Amec said that Bateson will not receive any special
compensation when he goes and he will continue to assist the group on a
number of specific matters.
Amec has been struggling to recover from the recession and this year's
estimated profits of around Pounds 25m are still going to be more than two
thirds below the figure of five years ago. The news of Bateson's departure
comes only three months after the replacement of Dennis Clark, head of
Amec's process and energy business, and is likely to increase City concerns
about Sir Alan's autocratic management style and the question of management
succession.
Sir Alan, who was Amec's chief executive between 1984 and 1988, stressed
yesterday that he did not plan to take on the chief executive's job
permanently. He expected to pick a new chief executive within the next year
and said that he very much hoped that Amec's next chief would come from
inside the group.
Keith Humphreys, who is chairman of the UK arm of Rhone-Poulenc and joined
Amec's board last year, has been appointed non-executive deputy chairman of
Amec. Meanwhile, George Payne, who replaced Clark and heads the process and
energy sector, has joined the board.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nick Clegg, 58, one of many ex-Hill Samuel bankers scattered around the
City, is retiring as co-chairman of Daiwa Europe, the European arm of the
Japanese securities firm.
Daiwa Europe has grown rapidly since Clegg joined in 1986. Staff numbers in
London have grown five-fold to 750, and the group's European business now
employs over 1,000 people and is backed by Pounds 500m of capital. Clegg is
giving up his full-time executive responsibilities at the end of the year
but will remain chairman of Daiwa Europe Bank.
Alex Monnas, 43, another ex-Hill Samuel banker who now heads Daiwa Europe's
fixed income division, has been appointed deputy chief executive and will
report to Ryonosuke Miyoshi, 50, chairman and chief executive of Daiwa
Europe. Masayasu Ohi, 47, general manager of Daiwa Securities' international
investment banking department in Tokyo, is moving to London to be managing
director and president.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: US staff biking to work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US workers who commute by bicycle are becoming pampered employees at many
companies. Nike, the Oregon-based sports shoe manufacturer, gives workers a
Dollars 1 credit at the company's cafeteria, fitness centre or store if they
pedal to work.
At Fleetwood, a maker of motor homes in Southern California, biking
employees enjoy mini-garages for storage, a free repair facility, showers
and changing rooms, the free loan of a bicycle, and a safety kit. USAA, an
insurance group in San Antonio, Texas, encourages workers to form bicycling
clubs to articulate needs to management and to help riders devise the best
routes to the office.
The bike-to-work movement is being pushed along by government initiatives.
Next year, Oregon will enforce a law that requires all businesses in the
state to provide covered storage spaces for customers and workers.
Massachusetts plans to spend Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.6m) over the next few
years to adapt roads to bicycle use.
Under Clean Air legislation passed during the Bush administration, every
state must present a plan to encourage bicycle use by the end of 1995.
'San Antonio has launched a big bicycle-mobility plan because they are on
the edge of non-attainment of the Clean Air Act standards,' says Andrew
Clarke, deputy director of the Bicycle Federation of America. 'If they do
not take the initiative themselves, the federal government will force them
to.'
Biking is an increasingly popular way to reduce air pollution, say
politicians, because it costs relatively little compared with public
transport improvements.
Refitting roads to accommodate bicycles does raise the ire of many, though.
In densely populated cities, it often means eliminating traffic lanes,
slowing the flow for drivers. And by providing shelters for bicycles,
businesses may have to cut the parking spaces available for cars.

Environmental reporting is a waste of time and money. This could be the view
of the vast majority of companies that steadfastly ignore demands to publish
regular voluntary reports on their emissions, waste, and efforts to reduce
their impact on the environment.
After a spate of reports in the early 1990s from blue-chip companies in
western Europe and North America, environmental reporting appears to be at a
crossroads. Those companies that have reported - about 150 worldwide - are
wondering whether it is worth continuing. The non-reporters appear to be
hoping that reporting is a dying fashion.
'Reporting by some companies spurs on competition among others. But a
diversity of styles and lack of conformity has undermined this competition
because there is no benchmarking. And, of course, those companies which
choose not to report are deeply comfortable with this,' says John Elkington,
a director of SustainAbility, a UK consultancy advising the United Nations
Environment Programme on reporting.
Unep is trying to encourage small- and medium-sized companies throughout the
world to report. Such companies produce most of the world's pollution, but
because of their size and low visibility they are less affected by public
pressure. Unep's underfunded campaign is only beginning, but the chances of
success look slim unless there is renewed pressure to report.
The future of voluntary reporting is uncertain, for three reasons. First,
those companies that have so far reported have received, at best, a muted
response from the audience that was calling for voluntary reporting, mainly
campaign groups.
Second, recession and the rapid slide of the environment down the political
agenda have reduced the pressure to report. Only businesses in those sectors
whose record is constantly under public scrutiny, such as water, chemicals
and energy, feel the need to report.
Third, information contained in the vast majority of reports lacks
credibility and is of little use to most audiences, such as investors.
'Environment reporting is still the product of the public relations
industry,' says Clive Bates, a campaigner at Greenpeace UK.
'Investors, employees and the public need the unexpurgated environmental
facts just as much as they need to see the mandatory financial accounts,' he
adds.
Greenpeace is not alone in its criticism of the value of the information
found in environmental reports. Bill Dale, environment analyst at S. G.
Warburg, says the City finds it difficult to identify potential
environmental risk because of the poor quality of information made available
by companies.
'Although more data are now being revealed in annual reports there is a high
degree of discretion in what is reported,' he said.
It seems unlikely that companies will ever be forthcoming with all the facts
until they are forced. Although there have been hints that the European
Union could legislate on the issue, this now seems unlikely.
The EU's voluntary scheme, called Eco Management and Audit Scheme, is up and
running but has yet to fulfil one of its primary goals - to encourage
companies to conform to its standards and so gain a competitive advantage.
And Emas is only aimed at very large industrial operations.
The general trend in the EU's attitude towards the environment is away from
prescriptive legislation and towards a greater use of voluntary and fiscal
measures to encourage improved environmental performance.
This does not mean, however, that environmental reporting is off the agenda.
Elkington sits on the EU's consultative forum on the environment, a group of
business people and representatives from consumer groups, local government,
trades unions and non-governmental groups. 'In our discussions, reporting is
seen as absolutely fundamental,' he said.
And companies that continue to report say they find benefits other than
public recognition for their efforts. The process forces them to set up the
systems to gather information about their products and processes. This
enables them to manage their businesses better.
'Our report gives us the opportunity to provide concise information on our
environmental performance to outsiders and employees. We find it a useful
communications tool,' says Richard Robson, environment communications
manager at ICI.
Thorn EMI has just produced a highly detailed report on its performance and
the Kingfisher retailing group, which includes Comet, B&amp;Q, Superdrug and
Woolworths, is expected to publish its first environmental report this year.
'Reporting is a primary strategic communications tool,' says Elkington. 'A
prime example here is the success of Dow Europe. Because it does not have an
annual report for the European business its their environmental report is a
window through which people can view Dow.'
But in spite of such advantages, it appears that many companies will not
take environmental reporting seriously unless they are put under more
pressure.
Early indications are that in the absence of any official initiative, the
financial community could provide the impetus.
Asbestosis claims and concerns about possible effects of climate change on
catastrophic property casualty exposures have increased the world insurance
industry's interest in the environment. Banks are paying more attention to
their exposure to environmental risk and investors are starting to show
concern about risks posed by companies with poor environmental records.
But if the financial community is to convert its concerns into action it
needs better information. Dale says: 'Most of the information, including
specific quantitative detail, is arbitrary and self-determined. In very few
cases is it possible to draw direct conclusions as to the implications for
revenues and profit margins. While investors wait for better standards of
reporting they will be more impressed by those companies which publish
separate reports on their environmental performance. Particular credit will
be given to information that is independently audited or verified.'

FT  16 NOV 94 / Management: Cherry-picking top talent - Reuters Holdings has
taken the 'virtual' office concept beyond its usual boundaries, finds
Desmond Dearlove
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DESMOND DEARLOVE

<TEXT>
Just a few yards off Fleet Street on the first floor of the London
headquarters of Reuters Holdings, one of the most far-reaching examples of
'virtual business practice' is unfolding.
It represents a break with traditional business structures and pushes at the
frontiers of current management thinking - it could radically redefine the
nature of organisations.
In the UK, the concept of the 'virtual organisation' has been largely
technology-driven, with a number of companies using networked computer
terminals to create an IT infrastructure - or 'virtual office' - which
exists independently of the physical location of employees. IBM, Mercury
Communications and Digital Equipment, for example, have all experimented
with this sort of model, using electronic-mail and other IT tools to enable
employees working remotely to plug into virtual offices.
However, commentators in the US claim that the virtual concept can be taken
further. Tom Peters, in particular, argues that an important strength of
software companies in California's Silicon Valley lies in a complex web of
relationships that promotes multiple collaborations. This, he says, results
in amorphous business groupings that can reconfigure to create new virtual
organisations without the pain and expense of restructuring or redundancies.
It is this model that inspired Greg Garrison, director of the Reuters
usability group, to create what is probably one of the first truly virtual
organisations in Europe; one which spans two continents and incorporates
people from 12 other companies - including Microsoft, Logica and Admiral
Computing.
Garrison's achievement has brought a ringing endorsement from Peters who
described him in the September issue of his newsletter On Achieving
Excellence as 'an impresario, creating a new way of doing business as he
goes'.
In early 1993, Garrison was drafted into the Reuters London headquarters
from its Asia Pacific office to set up the usability group. His brief was to
achieve a breakthrough in the user-friendliness of the financial information
services provided by Reuters to international bankers, brokers and dealers
in 150 countries.
The aim was to seize competitive advantage through the creation of highly
intuitive user interfaces which accurately matched the delivery of
information with the way customers in dealing room environments wanted to
work. With keen competition from other suppliers, including Bloombergs
Financial Services and Dow Jones Telerate, Reuters' leadership of the highly
lucrative market for real-time information was at stake.
Garrison's start-up plan for the usability operation called for a staff of
24 full-time Reuters employees specialising in human-computer interface
design. But a combination of hiring controls and the company's reluctance to
employ permanent specialists with the esoteric skills required meant
Garrison was allowed only two of the 24 staff requested. Board level
commitment to the initiative, however, ensured a generous budget to fund the
staffing requirements from outside.
Garrison's dilemma was how to assemble the team of highly specialised IT
experts. The traditional method was to outsource. But an initial evaluation
of the sorts of skills required - ergonomics, software prototyping,
interface graphic design and artificial intelligence - convinced him that no
single consultancy in the UK could provide all the solutions.
In response he invented a 'virtual' organisation, cherry-picking the top
talent from 12 companies around the world.
'I needed an organisation which would be a constantly evolving and changing
team of experts - some of whom would be from other companies, some of whom
would be independent - but most of whom would not be permanent Reuters
staff,' Garrison explains. 'I wanted to employ them very flexibly on a
project-by-project basis when and as I needed them.'
Using the promise of substantial contracts as a carrot, Garrison was able to
convince the consultancies to take the unusual step of signing
non-disclosure contracts, not just with Reuters but with each other. This
laid the foundation for a collaborative environment.
What he now has at his disposal is an extended virtual team of 50 people,
consisting of a core group of between 12 and 24 who work on-site at the
Reuters' office in London. Some individuals contribute from other UK
locations, and consultants based in the US and Europe participate in the
team remotely using E-mail, fax and telephone.
Garrison operates his virtual organisation as a 'just-in-time' skills pool,
which shrinks and grows - and can even change its skills composition - to
match the workload. When not required, participating consultants return to
their own companies.
Such an arrangement does not come cheap, however. Team members are charged
to Reuters on a day rate, typically between Pounds 300 and Pounds 500 per
person. But Garrison calculates that savings on recruitment costs and staff
benefits including holidays, sick leave and pensions mean that he pays a
premium of only 8 per cent to 15 per cent above the market rate for his
virtual employees. He believes that the calibre of the staff alone justifies
the premium. It also enables him to start and stop projects almost
instantaneously.
Along with the expertise they bring, each of the 50 or so consultants also
brings access to the skills pool of the organisation. In one case, by
accessing the Microsoft product research laboratories in the US, team
members from Microsoft were able to provide a software tool that Reuters
needed but which wasn't available in the marketplace.
Reuters has just installed state-of-the-art usability testing laboratories
to enable Garrison to continue the virtual experiment. This suggests that so
far at least the virtual concept is delivering tangible results.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Management: A fresh perspective on training / A look at an
innovative Tec that has created real accountability to business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hold a contest for the most innovative Training and Enterprise Council in
England and Wales, and the Tec for South and East Cheshire would almost
certainly take the prize.
The Tec has a long list of 'firsts' to its name, including being among the
first to agree a merger with its local chamber of commerce. It has also set
up a membership scheme that has created real accountability to local
businesses and built strong links with employers.
At the core of South and East Cheshire's activities is a philosophy of
working as closely as possible with its local community. 'We approached
everything we did from that perspective,' says 42-year-old Richard Guy, the
innovative chief executive who joined the Tec from the Department of
Employment, but who recently took up a new post in Manchester.
Tecs, numbering 82 in England and Wales, are private companies established
by the government in 1991 to drive a skills revolution in the UK. They
receive nearly Pounds 2bn a year to run government-funded training
programmes for young people and the unemployed, as well as working with
other partners, such as local authorities and chambers of commerce, to
improve enterprise activities in their areas.
At first, many Tecs found it easiest to continue running training programmes
in the same way as the civil servants who preceded them. This approach
usually guaranteed a reasonable place on the government's league tables,
which measure a narrow range of Tecs' activities and exclude most of their
economic development work.
South and East Cheshire, however, has taken a more entrepreneurial approach.
On Youth Training, for example, Guy jettisoned the system of using managing
agents to place young people on employers' training schemes. Such
intermediaries he says deprived him of a point of contact with employers
necessary to integrate YT operations effectively in the Tec's other work.
So Guy started to contract directly with some 800 employers to provide
training places. One benefit has been that the Tec has one of the highest
levels of young people on YT working as employees. Where managing agents are
used, they normally have non-employed status which means the young person is
not guaranteed a job at the end of training.
As important, the switch has allowed Guy to involve local employers much
more in the work of the Tec. They are invited to join a business membership
scheme, which also gives joint membership with the local chamber of
commerce. Members total 2,000, about 55 per cent of employers with five or
more employees in the area. They are able to attend the annual meeting, cast
votes on key policy issues and elect board members.
The scheme, probably the best developed of the handful set up by Tecs,
offers direct accountability to local businesses that is often absent
elsewhere.
The membership scheme also offers special discounts for business support
services offered through Business Link, the 'one-stop shop' the Tec operates
with other partners on behalf of the Department of Trade and Industry.
Each company joining the Tec, or Business Link, with more than five
employees is allotted a personal business adviser.
Guy's strategy has its detractors. Some critics point to the Tec's
comparatively large staff of 120, 50 of whom are engaged in Business Link.
They claim that Tecs should not be involved in the direct delivery of
services, not least because it can be more expensive than sub-contracting.
Guy says: 'We do sub-contract all things that are specialised, and that
accounts for 75 per cent of our budget. This does lead to savings. But the
direct service is important because we can pull firms together and
sub-contract very effectively on behalf of the group.'
The strategy has been well-received among its customers in Cheshire. 'The
Tec is a good sounding board for impartial advice,' says Garry Crosby,
managing director of Alert Reactive System, an 18-month-old building
management contracting company in Knutsford. 'I can't praise my business
adviser at the Tec enough. The number of times that I have picked up the
phone in desperation. It can be a lonely job setting up a business after
working for a big company which took care of all the support systems like
lawyers and accountants.'

FT  16 NOV 94 / Recruitment: Why not simply stop working? - Machines are
changing our social order by freeing up the human brain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why do we work? Whenever I ask myself this question, which is frequently,
the obvious and simple answers come to mind, such as to feed and clothe the
family. It is, however, a question usually addressed privately because it is
not easily voiced openly in a society where unemployment is rife and where
work has become the chief focus of human activity.
It was heartening to hear last week, therefore, someone not only attempting
to answer this question historically but also examining its broader
implications. Alain Cotta, professor of economics at Paris Dauphine
University, told delegates of Hay mangement consultants' international
conference in Prague that work was a 'very new concept', less than two
centuries old.
He was speaking about work in the sense of something sought out as an
edifying pastime that brought with it social status. Before the industrial
revolution only those people with no other choice worked, and the more they
worked, the lower their social status. He said: 'Social order was then based
on a hierarchy inverse to that based on work.'
'Work was not even permitted at all at the ultimate summit as this would
have meant going against the social status which had been attained,' he
said.
Only later did the work concept become the key to merit and meritocracy,
claiming the status of moral value. 'As soon as it was introduced on the
social scene by industry, work suddenly claimed all the honours,' said
Cotta.
He quoted the 19th century German philosopher Hegel's warning that work
'suspends desires' and directs energies towards the production of goods. In
accepting work in mechanised industry, people were themselves becoming part
of the new machine state, taking orders from a chief or boss, something
which Elias Canetti, the Nobel prize winner, once compared to 'pins driven
in our flesh', he said.
Hegel's observation that machine would replace muscle and in so doing create
machines of people, was right, Cotta concluded, but a new process was taking
the transformation further, he suggested, taking over the nerve cells or
neurons. He called it the 'neuron prosthesis'.
Cotta said: 'More than half the people are now employed in sectors where
they create, release, transfer, receive and utilise information. The
crossing of the frontier between muscle and neuron may have as many
consequences as the rise of industry.'
Cotta is putting his finger on the information and technological revolution
that is overtaking the industrialised world. He is suggesting that work has
turned full circle to the point that 'people are now looking forward to
filling their time instead of producing. Man is trying to free himself from
the original painful constraints of work.'
He not only points out what many of us have resentfully accepted - that
industry has increased the time spent at work, separating people from their
domestic and social life - but says that arguments against work today focus
not on its duration but on the subordination of individuals to orders.
Here, he may be trailing developments. Far from subordinating the employee,
the advent of delayering and empowerment in the workplace has led to the
emasculation of the middle manager and is even challenging the influence of
higher management.
Cotta identifies the emergence of three groups of people in society
differentiated by their relations to work. The largest is the middle class,
defined as 'all the individuals for whom work remains to be endured and is
their only way to earn a living - but not a reason for living'. He has no
category for the traditional working class.
The second are those excluded from work because of the ever increasing
levels of education, qualification and technology, or because they have
retired on a pension or excluded themselves voluntarily, living on benefits
or private income.
The last group, he says, comprises people who have chosen to work, including
those in the professions. While these three social groups are at present
stable he asks whether progress may induce further the condemnation of work
and the attraction of two extremes: exclusion and predilection.
What, asks Cotta, is going to happen to his middle class? 'Once the level of
development can ensure a decent life where work requires minimal efforts, if
not none, its schedules being considerably reduced and made flexible, the
charms of the 'exclusion' become more evident. Why not simply stop working?'
Work then, he argues, could once again be a key factor of social evolution.
Social dynamics would be motivated by two powerful attractions: 'the
sentence to death of work or the assertion that it can be the reason for
living.'
Now for something completely familiar. Day Associates, which compiled the
above table said that 5 per cent was being widely quoted by City
institutions as their budget for base salary increases for 1995. Year on
year from August to August, said Day, City clerical salaries, including
bonuses, rose on average by 8.8 per cent while management salaries rose by
15.2 per cent in the same period.
The table shows a selection of data from its latest quarterly survey of pay
and benefits of 315 jobs in 135 banks and finance houses. The first three
columns show average basic salaries for various rankings in the same type of
job, followed by the average basic salary, and then bonus paid as a
percentage of basic salary. Finally, the last two columns indicate the
percentage of people with car allowances and the average amount.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Obituary of Humphrey Berkeley: MP and Conservative rebel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Humphrey Berkeley, who died yesterday aged 68, was mainly responsible for
democratising the election of the Conservative party leader.
He was Conservative MP for Lancaster when in 1963 the sudden resignation of
Harold Macmillan, the prime minister, plunged the party into crisis.
At the time the Tory whips controlled the machinations, known as the
'processes of consultation' which - in theory at any rate - determined the
preferences of backbench MPs for various candidates for the succession.
The process was discredited when it became known that the Earl of Home,
still a peer, had emerged with more support than such leading rivals as RA
Butler and Reginald Maudling.
Iain Macleod, party chairman and leader of the Commons when Mr Macmillan
resigned, refused to serve under the new prime minister, protesting that his
emergence owed more to the 'magic circle' than any consultative process.
Mr Berkeley, a supporter of Mr Macleod, led demands for the introduction of
voting procedures which operated for the first time when Sir Edward Heath
succeeded Sir Alec Douglas-Home (as he became on disclaiming his hereditary
peerage) in July 1965.
Mr Berkeley attributed his defeat at Lancaster in 1966 to the unfavourable
publicity which resulted from his sponsorship of a private member's bill
legalising homosexual acts between consenting adults.
Ironically, he found the Conservative party under Sir Edward increasingly
unattractive and resigned from it in 1970, switching to Labour.
He tried to return to the Commons as Labour MP for North Fylde (Lancashire)
in October 1974, and also failed to secure election in 1987 for the Social
Democratic party at Southend East.
He rejoined the Labour party in 1988.
Mr Berkeley, an outspoken opponent of racial discrimination, was a
vice-president of the Anti-Apartheid Movement for many years.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Underground laboratory urged for Sellafield
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A rock laboratory should be built as soon as possible, 650 metres
underground, to establish whether the area around Sellafield in Cumbria is
suitable for the deep disposal of radioactive wastes, the Royal Society said
yesterday.
The recommendation from the society, Britain's senior scientific body, comes
in a report on the activities of Nirex, the nuclear industry's waste
disposal company. Although Nirex commissioned the study, it was carried out
independently by the society.
It concludes: 'The society retains an open mind on whether Sellafield can
meet the safety criteria for a UK deep repository.'
If the site is suitable, the society adds, the nuclear industry should
consider depositing its most radioactive 'high-level waste' there, as well
as the low-level and intermediate-level waste Nirex is considering.
Nirex yesterday distanced itself from that proposal, aware that it could
inflame public opposition to the project. It said: 'Nirex has no remit for
high-level waste and the repository is not being designed to accept it.'
The Pounds 120m rock laboratory would help to establish whether the area's
geology is suitable for keeping radioactive materials isolated for tens of
thousands of years.
Sir Alan Muir Wood, who chaired the Royal Society study group, conceded that
Nirex appeared to have chosen Sellafield for political reasons - because it
was already a nuclear site. He said: 'It is unlikely that Sellafield would
have been first choice on geological features alone.'
The report recommends that the repository should be built in two stages. The
first would be for short-lived wastes whose radioactivity would die away
within a few hundred years. The second would be an extension into deeper
geological strata - below 1,000 metres - where there is less risk of
radioactivity reaching the surface and where long-lived wastes could be
stored.
Nirex reacted warily to that proposal too. Deeper drilling and tunnelling
would not only increase costs but also increase the safety risks to
construction workers, it said.
Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, the environmental groups, said that the
recommendations could not be justified by the scientific evidence.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Nirex seeks to avoid rocky horror: The construction problems
of a Sellafield repository
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Excavating a tunnel is risky at the best of times - as engineers involved in
the collapse under Heathrow airport will attest - but to construct caverns
under Cumbria to store some of the world's most deadly materials represents
a huge engineering task.
The problem of how to keep secure long-lived radioactive waste from nuclear
power stations is taxing the construction ingenuity of many nations.
Political skills may also be required to persuade communities to accept the
development of deep underground structures which will need to remain safe
for hundreds of thousands of years.
In the UK the task falls to Nirex, which is jointly owned by British Nuclear
Fuels, Nuclear Electric, the UK Atomic Energy Authority and Scottish
Nuclear. The company, in which the government holds a golden share, has
spent Pounds 50m on investigating 500 possible sites for a repository in the
UK.
The choice has been narrowed down to 2 sq km of land beside the Sellafield
nuclear reprocessing works in Cumbria, which produces about 60 per cent of
the country's intermediate-level waste.
An alternative site, close to Dounreay nuclear power station in Caithness,
was shortlisted but later rejected because of cost and the potential risk of
transporting waste over long distances to such a remote site.
A final decision on whether to go ahead at Sellafield will depend on the
outcome of some of the most intensive and costly geological and engineering
studies conducted in this country.
A public inquiry still has to be held into the project, which is expected to
cost a total of Pounds 2bn. Nirex expects to have spent close to Pounds 1bn
and 18 years on design and planning by the time construction is expected to
start in 2005.
A further Pounds 100m has been spent on preliminary investigations. This has
included drilling 20 boreholes up to 2km deep.
Scientists have also been investigating likely ground and water movements
during and after excavation.
Engineers will have to take into account the possible effects of global
warming as well as predictions that an ice age could return to affect
Cumbria in the next 10,000 years.
Their next step will be to build a Pounds 120m underground laboratory to
determine more precisely how rocks laid down 470m years ago may respond to
large-scale excavation. Some 1,200 metres of tunnels are planned 700 metres
below the surface to create the test facility.
A planning application to build the 'rock characterisation facility' was
submitted to Cumbria County Council this year. Nirex said engineers might
have to freeze surface sandstone to prevent water entering access shafts
during construction.
The test facility - and ultimately the repository itself - will be built in
dense volcanic rock underlying the sandstone. The volcanic rocks, equivalent
to a medium-strength granite, allow very little water to permeate as
minerals washed out of the rock, in hundreds of tiny fissures, form a
natural grout.
This is important as water seeping into the caverns could carry
radioactivity back to the surface.
Intermediate-level waste, including cladding from spent nuclear fuel,
filters, worn-out plant and equipment which has been in contact with
radioactive materials as well as isotopes used in medical treatment, will be
placed in steel containers. These will be filled to the brim with cement
before being stored underground.
Nirex said the steel drums and boxes would eventually corrode. It has
developed a chemical additive to a cement which will be used as a third
layer of protection, around the steel containers.
Dr Alan Hooper, Nirex science manager, said the company was seeking a patent
for the cement which was 'designed to inhibit radioactive particles from
dissolving in the water and will remain effective for thousands of years'.
Nirex is working with its French and Swedish equivalents ANDRA and SKB on a
Pounds 1m project to test methods of construction by building two tunnels
five metres in diameter, 430 metres below ground, at Aspo in Sweden. These
will be excavated by various techniques, from blasting to using a
tunnel-boring machine.
Mr Brendan Breen, Nirex's mining manager, said: 'I have never worked on a
project where the planning has been so meticulous but the consequences of
failure are so horrendous.'

FT  16 NOV 94 / Stores planned for radioactive waste worldwide
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Worldwide plans for the underground storage of intermediate and high-level
radioactive waste are:
UK
Some 27 per cent of the UK's electricity was produced by 35 reactors last
year. A site in Cumbria close to Sellafield has been identified for an
underground repository for mostly intermediate-level waste over 50 years.
The repository is expected to be ready in 2010.
FRANCE
Some 78 per cent of electricity was produced by 58 reactors last year. Two
sites are expected to be short-listed next year for an underground
repository for long-lived waste.
GERMANY
Some 34 per cent of electricity is produced by 19 nuclear plants. Two sites
are being considered for repositories - a former iron ore mine at Konrad and
a site at Gorleben, both in Lower Saxony. An abandoned salt mine at
Bartensleben in the former east German republic has been used since 1981 for
low and intermediate-level waste.
SWEDEN
In 1980 it was decided all nuclear power stations - which currently produce
about half of the country's electricity - would be to phased out by 2010.
The exact timetable is still to be established. Low and intermediate-level
waste is stored underground near the Forsmark nuclear plant, 50 metres below
the bed of the Baltic Sea. Investigations are continuing to identify a site
for high-level waste.
BELGIUM
Nuclear power produces 59 per cent of electricity. A potential site for the
disposal of high-level and long-lived radioactive waste was identified in
1974 at Mol-Dessel in northern Belgium, where an underground laboratory has
been working on feasibility studies since 1983.
FINLAND
Nuclear power stations produce 29 per cent of electricity. The country
already has a repository for low and intermediate level waste at Olkiluoto.
The search continues for a site for high-level waste.
US
Some 20 per cent of power is produced by 110 reactors. A site has been
identified under Yucca Mountain, Nevada, for a deep-level repository. An
underground laboratory is being constructed.
JAPAN
Some 31 per cent of electricity was produced by 48 nuclear plants last year.
The Power Reactor Fuel Development Corporation plans an underground
laboratory at Honrobe, on the island of Hokkaido, to study disposal of
high-level waste in sedimentary rock.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Porter challenges auditor's figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROB EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The district auditor in the case of alleged vote-rigging by Westminster City
Council was yesterday accused of failing to apply 'fundamental accounting
concepts'.
The accusation was levelled by Mr Michael Wheeler, a senior partner at
Chantrey Vellacott, an accountancy firm, who was called to give evidence to
the public inquiry yesterday by Dame Shirley Porter, former council leader.
He said Mr John Magill, the district auditor and a senior partner at the
accountants Touche Ross, had been inconsistent over certain costs and had
confused capital and revenue expenditure.
Lawyers for Dame Shirley are challenging the district auditor's calculation
that she and nine others should pay a surcharge of Pounds 21.25m to make
good losses through the designated sales scheme.
Mr Wheeler said the scheme had made a profit of Pounds 361,000. Mr Magill
calculated the biggest single item as Pounds 13m - the cost of selling
council properties at a discount instead of their open market prices. Mr
Wheeler said it was 'invalid' to assume they would have been sold at the
higher prices.
The inquiry was adjourned until tomorrow.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Hualon accused over competition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hualon Corporation of Taiwan has been accused of planning to go back on
its pledge not to compete directly with European producers at its projected
Belfast textiles plant.
The British Apparel and Textile Confederation is appealing to the European
Court against the European Commission's approval of Pounds 61m in government
aid for the Pounds 157m project.
Mr James McAdam, confederation chairman, told its annual convention that
remarks by the company 'have strengthened the grounds of our appeal'.
He said the commission's decision to approve the aid 'was based almost
entirely on assurances, given by Northern Ireland's Industrial Development
Board, that production from the plant would be high-volume goods of low
added value to compete with low cost imports'.
But he said the company had 'stated that the opposite is the case and that
the output of the plant will be high added-value products competing directly
with existing European production. This is in conflict with what the
government has contended'.
The confederation says the project makes poor use of taxpayers' money, and
claims there is 20 per cent overcapacity in the European Union.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Channel link bill expected next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Draft legislation to allow construction of a Pounds 2.7bn rail link between
the Channel tunnel and London is expected to be put to parliament on
November 24.
The rail link bill will be one of the first pieces of legislation considered
in the new session of parliament, which starts today with the Queen's
Speech. It will mark the start of a parliamentary process expected to take
up to two years.
Provided there are no unforeseen difficulties in the passage of the bill,
construction should start in early 1997 for completion in 2002. The fast
rail link will cut 30 minutes off the three-hour journey between London and
Paris.
The route, which passes under the river Thames near Gravesend before
crossing Stratford and east London to St Pancras station, has been decided -
although small variations are allowed within a designated 'envelope'.
Even so, the legislation is expected to prompt several thousand protests
from residents and other interested parties along the 68-mile route.
The bill takes the form of a 'hybrid bill' under Commons procedures covering
legislation involving both public and private interests.
It is expected to be given its first reading next Thursday and could receive
its second reading by Christmas before going into committee for detailed
consideration.
Protestors will be able to petition the select com-mittee which considers
the bill.
In parallel with the passage of the bill through parliament, the Department
of Transport will select a consortium to build and operate the rail link.
Four consortia were shortlisted in August. They are Eurorail, including BICC
and GEC; Hochtief and Costain; London and Continental including Blue Circle,
National Express and Virgin; and Union Link, including Holzmann, Mowlem and
Taylor Woodrow.
Bids must be made by March 14 and the government will decide on the winning
consortium by late next year. This decision will be influenced by the degree
of risk which the bidder is prepared to take on and the amount of
public-sector subsidy it requires.
The public-sector contribution will include Union Railways, the company
which has developed the project, European Passenger Services, which operates
the Eurostar high-speed trains, and surplus railway land at King's Cross in
London. The consortium that builds the route will be granted a 999-year
lease to operate services.
It will be expected to provide timetable slots for Kent commuter services
between the high-speed cross-Channel expresses.
Regular Eurostar services between London, Paris and Brussels started on
Monday. Two trains leave London daily for each Continental destination but
this will increase to 15 a day by next summer.

   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manchester Airport yesterday reported record passenger figures of 1.4m for
October - 8 per cent up on October last year and more than the airport's
annual total 30 years ago.
The continuing growth brought the airport's moving annual total of
passengers carried to 14.72m, 12 per cent ahead of last year's total. The
airport expects to reach 15m passengers this year.
The increases came in spite of the withdrawal of British Airways' Los
Angeles service, Canadian Airlines' flights to Toronto, South African
Airways' Johannesburg service and the suspension until spring of American
Airlines' New York flights.
However, Aer Lingus has started a New York service from Manchester,
Uzbekistan Airways has a route to Tashkent and France's Regional airline has
started a service to Lille. The airport offers 175 destinations, flown by 95
airlines.
Frequencies were increased on services between Manchester and Rome,
Brussels, Amsterdam and Glasgow. Lauda Air will double its Vienna return
flights to two a day from next March.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Prosaic truth disappoints conspiracy theorists: The reasons
for Sarah Hogg's impending departure from John Major's inner circle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The impending departure of Mrs Sarah Hogg from 10 Downing Street leaves
vacant one of the most important and gruelling jobs in Whitehall.
Mr John Major's choice as her successor to head the prime minister's policy
unit will do much to set the strategic direction for his government in the
approach to the next general election.
Conspiracy theorists were quick to see all kinds of dark motives in the
announcement that Mrs Hogg plans to step down in the new year.
Among the prime minister's enemies on the Tory right it will be claimed as a
victory for their long-running campaign to force him to sack her. Mrs Hogg,
a former economics journalist, was after all one of the strongest supporters
of British membership of the European exchange rate mechanism.
The truth is more prosaic. Mrs Hogg, brought in by Mr Major just after he
entered Number 10, decided some months ago that she needed a change.
She told Mr Major then that she did not want to stay for the next election.
To allow her successor time to work into the job meant leaving at the turn
of this year.
Her decision was based on the simple judgment that four years is enough in a
job which demands 16 hours a day and seven days a week. It is no accident
that none of three predecessors since 1979 has stayed for more than one
election.
Once it was decided that Mr Jonathan Hill, the prime minister's political
secretary, was to be replaced, Downing Street decided to announce Mrs Hogg's
departure now rather than let the news seep out.
Her tenure has coincided with the roughest period for any prime minister
since the late 1960s. As one of his closest confidantes she has taken her
share of the blame for the string of disasters.
The policy unit, an odd mixture of political appointees and career civil
servants, acts as the prime minister's principal alternative source of
advice. It is also his agent in ensuring his policies are followed by the
departmental baronies which hold the real levers of power across Whitehall.
Britain's system of government is more fragmented than generally
appreciated. Mr Major alone around the cabinet table does not have a large
department to do his bidding. He can hire and fire ministers. Ensuring that
his priorities are theirs is more difficult.
Mrs Hogg saw her role as providing Mr Major with strategic thinking on the
main policy issues and with ensuring that his views were well represented in
Whitehall.
She was particularly influential in the replacement of the poll tax by the
council tax, in shaping the government's position on the Gatt world trade
talks, in education policy and in the development of the Citizen's Charter.
She has been a bridge from Number 10 to the Treasury in shaping post-ERM
economic policy, particularly the private-finance initiative.
The 48-year-old Mrs Hogg has not been without her critics beyond the Tory
right. Some accused her of 'meddling' in the detail of policy rather than
concentrating on strategic direction. Others blamed her for the debacle over
the ill-fated 'back-to-basics' campaign. But those brickbats go with the
job.
In choosing her successor, however, the prime minister will be able to
complete a radical shake-up of his inner circle designed to give a fresh
political edge to policymaking. It is understood that he has a candidate in
mind but no firm decision has yet been taken.
Contrary to recent rumours Mr Major is working well with Mr David Hunt, the
senior minister charged with knocking heads together on key cabinet
committees. Mr Christopher Meyer, his press secretary, has proved adept in
avoiding presentational banana-skins. Mr Howell James, who will replace Mr
Hill as political secretary, has a reputation for shrewdness.
Mrs Hogg, meanwhile, has yet to give much thought to her next job. But
enemies as well as friends acknowledged yesterday that she will not find it
difficult to secure a high-profile post in the private sector.

FT  16 NOV 94 / 'Sleaze' judge refuses to be swayed by PM's views
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Nolan, the judge heading the committee of inquiry into standards of
conduct in public life, has made clear that he will not be swayed by the
prime minister's view that MPs should continue to have the right to enjoy
outside business interests.
As the government tries to recover from allegations of 'sleaze' against
senior Tory MPs, Lord Nolan has said that Mr John Major's views on this are
to be regarded as a personal expression which stand alongside those of any
MP.
Mr Major said in his Mansion House speech on Monday night that parliament
emphasised that Britain 'would not benefit from a monastic Commons' and that
politicians 'must know how this world works'.
Lord Nolan is understood to have told committee members that Mr Major's
views should not sway their examination of whether MPs should have business
interests.
He has not ruled out the possibility that the prime minister could be
summoned to give evidence to the committee.
The Nolan committee agreed yesterday to produce an interim report into its
activities before the end of the year. The committee is examining written
submissions from members of the public.
Lord Nolan also agreed to set up three separate sub-committees to examine
the activities of MPs, the ability of ministers and civil servants to move
to private companies, and appointments to quangos.
Mr Tom King, the former Northern Ireland secretary, is among the three
committee members examining whether former ministers can move to the private
sector, in spite of his declaration in the register of members' interests of
directorships.
Lord Nolan is understood to believe that there is no conflict of interest in
this.

FT  16 NOV 94 / EU fraud 'will force Tory revolt'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A report exposing massive waste and fraud in the European Union will prompt
a substantial Conservative revolt against legislation increasing Britain's
contributions to the EU, Tory Euro-sceptics said yesterday.
Ministers sought to play down the report, by the EU's Court of Auditors,
which said it was impossible to estimate how much money went astray from the
Ecu64.2bn (Pounds 50.52bn) of EU funds paid out last year.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, praised the court for exposing the
fraud. 'It is much better that it should be revealed than that it should lie
hidden,' he said on BBC Radio.
But Mr Bill Cash, a leading Euro-sceptic backbencher, said the report raised
'a very important question as to the extent to which the British taxpayer
should continue to pour money into this bottomless, fraudulent pit'.
Underlining the potential threat to the government, Sir Marcus Fox, chairman
of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers, warned Tory MPs not to
underestimate the impact of a rebel victory.
He said: 'It is a matter of confidence. If there is any amendment or defeat,
the consequences to the government are quite obvious. We shall end up with a
general election.'
Rightwingers dismissed cabinet attempts to shore up support for the
contributions bill, which the Treasury says will increase the UK's net
payment to the EU by Pounds 75m next year, and around Pounds 250m a year by
the end of the decade.
Many also claimed that only a big surprise in the legislative package to be
unveiled in today's Queen's Speech could save the government from a severe
mauling when the bill is tabled later this year.
Ministers are resigned to a battle with the Euro-sceptics, but plan to limit
parliamentary manoeuvring by ensuring that the bill is sufficiently tightly
drafted to head off backbench amendments.
Labour and the Liberal Democrats will try to embarrass the government by
calling for amendments to the Common Agricultural Policy, but will not seek
to defeat the central thrust of the bill, which both parties support.
Rightwingers said the timing of the EU report might help to stiffen support
for a backbench challenge to Mr John Major's leadership of the Tory party,
which constitutionally has to be mounted within the next two weeks or
delayed until next winter.
Few mainstream MPs believe that any candidate can defeat Mr Major, although
some say that a 'stalking horse' candidate such as Mr Norman Lamont, the
disaffected former chancellor, could clear the way for a further contest
next year.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Building societies' body urges rights for borrowers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About 7m people who have mortgages with building societies would be given
new rights to vote on issues affecting societies if proposals put forward by
the sector's trade association are accepted by the government.
The Building Societies Association, responding to a consultation paper from
the Treasury which marked the second stage in its review of societies'
powers, said that borrowers should have voting rights like investing
members.
But it dismissed two key suggestions made by the Treasury for making
societies more accountable. These were the setting up of consultative
committees of members and requiring societies to reserve some board places
for candidates nominated by 'ordinary members'.
As mutual institutions, societies are owned by their customers who are
members, rather than being responsible to shareholders.
The debate on what wider powers societies should be given to enable them to
compete more effectively in the retail financial services sector has focused
attention on how far in practice members can hold societies to account and
whether this form of ownership gives them an unfair advantage.
The association says that societies should give members more information, in
an accessible form, about their role as members rather than simply as
customers. To encourage this the association plans to issue guidance to
societies and a leaflet for general distribution.
It says that putting members in a better position to exercise their
membership rights would balance giving societies the wider and more flexible
powers it strongly supports.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Plea on livestock granted
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Exporters of veal calves yesterday won permission to bring an early High
Court challenge to a ban on using Coventry airport to fly livestock to the
Continent.
Phoenix Aviation and CC Freight, a consortium of farmers and cattle dealers,
said they were given permission to use the airport this month. But the
Labour-led city council, which owns the airport and has come under pressure
from animal rights activists, said no decision had been taken and it was
entitled to suspend flights.
Sir Christopher Prout QC, for Phoenix and CC Freight, told the High Court
that farmers faced losing long-established Continental markets.
He told Mr Justice Tucker the trade had been hit by the refusal of ferries
to ship live animals. Sir Christopher asked for leave to seek judicial
review on the grounds that the council had acted unlawfully and
unreasonably.
Mr Stuart Isaacs, for the council, said no decision had been taken on the
transportation of veal calves from the airport, and the council was still
considering the issue.
Mr Justice Tucker ordered that a full court hearing be expedited and
extended an injunction allowing Phoenix to continue the flights pending the
High Court's ruling.
Ferrylink Freight Service has halted livestock shipments to the Continent
after taking one such shipment from Sheerness, Kent, to the Netherlands last
week.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Power use rise shows economic growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Evidence of economic growth strengthened yesterday when PowerGen, the power
generator, said overall demand for electricity in England and Wales rose 3
per cent in the six months to October after three years of stagnation.
The company, reporting a 9 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 118m,
said the growth in demand was 'due to increased consumption in the
industrial and commercial sectors, indicating a general upturn in economic
activity'.
The increase compares with current annual growth forecasts in the National
Grid's seven-year statement of 1.3 per cent.
In the six months to the end of September electricity demand was 123.3
terrawatt hours, against 119.7 in the comparable six months of last year and
1992, 119.9 in 1991 and 118.9 in 1990.
The precise correlation between growth in electricity demand and economic
growth is debatable but a rough rule of thumb in the industry is that power
demand growth is usually about two-thirds of the expansion in gross domestic
product.
Offer, the electricity industry regulator, yesterday announced the terms of
reference for a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into Scottish
Hydro-Electric's controls, but said it had no plans to reconsider price
controls for the sector.
It said it was working on licence amendments arising from changes in
controls on Scottish Power and the 12 regional electricity companies in
England and Wales. It expected to publish the changes in the next few weeks.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer, said he had asked
the monopolies commission to report within six months on the distribution
and supply price controls of Hydro-Electric and the 'hydro benefit'
provision which provides for a transfer of revenue from the generation
business to distribution and transmission.
Hydro-Electric was the only company to reject price controls announced this
year by Prof Littlechild to take effect from next April. It was this that
triggered the referral to the commission.

FT  16 NOV 94 / BT adds services to interactive trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications has delayed the start of trials for its
interactive television project until the middle of next year to add a wider
range of services than simply video-on-demand.
The 2,500-home trial in the Colchester and Ipswich area will offer home
shopping, banking and educational programming as well as the film and
television service that had been scheduled to start in the spring.
Shopping-on-demand will be offered under individual brands. Thomas Cook will
offer holidays and travel, Sears fashion and sporting goods and WH Smith
books, compact discs and videos. A grocery service will be developed by
Safeway stores.
Mr Rupert Gavin, director of BT's information, communication and
entertainment programme, said yesterday: 'In order to test the capability of
interactive TV, it is important to offer consumers a wide range of
services.'
Technical trials in 60 homes showed it was possible to send good quality
pictures in digital form down ordinary telephone lines at the same time as
the lines were being used for a telephone conversation.
BT, which has a telephone network linking 20m homes, found the technology
had a wider than expected range. This suggested 92 per cent of the network
could handle interactive services.
The first commercial trial is likely to cost more than Pounds 30m. BT should
have enough information by the end of next year to decide whether to roll
out the service across the UK, which could cost several billion pounds.
BT wants to find out what services people are prepared to pay for and what
is the best method of charging.
The commercial trial will include monthly subscriptions, paying for
individual items and a mixture of the two.
Included in the service will be 600 hours of television, 400 hours of films
and 200 hours of music, all regularly updated.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Users' council hits out at electricity meter charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The electricity supply industry is facing strong criticism from industrial
consumers amid fears that it will implement significant rises in charges
associated with meter reading.
The Major Energy Users' Council said yesterday that there were proposals to
lift the metering charge levied on customers in the competitive market -
those using more than 100kw of electricity - from Pounds 200 this year to
between Pounds 360 and Pounds 630 in 1995-96.
The Electricity Pool, which helps to administer the metering payments
system, described the council's figures as speculative. No decisions had yet
been made on the charge.
Nonetheless, some electricity companies were pushing for large rises,
arguing that Pounds 200 did not cover costs.
The large energy users' anger results mainly from severe shortcomings in the
metering system - including data collection and computerised bill
settlements - since about 45,000 mainly industrial and commercial sites
joined the competitive market in April this year.
The users' council said: 'The electricity companies who have been quick to
enjoy the benefits of the privatised environment must now accept the
consequences of failure and cover the costs of the mistakes themselves.'
The pool said the costs of metering for the competitive market were still
being examined following the first year of competition for users of more
than 100kw. Decisions still had to be made about the correct allocation of
costs.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Bigger rises for British boards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors of UK-listed companies receive bigger pay rises than their
counterparts in foreign-owned companies, a survey showed yesterday.
Half received basic salary increases of 7.4 per cent or more, compared with
a median rise of 5.2 per cent for directors of foreign-owned companies
including Mobil Oil of the US and Japanese-owned Toyota.
The survey by Hay Management Consultants analysed more than 11,000 senior
managers and directors in 476 organisations in the 12 months to July.
Inflation is now 2.2 per cent, while average increases are edging towards
3.75 per cent, the survey said.
The median increase - including bonus - for UK board directors was 11.2 per
cent. Mr Richard Bednarek of Hay said that while the figure seemed high,
earnings per share had risen 20 per cent.
He said: 'The higher bonus earnings this year are indicative of the strength
of the recovery in the UK and are not unexpected at this stage of the
economic cycle.'
The highest-paid sectors were insurance, oil, and retail. The lowest-paid
sector was engineering.
Of the 227 non-executive directors surveyed, most were paid between Pounds
15,000 and Pounds 25,000 for an average of 17 days' work a year.
The mid-level of pay for non-executive chairmen was Pounds 68,000 for an
average of 70 days a year.
This is the latest in a series of recent directors' pay surveys that has
found their rises are well ahead of inflation.
According to another survey City managerial salaries have risen by even
greater amounts on average. Day Associates says that managerial pay in City
institutions, including bonus, went up 15.2 per cent in the year to August.

<TEXT>
Sales of National Lottery tickets continued yesterday at a level not far
behind Monday's total of 7.5m, Raymond Snoddy writes.
Camelot, the lottery operator, said that by 6pm last night a 14m Pounds 1
tickets had been sold in the lottery's first two days, far above
expectations.
The sales are being helped by enormous publicity before Saturday's first
multi-million pound jackpot draw. Camelot estimates that the top prize will
be at least Pounds 2m and if the current level of interest is sustained it
could be much higher.
After only two days of ticket sales the five causes that will benefit from
the lottery - arts, charities, national heritage, the millennium fund and
sport - are already guaranteed a total payment of about Pounds 4m.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Doctors attack move to local pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Medical Association clashed with the government yesterday over
doctors' and nurses' pay when Dr Sandy Macara, its chairman, wrote to MPs
outlining its opposition to local pay deals.
Dr Macara told MPs that local deals for doctors would be 'a further nail in
the coffin of the idea of the National Health Service, in which doctors work
for the service as a whole and not for individual competing businesses'.
The BMA was reacting to reports that the government had been pressing the
Doctors' and Dentists' Review Body to recommend no national pay rise for
doctors next year but to let hospital trusts strike deals locally. The
confrontation has been building for some time as the review bodies take
evidence for their pay determinations next year.
The BMA is concerned that, given the increasing deficits among a number of
trusts, such a system would lead to some trusts being in a position to pay
more than others.
The government's evidence to the review bodies, put forward this month by Mr
Gerald Malone, the health minister, came as no surprise to NHS staff aware
of ministers' intentions to see locally determined health service pay. The
government argues that any across-the-board recommendations would inhibit
such developments.
Dr Macara called the government's insistence on local pay 'an expensive
distraction to NHS trusts, a divisive force in the NHS and a threat to the
integrity of patient care'.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, yesterday affirmed the
government's intention to move towards local agreements. She said: 'It is
clear last year was a transitional year and we will move to more local pay
and that is under way.'

FT  16 NOV 94 / Abbey National boosts direct line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbey National, the home loans and banking group, is to expand its telephone
finance operation by an extra 250 jobs in the next three years.
Mr Peter Sunderland, director for direct distribution, said customers would
be offered financial services by telephone from March next year. The first
50 jobs would be advertised this week.
The new jobs will be based in Glasgow, where Abbey's life insurance division
is located, and will take the number of Abbey staff in the city to more than
1,500.
The existing Abbey National Direct operation employs 90 people in
Bournemouth and can handle 250,000 telephone calls a year.
Although Abbey has had a telephone operation since 1989, it has focused on
mortgages and related products. This move should allow it to offer a wider
range of life insurance, investment and pensions policies on the telephone.
One area of expansion could be general insurance, when Abbey's joint venture
with Commercial Union, the UK's largest insurance company, starts next year.
The group emphasised, however, that it saw the telephone business as an
extra service for customers rather than as a stand-alone operation.
Abbey's move comes as competition intensifies in telephone banking and
financial services. Last week Direct Line, the telephone insurance company
owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, took a further step towards offering life
insurance when it was accepted by the Personal Investment Authority, the
watchdog to protect the private investor.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Housing group raises cash from US markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A housing association has broken new ground by borrowing long-term funds in
the US capital markets.
Sanctuary Housing Association, the fifth-biggest in the country, has raised
Dollars 75m (Pounds 47.3m) by placing bonds privately with a group of four
US insurance companies and pension funds. The deal, the first overseas
borrowing by a housing association, was organised by Hambros, the merchant
bank.
Mr David Bennett, managing director of Hertford-based Sanctuary, said: 'We
are delighted to bring this major new funding option forward to the US
housing sector.' Sanctuary owns more than 19,000 houses and flats.
Housing associations, which provide low-cost rented accommodation or
home-ownership schemes, control about 4 per cent of the housing stock.
The government reduced its support in 1988 - grants now account for only
about 50 per cent of annual capital funding - and housing associations have
been active borrowers in the UK markets.
Funding has sometimes been both expensive and difficult in the UK, prompting
associations to look elsewhere.
Mr David Knowlton, director of finance at Sanctuary, said: 'A number of
associations have been waiting for somebody to dip their toe in the water.
This opens up the market for other associations.'
Mr Charles Arbuthnot of Hambros said the funds, repayable over 17 years,
were obtained at a cost of 120 basis points - a basis point is one hundredth
of a percentage point - over the equivalent US treasury bond rate.
Mr Arbuthnot said the proceeds were swapped into sterling, with the overall
cost secured at a 'competitive rate'. Exact terms were not disclosed.
The funds, in common with other loans, will be repaid from Sanctuary's
rental income of about Pounds 30m a year.
The Housing Corporation, which funds and monitors the work of housing
associations, said: 'There has been nothing like this in the housing
association sector before. It is innovative and unique.'

FT  16 NOV 94 / Yorkshire Bank courts mid-sized companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Growing competition among banks to lend to medium-sized companies was
indicated yesterday when Yorkshire Bank, a subsidiary of National Australia
Bank, unveiled plans to increase its share of the market.
Yorkshire Bank offered a 1 percentage point reduction for a year on interest
rates on new capital investment loans of up to Pounds 2m. It also offered to
remove arrangement fees for companies transferring loans of up to Pounds 10m
from other banks.
Mr Tom Gallagher, the bank's chief executive, warned that loan covenants -
the financial terms which borrowers must meet if loans are not to be
withdrawn - were being loosened by large banks because of growing
competition to lend.
He said: 'I see signs in this market that some banks are prepared to lower
their lending standards. I cannot believe it. What on earth have they
learned?' Many banks suffered losses following unwise lending in the late
1980s.
Although margins on syndicated loans to the biggest companies have narrowed
sharply in the past year, Yorkshire Bank's move is one of the first
indications that competition is spreading to the mid-sized corporate sector.
Mr Gallagher said that the bank, which has Pounds 4bn in assets and 130,000
business customers, had no target for lending but wanted to add to market
share.
He said the bank was 'sending a signal' that it would be competing more
strongly for medium-sized companies' business.
He added: 'We will move with Yorkshire caution, but we are very determined
to gradually extend our footprint.'
The move to cut lending rates under a 'business investment loan' package,
which is available until March 31, was welcomed by Mr Stan Mendham, founder
of the Forum of Private Business, who said it was a small move towards
reducing costs.
Mr Peter Coleman, head of commercial banking, said it would concentrate on
covenants relating to cashflow instead of being overdependent on securing
loans. He said: 'We will not tie them with superfluous covenants just to
give us comfort.'

Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's president elect, looked set to emerge
as the big winner in yesterday's gubernatorial elections after candidates
from his Social Democracy party (PSDB) were shown by exit polls to have
easily won the three most important states.
According to polling agency Ibope, PSDB candidates were set to win in Sao
Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais, which together account for more than
40 per cent of Brazil's voters.
The PSDB and its allies also appeared set to win the big northern state of
Para and the north-eastern state of Bahia.
Elections were held in 17 states and the capital, Braslia. The remaining
nine states decided their governors last month. First results from
yesterday's polls are expected today.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Trade unions and farmers in interest rate protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Trade unionists, farmers and consumer groups yesterday protested over rising
interest rates in a rally on the steps of the Federal Reserve building in
Washington, writes Nancy Dunne. A further rate rise would 'clobber job
prospects, squeeze wages, and raise mortgages and other loan payments for
millions of Americans,' a rally leaflet said.
Concern over interest rates is shared by some businessmen and economists who
believe the Fed and bond market have not taken account of the competitive
conditions in the global economy which curb inflation.
At a briefing last week sponsored by two Washington think-tanks - the
Economic Strategy Institute and the Economic Policy Institute - a panel of
economists and businessmen attacked what has been the fastest tightening of
interest rates since the second world war.
Mr Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers,
said a majority of chief executive officers in NAM opposed further interest
rate rises at present. 'There is no evidence that the US economy is about to
overheat, and any further rise in interest rates will simply stifle a
steadily growing economy,' he said.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Fed sees growth flying too fast for comfort: Why interest
rates have risen by  3/4 of a percentage point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Members of the Federal Reserve's policy-setting Open Markets Committee had
probably made up their minds long before they met yesterday that they needed
to raise interest rates sharply to cool down the economy.
But if they had any last-minute doubts, statistics on retail sales and
industrial production published just as they sat down in Washington offered
more evidence of 'persistent strength in economic activity and high and
rising levels of resource utilisation'. This underlined their belief in the
need to raise interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point, and
not the half point the financial markets had assumed.
Retail sales jumped by 1.1 per cent in October and by 7.5 per cent over the
last year, led by sectors sensitive to higher interest rates such as cars,
furniture and building materials. Industrial production rose 0.7 per cent to
stand 6.7 per cent higher than a year ago. Manufacturing production rose 0.9
per cent in October and 7.8 per cent over the last year.
These latest statistics provide further evidence that even though the US
economy is now in its third year of recovery from recession, it is still
barely slowing from a pace that, for a fully industrialised country, can be
counted as torrid. If the 6.3 per cent annualised rate of gross domestic
product growth recorded in the fourth quarter of 1993 was a freak on the
high side, the 3.3 per cent rate of the first quarter of this year was
abnormally low, partly because of the California earthquake.
Growth at a 4.1 per cent rate in the second quarter and at 3.4 per cent in
the third quarter - and accelerating again in the fourth quarter, according
to many Wall Street economists - remains much faster than the roughly 2.5
per cent pace the Fed would be comfortable with as sustainable without
giving way to a surge in inflation. Although there have been some recent
signs of slowdown, by most measures the economy is humming along at very
close to full capacity.
The number of payroll jobs has risen by 2.6m in the first 10 months of this
year, bringing unemployment down to 5.8 per cent last month, lower than the
point at which most economists estimate that labour shortages start to make
themselves felt in the shape of higher wage demands.
Job creation has been even stronger than measured by the Labour Department's
statistics. A statistical adjustment added another 760,000 new jobs to the
figures for last March.
Interpretation of the unemployment statistics is rendered more hazardous
because of a radical change introduced earlier this year in the way the data
are collected. Nevertheless, anecdotal signs of labour market pressures are
showing up even though aggregate numbers show wage inflation still to be
well under control.
Yesterday's industrial production data, too, showed tightness in
manufacturing industry. The overall industrial capacity utilisation rate of
84.9 per cent in October is the highest recorded since the Fed revised its
statistical series in 1982, topping the rate of 84.8 per cent recorded at
the very peak of the last business cycle. A utilisation rate of 84.6 per
cent for manufacturing industry is only just below the last cyclical peak of
85.1 per cent.
These statistics are problematic, for it is uncertain how much capacity has
expanded as a result of the heavy corporate investment of the last two
years. Yet here, too, signs of capacity constraints are showing up.
Purchasing managers report longer delivery times from suppliers, and
manufacturers are increasingly turning overseas for supplies, especially for
steel.
Indeed, the US trade deficit - September's figure is to be announced on
Friday and is expected to be unrepentantly large - can be read on one level
as confirmation that US demand is growing faster than the domestic economy
can supply. With the world's other major economies pulling out of their own
recessions, their eagerness to export may diminish, and with it the brake
they put on US manufacturers' ability to raise prices.
If these indicators all point to inflationary pressures, the one place where
inflation is scarcely showing its face is in the price indices. The consumer
price index remains resolutely well-behaved: today's announcement of the
October index is expected by Wall Street economists to show an increase of
around 0.2 per cent from September, which would lower the year on year rate
to around 2.8 per cent. Warning lights can be found in segments of the
producer price data but the overall index remains resolutely well behaved.
But the Fed wants - and the financial markets want the Fed to want - to
control inflation before it shows its face. The difficult judgment is
whether the Fed's five interest rate increases between February and August,
together with yesterday's increase, have tightened monetary policy enough to
chill the economy.
The response to the Fed's actions comes with 'long and variable lags,' as
economists like to put it. In the housing sector, for example, the immediate
response to higher interest rates may be a rush of buyers, anxious not to
miss the boat before rates move higher yet. And Fed governors have been
scolding banks for taking some of the sting out of their efforts to raise
interest rates by relaxing their own credit terms.
They must now hope their decision to raise interest rates by  3/4 of a point
 -the largest adjustment the Fed has made in interest rates since 1980,
which banks charge each other on overnight balances held at the Fed - will
not jam the brakes on the economy so hard that it plunges into recession.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Fewer high rollers in New York: Rolls-Royce's Manhattan
dealer is closing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manhattan residents who want a Rolls-Royce will soon have to head, at least
for a time, for unfashionable Long Island - or to suburban New Jersey or
Connecticut - to buy one.
Carriage House Motors, which claims to have been the UK luxury carmaker's
biggest dealer for most of the past decade, closes its doors on Manhattan's
East 61st Street next month. Demand for one of the ultimate car status
symbols is not what it was.
Mr Michael Schudroff, owner of Carriage House and one of the world's biggest
collectors of vintage Rolls-Royces, says: 'People are looking at them
differently these days. The 1990s is not a time to be flamboyant.' So far
this year, Mr Schudroff says he has sold 65 new Rolls-Royces and around 185
'pre-owned' ones. That is a far cry from the late 1980s, when he was selling
around 550 a year, 200 of them new.
The US recession also had something to do with the fall in sales in the
early 1990s, along with a new luxury sales tax which adds 10 per cent to the
price of each vehicle - though many other parts of the US car market have
bounced back in the last two years.
The rising cost of maintaining premises in Manhattan has finally persuaded
Mr Schudroff to move to Greenwich, Connecticut. With smaller premises, he is
preparing to sell a large part of his vintage collection: on December 10,
Sotheby's in New York will auction around 50 vehicles, including cars once
owned by Diana Rigg, David Niven and Bahrain's ruler.
Mr Robert Warren, head of Rolls-Royce's North American business, concedes
the loss of the Manhattan dealer will leave the company unrepresented in an
important market. The company has already been approached by other Manhattan
dealers hoping to be awarded the Rolls-Royce franchise, and he expects to
name a new dealer shortly.
Whoever gets the New York dealership would do well to heed a warning from Mr
Schudroff: 'If you take a car for a test drive, you're lucky if you don't
get whacked by a taxi.'

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The new Republican leadership in Congress is threatening to take away the
limited voting rights in the House of Representatives enjoyed by the
District of Columbia and to downgrade the status of the congressional
committee responsible for the nation's capital.
Mrs Eleanor Holmes Norton, the DC delegate, emerged from a meeting with Mr
Newt Gingrich, certain to be the next Speaker of the House, promising to
fight his proposals.
But the return of Mr Marion Barry as Washington's mayor after a four-year
hiatus combined with Republican control of the legislature threatens the
city, already in a deep budgetary crisis, with the probability of an
extremely unsympathetic reception on Capitol Hill.
Under current procedure Mrs Norton, first elected in 1990, may serve on
House committees, address the floor of the chamber and vote when the House
sits as 'a committee of the whole'. But her votes on actual legislation are
not recorded. The nation's capital has no representation in the Senate.
Mr Gingrich reportedly told her that he intended to take away the limited
voting privilege and deprive her of the right to speak when the House
considered the District's affairs.
Mrs Norton received some support for her stand yesterday from Congresswoman
Connie Morella, the moderate Republican representing the wealthy Maryland
suburb immediately north of the city.
She agreed that it would be unfair to reduce the District, whose citizens
pay federal income taxes, to the status of the four offshore protectorates -
Puerto Rico, Guam, the American Virgin Islands and American Samoa.

The Clinton administration is considering a new policy which could ease
restrictions on US foreign arms sales by taking into account the financial
health of the nation's defence industry, defence officials said yesterday,
Reuter reports from Washington. Such a step could be a boon to the
struggling US arms industry, hit hard by Pentagon budget cuts and falling
overseas military sales.
The defence officials, who asked not to be identified, said President Bill
Clinton had not given final approval to the plan, and they stressed that US
national security interests would remain as the chief factor in deciding
whether to sell arms to other countries.
The Los Angeles Times reported yesterday that the US defence industry had
won a big victory and that the administration was preparing to adopt the new
policy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trade unionists, farmers and consumer groups yesterday protested over rising
interest rates in a rally at the steps of the Federal Reserve building in
Washington.
A rate rise for the sixth time this year to counter the threat of inflation
would 'clobber job prospects, squeeze wages, and raise mortgages and other
loan payments for millions of Americans,' according to a rally leaflet.
Popular concern about rising interest rates is shared by some business
groups and economists. They believe the Fed and the bond market have grown
'paranoid' over inflation and have failed to take account of the the
competitive conditions in the global economy which curb inflation.
At a briefing last week sponsored by two Washington think-tanks - the
Economic Strategy Institute and the Economic Policy Institute - a panel of
economists and businessmen attacked what has been the fastest tightening of
interest rates since the second world war.
Mr Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers,
said a majority of chief executive officers in NAM opposed further interest
rate rises.
'There is no evidence the US economy is about to overheat, and any further
rise in interest rates will simply stifle a steadily growing economy,' said
Mr Jasinowski.
The US can now produce more with less inflation, he said. 'While
productivity growth was highest in the manufacturing sector from 1983 to
1993, price increases in manufacturing were the lowest.'
Mr James Medoff, a Harvard economics professor, said businesses, already
burdened by high levels of corporate debt, have been forced to cut
employment and make use of temporary workers and overtime. 'Large wage
increases are a last resort by firms seeking additional labour.'
The Fed's concern about inflation may have inflamed the fears of foreign
investors and currency traders, causing them to sell dollars, increasing the
possibility of inflation, said Mr Medoff. 'The difficulties for the dollar
began just when the interest rate increase began, and the sequence of events
in the markets in February suggests that the Fed's action was the cause of
the dollar's decline rather than a response to the dollar's decline,' he
said. Mr Preston Martin, former Fed vice chairman, warned that continued
rises next year 'portends too great a recession risk.'

FT  16 NOV 94 / Saudi businessmen reach for the media stars: Roula Khalaf
tracks a crowded race for dominance of the Mideast satellite television
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROULA KHALAF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rival Saudi Arabian businessmen are spending close to Dollars 1bn in a race
to become the Middle East's media moguls. Seduced by the glamour of the
media age, and driven by an urge to influence the content of information and
entertainment in one of the world's most conservative societies, they are
already beaming more than 20 satellite television channels across the
region.
Satellite dishes have proliferated on rooftops in the area since the Gulf
war with more than 400,000 in Saudi Arabia alone, in spite of a
long-standing ban on dishes. CNN and Star TV, among others, opened a window
to the world for people who had to contend for years with heavy - handed
censorship of state-owned channels. Programming is so poor in some places
that viewers look forward to the commercial breaks, and rent tapes of
commercials from video shops.
Saudi businessmen have rushed to capitalise on the new wave. They knew that
the satellite intrusion was unnerving conservative governments. It was no
longer acceptable for the image of an embracing couple on American shows
such as Dallas or Dynasty, for example, to be frozen and substituted with a
channel's logo, a common practice on some state-owned television stations.
The would-be media magnates reckoned they could please both governments and
viewers by launching a series of agreeable but sanitised channels.
Three rival Saudis have led the quest for the Middle East's satellite
viewers (there are an estimated 1m to 2.5m dishes in the Middle East):
Sheikh Walid Al Ibrahim, a businessman whose sister is the wife of King
Fahd; Sheikh Saleh Kamel, the billionaire owner of Islamic banking group
Dallah Al-Baraka; and Emir Khalid Ibn Abdallah Ibn Abdel Rahman, who is
married to the King's sister, and is head of the Mawarid Group, one of the
kingdom's largest conglomerates. Mr Al Ibrahim started the trend in 1991
when he enlisted Mr Kamel's financial support to launch the Middle East
Broadcasting Centre (MBC), the first pan - Arab satellite television
station, which quickly gathered an audience of 27m as some Arab countries
picked up the MBC signal and rebroadcast it. MBC, broadcast from London, is
self-censored but its seeming independence from government control and its
news programmes' international flavour - it has an office in Jerusalem, for
instance - have made it popular in the region.
Last year Mr Kamel sold his stake in MBC to launch a rival media company,
Cairo-based Arabian Radio and Television (ART), which beams four dedicated
channels of children's programmes, sports, movies and music. 'We will do
anything we can do to protect our Arab children from the coming invasion
from western countries,' Mr Saria Al Khatib, a manager at ART, says.
MBC is preparing to launch four additional channels. Media consultants say
ART and MBC are spending at least Dollars 200m each on their projects.
Mr Ibn Abdallah has loftier ambitions, a more liberal mindset and a fatter
wallet. In May, his Rome - based Orbit Communications Company is spending
about Dollars 500m launching 16 television and four radio channels targeted
at Mideast viewers.
More Arab businessmen are joining the race. Mr Mohammad Al Sager, editor of
Al Qabas, Kuwait's largest daily, is the biggest shareholder in a new
company which has raised Dollars 50m to set up yet another pan-Arab channel,
expected to be on the air next year. Various Arab countries, meanwhile, are
broadcasting their state-owned channels via satellite.
The Middle East market, however, is not big enough to support all the new
channels. ART and MBC are aiming to attract mass audiences by beaming
services for free until they get on cable systems, still to be set up in
most of the region.
Advertising revenue is still too low to support that many channels. In Saudi
Arabia, the largest advertising market in the region, total advertising
expenditure stood at Dollars 247m in 1993 with television's share a mere
Dollars 57m, according to the Dubai-based Pan-Arab Research Centre.
Orbit, meanwhile, is a pay television service catering to a small group of
western-minded and more liberal viewers. It has signed lavish deals with
American networks to rebroadcast news and entertainment programmes and
commissioned the BBC to create a World Service Television in Arabic, which
is already on the air. Orbit says it buys programmes that would not offend
the sensitivities of the region and leaves them unedited.
Just a few months into launch, however, some Orbit dealers who had been
selling decoders for Dollars 10,000 have lowered their price to Dollars
6,000 - still a lot considering customers have to pay Dollars 90 to Dollars
200 a year in subscription fees after the first year.
Meanwhile, the Saudi government earlier this year said it would begin to
enforce its ban on satellite dishes. Although few have been taken down as a
result and a black market in dishes is flourishing, the ban has dampened
hopes of growth.
At the same time the government is investing up to Dollars 500m in a cable
system, which is easier to censor. That will put further pressure on the
market but may give MBC an edge over its rivals because the system will be
operated by an MBC affiliate, also majority owned by Mr Al Ibrahim.
The system will start with 20 channels and eventually reach 30. Five
channels are likely to go to MBC, and Arab government channels, which will
receive priority, will take at least a half dozen more. And as the Saudi
government seeks to make a return on its investment in cable, it may at last
close the doors of the most lucrative Mideast market to satellite dishes.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Angola forces sign truce to end civil war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Angola's government and Unita rebel forces yesterday signed a truce aimed at
halting nearly two decades of civil war.
According to the United Nations the agreement, due to take effect today, is
expected to remain in force until November 22, after which a permanent
ceasefire is to come into force.
The truce was signed as southern African leaders met in Zambia in an urgent
attempt to keep Angola's faltering peace accord on track after a last-minute
postponement of the signing of a formal peace accord, painstakingly
negotiated by United Nations mediators over 11 months.
Mr Thabo Mbeki, South Africa's deputy president, had warned Angolan leaders
that regional countries would take action - widely seen as including
military intervention - should the latest Angolan peace bid crumble.
Under the truce, which represents only part of the formal peace plan and was
signed by top generals of the government and Unita, fighting will halt at
8pm today. A formal peace accord is due to be signed on Sunday. The truce
will remain in effect until the ceasefire called for in the peace accord
takes effect at midnight November 22.
The signing of a formal accord had been delayed because Angola's Unita
rebels refused to sign while government forces were intensifying the war.
The government and Unita initialled the formal pact two weeks ago, but since
then Angolan government army troops overran Unita's stronghold of Huambo in
central Angola.
The Angola war has severely tested the capacity of the southern African
states, which originally came together to help overthow white minority rule
in Rhodesia and South Africa, to act as guarantors of a peace settlement
based on democracy.
If such a regional security pact grouping can succeed in southern Africa, it
could set an example of conflict resolution in other troubled areas of the
continent.
Angola is no different from other African states where an upsurge of
violence has frequently preceded peace agreements.
However the MPLA government may have turned the tables on Mr Jonas Savimbi,
leader of Unita.
Since he rejected his 1992 election defeat, he has tried to win an
ascendancy on the battlefield hoping it would be reflected in the
composition of the government emerging from the Lusaka peace talks. The
MPLA, however, seems to have based its strategy on two more astute
assumptions.
The first was that it could take Huambo. The second was that international
opinion would come down on its side. When Mr Savimbi resorted to war after
his election defeat he lost most of his friends in western capitals.
The MPLA has played a devious game, breaking the spirit of the Lusaka talks,
but Unita's cries of foul play have won little sympathy.
No one underestimates the capacity of Mr Savimbi further to disrupt the
peace process. Even if the signing goes ahead on Sunday formidable obstacles
remain - not least the integration of two rival forces into a national army.
But regional and international developments are putting him under intense
pressure. The prize is peace in a region where the wars for independence
began in the early 1960s. Even the unpredictable Mr Savimbi must realise
knows that sooner or later he has to settle his differences at the
conference table and abide by the result.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Import boom spurs fall in Japan's trade surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's trade surplus fell faster than expected for the third month in a row
in October, thanks to an import boom. Economists greeted this as fresh
evidence of change in the country's economic structure.
The politically contentious trade balance shrank by 15.2 per cent compared
with the same month last year to Dollars 9.28bn (Pounds 5.65bn). That is
well below the lowest forecast by Tokyo economists, and likely to strengthen
Japan's position in trade talks this week with the US and, separately, the
European Union.
This brings the three-month moving average for the surplus to Dollars
8.47bn, the lowest since May 1992. A finance ministry official said the
surplus was now at a turning point.
Imports surged ahead in October by 24 per cent to Dollars 25.34bn, more than
twice as fast as exports, up by 10.4 per cent to Dollars 34.62bn according
to preliminary finance ministry figures. Sales of foreign goods in Japan
have risen in dollar terms every month this year.
Import penetration of the domestic market may be growing, said economists.
The yen's rise against the dollar has made many imports cheaper in the
Japanese currency. There has also been an increase in imports from the
growing number of Japanese factories which flee high-cost Japan for cheaper
overseas locations.
Japan's domestic market is also gradually growing again and hence sucking in
imports. The rise in domestic demand was underlined yesterday by separate
official reports of a 0.7 per cent rise in private sector machinery orders
in the year to September and a 9.8 per cent rise in steel output in October,
to reach a three-year high.
Previous rises in imports on this scale, in the mid 1980s, have been led by
European luxury goods. The latest increases have been more broadly based,
geographically and by sector. Imports have grown across all nine industrial
sectors measured by the finance ministry, from food to machines, as well as
from all Japan's seven main trade regions.
The surplus with the US fell for the first time in eight months, by 6.8 per
cent to Dollars 4.79bn, helped by a 26.4 per cent rise in imports. October
was the fourth consecutive month in which Japan's purchases from the US grew
faster than its sales to the US. Imports from the European Union rose even
faster, by 33.6 per cent, while the rest of Asia sold 21.7 per cent more to
Japan than it did a year ago.

FT  16 NOV 94 / IMF set to assist more ex-Soviet states
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund is considering support agreements in
Uzbekistan, Armenia and Azerbaijan, the last three candidates for a
scaled-down programme specifically designed for eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union.
If the three republics are granted Systemic Transformation Facilities, the
IMF will be assisting almost all the independent nations that emerged after
the Soviet collapse.
It would leave just ex-Yugoslavia, Georgia, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan
without IMF assistance when the STF programme closes to new members next
month.
The IMF has eased its requirements in this programme, a special case being
made for eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. In general, the IMF has
responded to criticism that its guidelines were too tough for this region.
The two Caucascus republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan, for example, have
among the region's worst economies mostly because of their six- year
undeclared war against one another. Uzbekistan, conversely, has suffered
little instability but has been among the most reluctant to adopt genuine
economic reform.
'These have been the laggards all along,' said a western economist,
referring to the last three STF candidates. 'You don't know whether they are
now committed to reform, or if they simply see the boat leaving and don't
want to miss it.'
Analysts believe Armenia will almost certainly reach agreement with the IMF.
While economists are not entirely satisfied with Azberbaijan's performance,
it would be politically difficult for the IMF to admit Armenia but not its
enemy.
Uzbekistan is trying to persuade the IMF that it will stop indirect
subsidies to state enterprises and reduce state control over its main
industry, cotton.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Taiwan expresses regret over shelling of China
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan yesterday expressed regret over what it described as the accidental
shelling of China after a burst of Taiwanese anti-aircraft rounds landed on
the mainland, seriously wounding two people.
Beijing reacted angrily, describing the shelling as a vicious attack that
'sabotaged the peaceful atmosphere across the Taiwan Strait'.
China claimed that 12 shells had landed in a suburb of Xiamen which is
located on the mainland coast adjacent to Taiwan. It expressed 'grave
concern' and demanded severe punishment for those responsible.
Taiwan's defence ministry said it was investigating the 'unfortunate
mistake' in which anti-aircraft shells used in a training exercise had
failed to explode in mid-air but landed instead on the mainland.
'We express deep regret over this mistaken incident which had no hostile
intent,' said a Taiwanese statement.
Taiwanese officials have not at this stage explained how the shells came to
be fired in the direction of the mainland in the first place. Taiwan has
offered to pay compensation to the wounded.
The errant shells were fired from anti-artillery batteries on the island of
Lesser Quemoy, six kilometres to the east of Xiamen. The island was often at
the centre of fierce artillery duels in the 1950s between Taiwan and the
mainland.
Yesterday's incident will add to unease across the Taiwan Strait, but seems
unlikely to affect a timetable for continuing talks between Taiwanese and
mainland officials aimed at improving working relations.
The next round of talks is due to be held in the Yangtze River town of
Nanjing between November 21-23. The discussions have been dealing with
issues such as illegal immigration, postal and telecommunications links and
prisoner exchanges.
In Taiwan, Mr William Li, spokesman for the Mainland Affair Council which
formulates China policy, said he doubted yesterday's shelling would have a
serious impact on relations.
'This is an isolated incident and it will not affect relations across the
straits,' he said.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Africa leaders bid to salvage Angola peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
African leaders met in Zambia yesterday in an urgent attempt to keep
Angola's faltering peace accord on track.
The meeting of southern African states followed a last-minute postponement
from yesterday to Sunday of the signing of the accord, painstakingly
negotiated by United Nations mediators over 11 months.
The leaders, who earlier this year used both carrot and stick to reverse a
coup ousting one of their members in Lesotho, were drafting a tough
statement telling Angola's warring sides to stop the bloodletting, officials
said.
Mr Thabo Mbeki, South Africa's deputy president, has already warned that the
leaders will take action - widely seen as including military intervention -
should the latest Angolan peace bid crumble as others before it.
Although UN officials declined to give reasons for postponing the signing
ceremony, officials said it was because Angola's Unita rebels had refused to
sign while the government intensified the war.
In the past two weeks, after the government and Unita had initialled the
pact, Angolan army troops overran Unita's stronghold of Huambo in central
Angola, throwing the peace process into doubt.
The Lusaka talks are testing the capacity of the southern African states,
which originally came together to help in the overthow of white minority
governments in Rhodesia and South Africa, to act as guarantors of a regional
security pact based on democratic governments.
If such a grouping can succeed in southern Africa, it could set an example
of conflict resolution from which the rest of the continent can learn.
Whether manoeuvres in the field are designed to win advantages at the
negotiating table, or the last resort of parties or individuals who fear the
outcome of the ballot box, Angola is no different from other African states
where an upsurge of violence has frequently preceded peace agreements.
This time, however, the MPLA government may have turned the tables on Mr
Jonas Savimbi, leader of the Unita movement.
Since he rejected his 1992 election defeat, he has tried to win an
ascendancy on the battlefield that would be reflected in the composition of
the government that would emerge from the Lusaka peace talks.
The MPLA, however, seems to have made two critical calculations. The first
is that it could take Huambo. The second was based on an assessment of
international opinion, in particular Washington and Moscow, the two key
outside powers.
When Mr Savimbi resorted to war after his election defeat he lost most of
his friends in western capitals. Whether the MPLA has broken the spirit of
the Lusaka talks or not, Unita's cries of foul play will have little impact.
No one underestimates the capacity of Mr Savimbi further to disrupt the
peace process. Even if the signing goes ahead on Sunday formidable obstacles
remain - not the least of which is the integration of two rival forces into
a national army.
But regional and international developments are putting him under intense
pressure. The prize is bringing peace to a region where the wars for
independence began in the early 1960s: even the unpredictable Mr Savimbi,
argue frontline officials in Lusaka, knows that sooner or later he has to
settle his differences at the conference table and abide by the result.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Law of the Sea promises many disputes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Diplomatic Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which enters full force
today, seems likely to be treated by coastal states as a rich source of
legal and rhetorical arguments to be used against rivals.
This is in spite of the fact that the last thing the law's drafters wanted
was to provide disputatious countries with extra torpedoes. One of the law's
ostensible purposes is to encourage compromises over the exploitation of
maritime resources, even among countries with unresolved disputes.
Apart from a standoff in the Aegean - where Turkey has threatened war if
Greece extends its territorial waters to 12 miles - one of the most grave
maritime disputes involves China and Vietnam, locked in a war of words over
oil rights in the South China Sea.
Both China and Vietnam claim to be acting in accordance with the Law of the
Sea but their interpretations of the document are miles apart.
Over the last month, China has accused Vietnam of infringing its interests
in international waters by inviting US and European companies to explore for
oil in the Tonkin Gulf.
Vietnam has retorted that it is exercising its legitimate rights in the
economic zone to which it is entitled by the UN convention. It said that
under the terms of that treaty, there were no international waters in the
Gulf.
This dialogue of the deaf reflects confusion over the difference between
territorial waters - which may be extended, under the UN Law, up to 12 miles
 -and the 'economic zone' which coastal states are entitled to claim,
amounting to either 200 miles or the full extent of their continental shelf,
whichever is larger.
China and Vietnam are also arguing over resources around the Spratly
Islands, a group of reefs and atolls whose other would-be owners are Taiwan,
Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines.
China has awarded an exploration contract to the US company Crestone for an
area south-west of the Spratlys, while Vietnam has awarded a consortium led
by Mobil a bloc slightly further to the west. Each state has denounced the
other's contract.
Sovereignty over the Spratlys - and hence control of the surrounding
economic zone - is crucial to each side's claim to energy rights, and the
salience of this issue is expected to grow as the UN convention enters
force.
However a study by a London-based law firm, maintains that the law favours
pragmatic joint exploitation accords, even among countries with unresolved
disputes.*
Laying out the common-sense arguments for such accords, it notes that oil
deposits which straddle two states' economic zones cannot be exploited by
one without damaging the other's interests. When one state drills, oil from
the rival state's zone is liable to flow across the boundary line as a
result.
Article 83 of the UN convention says that pending final agreement on zones,
countries should 'make every effort to enter into provisional arrangements
of a practical nature'.
As an example of such a deal, the study cites the 1989 accord between
Australia and Indonesia over waters south of Timor.
However, such accords are not a panacea. Portugal - still seen by the UN as
legal administrator of East Timor - has challenged Australia's right to
enter the accord, before the International Court of Justice.
The entry into force of the UN Law comes a year after its ratification by
the minimum of 60 states. Another breakthrough came this summer when
provisions on deep-sea mining - outside the zones of any country - were
amended so as to convince the US, the UK and Germany to sign.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ralph Willis, the Australian treasurer, said yesterday that the
government's budget deficit for the 1994-95 financial year could turn out to
be lower than the ADollars 11.7bn (Pounds 5.5bn) forecast. He also said
Australia's economy was growing at an underlying rate of about 5 per cent,
although drought was depressing the final result. The government has been
criticised for running too loose a fiscal policy, and using higher tax
receipts from the faster-than-expected economic recovery to tackle issues
such as long-term unemployment at the expense of pruning the government
deficit. Government forecasts have suggested that the country will not be in
surplus until the late 1990s. Financial markets have also been sceptical
about the country's inflation outlook, particularly in the light of some
large wage claims recently.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Nagano backs bank's 'lottery'
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The growing row among Japanese banks over a plan by one of them to launch a
lottery-linked deposit account was joined yesterday by one of the country's
leading businessmen. Mr Takeshi Nagano, the president of the Japan
Federation of Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren) told a news conference
that he regarded the new account launched by the Johnan Shinkin Bank, the
country's largest credit bank, as within the bounds of free competition.
Last week the bank provoked fury among its rivals by offering customers a
time deposit account that carries with it eligibility for a lottery in which
savers can win up to Y50,000 (Pounds 320). The bank's competitors claimed
this breached voluntary rules that they would not offer large cash prizes as
incentives to depositors. But Johnan Shinkin said the real reason anger was
that it had broken a closet cartel that kept down interest rates. Rates were
liberalised last month by the Ministry of Finance, but since then there has
been little difference between rates offered by the country's banks. The
other banks put their objections to the ministry which on Monday set up a
panel of inquiry to review the bank's actions. 'It may be a grave matter for
the Finance Ministry but I think it is within the framework of liberty for
the management of financial institutions,' Mr Nagano said.

Nepalis voted yesterday to choose a new parliament amid scattered violence
and anxieties that no clear majority would emerge to guide the new Himalayan
democracy out of poverty. Despite the deployment of more than 100,000
members of the security forces, at least 13 people were injured in clashes
between supporters of rival parties, police and local officials said. More
than 1,250 election observers, including 130 foreigners from 28 countries,
were posted in 205 constituencies for the kingdom's second general election
since pro-democracy protests ended an absolute monarchy in 1990.
In 1991 the centrist Nepali Congress party won the country's first free
elections in 31 years after King Birendra was forced to relinquish almost
all of his power. But factional infighting and corruption allegations
plagued the ruling party, forcing Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala to
call parliamentary polls 18 months ahead of schedule. A total of 12.3m
people were eligible to vote. No idea of the outcome was expected before
Friday. Political observers were split over whether the Congress party,
which held 114 of 205 seats in the outgoing parliament, would overcome
internal wrangling to retain a majority.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Charity quits Rwandan camps

<TEXT>
Medecins Sans Frontieres, the international medical charity, has evacuated
its staff from Rwandan refugee camps in eastern Zaire where lawless Hutu
militia have imposed a reign of terror. MSF said soldiers and militia linked
to the ousted Rwandan government had taken control of the camps around
Bukavu, home to some 250,000 refugees. MSF medical staff have witnessed the
intimidation, arrest and assassination of refugees wishing to return to
Rwanda. Charity workers who have tried to intervene to save lives have
themselves received death threats. Hutu militia carry weapons inside the
camps and are drafting young Hutu men into forced military training. They
have also taken control of the distribution of food aid. 'The situation has
deteriorated to such an extent that it has become ethically impossible for
MSF to continue aiding and abetting the perpetrators of the Rwandan
genocide,' Ms Samantha Bolton, an MSF spokeswoman, said yesterday in
Nairobi.

<TEXT>
South Africa said yesterday its gross domestic product grew by a
worse-than-expected 2.6 per cent in the third quarter of the year. Following
a decline in GDP of 3.6 per cent in the first quarter and a rise of only 1.6
per cent in the second quarter, the latest figures mean that the final
growth rate for 1994 is likely to be about 2 per cent, only slightly up on
last year's 1.1 per cent. The announcement is a blow for the government,
which earlier in the year had been forecasting growth of 3-4 per cent for
1994. However labour unrest and political uncertainty surrounding the
country's April elections appear to have dented growth in the first half of
the year.
The news, which came as the administration presented the latest version of
its centrepiece economic plan, the Reconstruction and Development Programme
(RDP), to parliament, may also make it difficult for the administration to
meet its revenue targets for the year. The White Paper on the RDP is
predicated on a 3 per cent annual growth rate for South Africa.

FT  16 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Malaysian concerns - Asia-Pacific Economic
Co-operation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In an unpublished memorandum circulated in Jakarta last night, Malaysia said
it would 'only commit to undertaking further liberalisation on a unilateral
basis at a pace and capacity commensurate with our level of development'. It
said Apec liberalisation should 'not create an exclusive free trade area in
Asia Pacific'. Liberalisation must be consistent with the Gatt and WTO and
'on an unconditional MFN (Most Favoured Nation) basis'.
It said the target dates of 2020 and 2010 for Apec liberalisation were
'indicative and non-binding,' and liberalisation should be 'undertaken on a
best endeavour basis' consistent with countries' level of economic
development. Liberalisation should 'only cover a substantial proportion of
Asia Pacific trade and should not go beyond the provisions of Gatt and WTO'.
Referring to the provision in the statement allowing countries to join Apec
liberalisation at a later stage, Malaysia said 'decisions in Apec should be
taken on the basis of consensus'.

The European Union expects to ratify the Uruguay Round trade accords 'before
Christmas', a senior EU trade official said yesterday.
The official, who was in Geneva for a meeting of the Quad group of leading
traders, said the other Quad members - the US, Japan and Canada - planned to
ratify the accords before the Uruguay Round implementation conference on
December 8.
He forecast that most EU member states would ratify by the time of the
implementation conference, which is expected to set a January 1 1995 date
for the Uruguay Round and the World Trade Organisation, that will police the
accords, to become effective. But he said all 12 nations might not complete
national procedures until EU foreign ministers met on December 19-20. The EU
itself would then be in a position to ratify.
The official said that the EU, Japan and Canada favoured a limited
transition period during which the WTO and the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (Gatt) would operate in parallel.
The US has already said it intends to pull out of Gatt as soon as possible
after the WTO comes into force, but the EU official said he saw 'no major
difficulty' with a short transition of perhaps one year. Of the 125
participants in the Round, only about 80 are likely to have ratified the
trade accords by January 1.
Japanese legislators said earlier this month that Tokyo was likely to ratify
the pact during its current parliamentary session ending on December 3, but
might postpone diplomatic steps to seal the pact due to delays in the US and
Europe.
Brussels also remains confident that its candidate for WTO director-general,
Mr Renato Ruggiero of Italy, will be chosen by next month.

FT  16 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Mercedes-Benz unveils people's car
prototype - Carmakers jostle for stake in China project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mercedes-Benz was prepared to invest up to DM2bn (Dollars 1.3bn) in China to
build 250,000 models a year of its 'people's car' designed specifically for
the local market, a senior representative of the German carmaker said
yesterday.
Mr Jurgen Hubbert, head of Mercedes-Benz's car division, said that efforts
to win Chinese approval for the family car project were part of the
'globalisation' of the company's business.
'The increasing internationalisation of world business has led the company
to go one step further than export or foreign assembly,' he said.
'Mercedes-Benz is now looking for overseas production locations where it
will not just assemble, but develop and manufacture passenger cars of the
highest quality.'
Mr Hubbert was speaking after Mercedes-Benz had unveiled its prototype
Family Car China (FCC) at a lavish exhibition in Beijing, attended by 22
international carmakers showing their wares in an attempt to be selected as
partners in a Chinese people's car project.
China's Ministry of Machinery Industry, responsible for the vehicle sector,
said it would select successful bidders within a year.
It is not clear whether there will be more than one company selected.
China announced earlier this year that it aimed by the year 2000 to have
built an industry capable of supplying 90 per cent of domestic requirements
of about 1.5m cars annually. China manufactured 234,000 cars last year.
Among Mercedes-Benz's competitors are Porsche and Volkswagen of Germany,
Nissan and Toyota of Japan, Fiat of Italy, Daewoo and Hyundai of South Korea
and General Motors and Ford of the US.
Porsche, like Mercedes-Benz, has developed a prototype for the Chinese
market known as the C88. To overcome scepticism about the involvement of a
luxury carmaker in the project, Porsche executives are publicising the fact
that it was Ferdinand Porsche who designed and built the first Volkswagen in
the mid-1930s.
Mr Stefan Geist, Porsche's marketing manager, said that one of the company's
aims was to show that 'we not only produce sports cars, we are also able to
do other things like providing design and engineering services'.
Unlike Mercedes-Benz, whose interest is in a 50-50 joint venture producing
cars, Porsche wants to supply basic design and engineering assistance to a
Chinese manufacturer in return for a fee or royalty on models produced.
Ford, which is showing its Fiesta and other small models in Beijing this
week, also invoked the past to strengthen its claims to participate in the
people's car project.
Referring to the Model T Ford, the world's first mass-produced car, Mr Wayne
Booker, executive vice-president for international automotive operations,
said: 'Ninety-one years ago Henry Ford had a vision of providing the
greatest good for the greatest number of people. From that beginning Ford
has adhered to the vision of serving working people.'
Volkswagen, the German carmaker which is already the leading car producer in
China, said the Seat Cordoba, introduced in China recently as the City Golf,
could be the basis for a people's car.
Mr Martin Posth, responsible for Asia, said VW would present a complete
concept covering development, production, national specialisation,
distribution and service.

The European Court of Justice yesterday paved the way for EU ratification of
the Uruguay Round trade accord before the year-end deadline by ruling on a
dispute between the Commission and member states.
In a long-awaited pronouncement, the court ruled that the Commission will
have to share responsibility with member states for negotiation in certain
trade areas, such as transport, services and intellectual property rights.
The ruling supports the argument made by member states that the Commission's
existing authority does not extend to these areas, which will come to the
fore in future trade negotiations under Gatt's successor body, the World
Trade Organisation.
Although the court's verdict was interpreted as a setback for the
Commission, Sir Leon Brittan, trade commissioner, said: 'We now have a clear
basis on which we can all work together in Europe both to ensure that the
WTO enters into force on time, with full European participation, and to
ensure that Europe plays a strong role from day one in shaping the agenda
for the WTO itself.'
The Commission had argued that the Uruguay Round accord should be ratified
under those articles of the Rome and Maastricht treaties that give it
exclusive authority to negotiate on trade. The full implication of the
court's opinion will take time to digest but the Commission highlighted a
number of points yesterday.
Trade in goods will continue to fall completely within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Commission. This includes trade in nuclear goods and in
coal and steel products.
Cross-border services such as telecommunications, audio visual, and
financial services that are transmitted electronically across frontiers are
analogous to trade in goods, and therefore fall under the jurisdiction of
the Commission.
Other types of services which imply movement of people or establishment
within the community - for example, when a third country company sets up a
subsidiary - will be a shared responsibility.
In intellectual property rights jurisdiction remains with member states,
other than in the case of counterfeit goods crossing borders. The court
added the community may be called on to act in any case where there was a
direct repercussion on the functioning of the common market.
The Commission and the member states will now have to decide on the best way
to proceed. An EU official said yesterday that the parties would need a code
of conduct as a basis for negotiation, but added that an original code -
drawn up by the German government and the Commission - was now out of date
and that a new one would have to be considered.
'There has been agreement that some sort of code of conduct will be needed,
but there is not yet a unanimous view of what sort of code. We have to look
at the court decision and decide what sort of rules are appropriate,' the
official said.
All 12 national parliaments must now ratify the Uruguay Round deal before
the end of the year. Three countries - Greece, Germany and the UK - have
already ratified the accord setting up the WTO and its annexes containing
the specific agreements negotiated under Gatt on areas such as agriculture,
textiles and telecommunications.
EU foreign ministers have also sent the accord to the European Parliament to
press on with its own ratification procedures.

FT  16 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Mahathir mars Apec consensus -
Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation
</HEADLINE>

Pacific rim leaders yesterday agreed to draw up concrete plans in the next
year for completely free trade and investment in the region by the year 2020
in a move they said would give a powerful impetus to further liberalisation
in the rest of the world, write Peter Montagnon and Guy de Jonquieres in
Jakarta.
However, the impact of their decision at the Asia-Pacific Economic
Co-operation forum in Bogor, near Jakarta, was marred by reservations from
Malaysia. Its prime minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, said the agreement was
non-binding and the timetable merely indicative.
Other leaders of the 18-member group hailed the agreement as an historic
breakthrough, but said they had yet to define what 'free and open trade'
meant. Crucial questions include how far it should cover services as well as
goods, and whether Apec should demand concessions from other countries
before extending its planned liberalisation to the rest of the world.
Mr Paul Keating, Australian prime minister, said decisions on these issues
would have to wait at least until next year's Apec meeting in Osaka, Japan.
But he called the statement, which commits the region's more advanced
countries to free trade by 2010, a triumph comparable to the foundation of
the Bretton Woods institutions in 1944.
US President Bill Clinton said the agreement was 'potentially historic,' but
its realisation would require continuing commitment by political leaders.
The summit gave a boost to China's hopes of joining the new World Trade
Organisation next year by stating that 'full and active participation in and
support of the WTO by all Apec economies' was vital to strengthening the
world trade system.
The meeting agreed to accelerate implementation of the Uruguay Round world
trade deal and announced a standstill 'under which we will endeavour to
refrain' from measures which increase trade protection.
Several leaders sought to play down worries about another clause in the
statement which would apparently allow countries not ready to participate in
co-operative arrangements to join at a later date. 'To have gone this far is
frankly amazing,' said Sir Hamish Macleod, Hong Kong's financial secretary.
'If you think back a year or two, you would not have believed it could
happen.'
The widespread assumption is that Malaysia's objections will be insufficient
to prevent work proceeding. Malaysia has offered to host Apec's meeting in
1998 and demonstrated its interest in free trade by sharply cutting tariffs
in last month's budget.
Dr Mahathir's chief concern is to avoid being sucked in to a process
dominated by the US and outside the multilateral framework.
Other countries, such as China, Japan and Thailand, may raise similar
objections once work begins on the details.
Apec officials have warned privately that defining the scope of the
programme will be even harder than setting a timetable for its completion.
Already Japan, South Korea and some other countries have said full
liberalisation of their agricultural markets would be politically difficult.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The leaders of the 17-member Apec countries agreed to build on the Uruguay
Round world trade deal and take the lead in strengthening the open
multilateral trading system, saying the 'full and active participation in
and support for the WTO (World Trade Organisation) of all Apec economies'
was vital to this objective.
They would accelerate implementation of their Uruguay Round commitments and
aimed to deepen and broaden its results.
'We also agree to commit ourselves to our continuing process of unilateral
trade and investment liberalisation. As evidence of our commitment to the
open multilateral trading system, we further agree to endeavour to refrain
from using measures which would have the effect of increasing levels of
protection', they said.
They pledged promptly to reduce further trade and investment barriers 'in a
Gatt-consistent manner' and believed this would stimulate further
multilateral liberalisation. 'We wish to emphasise our strong opposition to
the creation of an inward-looking trade bloc that would divert from the
pursuit of global free trade. . . The outcome of trade and investment
liberalisation in Asia-Pacific will not only be the actual reduction of
barriers among Apec economies but also between Apec economies and non-Apec
economies.'
The leaders urged the successful launching of the WTO. 'Full and active
participation in and support of the WTO by all Apec economies is key to our
ability to lead the way in strengthening the multilateral trading system. We
call on all non-Apec members of the WTO to work together with Apec economies
toward further multilateral liberalisation.'
The statement outlined the vision for Asia-Pacific economies as 'based on a
recognition of the growing interdependence of our economically diverse
region, which comprises developed, newly industrialising and developing
economies.
'The Asia-Pacific industrialised economies will provide opportunities for
developing economies to increase further their economic growth and level of
development.'
Free and open trade and investment in Asia-Pacific would be achieved by
developing countries by the year 2020 and by industrialised economies by
2010, it continued.
However, in another part of the statement, the leaders said: 'In order to
facilitate our co-operation, we agree the Apec economies that are ready to
initiate a co-operative arrangement may proceed to do so while those that
are not yet ready to participate may join at a later date.
'We direct our ministers and officials immediately to begin preparing
detailed proposals for implementing our present decisions. The proposals are
to be submitted soon to Apec economic leaders for their consideration and
subsequent decisions. Such proposals should also address all impediments to
achieving our goal.'
The leaders also agreed to examine the possibility of a voluntary
consultative dispute mediation service, while stressing that the WTO should
be the primary channel for resolving trade disputes.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Italian unions call new general strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The confrontation between the Berlusconi government and Italy's trades union
movement escalated yesterday with the calling of a new and more extensive
general strike to protest against the 1995 budget.
The fresh strike call came within hours of the government's decision to
impose a confidence motion on today's debate in the chamber of deputies on
the articles in the budget relating to pensions reform.
The government's use of a confidence motion for the second time in the
budget debate is intended to retain tight discipline among the fractious
right-wing coalition. But it was also a clear signal to the unions that -
despite the huge weekend protest in Rome of 1.5m demonstrating against the
budget - the government was determined not to make more compromises.
The general strike will be staged on December 2 and will last eight hours.
This will cause much more disruption than the previous stoppage on October
14 which lasted four hours. Outlining plans last week for the demonstration
in Rome, union leaders had more or less talked themselves into a new general
strike if the government failed to respond by reopening talks on pensions.
Yesterday the northern section of the engineering union said it would stage
a three-hour stoppage today in protest against the government move and this
will foreshadow stoppages elsewhere. In an effort to prevent further
industrial action the government will meet the unions next Tuesday.
The government had little option but to appear tough. The 1995 budget target
of holding the public sector deficit down to L138,000bn (Pounds 55bn),
equivalent to 8 per cent of GDP, is already at risk due to a combination of
concessions and the higher cost of servicing Italy's debt stock. Some of the
concessions relate to pension reform, making it easier for people to still
benefit from early retirement provisions.
But the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi has been pressing its
partners in the right-wing coalition to accept a large number of amendments
to pension reform. Some of these are in line with union requests which are
seeking to avoid hardship cases and ensure that the reform is thorough - not
a mere cost-cutting measure to reduce government spending.
The government plans to raise L8,000bn through cuts in the pension benefits.
Yesterday Mr Lamberto Dini, the treasury minister, said the League
amendments would cost an extra L11,000bn over the next six years. One of the
two main amendments the League has sought to introduce concerns the process
whereby those who retire either before the normal retirement age or before
they have made their full contributions will be penalised.
Mr Bossi has frequently threatened to break with the government over
pensions. But yesterday a League spokesman said it would observe the
discipline imposed even though it disapproved of the guillotine method of
the confidence motion. To deflect attention from this volte face, Mr Bossi
said the League would seek to establish a bridge with the government for
renewed dialogue.
By retreating Mr Bossi has shown he is not yet willing to break up the
coalition. His stance yesterday was in part determined by the prospect of
local elections this weekend where he needs the backing of Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's Forza Italia to ensure League mayoral candidates win.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Pan-Europe stock market planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY, Growing Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to launch a pan-European stock market for fast growing companies were
unveiled yesterday by a group of European venture capitalists, the Paris
Bourse and the US Nasdaq market.
The new market would provide entrepreneurially-led companies of any size
with access to equity finance at an earlier stage than their national stock
exchanges currently allow.
The group, led by the European Venture Capital Association, hopes the market
 -to be called Easdaq - will open in late 1995. This would coincide with the
EU directive calling for free movement of financial services across borders
which must be implemented nationally by 1996.
A survey conducted by accountants Coopers and Lybrand and funded by the
European Commission, established that nearly half the companies seeking a
flotation in four European countries would be suitable for Easdaq.
But its success rests on whether institutional investors worldwide will be
prepared to invest in the entrepreneurially-led fast growth companies.
Mr Jos Peeters, chairman of the working group on Easdaq, said there were
15,000 venture capital backed companies in Europe 'among which the star
performers are potential candidates for a listing on the new market'.
Easdaq would also appear to compete in the UK with the Alternative
Investment Market which the London Stock Exchange will launch next year to
replace the Unlisted Securities Market.
Mr Ronald Cohen, chairman of Apax Partners and one of the main driving
forces behind Easdaq, said the new market would be highly regulated against
fraud. Companies wanting a listing would need a conventional investment bank
sponsor and would need to keep the market fed regularly with relevant
information.
The London Stock Exchange does not currently expect companies floating on
the Alternative Investment Market would be heavily regulated, a shortcoming
for serious institutional investment, some investors say. The Easdaq would
also have an independent management team, unlike AIM which would remain
within the LSE.
Launching the plans for Easdaq, 21 European and US financial institutions
yesterday founded a new body, the European Association of Securities
Dealers, which will develop the technological infrastructure and settlement
systems for the new market.
The Easdaq - which stands for the European Association of Securities Dealers
Automated Quotation market - will be a profit-making company.
Before the project can get off the ground the Easdaq company will need to
raise about Ecu10m (Pounds 7.8bn) in equity capital.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Power struggle over EU policy stalls Austrian coalition
talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A power struggle over who should be in charge of European policy is holding
up Austrian government coalition talks more than a month after disenchanted
voters returned the traditional conservative and socialist coalition
partners with less than their usual overwhelming majority.
At the same time, an ambitious austerity plan to cut government and social
spending by ASch220bn (Pounds 12.8bn) over four years has run into strong
opposition from the trade union forces within Chancellor Franz Vranitzky's
Social Democratic party (SPOe). The cuts are needed to bring Austria's
budget deficit in line with the European Union's Maastricht convergence
criteria for economic and monetary union.
Observers still expect the SPOe and the conservative People's party (OeVP)
will patch up their differences and continue the so-called grand coalition
that has ruled Austria since 1986. But five weeks after the elections, in
which SPOe and OeVP saw their majority shrink from 97 to 51, there is
growing talk in Vienna of a breakdown of the coalition.
Waiting in the wings is the right-wing Freedom party (FPOe) led by Mr Jorg
Haider, which boosted its voting share to almost a quarter and has made the
OeVP the tempting offer to back a minority government in parliament. Because
of Mr Haider's extremist and xenophobic views, liberal forces in the OeVP,
which holds only 52 seats in the 183-seat parliament, have ruled out any
partnership with the FPOe.
However, foreign minister Alois Mock, who represents the conservative wing
of the OeVP, has shown few qualms about co-operation with Mr Haider. Even
though he is seriously ill with Parkinson's disease, Mr Mock still hopes to
become chancellor and has not forgiven Mr Vranitzky for denying him this
post in a closely contested election in 1986. His demand to be put in charge
of all aspects of European policy when Austria joins the EU on January 1 is
seen as a ploy to break up the coalition talks and wrest control over the
party from its liberal chairman Mr Erhard Busek.
Mr Vranitzky, by contrast, wants the co-ordination of EU policy to rest in
the chancellery. He argues that the issues decided in Brussels go well
beyond traditional diplomacy and touch every aspect of government policy. He
wants a strong state secretary for European affairs in his office to balance
the foreign ministry's role.
The dispute is hard to solve because the constitution does not clearly
define the chancellor's responsibilities. He heads the weekly cabinet
meeting, but is not officially charged with co-ordinating government policy.
The outcome of the power struggle is certain to affect Austria's position on
European security policy. While Mr Mock wants to abandon neutrality and join
the Western European Union, Mr Vranitzky wants to preserve neutrality as
long as a common defence policy does not yet exist. Mr Mock and Mr Vranitzky
are also at odds over relations with eastern Europe and EU policy toward
Bosnia. Mr Mock is much keener on integrating eastern Europe quickly and on
supporting the Bosnian government, including ending the arms embargo.
Even if the coalition continues, the current impasse could still spell
trouble for the government in the coming months. Few observers expect it to
last the full four years.
While the right wing of the OeVP is pressing Mr Busek, the party chief, to
play the Haider card, leftwingers in the SPOe are calling for a retreat into
the opposition to recover strength after the disastrous election result.
Meanwhile, the powerful trade unions are challenging Mr Vranitzky's
pragmatic and pro-business policy and are demanding a better social balance
in the current round of spending cuts. On Monday, the trade union
representative in the SPOe's negotiating team, Mr Rudolf Nuernberger, walked
out of the talks. The OeVP, however, insists on a brake on Austria's
generous social programmes to bring the budget deficit below 3 per cent of
gross domestic product until 1998 from 4.7 per cent this year.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Former bank chief accused of fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mario Conde, the flamboyant banker who was dismissed as chairman of
Banesto by the Bank of Spain at the end of last year, and nine former
directors of the troubled bank were yesterday formally accused of criminal
fraud by the public prosecutor of Madrid's high court.
A high court judge will now decide whether to charge Mr Conde and his
associates. The accusation came as members of a parliamentary commission on
the collapse of Banesto were drafting their conclusions to six months of
hearings. A member of the commission said the parliamentarians were likely
to recommend criminal action against Mr Conde.
The prosecutor's formal accusation yesterday brings to a head the second big
financial scandal in Spain in the past month. Mr Javier de la Rosa, the
Barcelona financier who together with Mr Conde became an emblem of Spain's
booming late 1980s, was imprisoned pending fraud charges three weeks ago.
The prosecutor, who demanded surety totalling Pta12bn (Pounds 59m) against
all the ten accused in the Banesto case, has passed the results of his
investigation to a judge at the senior court dealing with monetary offences.
Details of the accusations were not released at the prosecutor's request and
court officials said the judge had up to two weeks to decide whether to
bring the case to court.
Mr Conde was removed as Banesto chairman after a Bank of Spain inspection
revealed it had heavily overvalued its assets. A self-made millionaire, Mr
Conde became chairman in 1987 at age 39 after he used the proceeds of
disposal of a pharmaceutical business to buy shares in the bank.
The most damning public evidence against the bank's former executives came
from Banesto's present chairman, Mr Alfredo Saenz, who told the
parliamentary investigation: 'In Banesto there are cases in which money has
not been lost; it has disappeared and somebody has it.'
Mr Saenz became chairman of Banesto after it was acquired by Banco Santander
in April following a lifeboat operation involving Pta780bn in public and
private monies to salvage the institution. The Bank of Spain said Banesto
had been 'grossly mismanaged' when it ordered the removal of Mr Conde, who
claimed the move was political.
Spain has been gripped a by several spectacular public scandals this year.
Mr Mariano Rubio, the former central bank governor, was jailed over a share
sale and still faces charges. The former chief of the Civil Guard is on the
run from Spanish police and Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez is at the centre
of a controversy for allegedly favouring a family member with government
contracts.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Kohl stays chancellor in close vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Helmut Kohl was yesterday re-elected chancellor of Germany, but with only
one vote to spare after three of his own coalition partners voted against
him in a secret ballot.
Mr Kohl, 64, who received 338 of the 671 parliamentary votes, just one above
the required majority to get elected in the first round, said after his
re-election, 'I didn't expect all the votes from the coalition. It was the
result I had expected.'
The opposition Social Democrats, Greens, and reformed east German communist
Party of Democratic Socialism all cast their combined 330 votes against him.
There were no abstentions and only one deputy, of the SPD, was absent
because he was in hospital.
A smiling Mr Kohl, re-elected chancellor for the fifth successive time,
stood to acknowledge the ovation from his own benches after Mrs Rita
Sussmuth, speaker of the house, announced the result. Coalition deputies
then broke into a rhythmic applause, while the opposition sat stoney-faced.
Mr Rudolf Scharping, leader of the SPD, walked over to congratulate Mr Kohl,
while the chancellor, in an unusual gesture, shook hands with Mr Gregor
Gysi, leader of the PDS.
But with a narrow victory, secured by Mr Wolfgang Schauble, parliamentary
leader of Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and the Christian
Social Union, its Bavarian sister party, who personally made sure every
deputy would attend the vote, Mr Scharping warned that the next legislative
period would be difficult for Mr Kohl.
'It will be tight now (for Mr Kohl),' he said. 'Making difficult political
decisions with such a narrow majority will be like walking on a tightrope,'
he added. He was also referring to the coalition's narrow parliamentary
majority. It had a 134 majority in the last parliament cut to just 10 in
this one.
But the decision by three (unnamed) members of Mr Kohl's own coalition to
vote against the chancellor suggests he will require, and try to impose,
strict discipline across party ranks to push through his agenda.
Mr Kohl's agenda for the next four years will be spelt out tomorrow when he
addresses the Bundestag. The agenda, agreed at the weekend between the CDU,
CSU and the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the coalition, and which
is called 'Making united Germany fit for the future' includes curbing the
budget deficit, pressing ahead with privatisation, creating more jobs,
slimming the bureaucracy, and social security cut-backs.
At the same time, Mr Kohl will announce the new cabinet, which will be
reduced in size. The Free Democrats are expected to retain the foreign and
economic ministries, but it is still unclear if Mr Gunter Rexrodt will
retain the economics portfolio.
The FDP's bargaining position for its share of cabinet posts has been
weakened following last month's federal elections when its number of
Bundestag seats fell by 32 to 47, although Mr Kohl is more than ever
dependent on them given the coalition's slim overall majority.
Yesterday, Mr Werner Hoyer, general secretary of the FDP, announced his
resignation, apparently because he is held responsible for the party's
election debacle. His resignation will take effect next month when the
liberals hold a special party conference to assess the disastrous results as
well as a future strategy.

FT  16 NOV 94 / French give ground over access to Orly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government, which is under strong pressure from European
governments and airlines to allow access to Orly airport in southern Paris,
said yesterday it would bring forward the date on which it would allow
landing rights.
The transport ministry said that carriers from European Union member states
would be allowed to launch services from January next year. The French
government had previously said that the services could not start before the
spring.
The European Commission has ordered France to open up Orly, which is the
main hub for domestic French flights and closer to central Paris than
Charles de Gaulle, the other main airport in the French capital.
But in spite of this ruling and strong pressure from European carriers,
including British Airways and KLM of the Netherlands, the French government
has resisted the opening of Orly. It has argued that it needs time to
prepare for competition and to take measures to prevent disturbance to
inhabitants of the Orly area.
Yesterday's announcement coincided with the latest test of strength between
the French government and a foreign carrier seeking access to Orly.
After a protracted wrangle, Mr Niki Lauda, the former Formula 1 motor racing
champion and founder and chairman of Lauda Air, the Austrian airline,
yesterday landed his inaugural flight at Charles de Gaulle airport. He then
pressed for rapid access to Orly.
Mr Lauda had threatened as late as Monday evening to fly to the airport in
southern Paris, in spite of the refusal by the French authorities to grant
his airline landing permission. He said yesterday that he had been given
permission to fly to Orly from the beginning of next year.
Lauda Air said it had been awarded landing slots for Orly in the summer. Six
weeks ago, however, the company claimed it had been told by the French
government that it could not start services as planned. Instead, the airline
said it was offered landing slots at Charles de Gaulle, but the timings were
inconvenient.
In June, France was forced to allow British carriers to fly to Orly from
London after a confrontation with the British government and the Commission
and a threat by the airlines that they would take off for Paris without
landing authoris-ation.
The start of services by European carriers to and from Orly airport is set
to coincide with the launch of flights between Orly and Marseilles and Orly
and Toulouse, which are the most profitable routes in the French domestic
market.
A ruling last month by the European Court of Justice upheld a decision by
the European Commission that competition should be introduced on the two
routes.

West German gross domestic product rose 'about 1 per cent' in the third
quarter, bringing aggregate growth for the first nine months to 2.25 per
cent, the economics ministry said yesterday. Although the recovery now
extended to the whole country and was firmly based, it was still not safe to
say that an extended upswing was assured, the ministry added in its monthly
report on the economy. Rising international interest rates and the marked
strengthening of the D-Mark against the US dollar presented risks to
recovery which made it all the more important for pay negotiators to show
restraint in the 1995 wages round. Final figures are not expected for some
weeks, but the data published yesterday is still in line with previous
government forecasts made just before the federal elections last month.
French non-farm payrolls, excluding the state sector, rose a seasonally
adjusted 58,400, or 0.4 per cent, in the third quarter after a rise of
85,100, or 0.6 per cent, in the second quarter, according to the labour
ministry.
Italy's industrial production grew 4.1 per cent during the first nine months
compared to the same period last year, according to Istat, the national
statistics institute.

<TEXT>
Failure to deregulate the European electricity industry could hamper
widespread introduction of more environmentally sound processes at European
oil refineries. Mr Tomihiro Taniguchi of the International Energy Agency
told a Financial Times conference yesterday that an environmentally friendly
gasification process existed to turn high-sulphur fuel oil and other
unwanted refinery residues into fuel for highly efficient combined cycle
power plants. But the economics of such projects were 'crucially dependent'
on refineries being able to sell the electricity. Only deregulated markets
were likely to offer prices high enough to justify such investments, he
said. France in particular has consistently opposed moves within the
European Union to deregulate electricity. Conference speakers predicted that
European demand for fuel oil would continue to contract.

Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European Monetary Institute, last
night warned strongly against the setting in advance of tight exchange rate
stability criteria for countries seeking to enter European Monetary Union.
After the first council meeting of the EMI - forerunner of the planned
European central bank - at its new Frankfurt headquarters, he said it would
be 'counter-productive and very dangerous' to set explicit exchange rate
bands ahead of monetary union which he expects after 1999. The decision
should be taken at the end of the two-year period in which 'normal
fluctuation margins' have to be adhered to. 'I just don't see how we can put
any precise figure on that today.' He said the 'very hard lesson' of crises
in the European exchange rate mechanism showed that very specific currency
fluctuation margins 'give a bonus to speculative pressure'.

Ukraine's parliament yesterday revoked the immunity of Mr Yefim Zvyahilsky
(61), the former prime minister accused of embezzling millions of dollars in
barely eight months in office, thus opening the door to his prosecution.
Detailed charges against Mr Zvyahilsky, who headed the government from
October 1993 to last June, centre on allegedly fraudulent business deals,
illegal currency trading and skimming off state contracts. The prosecutor,
Mr Vladislav Datsyuk, yesterday said the former prime minister, now a
deputy, would be charged with theft and grand larceny - activities which, he
said, cost Ukraine Dollars 25m. Funds, allegedly transferred to a Swiss bank
account, had not been recovered. The prosecutor may request the extradition
of Mr Zvyahilsky, who is in Israel undergoing medical treatment.

The Hungarian government's credibility with foreign investors was on the
line last night as reformers and foreign advisers sought to persuade
socialist ministers to complete plans to sell the last state-owned hotel
chain to foreign investors. Senior ministers in the socialist-liberal
coalition government have been pressing for the state to ignore an
international tender for the 15 properties owned by HungarHotels and
transfer the assets to the cash-strapped state social security fund.
Mr Ferenc Bartha, the privatisation commissioner, told an FT investment
conference here that he hoped for a 'positive' decision at a meeting on the
sale today which would allow one of the three shortlisted foreign bidders to
continue purchase negotiations. The top contenders for the group which owns
some of the country's prime tourist hotels are American General Hospitality,
a privately owned US group, and Intercontinental, the Japanese owned

The US and its Nato allies are considering establishing a 10km heavy weapons

Serb forces overrunning the Moslem-held enclave. The possibility has been
raised as forces loyal to Mr Fikret Abdic, ousted Moslem leader of the Bihac
enclave, are being mobilised to join a Serb offensive against the area, UN
officials said. Mr Michael Williams, UN spokesman, said in Sarajevo: 'Our
estimate is that Mr Abdic is presently mobilising a force of at least 5,000
from refugee camps.' Bosnian Serb forces had fired seven Sam anti-aircraft
missiles at the Bihac pocket on Monday, he confirmed. About 30,000 people
loyal to Mr Abdic last August fled the Bihac pocket, a UN safe area, after
being defeated by Bosnian government forces.

FT  16 NOV 94 / EU plans to scrap farm price cushion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
One of the European Union's most expensive policies, originally intended to
cushion farmers' incomes from currency fluctuations, is to be scrapped under
plans Brussels will publish today.
The policy, which is known as 'switchover', has cost the EU budget around
Ecu6bn (Pounds 4.7bn) since it was introduced a decade ago. It has added 21
per cent to European farm prices, according to European Commission
officials.
One Brussels official yesterday heralded the near-certain abolition of the
scheme as 'the death of a great dinosaur'.
Only Germany, at whose behest the system was introduced in 1984, opposes
ending switchover. But as current president of the EU it is in the invidious
position of having to chair next month's meeting of agriculture ministers
which should decide on the issue; this obliges Bonn to concentrate on
winning consensus rather than allies.
Switchover, part of the EU's complex 'green money' system for converting
agricultural subsidies into national currencies, realigns farm prices in
every EU member state to follow the upward movements of the strongest EU
currency, invariably the D-Mark but often the Dutch guilder as well.
Although designed to protect Germany's politically influential farmers, it
has become an inflation machine which locks farm price increases permanently
into the EU budget, over half of which goes on the Common Agricultural
Policy.
The Commission fought to abolish switchover after reform of the CAP in 1992
cut farm prices sharply. But Germany won a two-year extension following that
autumn's turmoil in the European exchange rate mechanism currency grid.
But, after the decision in August 1993 to float all currencies within wide
bands of the ERM, there have been no formal realignments and Brussels put
the scheme in abeyance. Germany argues that, in practice, the 'hard' ERM
currencies have continued to trade within narrow bands, putting farmers in
the countries concerned at a disadvantage against currencies such as the
lira, the peseta or sterling, which have 'floated' over the past two years.
The Commission is unmoved and holds a strong hand. Moreover, it would be
particularly hard for Germany, which complains that it is by far the largest
contributor to the EU budget, to produce cogent arguments to retain or
extend in time such manifestly indiscriminate compensation.
'The Germans have to recognise that every time the switchover is triggered,
they're paying a third of the bill, while their farmers are only getting
about a quarter of the take,' one Commission official said.
What the Commission now wants is to target compensation on farmers who lose
out on sharp currency realignments and pay them directly, rather than by
increasing prices. But it may insist this is paid out of national budgets
and would be tough on eligibility 'in the light of the 20 per cent windfall
many farmers have had over the past 10 years' through switchover, one
Brussels official said.
Here too, the Commission is in a strong position. Any increase in EU aid
which raises farm prices now quickly runs into three formidable and linked
obstacles: a tight agriculture budget ceiling; a reformed CAP whose success
depends on prices coming down; and EU commitments under the Uruguay Round
world trade agreement to slash farm price support.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Lauda Air lands right to fly into Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nikki Lauda, Austria's former Formula One racing champion, came up against
some tough opponents in his career on the world's racing circuits. But few
have rivalled his latest adversary - the French transport ministry.
Yesterday, after months of wrangling, a last minute agreement allowed the
founder and chairman of Lauda Air to pilot his airline's first services to
Paris.
The agreement, however, represents an uneasy compromise rather than a
long-term solution. Mr Lauda touched his Boeing 737 down at Charles de
Gaulle airport in northern Paris, not his preferred destination of Orly to
the south of the capital.
Nor is the battle over. 'We want and expect approval to fly to Orly very
soon,' says Mr Derek Jewson, commercial director of Lauda Air.
The launch of Lauda Air's services is the latest test of strength between
foreign airlines seeking access to French air routes and destinations,
particularly to Orly, which is closer to the centre of Paris and more
convenient for internal French connections.
In June, France was forced to allow British carriers to fly to Orly from
London after a confrontation with the British government and the European
Commission and a threat by the airlines that they would take off for Paris
without landing authorisation.
France says it is committed to liberalising routes to Orly but argues that
it needs time prepare for the introduction of competition. The French
transport ministry yesterday confirmed that it it planning to open the
airport to EU carriers from the beginning of next year. But several EU
airlines including Lufthansa of Germany, which holds a 39 per cent stake in
Lauda Air, and KLM of the Netherlands, have pushed for quicker access.
As with the British carriers, the launch of services by Lauda Air was a case
of brinksmanship. As late as Monday evening, the Austrian airline was
planning to fly to Orly, despite warnings that its aircraft could be
impounded and that passengers would not be allowed to disembark.
The Austrian airline said that it had awarded landing slots for Orly in the
summer. Six weeks ago, however, Lauda Air claimed it had been informed by
the French government that it could not start services as planned. Instead,
the airline says that it was offered landing slots at Charles de Gaulle, but
the timings were inconvenient.
A compromise was finally reached after the French government made available
better slots, which allowed Mr Lauda's aircraft to take off from Vienna at
8.40 am yesterday rather than 5.55, as was previously offered.
For Lauda Air, however, it is not the end of the matter. Before heading back
to Vienna, Mr Lauda held meetings with French officials to press his case.
'If we don't get access to Orly soon we will pursue a legal course,' said Mr
Jewson.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Growth slows in sale of new cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New car sales in west Europe rose by 3.3 per cent in October year-on-year to
916,700, according to provisional figures from Acea, the European Automobile
Manufacturers Association. The rate of growth has slowed since the early
summer, and last month sales were lower than a year ago in eight of the 17
markets.
In the first 10 months of the year sales rose by 4.9 per cent to 10.18m with
higher sales in 11 markets.
The pace of recovery has been slowed by the German market, where October
sales are estimated to have fallen by 1 per cent to 250,000. The European
market was also hit by a 3 per cent decline in the UK, which had previously
played an important role in leading the industry out of recession.
However, there was continuing strong growth in France and Spain, where
demand has been stimulated by government incentives. There are signs too
that the deep recession in the Italian market may be over. Sales rose by an
estimated 6.2 per cent in October against a 6.7 per cent decline in the
first 10 months.
Growth has been strongest this year in the Nordic countries. Sales in the 10
months have risen in Denmark by 73.3 per cent year-on-year, Norway (39.5),
Sweden (27.5) and Finland (22.7).
Japanese carmakers have lost ground with sales falling by 6.7 per cent in
the period. Their share has declined to 11.1 per cent from 12.5 per cent a
year ago with their competitiveness under heavy pressure from the strong
yen.
The Japanese have only small shares, too, in some of the protected markets
such as France and Spain, which have shown strongest growth among the big
volume markets.
The PSA Peugeot Citroen group and Renault have benefited most from rising
demand in these two markets and have emerged this year as the fastest
growing volume carmakers in west Europe.
Peugeot Citroen has increased its sales by 10.1 per cent and has raised its
market share to 12.8 per cent from 12.2 per cent a year ago.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Irish coalition teeters on the brink: How a political
marriage turned sour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ireland woke up wearily yesterday to the realisation that yet another
government had been dragged close to the brink of collapse.
The political showdown, which could yet be resolved in parliament today, has
nonetheless soured relations between Fianna Fail and its Labour partner.
On this occasion it was triggered by Labour party criticism of the attorney
general's mishandling of a child abuse case. The Fianna Fail prime minister,
Mr Albert Reynolds, almost certainly misjudged the reaction of his junior
coalition partner to his appointment of the attorney general, Mr Harry
Whelehan, as president of the High Court.
However, the roots of this particular breakdown go deeper and lie in the
unhappy marriage between Fianna Fail, the dominant force in Irish politics
since the foundation of the state in the 1920s, and Labour, the small
left-of-centre party.
From the beef tribunal scandal to the famous X-case involving the attorney
general's injunction preventing a 14-year-old rape victim from seeking an
abortion in the UK, Labour has looked increasingly uncomfortable.
Even on the key foreign policy issue of Northern Ireland, there were
suggestions that Labour was unhappy with Mr Reynolds's insistence on forcing
the pace on the peace process.
The government was formed in January 1993, after the 1992 general election
prompted by Fianna Fail's falling out with its former partners, the
Progressive Democrats.
There have been natural policy differences. On social issues, Labour has had
to swallow hard. Despite six cabinet posts against Fianna Fail's nine, it
has appeared isolated from the key economic decision-making. A tax amnesty
aimed at enticing black earnings into the exchequer, passed last year, was
unsuccessfully resisted by Labour. There have been squabbles about how to
spend the Pounds 7bn Ireland receives from the European Union in farm
support and structural and other funds.
But in many dispassionate Irish eyes, the coalition, the first between these
two parties, has made considerable legislative progress, passing some 40
bills.
At one level, the Reynolds-Spring team seemed an awkward combination. It was
partly a question of generation - Mr Reynolds at 59, is 15 years older than
the Labour leader, Mr Dick Spring. Mr Reynolds, despite heading what is in
Ireland the establishment party, is unusual in being a self-made man, having
amassed a fortune in the pet food business and before that as a showband
impresario. Mr Spring, by contrast, entered politics in 1981, taking over
the North Kerry seat on the death of his father, a dynastic practice common
in the Irish parliament.
But, at a deeper level, there is a fundamental personality difference. Mr
Reynolds's can-do approach to policy has often seemed high-handed, and has
irritated the prickly and rather solemn Labour leader.
In the current row, for all the high moral talk of 'public accountability',
there were few illusions in Dublin that the real scalp Mr Spring is seeking
is that of Mr Reynolds himself.
They have clashed before; on both occasions Mr Spring gave ground. First,
there was the case of the two foreigners who had invested in Mr Reynolds's
petfood business who were given citizenship: the so-called 'passports for
sale' scandal.
The final straw was the Beef Tribunal, an investigation into the misuse of
official export credits, where Mr Spring again found himself questioning the
prime minister's role. With convenient timing, when the Dail (parliament)
came to debate the issue, the controversy was overshadowed by the IRA's
ceasefire.
In forcing the issue to a head, Mr Spring has clearly calculated that this
crisis is sufficient to take to the country, a measure of how the moral
climate has changed in Ireland in the past two decades.
The emotive issue of child abuse by a Catholic priest, is seen by the Labour
strategists as a natural winner, pitting 'secular' Labour against Fianna
Fail, traditionally the church's political ally.
Fianna Fail may still command the loyalty of its largely rural-based
support; an opinion poll only 10 days put the party streets ahead, with 50
per cent. However, with one of the youngest populations in Europe, and the
fastest rates of rural depopulation, this latest crisis could well signal a
significant shift in the centre of political gravity in Irish politics.
Like British attitudes to royalty, the Irish have a fascination with the
moral mishaps of their priests. As Fianna Fail's popularity at the polls
fades, so the church's hold over society has weakened, and the old
irredentist myths of a united Ireland have faded.
In a society which holds its rock stars up as examples of excellence, Fianna
Fail no longer looks to many younger people like the natural party of
government.
It would doubly ironic if, as seemed possible yesterday, President Mary
Robinson were now to play a key role in this crisis. It was her election,
more than any other recent event which underlined these changes. Her victory
as Ireland's first woman president marked Fianna Fail's first ever defeat
for its presidential candidate.

Forces loyal to Mr Fikret Abdic, the ousted Moslem leader, are being
mobilised to join a Serb offensive against Bihac, the northwestern Moslem
enclave, UN officials said yesterday. 'Our estimate is that Mr Abdic is
presently mobilising a force of at least 5,000 from refugee camps,' Mr
Michael Williams, UN spokesman told reporters. Bosnian Serb forces are
reportedly closing in on Bihac; Mr Williams yesterday confirmed they fired
seven Sam anti-aircraft missiles at the Bihac pocket on Monday. About 30,000
civilians and soldiers last August fled the Bihac pocket, designated a UN
safe area, after being defeated by Bosnian government forces. They lived
under difficult living conditions in Serb-held lands in Croatia, when Zagreb
refused to let them cross into the self-styled Serb state. Local Serbs have
re-armed Mr Abdic's soldiers, apparently preparing an assault from Croatia,
which borders the Bihac pocket, the dense Moslem heartland.

Norwegians are increasingly warming to the idea of European Union membership
and more people are taking a stand on the issue although opposition to the
move continues to hold a clear lead, according to four opinion polls
undertaken after Sweden voted to join the European Union. Since Sweden's Yes
vote on Sunday, Norway has stepped up its campaign to convince a reluctant
electorate to approve membership in a referendum on November 28.
The surveys revealed that the Yes camp has narrowed the gap by between 5-6
percentage points and has gathered support for the move from 38.3 per cent
of the voters. But those opposed retain a strong lead, increasing support
for a No vote by just under one percentage point to an average 47 per cent.
The sharpest movement in the polls was by those undecided where the figures
dropped sharply to an average 14.8 per cent from 20.8 per cent.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Former premier loses immunity

<TEXT>
Ukraine's parliament yesterday revoked the immunity of Mr Yefim Zvyahilsky,
the former prime minister accused of embezzling millions of dollars in
barely eight months in office, thus opening the door to his prosecution.
Detailed charges against Mr Zvyahilsky, who headed the government from
October 1993 to last June, centre on allegedly fraudulent business deals,
illegal currency trading and skimming off state contracts. The prosecutor,
Mr Vladislav Datsyuk, yesterday said the former prime minister, now a
deputy, would be charged with theft and grand larceny - activities which, he
said, cost Ukraine Dollars 25m. Mr Datsyuk claimed the former prime minister
was accused of arranging the sale of strategic high-grade aviation fuel to a
Greek-registered company at low prices; the state only received Dollars 10m
of a reportedly Dollars 15m contract, he said. The prosecutor also told
deputies that Mr Zvyahilsky, a former coal mine director from Donetsk, a
large city in eastern Ukraine, was suspected of embezzling around Dollars 3m
from a state-owned agro-industry company. The funds, allegedly transferred
to a Swiss bank account, have not been recovered.
Mr Zvyahilsky is currently in Israel undergoing medical treatment. After
yesterday's vote, the prosecutor may seek his formal extradition. If
convicted, the 61-year-old faces a minimum of 15 years in jail.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Fed raises US short-term rates by 3/4 of a point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Federal Reserve surprised the financial markets yesterday with an
increase of three-quarters of a percentage point in short-term interest
rates intended to keep inflation under control.
The increase is the largest adjustment the Fed has made under the
chairmanship of Mr Alan Greenspan, who has preferred more gradual changes in
monetary policy, and responds to what the Fed called 'evidence of persistent
strength in economic activity and high and rising levels of resource
utilisation'.
The size of the increase unsettled Wall Street, which had expected the Fed
to raise short-term rates by only half a percentage point. Share and bond
prices immediately jumped sharply as the markets applauded the central
bank's resolve to fight inflation. But they later retreated as investors
worried that the Fed's comments about its concern at the strength of the
economy suggested it might raise rates again soon.
By the close in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average - which
fluctuated wildly all afternoon - was down 3.37 at 3,826.36. The bond market
held its modest gains, which pushed the yield on the long bond down slightly
to 8.047 per cent. Currency markets, however, reacted unequivocally to the
Fed's move, with the dollar rising a pfennig to DM1.555 and half a yen to
Y98.7. The dollar opened in Tokyo at Y98.61 and DM1.5565.
'The Federal Reserve views these actions as necessary to keep inflation
contained, and thereby foster sustainable economic growth,' the Fed said
after its federal open markets committee, which sets interest rate policy,
met yesterday.
The move is the sixth interest rate increase this year, and takes the
federal funds rate, which banks pay when they borrow from each other's
reserves held at the Fed, to 5.5 per cent from 3.0 per cent at the beginning
of the year. The discount rate, which banks pay for direct borrowings from
the Fed, also started the year at 3 per cent but has risen only to 4.75 per
cent.
Many commercial banks immediately followed suit, lifting their prime rates
by three-quarters of a percentage point to 8.5 per cent.
Financial market traders and economists have been beseeching the Fed to act
decisively to slow economic activity. But the Fed has not moved rates by
more than half a percentage point in either direction since 1981.
When the FOMC last met in September, it decided to leave rates unchanged, in
spite of the growing conviction of Wall Street economists that another move
would be needed.
Economic data available at the time of the September meeting showed that US
gross domestic product had grown at a 3.8 per cent annualised pace in the
second quarter, the unemployment rate had stabilised at 6.1 per cent and the
National Association of Purchasing Managers' index showed a slowdown in
manufacturing activity.
Since then, second-quarter growth has been revised up to 4.1 per cent, with
the third quarter still humming along at a 3.4 per cent rate; unemployment
has dipped to 5.8 per cent and the NAPM index has risen sharply for the past
two months.
Industrial production figures yesterday added to the picture of 'persistent
strength in economic activity and high and rising levels of resource
utilisation'.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Whirlpool to cut 3,200 jobs in drive to save Dollars 150m a
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Whirlpool, the US-based maker of washing machines and other home appliances,
said yesterday it planned to eliminate 3,200 jobs in Europe and North
America next year - some 8 per cent of its worldwide workforce of 40,000.
It said the job losses were part of a cost-cutting drive that would save
Dollars 150m (Pounds 91.4m) a year. In the short term, however, the
re-structuring will hit earnings: the company said it would result in a
pretax charge of Dollars 240m to fourth-quarter profits this year.
The brunt of the job losses will fall on Whirlpool's European operations,
where the existing workforce of 13,000 will be reduced by 2,000. The rest
will be in the US and Canada, where the workforce of 23,000 will be cut by
1,200.
Whirlpool, the world's biggest manufacturer of home appliances, said the
move was aimed at increasing competitiveness. In Europe, it said, the
restructuring was part of a process of integration that had been going on
since the company acquired the Philips Electronics home appliance business
in 1991.
Recently, Whirlpool's financial performance has been strong. In the quarter
to September, big increases in sales helped the company produce a 40 per
cent increase in net income to Dollars 98m. But profitability in Europe has
consistently lagged that of the company's US operations.
Like other big manufacturers, Whirlpool has been trying to improve European
profitability by reorganising on pan-European lines. As part of the process
it has already consolidated most functions, including buying, product
development, customer service, information technology and some
manufacturing.
Yesterday the company said it would extend the approach to sales and
marketing and complete the process in other functions. The result would be
job losses across all functions and geographic areas. However, no European
factories would be closed.
In contrast, the job losses in North America will come mainly from plant
closures. Whirlpool said it was closing a plastic components factory in
Columbia, South Carolina, with the loss of 500 jobs, and a clothes drier
factory in Cambridge, Ontario, with the loss of 400 jobs. The remaining cuts
would fall on salaried staff in US manufacturing.
Whirlpool said production of the plastic components made in Columbia would
be transferred to suppliers near its US assembly plants. Cambridge
production would be transferred to the company's plant in Marion, Ohio.

FT  16 NOV 94 / EU auditors court hits at Brussels over fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER, DAVID GARDNER and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG, BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union's Court of Auditors blasted the European Commission
yesterday for lax financial management and a failure to tackle fraud, which
it said had become endemic inside the EU.
Commission officials called part of the court's 484-page report
ill-informed, but Euro-sceptic Conservative MPs in the UK claimed it would
stiffen opposition to legislation increasing British contributions to the
EU, which will be announced at the opening of parliament today.
Mr Andre Middelhoek, court president, said in Strasbourg that it was
impossible to estimate how much money went astray from the Ecu64.2bn (Pounds
50.2bn) of EU funds paid out in 1993. 'Fraud exists everywhere. There's no
question of it just being something that happens in one country as opposed
to another,' he said.
But the strictures by the court, the EU's main financial watchdog, on Union
aid to east and central Europe, and the former Soviet republics - worth
Ecu1.1bn and Ecu530m respectively last year - were dismissed. Officials
working with Sir Leon Brittan, the commissioner responsible for the
programmes, said they were 'misleading, inaccurate, or by now outdated' .
They 'reflect an insufficient understanding of how the programmes work or
the specific circumstances on the ground', one official said.
The court, for instance, says that EU food aid to the Baltic states undercut
local food prices, driving an embryonic private sector out of business. Sir
Leon's officials say that, in fact, food prices were already well below
world levels, and the Commission and Baltic governments therefore set higher
minimum prices to prevent former state-owned enterprises from undercutting
private traders.
The report identifies several serious cases of fraud, mismanagement or
incompetence in the EU.
Wine production has risen by one-fifth since 1989 despite EU spending
totalling Ecu1.2bn to take vineyards out of production. The European
Parliament failed to enforce competitive tenders for its new building in
Brussels. The cost has risen from original estimates of about Ecu1bn to
Ecu1.83bn.
EU payments to persuade milk and wine producers to cut production are still
being offset by political incentives to increase output.
The report's appearance coincides with a planned Ecu600m increase in the EU
budget in 1995, which could face opposition in some member states, notably
the UK.
Mr Bill Cash, a leading right-wing Euro-sceptic, seized on the report as
evidence that British taxpayers were contributing to a 'bottomless,
fraudulent pit'. Other rightwingers forecast a rebellion against the bill.
But British ministers praised the Court of Auditors for identifying the
fraud, and played down the prospects of a backbench rebellion.

FT  16 NOV 94 / Top aides go in Major's shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major extended the shake-up of his inner circle of advisers
yesterday by announcing that two of the most prominent backroom politicians
in Downing Street would be replaced.
In a further restructuring of the team that will mastermind the Conservative
party's campaign at the next election, the prime minister's office announced
that Mrs Sarah Hogg would stand down as head of the No. 10 Policy Unit.
Mrs Hogg, one of the prime minister's closest aides, has held the post for
four years. But she has recently been strongly criticised by Tory MPs for
some of the prime minister's policy failures.
In addition, Mr Jonathan Hill is leaving his job as political secretary to
the prime minister. He will be replaced by Mr Howell James, a former
director of corporate affairs at the BBC and one-time adviser to Lord Young,
the former trade secretary.
Downing Street emphasised that Mrs Hogg, who has been in charge of the prime
minister's political strategy, was leaving at her own request and had told
Mr Major of her wishes last summer.
Her replacement has not been announced, but senior Tory figures said Mr
Nicholas True, deputy head of the policy unit, was a strong candidate.
The advisers' departure further indicates Mr Major's determination to make a
clean sweep of the top jobs in his kitchen cabinet with little more than two
years until the next election.
Yesterday's moves follow the appointment of Mr Christopher Meyer, a former
diplomat, as press secretary, and of Mr John Ward, the MP for Poole, as his
parliamentary private secretary.
Rightwing Tory MPs did not disguise their pleasure at the departure of Mrs
Hogg, who is regarded as a staunch supporter of European Union integration
and of Britain's ill-fated membership of the exchange rate mechanism. Mrs
Hogg has also been seen as the architect of the prime minister's
unsuccessful 'back to basics' campaign.
However, Mr Major expressed his sadness at her decision to leave. 'Her
staunchness and her wise advice have been of incalculable value,' he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
About 100,000 civilians have been killed in Angola since the country's civil
war resumed two years ago, Human Rights Watch said in a report due for
publication today, Reuter reports from Lisbon.
The New York-based organisation said both sides had been guilty of torture,
summary executions and the recruitment of child soldiers. It urged the
United Nations to enforce an arms embargo against the two sides.
The report, released on the same day as the Angolan government and the rebel
movement Unita had been due to sign a new peace agreement, also demanded
that the UN deploy human rights monitors throughout the country.
The report, entitled 'Angola: Arms Trade and Violations of the Law since the
1992 Elections', said the Angolan government had become the biggest arms
importer in sub-Saharan Africa, buying more than Dollars 3.5bn of military
equipment over the past two years. 'The government is believed to have
mortgaged the next seven years of oil production to finance this huge
build-up of weaponry,' it said.

<TEXT>
Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto yesterday offered to make peace with
her political opponents after the opposition tried to shout down President
Farooq Leghari (pictured left) during the opening of parliament. Mr
Leghari's 45-minute speech to an annual joint session of the two-chamber
parliament in Islamabad was barely audible amid the non-stop chants of 'Go
Leghari, go'. Excited deputies pushed, shoved and hurled insults at one
another as members of Ms Bhutto's Pakistan People's party (PPP) formed a
protective phalanx around her. PPP deputies lined up on the speaker's dais
to keep their banner-waving opponents at bay. Bhutto supporters later
punched two opposition deputies and witnesses said one of them was bleeding
from the mouth.
'We have always extended the hand of friendship to them,' Ms Bhutto told
reporters later when asked about the chances of a dialogue with opposition
parties. 'Even now the government is willing to talk to them on issues of
national interest,' she said. The incident followed the arrest on Sunday of
Mr Mohammed Sharif, the father of opposition leader Mr Nawaz Sharif, on
charges of obtaining loans fraudulently from foreign banks.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Brussels reports stronger recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic recovery in the European Union is gathering in strength as
confidence grows in the industrial and construction sectors and among
consumers, the European Commission reported yesterday.
The preliminary results of its business and consumer survey for October
disclosed a sharp improvement in industrial confidence last month and a
recovery in capacity utilisation in manufacturing industry to the average of
the past 11 years.
The Commission said its October survey showed that capacity utilisation,
which is measured every three months, jumped to 81.5 per cent among
manufacturers in the 12 member states, from 80.4 per cent in July.
Utilisation was up 4.1 percentage points from the 77.4 per cent level of
October 1993 and half way between the most recent 77.2 per cent low of July
last year and the most recent high of 85.8 per cent registered in the late
1980s.
Britain, according to Commission estimates, had the highest level of
capacity utilisation at 85.3 per cent and was narrowly ahead of the
Netherlands and France. Ireland and Spain had the lowest levels of capacity
use in the EU.
However, the improvement in manufacturing activity will not lead to higher
employment in the EU. Only in Denmark did the number of manufacturers saying
they expected to boost employment exceed those expecting to shed labour.
The survey revealed that the EU's industrial confidence indicator, which is
compiled from business peoples' replies on a number of issues such as order
books and selling price expectations, improved to plus three in October from
zero in September and minus 14 in the first quarter of this year. This
indicator is now close to the recent high of plus six recorded between 1988
and 1990 and well above the minus 28 level registered in the recession
between 1991 and 1993.
The index of consumer confidence, which collates the views of households
about their financial situation, the general economic situation and their
inclination to make large purchases was less buoyant. It registered minus 10
last month for the EU as a whole, although this was an improvement on
September's level of minus 12 and the 1991-93 low of minus 26. The highest
level reached by the EU's consumer confidence indicator between 1988 and
1990 was minus three.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Berlusconi faces huge aid bill for flood damage: Costs may
be underestimated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Berlusconi government is searching for ways to find some L7,000bn
(Dollars 4.6bn) in additional aid to cover the damage caused by last week's
catastrophic flooding in northern Italy.
As an immediate response, the right-wing coalition pledged L3,000bn drawn
from existing funds. But the final assessment of flood damage in Piedmont is
expected this week and initial estimates of more than L10,000bn worth of
damage could prove conservative.
With very limited personal and corporate insurance cover, especially in the
agricultural sector, among the worst affected, individuals, companies and
local authorities are looking to the government for financial help.
Mr Roberto Maroni, the interior minister who has taken charge of the relief
operation, has done nothing to dispel the impression that the government
will foot the bill. Indeed, the government seems more than ready to do this
to offset growing criticism over the authorities' handling of the disaster.
The cost of previous disasters, such as the 1980 Irpinia earthquake in
southern Italy, were financed by increasing taxes on petrol or tobacco. But
this could prove inflationary and the government may well opt to issue a
special bond or introduce a once-off income tax payment.
More than 700 towns and villages were hit by the floods which began on
November 5 in the tributaries of the River Po. Many are still without fresh
water supplies although minimal road communications have been restored
throughout Piedmont. This has enabled about half of the 10,000 people
displaced by the floods to return to their homes.
As the clearing-up operation continues, attention has shifted to
establishing how the authorities were caught seemingly unawares by the
floods. Magistrates in Turin, Alessandria and Asti have opened separate
investigations; and Mr Mario Palmieri, the prefect of Asti, is being
investigated for culpable homicide for his failure to prevent death from the
floods.
At the same time magistrates are looking into the activities and management
of Italy's civil protection agency, which is in charge of preventing natural
disasters.
The magistrates are trying in particular to establish why a fax sent at
16.30 on Thursday November 3 from the Piedmont service for the prevention of
environmental risks was ignored. This fax was marked urgent, warned that
exceptionally heavy rainfall was forecast for Saturday November 5 and
accurately identified the areas at risk.
The warning was sent to the regional authorities, but was either ignored or
played down. In one instance it was buried under a pile of letters for five
days. It is even more remarkable that in spite of the fact that the floods
took more than 24 hours to reach populated centres such as Asti and
Alessandria, none of the big towns were properly prepared.

<TEXT>
The German state of Lower Saxony, bowing to pressure from the federal
government, has approved the first shipment of nuclear waste to a
medium-term storage facility in the northern city of Gorleben. The federal
environment minister, Mr Klaus Topfer, forced the state's hand with an
administrative order. The Lower Saxony environment minister, Mrs Monika
Griefahn, said her approval was conditional on removal of the waste within
seven years and insisted that the facility should pose no health risks for
people who live in the area. She also said waste storage facilities should
be built up at nuclear reactors themselves, and that Gorleben would accept
no nuclear waste that had been reprocessed outside Germany. The first
shipment of waste, from a reactor in southern Germany, could take place on
November 24. The transport is likely to involve one of the largest police
actions in post-war German history. An estimated 4,500 police will be
deployed in Lower Saxony alone to protect the shipment, and thousands more
police will be on the 500km route.

FT  15 NOV 94 / BASF buys Boots prescription drug arm for Dollars 1.4bn:
Biggest of recent German healthcare deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BASF, the German chemicals manufacturer, took its biggest step yet into the
pharmaceuticals industry yesterday by agreeing to pay 'about Pounds 850m'
(Dollars 1.4bn) for the prescription drugs arm of Boots, the UK retailer.
The proposed deal, still subject to detailed contract discussions, would be
BASF's third in two months.
The pace of dealmaking indicates a determined - if belated - effort to
improve the performance of Knoll, BASF's drugs division. Knoll has annual
sales of only DM2bn and fell into loss last year, compared with Bayer's
drugs business, which contributes about two thirds of group profits from
annual sales of DM8bn (Dollars 5.3bn).
BASF said yesterday the rationale for the Boots acquisition was 'both
therapeutic and geographic'. Boots is strong in the US, UK and Commonmwealth
countries while BASF has most of its business in continental Europe.
BASF also wants Boots' expertise in nervous-system drugs. Boots has licences
to develop two such drugs, with projected launch dates at the end of the
decade. Until then, BASF will have to make do with an old and small product
portfolio.
In the first half of 1994, Boots achieved prescription drugs sales of Pounds
226m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 49.8m. Spending on research and
development was Pounds 33m.
Most of Boots's prescription drug sales and profits come from Synthroid, a
thyroid drug available only in the US. The drug had first-half sales of
Dollars 117m - outside the world's top 100 best sellers. Synthroid, like all
other significant Boots products, has no patent protection.
Older drugs have been a central theme of BASF's deals recently. Last month
it bought rights to 80 out-of-patent generic drugs from Hexal Pharma and
signed a deal with Ivax, the second-biggest generics company in the US, to
distribute drugs in Europe.
In global terms, the Boots deal is small. BASF's Pharma division has annual
sales of DM2bn. With the Boots operation, BASF would move from about 40th
biggest in the world in terms of drugs sales to about 30th.
The acquisition would nevertheless be the biggest of the recent forays into
healthcare by German chemicals companies.
In March, Bayer spent Dollars 130m on a 28.3 per cent stake in Schein, a
privately owned US group. That followed last year's Dollars 546m purchase by
Hoechst of a 51 per cent stake in Copley Pharmaceuticals, another US
company.
For Boots, the proposed deal ends months of speculation over Boots's
intentions. The company put its prescription drugs business up for sale when
adverse side-effects of its most promising drug, the heart treatment
Manoplax, forced it in July 1993 to abandon its development.
Yesterday's decision commits the UK company to developing as a retailer,
after it has spent most of its 140-year history trying to combine healthcare
with shopkeeping.
BASF beat several rivals to the deal, including a management buy-out team.
Other companies that had been in talks with Boots included Zeneca and Medeva
of the UK, but no agreement was reached on price.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Names force out details on agencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hard-hit members of Lloyd's of London yesterday won a court order forcing
details to be given on the level of insurance cover bought by the
professional agencies they are suing to meet possible negligence awards,
Ralph Atkins writes.
The ruling in the High Court may lead to some indication being given about
the amount of money available to meet any damages awarded to Names, the
individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the Lloyd's insurance
market.
The decision is a fillip for Names such as the Gooda Walker Action Group
members, who last month won damages they estimated at Pounds 504m against
Lloyd's agencies but have yet to discover how much they might actually
receive.
However, lawyers acting for those who provided the errors and omissions
cover said they would appeal against the ruling. They also said the figures,
if released, would not indicate how much Names might be entitled to receive
because that would depend on the details of actual claims made on the errors
and omissions policies, rather than on global figures on total cover.
Solicitors Clyde &amp; Co also said the High Court's decision was 'unnecessary
and irrelevant' to its attempts in the High Court to obtain guidance on
whether Gooda Walker Names, and others near the front of the queue of
lossmaking Names seeking legal redress, should be allowed to exhaust funds
available from the errors and omissions 'pot'.
But Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, said: 'The
E&amp;O insurers are always saying that there is not enough cover there to pay
us, so why are they so reluctant to reveal these policies?'

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (16): A fixed-price contract
to control costs - Facilities management/Outsourcing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's first multilateral foreign exchange netting and settlement
service is about to become a reality and - in a coup for the outsourcing
world - has decided to outsource its entire data processing operation from
scratch.
The Exchange Clearing House, Echo, co-operatively funded by more than a
dozen banks worldwide, as a 'green field site' is far from a typical
facilities management (FM) deal because the FM partner - the Hoskyns Group -
will be involved in the development of the systems as well as the
maintenance and day-to-day running of it.
Concern for security was a crucial factor in the decision to take the
outsourcing route. Uninterrupted, secure, 24-hour trading was so important
that Echo needed at least one secure computer site for its information
technology (IT), an expense that few in-house operations could bear.
Another unusual aspect was the amount of work put in during the early
stages. The five bidders on the shortlist for the contract had to work out
in detail how they would develop the systems and exactly what resources
would be needed, before Echo was even sure of its financial backing.
In spite of the unusual nature of the deal, Echo's chief executive Graham
Duncan cites the classic reasons for choosing an outsourced deal rather than
'growing in-house expertise.' He was looking for a fixed-price contract that
would make IT costs controllable and he wanted a ready-made team,
well-versed in the world of finance, that could work well together from day
one. He also wanted the security of a partner large enough to offer backup
expertise and systems, running parallel sites for disaster recovery.
'This was a unique project: no-one had tried to do this before. It had to go
out to tender before we could be sure of the finance, and for that reason
the venture would only work if we found outsourcing partners who really
understood the business,' he says.
Banks participating in Echo will be able to pool the amounts due to each
other from foreign exchange (FX) deals. A single payment of the net amount
due in each currency is then made between each bank and Echo.
As well as drastically reducing the expense of FX trading, and cutting the
volume and administration of transactions, the netting system also reduces
settlement and replacement risks for the participating banks.
During the five-year gestation period, Mr Duncan worked out how to extend
the low-risk ethos to his IT strategy - 'we look on outsourcing as a risk
reduction strategy. We had not a desk nor a paper clip, and what I wanted
was a short cut to quality and to competence, so that all our time and
team-building could be focused on doing the business.'
The value of business to be handled by the system (about Dollars 1,000bn
daily) dwarfed the run-of-the mill IT security problems - 'we focused at the
beginning on two concerns: air crashes and bombs. Bombs in a financial
centre offer a short cut for terrorists, and an air crash can wipe out an
entire facility.'
Within two years, evidence justified this approach, with bombs being planted
in the City of London, and a Jumbo jet crashing outside Amsterdam, within a
half-mile of two trading sites.
Echo only looked at software houses that could offer FM facilities as well
as development skills. Hoskyns, in partnership with one of the UK's most
experienced financial software houses, Logica, was chosen as one of only two
bids remaining (and the only European company) from a shortlist of five,
which itself had been whittled down from an original invitation to tender to
17 worldwide FM providers.
Hoskyns is providing two data sites, and through the sub-contractor Logica,
development services for software based on IBM AS400s and a network of Vax
computers, Sun workstations and Apple Mac servers. The entire contract is
worth Pounds 14m over five years. To reach this figure, both sides in the
deal had to be sure of exactly what could be delivered, what resources would
be needed, and exactly how delivery could be measured.
Mr Duncan dismisses the argument that IT is too precious to cede control to
another source: IT, he says, is difficult to control in any case, and having
a service level agreement offers more control than many organisations have
over their in-house IT.
'I've always been a fan of outsourcing because the financial service
industry ought to concentrate on being the financial services industry. For
many institutions, it's a drain on their resources and a distraction from
their main business.'
Fixed-price contracts generally profit both parties. FM is the direct heir
of the bureau services used 20 years ago in assuming that a user is able to
put a value (not just a price) on IT services. Often, outsourcing is
associated with old mainframe based 'legacy' systems, freeing the user to
concentrate on core business.
However, partnerships, rather than mere client/provider relationships are
now in vogue. Recent trends have been to 'split the profit' between client
and provider, where real savings have been made. Andersen Consulting was
awarded the contract for the London Stock Exchange (LSE) computer
operations, which employed 400 staff, costing Pounds 50m a year in 1991.
The contract (awarded without tender, due to the preparatory work) has been
running since early 1992, with the target of reducing staff by 24 per cent
in the first year - 'our aim was to reduce the total running costs by Pounds
10m a year, in two years, and by Pounds 20m per annum in five years. We're
already ahead of target,' says Vernon Ellis, the managing partner for
Andersen Consulting in Europe in charge of the LSE project.
'We proposed taking the entire operation over, and reducing the cost of
running and maintaining to free up LSE resources to develop new market
trading systems.'
But not everyone is convinced. Brian Periera, manager of information systems
for Pricoa Relocation Management, is talking to several potential partners,
all FM suppliers, in a project to re-vamp the core systems of the company.
Pricoa is the London Region of Prudential Resources Management of America,
which manages large clients such as IBM and its parent, the Prudential
Insurance Co of America, in staff relocation schemes.
'Facilities management just isn't an option for the relocation division. We
feel that by outsourcing, you're putting too many valuable resources in the
hands of people outside our own company. If we wanted to go back, to take
control again, it would be a difficult move, and that's a major fear for any
company to whom systems are important. In-house control has to be assured.'

Enfield, in north London, can perhaps lay claim to being the oldest junction
on the financial world's information superhighway. It was here, at a branch
of Barclays, that the world's first 'hole-in-the-wall' cash dispenser went
live, in June 1965. Now there are 300,000 of the ubiquitous automated teller
machines (ATMs).
Gallup Organisation, the market researcher, says that six out of 10 adults
in the industrialised countries of the west now carry an ATM card. And,
according to Tony Knight, who researches telecommunications and computing
technology at Henley Management College, the ATM is developing into a much
more capable terminal - 'with the advent of smart cards, the user will be
able to transact much of their financial business through such a terminal,'
he says.
Paul Rogers, marketing manager for AT&amp;T self-service products, which makes a
third of the world's ATMs, says future sales of the ATM will evolve from a
low level cash dispenser into a multimedia kiosk capable of automating many
service functions - 'any retailer wanting to sell services and products or
provide information will use the multimedia kiosks, which have opened up a
whole new delivery channel . . . thus, we'll see a big growth of multimedia
kiosks by the end of the century.'
He also predicts that new entrants could threaten the financial
institutions' monopoly of ATMs - 'new multi-functional terminals could be
operated by telecom companies,' he says, 'These will replace telephone boxes
and will contain video and computer devices. They will be able to link users
by telephone, fax, or computer. Services be paid for by smart cards.
'These terminals, linked to any bank, will be able to credit or debit cards,
so that all kinds of financial transactions can be carried out at one
terminal, to any bank or financial institution,' he says. 'The question is:
'Will the banks get into communications before the communications people get
into banking?''
Whoever is first to operate the new wave of machines, the ultimate winners
will be the ATM manufacturers. NCR, Digital, IBM, Diebold, Fujitsu, Nixdorf
and Olivetti are gearing up to design machines that will allow banks to give
better service to customers.
The Huntington National Bank in the US has already introduced its Personal
Touch system which has an interactive video conferencing service. It allows
ATM-users to see and talk with a bank staff member, 24 hours a day, seven
days a week. Although a video link was demonstrated by the American Bankers'
Association in 1965, until recently the equipment has been too expensive.
Cheaper data storage and communication lines have now made it viable -
'customers are demanding more personal banking convenience,' says Richard
Stage, executive vice-president at Huntington. 'Personal Touch is not the
final solution for personal interactive banking but rather a transitional
solution on the way to home banking services.'
Manufacturers emphasise that for ATM systems to succeed, they must enhance
the feeling that a bank cares for its customers. Gunnar Enroth, in charge of
market development at Digital's Business Centre for Financial Industries in
Stockholm, believes that installations of multi-functional ATMs may not be
the way to achieve greater customer satisfaction.
'Most bank customers use ATMs only to withdraw cash,' says Mr Enroth.
'Nobody likes waiting in a queue. Even a cash withdrawal, particularly from
a hole-in-the-wall machine where the cash has to be transported from inside
the building to the outside, can take up to two minutes. If other, more
lengthy services are offered on the same machine, the customers waiting in
line will soon become disaffected.'
He believes that there will be growing number of fast machines, dedicated to
individual tasks, just as larger branches of banks have specific counters
for different transactions.
Digital has designed terminals which allow customers to make credit
applications, using touch-screen technology. Under law, forms still need to
be printed out and signed before the banks can process the applications but,
with all details captured electronically, the acceptance period is speeded
up.
Bank customers, however, share a natural distrust of new technology. This
could slow down the introduction of new self-service banking terminals -
'the banks must provide real incentives to persuade customers to use the new
terminals,' says Mr Enroth. 'After all, electronic transactions will reduce
bank costs and the benefits should be shared therefore with the customer.'
AT&amp;T has tried to break down techno-fear by making the user's experience
more stimulating. It is supporting the new Galleria 21 shopping concept now
being piloted at Heathrow's passenger terminals. Travellers can explore the
'shopless shop' at 24 shopping kiosks, each of which contains a touch-screen
offering the opportunity to browse through catalogues and make purchases by
inserting credit cards.
Half a dozen British bookmakers are using similar technology to accept bets
on a variety of sporting events. The more that terminals are used in other
spheres of life, the easier it is believed it will be for financial
institutions to automate their outlets.
But what about security? Customers accept ATM cards with magnetic stripes
and are about to experience smart cards with embedded chips. They are also
prepared to memorise Pin numbers. But, if more facilities are to be offered
through ATMs, will the established system give adequate protection to both
the customer and the financial institution?
'We have tested the various other methods being suggested to replace Pin
codes but they are not sufficiently accurate,' says Mr Enroth.
'Face-recognition, palm prints, voice recognition, eye iris matching - so
far, none of these methods have the high accuracy rates which the banks need
so that customers are not wrongly refused service.'
Thus, the familiar plastic 86mm x 54mm card will provide access an
ever-wider range of services. Some observers suggest that even general
elections could one day be held via ATMs. Given that most people are more
secretive about their financial affairs than about their politics, this
development may also be 'on the cards.'

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (14): Award-winning strategy
 -User case study, Leeds Permanent Building Society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No chief executive? No worries, if the latest results of the Leeds Permanent
Building Society are anything to go by. Anyone examining Leeds' promising
1994 results might be forgiven for thinking that its board's 18-month long
search for a new chief executive is almost irrelevant: the UK's fifth
largest building society is already in good hands.
Moreover, according to John Miller, executive director in change of
information systems, the Leeds is setting its sights wider, and higher, than
being just the the fifth largest building society.
'If you look at it in terms of the wider competitive base of banks, building
society and insurance companies, then we're no longer in the top 10. Our
strategy is to be the best provider of home and family services, and that
mission is still valid.'
Mr Miller is one of what he calls 'the troika' - the team of three
executives left at the top when former chief executive Mike Blackburn left
to take charge of the Halifax Building Society in February 1993.
Under Mr Blackburn, the Leeds prided itself on innovation, and information
systems came high on the agenda. The team he left in charge (all appointed
from outside the mainstream of the building society world) has proved its
worth, moving the Leeds forward in the aftermath of the recession.
The Leeds has delivered record financial results and developed innovative
ventures such as Leeds Life, the new life insurance company, and Leeds Unit
Trust, an in-house unit trust company, in the caretaking hands of financial
director and acting chief executive, Roger Boyes. A year ago the Leeds'
brief flirtation with the National &amp; Provincial came to nothing, and it has
continued to re-inforce its own brands, such as Liquid Gold and the Home
Arranger, with extensive television advertising.
In the 1993 annual accounts and directors' report, Mr Boyes put on record
(and up-front) his belief in the need to change, and keep changing: 'If we
are serious about putting the customer first, then nothing about the way we
do things, the way we're organised or the products and services we offer can
remain unchallenged.'
Commercial director, Chris Chadwick oversaw the business process management
initiative, which asked staff to participate in an overhaul of procedures,
with the aim of making the entire organisation more responsive to customers'
needs. More than 7,000 suggestions for improvements were forthcoming,
according to Mr Chadwick - 'some have been small and incremental, others
have meant re-engineering our systems.'
A big re-engineering process has already taken place over the last year with
the development of a unified customer database, the first step in
customer-focused services.
Bringing about the change in information systems is John Miller's job.
Although there was a strong technical emphasis when Mr Miller arrived at the
Leeds three years ago, he found an IT department that waited to be told its
role - 'the organisation was in technical response mode. The IT people
regarded their jobs as translating the needs into a technical solution, not
actually identifying the needs.'
Leeds' operational systems, explains Miller, had to be re-aligned 'to
recognise customers as individuals, rather than a series of account
numbers.' As in many financial institutions, there had been significant
investment in separate applications, running on different computers.
Mortgages, savings accounts, such as Liquid Gold, and general and life
insurance, were all separate products, with account numbers which attached
the customer to that particular product, regardless of other products or
services. There were 4.3m customers, but 7m customer records.
The aim was to create a unified, customer-oriented database which would
enable the Leeds to recognise its customers as users of multiple services,
and to satisfy their needs in different areas by cross-selling further
services and new products.
Olivetti, Unisys, and IBM, and BT were already the main technical partners.
The IBM mainframe-based mortgage package had been augmented in 1990 by a
Unisys-based package of software and hardware. In the late 1980s, more than
420 branches had already been automated and networked using Olivetti's IBIS
cashiering and counter-top applications, running on linked PCs.
The branches had to retain the ability to give instant decisions an
important element in a competitive market - 'we put the emphasis on a strong
service proposition, such as the Home Arranger,' says Mr Miller. 'At the
moment of truth, eyeball-to-eyeball with the customer, the person in the
branch has to have the ability to say yes, without referring things
elsewhere.'
Mr Miller's strategy was to build on the existing Olivetti workstations that
already provide all the familiar front-end facilities in the branches, with
IBM's DB/2 relational database in the background. It 'slid in' to replace
the former IDMS, so that end-users in the branches did not even realise
there had been a change, apart from having more facilities.
'The DB/2 database meant we could look at the customer and tell all the
products - mortgage, visa card, unit trusts, whatever - they were using.
First, it gives you cross-selling ability, secondly you can be more
responsive to individual customer needs.'
Information systems played no small part in the break-off in negotiations
with National &amp; Provincial a year ago: it would have been impossible to
integrate the two product lines and supporting systems.
Leeds takes pride in its robust attitude to IT as a servant, not a master.
This year it became the first UK building society to achieve full Iso 9000
accreditation. It has won the Alan Taylor Award for information systems
training, and won the British Computer Society Hay Award for excellence in
IT management.
One of Mr Miller's tasks has been to lower unit operating costs, and
concentrate on service satisfaction. A possible route forward is document
management - about to be piloted in one specific area.
'We're not just automating what's happening at present, but answering a
different question: 'Can we do it differently, and improve productivity by
an order of magnitude?',' he says.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (13): Wall Street leads the
way - Supercomputers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN SONSINO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine that an investment house managing funds wants to identify high,
medium and low-risk targets for its cash. Imagine, too, that it wants to
balance the funds between the three risk types and analyse the rates of
return, both planned and expected, from each type of risk. What are the IT
problems facing the investment house?
If the investment house operates in global financial markets, the varying
economic situations around the world would have a profound impact on the
ability of that investment house to say accurately what may or may not
happen to its clients' funds. Investing millions of pounds in equities or
bonds, and switching funds between currencies around the world, adds to the
complexity of the finance house's problems.
This investment house clearly has vast quantities of data to manipulate and
wants to perform complex financial calculations on these data. Where can it
turn for support?
Unusually, a few financiers are turning to supercomputers to manage their
data, and the supercomputer vendors are certainly eyeing the finance markets
with increasing interest.
A year ago, Merrill Lynch, one of the largest stockbroking firms in the US,
established a blueprint for the use of supercomputers in finance. It is
believed to have paid Dollars 1.75m for a Cray Research MP2E, a
twin-processor machine intended to give the firm greater power to handle its
trading activities. At the time, Mr John Galonte, a Merrill Lynch
vice-president, said simply: 'We want to improve the timeliness of some of
our calculations.'
Merrill Lynch is not the only broking firm to introduce supercomputers, says
Paul Clarke, brand manager for POWERParallel Systems at IBM in London. 'But
the leadership here is in the US, on Wall Street,' he says.
Some Wall Street users say the technology brings such significant
competitive advantage that they refuse to be identified, he claims -
'customers won't allow themselves to be referenced because of the
competitive advantage these machines bring them, but there are probably a
handful of users out there at present.'
Mr Clarke is brand manager for one of IBM's supercomputers, the SP2, a
machine he describes as a parallel, scalable computer. The end-user price
for the SP2 was about Pounds 500,000, but a stripped down, entry-level
version costs from Pounds 200,000-Pounds 250,000, he adds.
So far, there are no users of the SP2 in the UK - the machine was only
launched earlier this year, but financial users are at least beginning to
discuss supercomputing.
'We are in the process of setting up a meeting with UK banks,' says Mr
Clarke. 'Our scientists from the IBM Maths Centre in Paris will talk to our
customers to find out what they want. For example, customers are telling us
they're wasting millions in asset and liability management.'
Supercomputers can help, he suggests. So what are the advantages of these
high-performance machines, capable of processing vast amounts of data
extremely quickly?
In the last two to three years, IT managers in the finance world have been
seeing supercomputers used for maths-based services, in general engineering
applications, weather forecasting and so on. Now there appears to be a real
role for them in solving commercial problems. The range of problems they can
solve include financial analysis and planning; optimisation; risk analysis;
pattern spotting and portfolio analysis.
In essence, supercomputers can use a number of mathematical disciplines
simultaneously, making complex calculations such as simulations and
real-time trading analysis relatively straightforward for the finance house.
So will finance houses move away from current systems, mainly Unix-based
workstations, and adopt supercomputer technology over the next five years?
A recent survey by the research company, International Data Corporation,
attempted to discover just that. While it did not highlight an explicit move
towards supercomputers, it did reveal a surprise shift away from Unix-based
workstations in finance IT - 'we believe that Unix systems have been
oversold,' comments Alison McKenzie, research analyst and co-author of the
IDC report. 'They haven't lived up to expectations, according to survey
respondents, and they're more difficult to use than IT directors expected.'
In addition, they lack some of the functions of proprietary systems without
being as 'open' as desktop PCs in PC local area networks (Lans). And it is
in this area, desktop processing power and communications, that finance
managers will increase their investment substantially, says IDC.
In short, finance directors seem more interested in local computing power.
They ask: 'What can computing help us do for our customers?'
Customer service is 'a very important issue right now,' says Ms McKenzie.
However, she adds, more than a quarter are currently investing in mainframes
and supercomputers 'and 60 per cent of those will be increasing their
investment.'
Dr David Nunn at the University of Southampton points to the relative
ease-of-use of supercomputers in comparison with Unix machines.
'On paper, Unix workstations have the same power as traditional
supercomputers, but they're not as friendly,' he observes. 'Supercomputers
have better software and better documentation, on the whole. After 20 years
of working with supercomputers, I've a 'soft spot' for the Crays, even
though high-end Unix boxes often have the same number of megaflops.' (The
term, 'flops' stands for floating point operations per second).
But to some finance IT directors it will seem heavy handed to switch over to
supercomputers from their existing systems, which will remain Unix-based
workstations from vendors such as Sun or Silicon Graphics in the short-term.
Tony Jeffree, senior consultant in the Business Technology division at the
National Computing Centre, agrees.
'It depends what your definition of a supercomputer is,' he says. 'These
days, desktop Unix workstations can handle computing of the same scale of
the supercomputers from a few years ago. But I wouldn't put supercomputers
in the same breath as financial services.'
Perhaps where large database services are involved, supercomputing might be
useful, or for applications such as global financial modelling, but Mr
Jeffree says: 'My gut feeling is that supercomputer manufacturers will not
move heavily into financial services - perhaps at the esoteric end, but not
in the mainstream.'
To some users, top-end Unix-based workstations will be all they will ever
need.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (12): A vision of the future
 -Multimedia systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the excitement surrounding multimedia computing makes it hard to
ignore, many find it equally hard to see how it can be used by business
beyond applications such as training and presentation.
Early attempts to bring graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to personal
computers in the mid-1980s faced similar resistance. While the potential of
graphics was exploited quickly in computer games, it took several years for
GUIs to achieve credibility in business applications. Initially, senior
executives dismissed GUIs - and graphics in general - as a distraction and
worried about the effect the technology would have on worker productivity.
Ten years on, the idea of a PC without Microsoft's Windows or a comparable
GUI is unthinkable. Thus it seems likely that by 2004 a computer without
multimedia features will be as dated as the original IBM PC with its 'glass
typewriter' interface is now.
There is some way to go, however. A survey by Touche Ross earlier this year
showed that, in spite of much interest in multimedia technology, more than
two-thirds of UK companies had no plans to use it - mainly because of the
lack of useful applications at present.
Robert Baldock, a partner at Andersen Consulting, says that the finance
sector could take the lead in using multimedia technology - 'there are
changes evident in the way that retail financial services are structured
which will make multimedia important,' he suggests. 'People are using bank
branches less and less and a trend towards telephone banking is emerging.
Midland Bank, for example, set up First Direct because of this and others
have followed. Consumers are saying that they want convenience and faster
response to their needs. Multimedia technology offers a way forward.'
Mr Baldock is putting these thoughts into practice on a pilot project with
the Nationwide Building Society aimed at creating what he calls a 'virtual
bank.'
'The idea is to create an environment on the screen which allows customers
to browse through the banking services at their leisure,' he says. 'We have
done this by building a prototype 'kiosk' which recreates a real bank. The
opening screen is a picture of a bank in the High Street. You can 'walk' in
through the door and move around in a three-dimensional graphics environment
 -pointing at things and seeing how they react.'
Mr Baldock says to develop an element of fun in the virtual bank every item
on the screen reacts to the user. 'There is a pot plant in the lobby which,
when pointed at, will bloom. There is also an infra-red remote control to
activate videos on various banking services. If you go up to a counter, you
can activate a video-conferencing system which lets you speak directly to an
adviser and so on.'
The system is only at the concept stage but a production version is planned
and, ultimately, the virtual bank will be available across a network for
home use.
The convergence of multimedia and networking will serve as a stimulus to
both technologies. Recent advances in networking will soon make it possible
to offer a wide range of multimedia services in the home - and virtual
banking promises to be one of first.
Home banking is one of the leading applications of multimedia and networking
technology, according to Anne Perlman, vice-president of multimedia at US
computer manufacturer Tandem. 'We are finding our customers are moving
toward multimedia in financial services, although it is still early in the
cycle. The networking technology will let us take this into the home and the
multimedia technology will make it attractive to consumers,' she says.
But Ms Perlman notes that home banking alone is not unlikely to cause a
breakthrough. She sees it as part of a range of networked services - 'our
research shows that people like a range of services: video on demand,
video-conferencing, home shopping and, of course, home banking. It is when
all these are brought together that people start to get interested.'
Tandem is also looking at combining multimedia technology with existing data
processing technology - especially in the area of processing financial
transactions. Ms Perlman says that multimedia provides an ideal way to
present multi-dimensional information based on traditional data processing.
'We can see multimedia giving us ways to put lots of different variables
together on a screen and show things like company performance. If you wanted
to look at P/E ratios, risk exposure and stock variations over a period of
time, you need to present the data in three dimensions. Multimedia
technology lets you do this.'
Tandem has also looked closely at the system management problems associated
with the convergence of multimedia, networking and traditional data
processing. Transaction billing, mail order and royalty collection present
special difficulties, says Ms Perlman. 'There are so many different billing
and payment methods involved in multimedia networks and we have not, as yet,
been able to find suitable software to do this.'
Tandem is working with 32 of the world's top telecom companies on telephone
billing systems and expects significant growth in transaction billing as the
number of multimedia 'content' providers increases.
This is likely to change the way people buy and sell products. Mr Baldock of
Andersen Consulting sees the changes beginning to have an effect on banking:
electronic transactions as a percentage of the whole rose from 20 per cent
in 1985 to 37 per cent in 1992. He expects this to rise to 40 per cent by
the year 2000.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (10): Middle managers close
ranks - Document image processing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Middle managers in British financial services companies have for several
years successfully closed ranks against the large scale introduction of
document image processing.
The larger the institution, the more layers of middle management it has and
the less inclined it has been to embrace image processing on a large scale.
A large number of jobs are at stake.
Only in autonomous or green-field operations without such a bureaucratic
heritage have image systems been widely installed.
Most financial firms remain intensively paper-bound. The rise in their
office productivity in the past decade has been minimal compared to that of
the manufacturing sector and they still await their equivalent of the
just-in-time systems revolution.
Imaging has the potential to bring huge savings on storage space and to
simplify office routines drastically. So far that potential has not been
fulfilled.
But the middle managers may not be able to hold out much longer against this
type of automation. Systems suppliers are confident they will soon be able
to convince boards of directors that they cannot do without the new
technology.
Once critical mass has been gained, image processing could proliferate in
the same way as word processing did in the 1980s, affecting the prospects
for middle managers much as word processing did those of typists.
This threat has been staved off so far partly because middle managers have
claimed that it was impossible to do away with paper because paper gave them
the structure of their work. Without it people would not know what to do
next to process a claim on an insurance policy or authorise a loan.
This argument is being undermined by the progress of workflow systems, which
can take over the task of supervising the sequence of actions.
While no convincing cost-justification could be made for adopting image
processing from the early implementations which began in the mid-1980s,
David Allcock, marketing manager for Wang UK's workflow and imaging
division, insists there is now strong evidence that image processing can cut
costs and improve customer service and staff morale.
At Birmingham &amp; Midshires Building Society, for instance, the average time
taken to approve a mortgage application up to the point of an offer has been
cut by image processing and workflow systems from five weeks to three.
A study by the society revealed that out of the five weeks which the task
had been taking the actual processing of the application took only seven and
a half minutes; the rest was all waiting time.
The new systems have enabled inquiries to be carried out in parallel instead
of in sequence, according to the society's head of lending services Chris
Marney - 'a file can be in several people's in-trays at once. It's no longer
so easy for a file to go missing. And without a pile of paper on their desks
the staff feel a lot better about their work.'
At the TSB, a productivity improvement of about 20 per cent resulted from a
rationalisation of the processing of general insurance claims. This involved
the introduction of image processing and workflow systems. Fred Shaftoe,
TSB's director of customer service for general insurance, says the benefit
came mainly from bringing discipline into processes which were previously 'a
bit of a shambles.'
'When a customer calls you can answer the inquiry at once, instead of having
to get up and search for the file, which is impressive,' he says.
In some European countries bank statements are being issued to customers
incorporating miniature copies of their cheques. This service has not only
reduced the number of queries but proved popular and has spread from
Switzerland to Austria and Belgium. British banks have yet to approve its
use.
Another argument often used against investing in imaging was its high cost
in a proprietary mainframe environment. But as the prices of powerful
workstations and personal computers have fallen sharply, it now looks much
more attractive to downsize to client/server systems using these machines.
The cost of installing image systems is proportionately lower.
Images are stored on optical disks; a 5.25-inch disk can hold about 30,000
A4-sized pages and a jukebox of disks can hold 10m gigabytes of data.
Phillip Jones, an account manager for software supplier Filenet, estimates
that it is now possible to support four times as many users at a quarter of
the cost needed five years ago and to store four times as many documents.
Many applications involving documents in finance companies look ripe for
automation. Most of these companies already use scanning to capture a
customer's initial hand-written inquiry, but few of them follow this through
the entire system to gain the full advantage.
'The market leaders are beginning to make strategic integration of these
systems, but they are still the exception rather than the norm,' says Steve
Ball, a product marketing manager for Rank Xerox.
The systems usually come from several different vendors, so that such
integration demands the creation of a new set of standards. A central
standard is likely to be Postscript, the document reproduction system
developed by Adobe Systems, which recently merged with the desktop
publishing firm Aldus.
An important emerging standard is Den, the document enabling networking
standard which is backed by a group of systems vendors led by Xerox and the
network software company Novell.
Recently they have been joined by several other significant forces in the
industry, including a subsidiary of Eastman Kodak and the leading database
supplier Oracle.
The likely rapid spread of image processing systems may cause alarm among
the thousands of people in the supervisory tiers of finance companies.
But Mr Allcock of Wang UK argues that they can only avoid redundancy by
welcoming the technology and acquiring the new skills which will be in
demand, not by continuing to try to block its advance.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (8): Suppliers pool resources
 -Database software companies are standardising communications between
networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The global spread of computer networks and 'electronic money' is creating a
new form of commerce based on the electronic transaction. At the same time,
with the growing use of itemised telephone bills and networked services such
as CompuServe, the value of each transaction is diminishing and so cheaper
ways must be found to process such transactions.
'We are increasingly dealing with high volume, low value transactions,' says
John Spiers, UK marketing director of database software company Sybase. 'We
need to combine processing the growing volume of low value transactions with
new ways to manage and control them.'
Database suppliers such as Sybase have in recent years started to build the
mechanisms needed to process financial transactions into their database
software with the aim of reducing costs and increasing control.
'You need to be able to capture the value of the data which emanates from
transactions so you can exploit the information,' Mr Spiers says. 'A company
like American Express, for example, can gear its marketing to individual
purchases on a customer's monthly bill. If you hire a car or book a hotel
room, it can use this data to provide customers with information about these
activities.'
Pamela Pipe, a database product manager at software specialist Information
Builders, sees the hidden value of the information in financial transactions
as an opportunity for companies to gain a competitive edge - 'the number of
financial transactions is growing and this is driving people to find ways to
analyse their data to find the value in it.
'You need the operational performance to process the transactions. But you
also need the tools to bring out the information content - to pull out
trends, to focus marketing and inform decisions about products.'
Mrs Pipe also emphasises the need to draw together different data resources
 -possibly from different computer systems - to give a high-level view of a
company's information: 'We are working with large financial organisations -
banks and insurance companies - to look at the information spread around the
network on a variety of databases. They need to blend these together with
their legacy systems to get the real value from them,' she explains.
In spite of rivalries, database software companies are starting to
co-operate in order to bring different data resource together. Information
Builders is working with Oracle and IBM, among others, to create the concept
of the information warehouse.
This allows companies to treat their data as a single coherent database
which can be accessed by every employee. For example, databases can now
refer to each other using a language called SQL. Originated by IBM, SQL
standardises communications between databases and allows a variety of tools
to access data from the desktop.
SQL, by enabling the spread of databases across different computers, allows
companies to take advantage of cheaper hardware. Traditionally financial
transactions have been processed and stored on mainframe computers.
Increasingly, the same tasks can be carried out on cheaper PC-based
hardware. By combining many PC processors in what is called a parallel
processor, transactions can be processed and the results stored on much
cheaper hardware.
Neil Morgan, a marketing manager at Oracle UK, sees parallel processing as
the future of high volume transaction processing - 'with Oracle 7.1 we have
added parallel query and update processing and we are seeing an order of
magnitude improvement in response times and throughout. This means companies
will be able to afford to process these low value transactions.'
Oracle is also using the flexibility of more powerful PC hardware to lower
the cost of setting up new transaction-based systems. Mr Morgan cites the
example of a new credit card company. 'They needed to be able to set new
members up quickly so they have used a PC as the database server for the
customer database. The transactions are processed on a larger systems but
the basic set up for new members is carried out on a Pounds 20,000 PC system
which supports over 100 users 24 hours a day.'
This is possible because Oracle's database software works on different
computers, from PCs to mainframes. This is a trend echoed by other database
software suppliers including IBM. 'We can offer the same database technology
right across the range - including computers from other suppliers,' says
Janet Perna, director of database technology at IBM's Toronto laboratory.
IBM's DB2 has filtered down from its mainframe computers to its mid-range
and personal products, bringing the same features to each level. At the same
time, it lets customers access data from other suppliers' database software
including Oracle and Sybase.
Ms Perna says that customers want better access to their data - wherever it
might be. She says the trend towards client/server computing - which gives
users desktop power and access to company databases on the network - is a
part of this. 'The motivation for client/server computing is to give users a
better interface to their data and make new applications easier to use.'
However, this approach causes systems management problems. The need to bring
a variety of data resources together and make sure that they are used
properly makes the underlying software much more complex.
Database software suppliers are acutely aware of the problems of coping with
the explosive growth of electronic financial transactions and have a wide
range of solutions to offer. What is encouraging is that they are all moving
in the same direction and making it easier for customers to pick and choose
the tools they use to accessing and manage their data.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (11): Rapid delivery vital -
Software development
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The ability to build programs quickly has always been a goal for computer
software developers. Users always want their new applications immediately
and seldom understand why it takes so long to translate their requirements
into working code.
Over the past decade, fast delivery of new software has become more viable,
partly because hardware and software technologies have improved but also
because the techniques for building software are better understood.
Software construction can be viewed more as an exercise in engineering than
the arcane craft it once was. Applications can increasingly be assembled
quickly from pre-fabricated components rather than carved from solid blocks
of stone.
The competitive nature of financial services makes fast delivery of software
more important than in many sectors. So it is no surprise that banks and
insurance companies are pioneers in what has come to be called Rapid
Applications Development (Rad).
Early experiences of using Rad techniques show that companies can make new
applications work fast enough to gain an edge over their competitors.
David Sprott, marketing director of Texas Instruments' software division,
says: 'An investment company we are working with in the US succeeded in
putting in an advice system in 10 months instead of two years.'
The system had to provide a service, giving investment advice to the public
via a touch-tone telephone network - 'using our tools and Rad techniques, it
was able to build the system in phases and deliver it well ahead of the
expected schedule,' he says.
The Sumitomo Bank is another example. It used Rad techniques and development
tools from the software supplier Uniface to build a bond lending and
tracking application in eight months.
But Mr Sprott says that although tools are important, there is much more to
Rad than automating the production of programs - 'it's more important to see
it as a set of management processes. You need a method to allow you to put
software together that suits the business problem.'
He identifies user involvement, 'timeboxing' and what he calls iterative
development as being as important as the tools. Texas Instruments moved into
the Rad market from a strong base in computer-aided software engineering
(Case) where its Information Engineering Workbench (IEW) has long been a
respected software tool. Its experience in the Case market has shown that
tools must exist against a background of sound management and an
understanding of users problems - 'users must be heavily involved -
preferably full time  - so that they can influence the end-product and make
sure that it will do the job they want,' he says.
Timeboxing ensures that a software development project concentrates on the
business priorities and ensures that at least a part of the system is
delivered - 'normally, time is a variable in software development. But in
Rad you must make the elapsed time a fixed quantity and vary the scope and
resources to make sure you deliver something,' says Mr Sprott.
User involvement and timeboxing come together in Mr Sprott's iterative
approach to development. Each part of the application is built, tested and
approved by the user as the project progresses - 'if you use an iterative
approach, you are agreeing what you are building with the user all the time,
and parts of the systems become available early. Very often 50 per cent of
an application is not needed from day one. So you can deliver the important
parts and let users become familiar with them.'
This approach is echoed in the move towards object-oriented (O-O) systems
which emphasise the re-use of program code and component software - a
technique which Mr Sprott says will help users understand their applications
better.
'If you use the concept of business objects - such as an invoice or a sales
order - the user can see what is being delivered,' he says.
The O-O approach also supports the phased delivery of applications - indeed,
it changes the whole nature of what an application is. Mr Sprott sees the
definition of an application changing - 'instead of talking about
applications you can start talking about the scope of a system. You can use
existing infrastructures and code to build new applications. This obviously
speeds up development.'
Texas Instruments' view is endorsed by most software developers aiming to
produce software quickly. A recently formed industry body has published a
13-point plan for Rad. The Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)
consortium, formed in January 1994, includes British Airways, American
Express, Allied Domecq and J P Morgan Investment Management among its
corporate members as well as leading software developers Logica, Data
Sciences and Cognos.
The 13 principles advocated by the consortium expand those outlined by Mr
Sprott. They emphasise user involvement, a concentration on business
requirements and iterative development alongside practical advice such as
continuous testing, tight deadlines and close partnership between the
developer and the user organisations.
Rad is not seen as a panacea to the problems of building software quickly
but it promises to be another evolutionary step on the long road to
understanding the complex problems of translating user-needs into working
business applications.
When combined with O-O design and sound project management, it can produce
results quickly. And because Rad places greater emphasis on user involvement
than earlier software development methods, it also moves the priority away
from the technology towards the business problem.
Building software will always be difficult - but it is likely to be less so
as the Rad approach gains support.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (9): Worries over fraud -
Computer security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is an article of faith that hackers and fraudsters never even think of
attacking financial institutions. And were such an unlikely event to occur,
they could not possibly succeed in penetrating the physical and electronic
security that protects the cash and data assets of these respected bodies.
This is the diplomatic line that all banks adhere to, even as they invest
millions of pounds in security measures.
The truth is that banks are seriously concerned about the rise of ingenious
hackers and the growing awareness of computer fraud as a practical criminal
tactic.
Paul Rogers is marketing manager for self-service systems at AT&amp;T's UK
computer arm - the company supplies 70 per cent of the Automatic Teller
Machines (ATMs) in Britain.
Mr Rogers agrees that most attacks on ATMs are physical assaults aimed at
wrenching out the cash box, but that is no cause for complacency. 'Designing
ATMs is a case of trying to keep one step in front and making an effort to
prejudge what could possibly happen,' he says.
Mr Rogers is determined to pre-empt the resourceful hacker. He notes that
the latest generation of ATM is based around the industry standard OS/2
computer operating system. The core of this cash dispenser is no different
from office personal computers that have sold by the million.
This is a mark of the triumph of open systems and common standards, but it
throws up an unpleasant possibility - because there are many people out
there with an intimate understanding of the OS/2 platform. How can potential
hackers be discouraged from turning this knowledge against AT&amp;T's clients?
Mr Rogers' answer is to create a customised security shell around the
central chip and its software - 'we give the customer an open system, but we
protect that system from risk. Our Self Service System Software (S4) will
not allow a thief to breach an ATM and then lay another program on to the
system or download customer information that's stored on a remote host
computer.'
Fraud involving cash and credit cards remains a big problem, however.
Frank Hickman is a principal consultant with Unisys, the computer systems
company. He joined Unisys from consultants Touche Ross where he investigated
the practical applications of artificial intelligence (AI). Put simply, AI
is a field of technology that attempts to replicate the human brain through
computer programmes.
Despite many dubious claims by developers in the past, AI seems to have
thrown up a useful product in the form of neural networks.
'Neural technology means a program can be shown many examples of a process
and can then understand and discriminate within that data or process,'
explains Mr Hickman.
This search for a recognisable pattern has an instant attraction for banks.
The speed of credit card transactions makes spotting a stolen or counterfeit
card more difficult.
Some institutions such as the Royal Bank of Scotland claim success in the
battle against fraud by adding account holder photographs to bank cards. But
check-out staff under pressure might neglect to check a signature properly
so there is no guarantee that a photo will be any more likely to grab their
attention.
If a neural program can sit on the network and spot a break from the typical
spending pattern of one consumer, then fraud can be intercepted. This
solution means looking at the transaction itself - and that can only be done
using clever software. Mr Hickman characterises the problem as 'M25 fraud -
thieves zooming between superstores via the motorway system.'
While banks have to protect themselves from the fraud that springs from
common theft, they are also coming under increasing pressure to regulate the
kind of funds flowing into accounts. International initiatives against drug
trafficking and organised crime can have expensive consequences for
financial institutions.
The US Treasury now requires banks to ensure that a transaction is not
destined for an account that has been blocked on grounds of criminal
connections.
The Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control (Ofac) can impose a fine of
Dollars 10,000 - Dollars 500,000 for each example of non-compliance. So the
total fine for a series of infractions could run into millions of dollars. A
bank may only be one stop in a chain of destinations that culminates in a
bank account with a blacklisted country or individual. But if that bank is
'the first stop' the funds make in the US, then it is culpable.
When Ofac issued its blacklist of embargoed accounts, 18 months ago, the US
arm of the UK systems house Logica set about devising a solution for banks
that could not monitor every transaction manually.
Its response to the problem of inadvertent money-laundering is Hotscan,
launched in September. This is a Dollars 25,000 program that automatically
scans all payments and messages against a database of blocked accounts.
Hotscan resides on a personal computer but is linked to the bank's own
payments system. At the final stage of payments processing, Hotscan refers
each transaction to the blacklist database. If it spots a match, Hotscan
flags the transaction indicating that action is necessary.
According to Philip Izzo, senior vice president for international funds
transfer with Logica in Boston, Hotscan has already made its mark - 'the
Bank of Nova Scotia in New York is the first Hotscan site to go live,' he
says. 'In the first hour of operation, Hotscan caught out a payment going to
a bad guy]'
Mr Izzo reckons that Hotscan will soon be in action in Europe - 'we
developed it with an eye to the future: we hear that money-laundering is a
concern in the UK. US regulators have become more aggressive with the
banking community, and there are suggestions of more mandatory controls in
rest of the world.'

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (13): Expansion comes under
scrutiny - Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA CASASSUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle over how to accommodate more aircraft and passengers in the Paris
region appears to have been suspended until after next spring's presidential
and municipal elections.
Aeroport de Paris (ADP), the public operator for both Charles de Gaulle at
Orissy and Orly, had planned to build a third runway at Orissy by 1997 or
1998. But the question is now being scrutinised by a special commission that
is not due to present its conclusions until June next year.
The commission is also looking at the idea of building a third airport in
the capital area to relieve pressure on the two existing facilities which
have not reached saturation but could do so if air traffic continues to
increase.
One analyst said he expected the commission to come down in favour of both
schemes, as it would take about 20 years to complete the new airport.
Meanwhile, the ADP projects aircraft movements and passenger traffic to rise
by an annual average by 3 per cent over the next five to 10 years.
If the analyst is right, the government could have a number of schemes to
choose from. Four schemes have already been drawn up: two in the Amiens
region, one near Chartres and the other near Chalon-Sur-Sone, all of which
are far from the capital.
Of the two existing airports, Orly is the most congested. Runways are
operating almost at full capacity for three to four hours a day, compared to
one to two hours at Charles de Gaulle.
This is the reason transport minister Bernard Bosson cites for seeking a ban
on smaller carriers from peak travel hours on busy routes from Orly in
mid-1995. Initially the ban was to apply to only the Orly to London route
but it is now to be widened.
Protests from local politicians and residents held sway over the plans
before the commission was set up, and the government had agreed to shift
eastwards the location of the proposed third runway at Charles de Gaulle.
It also said it was giving up the original long-time 'hypothesis' of
increasing passenger traffic to 80m from the present 27m. The original plan
included the possibility of building five runways.
Mr Bosson said that the concerns of local residents were also behind the
decision to keep aircraft movement at Orly down to the current level of
about 200,000 a year instead of allowing them to increase to 330,000 an idea
that was first mooted by the ADP, chief spokesman Jacques Reder said.
Even so, work continues on the extension to terminal two at Charles de
Gaulle, with E wing due for completion in 1997.
This will follow the opening earlier this month of the high speed train and
urban RER train's so-called interchange module in the centre of terminal
two.
In addition FF250m will be spent at Orly over the next two years to enable
the west and south terminals to handle both international and national
traffic rather than specialising as they do at the moment.
This is intended to iron out the traffic peaks in both cases, Mr Reder
added.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (14): Belgium's dinosaur is put
to rest - Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Belgium's international airport in Brussels has long suffered the strain of
serving thousands of Eurocrats, business travellers, MEPs and their families
who have migrated to Europe's capital since the 1960s.
Built in 1958 for the World Expo in Brussels, it preceded the influx of
people working for European institutions and was created in order to serve
6.6m passengers per year. Last year, that limit was exceeded by 4m.
The crowded terminal, lengthy waits at passport control and old-fashioned
baggage carousels will next month become history.
Brussels Airport Terminal Company (BATC) has invested BFr20bn in a new
terminal which is due to open on December 11. The terminal will be big
enough to shift some 15m passengers per year, a limit it is rapidly expected
to meet.
The new concourse represents only phase one of a master plan for the
airport. Well served with runways - Zaventem has three - BATC says it hopes
to construct another concourse by the year 2,000.
The developments which are due to open next month are particularly important
for Belgium, a member of the Schengen free travel agreement which covers all
EU countries except the UK, Denmark and Ireland.
This will come into place some time in the new year and will allow the
Belgian authorities to separate easily Schengen passengers, who will not be
required to show their passports at the immigration counter, from passengers
from the rest of the world, who will.
With one of the highest percentages of business travellers in Europe, the
new concourse has been built with a special eye to their needs.
An unwritten goal for BATC is that at non-peak hours, it should only take
passengers 20 minutes from when they park their car, or alight from their
taxi, to when they board the plane.
The new concourse will also house a business centre, with meeting rooms and
offering secretarial services.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (12): Coping with the crowds -
The case for expansion in southern England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DONNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Months before the public inquiry into the proposed Terminal 5 at Heathrow,
London, pressure is building for further airport expansion in southern
England.
The inquiry, in May next year, will examine the case for Terminal 5 set out
by BAA which owns Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted in south-east England as
well as Southampton in the south-east and Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen in
Scotland.
The company says that by 2015 traffic at BAA's south-eastern airports will
have soared from more than 70m movements now to about 160m. If terminal
capacity does not increase, traffic will be lost to European competitors,
such as Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Paris.
BAA says it will self-finance the Pounds 900m Terminal 5. If work starts by
1997, the first phase will be completed by 2002, adding 15m passengers a
year; phase 2, expected to finish by 2013, will double this to 30m. The
extra space will raise Heathrow's capacity to 80m passengers a year; in the
12 months to this September it handled 50.3m.
BAA says that over the past 20 years, the number of passengers at Heathrow
has more than doubled, while the number of people affected by noise has been
reduced from 2m to fewer than 500,000 by the use of quieter aircraft.
When Terminal 5 is completed, BAA says this number will have fallen to about
300,000. The company encourages the use of quieter aircraft by offering
discounts on airport charges for them and penalties for noisier ones.
If approved, Terminal 5 would create 6,000 jobs - not including those in
construction work - and 8,000 existing jobs would be protected. Heathrow
generates 70,000 jobs, and the airport and the businesses it supports
contribute Pounds 3bn a year to the economy.
Airlines and other aviation businesses strongly favour Terminal 5. But
opposition is expected from residential and environmental lobbies around
Heathrow - despite the BAA's rejection of another runway and its promises
that everything would be done to lessen environmental problems.
Long before Terminal 5 is fully operational however, BAA and the airlines
will have begun to think hard about how to cope with further traffic growth.
New terminals are under consideration for Gatwick and Stansted and another
runway will be needed at one of the southern airports.
The runway debate is becoming contentious. BAA, believes that a new one is
not likely to be needed elsewhere in the south-east at least until 2010, a
view supported by a Department of Transport working group, Runway Capacity
to Serve the South East (Rucatse), which says 'benefits to passengers could
provide a case for a further runway at Heathrow or Gatwick by 2010 or, if
this were not provided, at Stansted by 2015'.
Rucatse says there is scope for making more use of existing airport capacity
in the south-east than had been assumed, and that greater use of regional
airports would also help to delay the need for expansion in London.
It identified possible sites for additional runways at the four main London
airports, and looked at the plan for an offshore airport near Sheerness
(Marinair). Rucatse was not asked to make any formal recommendations but its
report was intended to stimulate debate in UK commercial aviation.
The airlines believe that if traffic increases, another south-east runway
would be needed - by 2005 rather than 2010 - at either Heathrow or Gatwick,
to benefit from expanding inter-lining (connecting) traffic.
The British Air Transport Association (Bata), representing the airlines,
says that traffic growth has outstripped projections, and could reach the
160m level by 2010 rather than 2015. A study it commissioned from Alan
Stratford and Associates shows that London's capacity would be exhausted by
2012 (near the time that Terminal 5 would be working) and that by 2015 there
would be more than 22m passengers too many for London's airports.
'This clearly points to the need for new runway capacity to be provided in
the early years of the next century, even if Terminal 5 and expansions at
Luton and Stansted are sanctioned,' says Bata.
'If new (runway) capacity is to be provided, the Heathrow/Gatwick axis is
the most efficient location for it.'
Earlier this year the Chartered Institute of Transport, in its report 'New
Solution for Heathrow', also argued that Rucatse under-estimated the urgency
of the need for additional runway capacity at Heathrow, and did not
'adequately assess the broader economic issues and the vital contribution
which air services make to the prosperity of the economy'. Nor did Rucatse
fully acknowledge 'the advances in aeronautical technology which have
substantially reduced, and will continue to reduce, the adverse
environmental impacts of airline operations.'
The institute said more aircraft could use the airport if parallel runways
were built closer to the existing runways.
Meanwhile, other expansion schemes are emerging: an independent company has
proposed redevelopment of the airfield at Redhill near Gatwick, as a
'reliever' airport. BAA continues to spend large sums on its own airports.
Apart from Terminal 5, which will cost Pounds 100m even before the planning
inquiry starts, the company has earmarked Pounds 3.5bn for capital
expenditure at all its airports in the next 10 years.
The John Mowlem-owned London City Airport is steadily expanding, forecasting
up to 460,000 passengers in 1994, compared with 245,000 in 1993 and hoping
for 1m passengers a year by the end of the century.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (7): Challenges for Swift -
The big banks are looking carefully at the costs of message transaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK

<TEXT>
Swift, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication,
still dominates the field of interbank messaging but it faces growing
threats from other networks.
The Brussels-based company was set up in 1973 to automate the function then
undertaken by telexes. Owned by a consortium of about 2,200 banks, it
consolidated its position with the launch in 1990 of Swift II.
After numerous delays in delivery and considerable teething problems, Swift
II re-established the organisation as market leader and standard-setter. The
company's systems are used by around 4,300 financial institutions worldwide
to process around 500m messages a year.
Swift is now better positioned than it was to resist competition. The new
IFT (Interbank File Transfer) tariff is seen by customers as offering a more
attractive proposition for bulk transport than the older FIN service, which
was prohibitively expensive for some smaller banks.
Swift is also improving its service to customers in the trade finance sector
and developing new EDI (electronic data interchange) systems to help it
expand into trade services. It has extended its geographical coverage to
around 115 countries and is shortlisted for the contract to run the Bank of
England's Crest network for share settlement.
However, although these steps have helped to persuade most banks to continue
to use its services, others are looking for alternative lower-cost message
carriers. Faced with big competitive pressures of their own, the banks no
longer regard Swift as the only possible network service provider.
'This could prove a threat for the future, though it is not one at present,'
says Roger Hedges, product marketing manager for ACT's Midas, one of the
principal banking software systems. 'We are still connecting to Swift and we
are not being wooed by anyone else.
Swift's chief executive officer, Leonard Schrank, admits that the
organisation had not hitherto been run on a competitive basis - 'a civil
service mentality had crept in, but in the past two years we have
substantially transformed the company,' he says.
Prices have been cut by an average of 30 per cent. In June, Swift announced
a 70 per cent cut in the joining fee in an effort to speed up the
recruitment of firms in the fast-growing securities sector, as well as a 5
per cent rebate of the charge for FIN messages.
The challenge could, however, come from several directions. The banks
themselves may set up their own rival networks. A group has combined in a
venture called Ibos (the Interbank Online System), run by six European
banks.
Ibos, which was founded in 1991 by the Royal Bank of Scotland and Banco
Santander of Spain, competes directly with Swift in its core business of
international payments. The company's claim to offer a global service was
strengthened in January when the US computer systems company, EDS, a
subsidiary of General Motors which provides funds transfer services to
financial institutions worldwide, acquired an equity stake.
Ibos's managing director John Bertrand claims that its technology is 'the
next generation' to Swift's, with much greater reliability - 'our error rate
is zero,' he says.
Mr Bertrand says Ibos has letters of intent from eight banks wanting to join
the group, including four of the top 25 US banks. Ibos's objective is to
capture 10 per cent of the international payments market, with a customer
base of 500 banks, in six years, he says.
Another challenge to Swift could come from the national telephone companies,
either individually or as part of a group such as the Financial Network
Association (FNA). FNA began intra-bank operations early this year, with a
small number of banks participating. It has members in 14 countries and is
expected to add several more soon.
Another potential competitor is the UK-based company Scitor, set up in 1991
by Sita, the airline reservation system co-operative. It aims to meet demand
for value-added network services in certain industries outside its main
business, including finance.
Sita's structure and technology are similar to Swift's and it covers more
than 200 countries. However, Scitor's market development manager for
financial services Peter Wagner says that Scitor's services are
complementary to those of Swift rather than competitive.
'Swift has a narrower focus than we have,' he says. 'We are not trying to
take Swift's main interbank messaging business, but we are interested in the
branch-to-branch area and in offering cash management services.'
In this area Scitor is more likely to compete with EDI service providers
than with Swift.
Although Swift has broadened its user base to include brokers and fund
managers, it has not offered its services directly to multi-national
corporations for fear of upsetting its shareholders.
Shares in Swift are allocated by volume of message traffic. The top 35 banks
are said to generate half the traffic and are therefore in a strong position
to influence Swift's plans. Some big companies have lobbied Swift for access
to its network for a limited range of transactions, particularly
confirmations of payment.
Swift has yet to clarify its plans, but its chairman, Eric Chilton, has
recently acknowledged that a debate is going on within member-banks
worldwide on this issue. Most corporates do not want to become banks, he
believes. What they need is 'straight-through processing facilities' which
would minimise their costs and create standards, he said.
This is a key issue for Swift's management as it considers how best to
respond to any competitive threat. Swift cannot afford to delay a decision
too long. Some corporations, like the banks, are starting to look for
possible alternative solutions.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (6): Dealers become more
selective - The number of City dealing rooms is shrinking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
City dealing rooms are shrinking in size, according to the 1994 UK Dealing
Room Survey, which reports a drop of 4,365 dealing positions compared with
1990, a contraction of 14 per cent.
There are now also fewer dealing rooms overall - 1,533 compared with 1,712
in 1990. This contraction in the market, coupled with a more cautious
attitude towards expenditure, means that dealing-room suppliers are having
to work harder for their money.
The increasing use of standard hardware, such as personal computers and Unix
systems, has resulted, too, in suppliers not being able to differentiate
themselves by the computers they sell. Instead, they must try to stand out
by being better at fusing the many information products which dealers use
into an integrated system. This is a complex process because different news
and information feeds use different communications protocols, and display
data in different ways.
Important suppliers in the market for equipping dealing rooms include
Reuters (which owns Teknekron), Dow Jones Telerate, BT, Micrognosis, Capiti,
ACT Financial, and some of the world's largest computer companies. Janet
Wood, a spokesperson for Telerate believes that companies which have
expertise in communications technology (such as information providers like
Telerate and Reuters) have an advantage in this market, though BT's name
also appears on a lot of dealing-room bids.
Customers are more interested in the information they get on their screens
than on the technology they use to view it, says Ms Wood. This helps to
explain why Reuters - the leading information vendor in this market - is
also the dominant supplier of data management/dealing systems (with its
Triarch and Teknekron systems).
Nearly 200 Teknekron dealer positions, based on Unix workstations from Sun
Microsystems, were recently installed at Japanese company, Nomura's UK
subsidiary. Peter Green, Nomura UK's front-office systems director, says
they provide data from Reuters, Telerate and Knight-Ridder direct to the
desktop in a consolidated screen environment. Instead of the different
services appearing in separate windows on the screen, they look as though
they are all coming from the same place.
Nomura's new system also provides real-time spreadsheet capabilities. This
means that as data comes in from information feeds, it can automatically
update positions (for example the amount of a particular share/currency
held) recorded in an Applix RealTime spreadsheet (sold by US-based Applix).
Mr Green says: 'By the end of the year, we should have another 100 users on
the Teknekron system. We're moving away from a large host-based dealing
system, to true client-server computing where processing is distributed.'
The company plans to expand its dealing operations in a number of areas.
Nomura is investing more than Pounds 10m in its new dealing systems.
According to the dealing-room survey, financial institutions will invest
more than Pounds 1bn in new dealing room technology over the next 12 months.
In addition to capital expenditure, they will spend a further Pounds 1.7bn
in ongoing costs, including subscriptions to online information services and
telecommunications costs for dealing. Financial online services will account
for an average 65 per cent of this figure - costing about Pounds 40,000 per
dealer per year.
More than 75 per cent of UK financial institutions use a Reuters information
service, according to the same survey, with its nearest competitors being
Dow Jones/Telerate, Bloomberg and Knight-Ridder Financial.
But Stephen Kimsey, author of the survey, says: 'Although annual
dealing-room spending on information services will increase, companies are
cutting back on the number to which they subscribe. This now stands at
around three per dealing room, compared with an average of four in 1993.'
This is partly because companies are cutting back on 'me too' services, and
partly because some of the leading information providers have added value to
their services - making rival services less necessary.
Improvements include making services accessible through Windows-based
interfaces (such as those available from AT Financial Information), adding
more historical data, or providing information on extra markets (such as the
Japanese equity market). In addition, Reuters has introduced a business
television service and plans to transmit company annual general meetings
live to dealers' desks.
But even without TV on the desktop, dealers can still suffer from
information overload. They have so much information crammed on their screens
that they are starting to want higher and higher resolution screens, says
David Purcell of Microvitec, a leading supplier of specialist monitors for
dealing rooms - 'we are starting to see demand for CRT (cathode ray tube)
screens with a resolution of 800 dots across and 600 dots down and for
screens with diagonal screen width of 15in. or 17in. The problem is that the
bigger the monitors, the more space they take up on dealers' desks.'
One alternative is to use LCD (liquid crystal display) screens, such as
those used in portable computers. These are much flatter and give off less
heat. Sharp Electronics says its LCD screens will be used in a big dealing
room system, where instead of several overlapping windows of information
being displayed on a single screen, each window will be displayed on a
separate LCD screen.
Meanwhile, the systems used by settlement staff in the back office are also
changing - 'the back-office market is developing, with many people
downsizing from mid-range systems, such as IBM's AS/400,' says Mr Kimsey.
Most are planning to move to Unix or PC-based systems linked to the dealing
room system.
'There is a quiet revolution going on. For years, the City wasted a lot of
money on technology. Now people ask: 'Do we really need it?'. They are more
interested in functionality than technicality,' he says.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (10): Clear skies, at a cost -
Western Europe is gradually sorting out its air traffic control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DONNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A big improvement in the overall pattern of delays to air traffic throughout
western Europe has been seen over the past few years. However, much remains
to be done to ensure that the region can cope with the anticipated doubling
of passenger traffic in the next five to 10 years.
Forecasts that the cost to the European economy of air traffic delays would
rise to Dollars 10bn anually by the end of the decade if nothing was done,
have been revised downwards to Dollars 6bn. But at that level, continued
government attention is still needed throughout Europe, especially in air
traffic control, with the work that has been done barely keeping up with
increased demand.
In the UK alone, the National Air Traffic Services (Nats), operating under
the aegis of the Civil Aviation Authority, handles 1.5m aircraft movements
in controlled airspace annually, involving more than 100m passengers. In
addition, the ATC system has to cater for much traffic overflying the UK,
mainly between continental Europe and North America.
UK airports have experienced a sharp drop in the number of delayed
departures, despite an increase in aircraft movements, with delays at London
airports down from 28 minutes on average to eight minutes over the past
three years. This is largely due to the increase in ATC capacity resulting
from the introduction of the Central Control Function (CCF) at West Drayton,
near Heathrow, which helps to increase the volume of traffic handled.
To ensure its operations not only keep pace with traffic growth but also
move ahead of it NATS is investing in new facilities at the rate of Pounds
150m a year, compared with Pounds 20m a decade ago.
Privatisation of Nats, now under consideration, will be likely to make it
much easier for Nats to gain access to private capital markets to help
finance its expansion programme. Important elements in Nats' current
development programme include:
The new Pounds 350m en route air traffic control centre, under construction
at Swanwick, Hampshire, which enters operational service in late 1996,
enabling ATC capacity to be expanded in line with traffic growth;
Completion of the CCF project, to provide capacity in line with growing
demand in the London terminal area, by end-1995;
The Scottish radar replacement programme, including a new radar installation
north of Aberdeen for helicopter operations in the northern North Sea, and
the re-equipping of existing sites, one near Aberdeen and one at Lowther
Hill, by late 1995 and 1996 respectively; and
A proposed new Scottish and Oceanic air traffic control centre, adjacent to
the existing one at Prestwick, for completion by about 2000.
Much is also being done to upgrade existing infrastructures to increase
efficiency, cut costs and meet international commitments, especially to
Eurocontrol, the pan-European body based in Maastricht which is
master-minding the region-wide improvement of ATC called Eatchip - the
European ATC Harmonisation and Integration Programme.
Nats' own infrastructure improvements include:
A new ground-to-ground communications system comprising a core network of
digital links to meet both CAA and Nats requirements;
UK-wide replacement of radio-station control and monitoring equipment which
is becoming increasingly expensive to maintain; and
A new radar data transmission network to cope with increasing air traffic
volumes and to cater for the needs of the new en route centre.
On the wider European scene, Eurocontrol's Eatchip programme was created by
the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC, representing the governments
of more than 30 countries) in 1990.
Eatchip is aimed at creating a seamless Europe-wide ATC system to replace
the present motley collection of individual national systems, so that as far
as possible all European air traffic can flow smoothly.
The core of the problem is that overall air traffic in Europe is handled by
more than 50 control centres, using more than 30 different (and sometimes
incompatible) ATC systems, involving many different computer operating
systems and programming 'languages'. It is impossible start again, so the
task is one of updating, renewing, harmonising and integrating these myriad
systems.
Broad targets for Eatchip include:
Implementing a Central Flow Management Unit (CFMU) in Brussels by the end of
1995, supported by comprehensive radar usage throughout continental Europe;
En-route radar separation of five nautical miles between aircraft in
high-density traffic areas, and of 10 nautical sizes elsewhere by 1995;
The progressive integration of ATC systems, after harsonisation, in
high-density areas by 1995, and elsewhere not later than 1998; and
Introduction of operational 'Mode S' secondary-surveillance radar air/ground
data-links in high-density areas from 1998 onwards.
Last June, the ECAC transport ministers reaffirmed their unqualified support
for Eatchip at a meeting in Copenhagen, and undertook to make the necessary
investments in each country to achieve the required convergence of
individual national systems. The latter will involve the investment of more
than Ecu3bn (Pounds 2.33bn) over the next three years.
Eurocontrol is also preparing a 'Concept of the Flexible Use of Airspace',
to ensure that European airspace is available for all users by reducing or
eliminating areas currently reserved for military aviation.
Further ahead is the controversial issue of which all-weather landing-aid
system to adopt before the end of the century to replace the currently
widely-used Instrument Landing System which is under threat from increasing
use of commercial radio broadcasting signals. The alternatives are either to
adopt a Microwave Landing System or move to the US-developed satellite-based
Global Positioning System.
Opinions differ widely throughout world aviation on the best system to
adopt. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has called a
conference for next March, with the aim of settling the matter.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (11): Schiphol has grand plans
under way - Amsterdam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport is in the middle of an ambitious, multi-billion
guilder expansion drive that will allow it to handle 40m passengers a year
by the year 2015. This is a near doubling compared with the 21.3m passengers
who used the airport in 1993.
The airport also hopes to build a new, fifth runway around the turn of the
century. Opponents of Schiphol's goal of becoming one of the Europe's
'mainport' for air traffic are focusing their attention on trying to delay
the runway's construction.
A milestone in the expansion programme was reached in May 1993 when
Schiphol's terminal extension was opened in May 1993, boosting potential
capacity to 27m passengers a year from 19m previously.
The extension, used primarily as a base for intercontinental flights, was
designed so that Schiphol could retain its 'one-terminal' structure, making
transfers easier for passengers.
Schiphol is aiming to keep its future expansion within this one central
terminal, although satellite terminals may be necessary in the 21st century.
Transfer passengers, particularly those from regional airports in the UK,
are crucial to Schiphol. In 1993, 43.4 per cent of all passengers arriving
on scheduled flights were stopping over to catch a connecting service.
In August, Schiphol opened a new pier dedicated to regional airlines, as
part of its strategy of strengthening its position as a European aviation
hub.
Like other airports, Schiphol has a wide range of facilities for business
travellers, including office space, lounges and meeting rooms.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (9): Keeping a good record - The
industry is environmentally conscious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DONNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of accusations of noise pollution and aircraft emissions, most
airports are extremely environmentally-conscious. Airport managements,
especially in Europe, are not only aware that they can be penalised if they
transgress the regulations, but they are also just as concerned as local
populations with the well-being of the areas in which they themselves live
and work.
Many existing activities, especially in Europe and North America, are
already constrained by governmental regulatory requirements. These include
night curfews with severe restrictions on jet aircraft movements, as well as
the obligatory use of specified flight paths into and out of airports - to
minimise noise in built-up areas - take-off and landing 'noise abatement'
procedures, and strict operational procedures to minimise noise created by
aircraft on the ground.
The likelihood is that such environmental constraints will become even more
severe. The Airports Council International, representing the owners and
operators of almost 1,000 airports worldwide, believes that as environmental
regulations become increasingly important, the air transport industry,
because of its visibility and its continuing image as an elite mode of
transport, 'runs the risk of being singled out for special treatment in this
respect'. ACI believes airport owners must be ready for this.
But much progress has been made. Over the past 30 years, the noise of jet
engines has been progressively reduced through technology advances, while
legislation requiring the phasing out of older, noisier and dirtier aircraft
in favour of cleaner and quieter modern types has, together with improved
operational practices, transformed aircraft fleets.
The result is that airports today are much quieter places than they were, in
spite of considerable increases in air traffic. This process is continuing.
A meeting in December 1995 of the International Civil Aviation Organisation
 -which is responsible for establishing environmental standards for the
world air transport industry through its Committee on Aviation Environmental
Protection (CAEP) - is expected to recommend further tough standards on
aircraft noise and engine emissions, especially in the light of anticipated
big increases in air traffic.
The ACI and the International Air Transport Association (Iata, representing
over 220 airlines), are working through an Environmental Co-ordination Group
to develop 'joint positions' for that meeting. They are anxious to ensure
that any measures benefit the environment without involving unnecessary
costs to airports and airlines.
One possible measure is a further tightening of the rules on the
acceptability of aircraft in terms of noise and pollutant emissions. Many
airlines believe this could mean even earlier disposal than is necessary of
aircraft with many years of profitable service remaining.
Substantial research is being conducted by the aviation industry, including
airlines, airports and aircraft and engine manufacturers, to determine just
what environmental protection measures can be introduced without putting
brakes on the smooth growth of world air transport.
But the environmental record of most airports in Europe is generally good.
BAA in the UK, for example, has introduced extensive landscaping round its
airports and erected sound barriers to help shield local communities from
ground level noise. It has also helped house owners to reduce noise nuisance
by providing sound insulation grants.
BAA also publishes a detailed annual environment report, setting out its
activities, its targets and achievements. British Airways, the biggest user
of UK airports, does the same.
Throughout Europe, it is now impossible for any airport to undertake a major
expansion programme without first having to satisfy local authorities, as
well as regional and central governments, of its environmental
acceptability.
Winning acceptance for new developments can take a long time. In the UK, it
can take as much as 10 years from conception to in-service operation for
either a new terminal or runway.
In some places it can take longer. It took about 30 years to get Munich's
new airport up and running, although part of those delays were due to
financial problems.
BAA has a well-established track record in assessing the environmental
impact of ventures such as new terminals. Before submitting proposals for
such developments, it prepares comprehensive environmental assessments of
the project.
In the case of the proposed Terminal 5 at Heathrow, an environmental
statement was submitted with the application for planning permission in
February, 1993. BAA has also made meticulous preparations for the
forthcoming public planning inquiry into Terminal 5, which starts on May 16
next year and could take more than a year to complete.
Such inquiries are the best means of ensuring that everyone involved, from
the airport managements through to local residents and workers, can have a
voice in what is planned. No-one has yet devised a better way of ensuring
that environmental - and social - justice is done.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (5): Now the 'electronic
purse' - Payment systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a range of transactions other than those involving relatively small
amounts of money, electronic payment is now the norm. Consumers take it for
granted that they can pay for goods with plastic cards, while retailers know
they in turn will get their money through electronic funds transfer at the
point of sale (Eftpos), when customers' cards are swiped through
authorisation terminals.
But developments are now taking place also at the lower end of the scale,
which will make it possible for a new type of plastic cards to be used to
pay for small-ticket items such as parking, newspapers and soft drinks. This
area is known as the electronic purse.
'Plastic is accepted by consumers and retailers,' says Ken Hansen, managing
director of Verifone (UK), a leading supplier of the terminals used to
authorise credit and debit card transactions. 'Even the newer plastic debit
cards, which take money directly out of a customer's account have taken off.
In the UK, debit card transactions have just surpassed credit card
transactions.'
Individuals carry much less cash than they used to, but banks would like
them to carry even less, because it is expensive to handle. It has to be
counted and hole-in-the-wall automatic teller machines (ATMs) have to be
kept stocked up. More importantly, cash does not earn interest when it is in
the consumer's wallet. The latest cards, which a number of organisations are
experimenting with, contain electronic money or units of value. These work
rather like phone cards and can be of two kinds. They can either be
throw-away cards (such as phone cards) or they can be smart cards, which can
be reloaded with units when they run out.
Smart cards look like credit cards but have a computer chip built-in. This
enables them to store more information than a simple magnetic-stripe card.
Many banks favour smart-card technology because the cards have more memory
and intelligence and can be given a multi-purpose function. They are also
more secure because it is harder to duplicate the information on a
smart-card chip than a relatively simple magnetic stripe.
Examples of electronic purse initiatives include the Danish DanMont card,
which can be used to buy low-cost items; while in Singapore a combined
credit, debit, loyalty and electronic purse card has been jointly produced
by a bank and a retailer.
Shell's loyalty scheme is similar to a electronic purse. Customers who buy
petrol from Shell service stations get points added to a plastic card and
these can be exchanged later for goods.
In the UK, Mondex - a NatWest Bank cashless card, the British rights to
which are shared with BT and the Midland Bank - is to be tested in shops in
Swindon next year. NatWest wants Mondex to be used globally and has
franchised it to the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation for use in
several Asian countries.
As yet, there are no standards for the cards, for electronic-purse
authorisation terminals, or for machines to reload them with units. However,
a number of credit-card organisations around the world, such as Visa,
Mastercard, and Europay are working with other companies to set standards
for worldwide electronic-purse identification numbers (the kind of system
that enables Visa cards to be recognised abroad), the location of the
computer chips on each card and other important details.
One of the companies involved in standard-setting is VeriGem, a company set
up jointly by US-based Verifone and French smart-card supplier, GemPlus. Mr
Hansen says: 'A year ago we saw the way things were going with rising
interest in electronic purse cards and falling prices of Eftpos terminals
and telecoms links. The 'electronic purse' could be the biggest part of the
payment market because all the low-value cash transactions added together
are worth more than the large transactions.'
He says many banks are experimenting with chip cards - and some have
products which will be very close to the likely eventual standard. He
expects a full standard to be agreed next year. Jack Large, of UK-based
payment-card consultancy J&amp;W Associates, believes electronic purse
technology will start to pay off when it is brought together with
account-based debit cards such as the UK's Switch and Visa Delta - 'from one
card you will get cash withdrawal, payment at the point-of-sale, and an
electronic purse.'
There are, however, a number of commercial issues to be resolved. Lars
Mieritz, an analyst at the Gartner Group Europe, says: 'We won't achieve a
'moneyless' society until financial institutions provide an incentive to
consumers to replace cash.'
With electronic purse cards, one advantage to the consumer might be
convenience - 'going to the ATM is a grudge transaction,' says Mr Hansen.
Yet, electronic money will only be more convenient for the customer if
refilling an electronic purse is easier than going to the cash machine.
Retailers are starting to make far more use of the data they gain about
customer purchases from electronic payment systems. They are taking
advantage of powerful computers (based on massively parallel processing) to
analyse customers' spending and look for new patterns.

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (4): Pushing back to
profitability - Finance industry attitudes are changing fast, says Nick
Temple of IBM
</HEADLINE>

Nick Temple's translation earlier this year from chief executive of
International Business Machine's UK subsidiary to general manager with
responsibility for the company's business with the European financial
community is indicative of the changes reshaping the world's largest
computer company.
Mr Temple, 46, has been largely credited with pushing through measures which
have put the UK operation back on the path to profitability after two years
of heavy losses. Now he has returned to the business sector - the finance
industry - where he built his reputation in the 1980s as a tough,
no-nonsense manager with an acute understanding of the industry's direction.
It is an area of critical importance to IBM. Europe is its largest market
and the financial institutions among its largest customers.
The sector is in a state of profound change, he says - 'it would be wrong to
say the finance industry is coming out of recession, but its attitude is
starting to change very significantly. Priorities are fundamentally
different from only a year ago.
'Last year, heads of financial institutions were concerned about the
management of change, controlling costs and finding ways to get the maximum
benefits from their investment in information technology. Today, while the
management of change is high on the list, the real concern is how to
mobilise new technology to combat competition. Competition is starting to
become a real threat.'
The IBM mainframe computer remains the workhorse of finance industry data
processing, but the computer giant can no longer dictate its customers'
computing strategy as it did in the past.
Mr Temple prefers to talk about collaboration, partnerships and teamwork.
Some of his ideas are focused on the technological horizons: 'We are
planning to form partnerships with some of our customers to develop radical
thoughts about ways of working in the future.'
The 'information superhighway,' the convergence of computing and telecoms to
provide interactive multimedia services to the office and the home, looms
large in his thoughts. 'Suppose you were setting up an electronic bank from
scratch and you were defining an agent (a piece of software that you could
instruct to carry out your banking for you) on the information superhighway,
what would it be, how would it look and how would you go about doing it?
'This would be quite different from conventional ideas of home banking which
are simply extensions of what goes on in the bank branch.' He believes that
to make home banking attractive for customers who may be intimidated by
technology it will be necessary to combine it with other services - say,
home shopping.
Developments of this kind will have their own consequences. Conventional
retailers will have to work harder to make shopping a pleasure - or their
customers will use the superhighway in preference to physical shops.
Most of Mr Temple's attention, however, is directed towards more immediate
issues. He is a powerful advocate of improvements in risk management,
pointing out that the speed at which financial transactions are carried out
and transmitted over networks could and has led to fraud and disaster - 'if
it's not applied in the right way, the technology becomes a liability and
not an enabler.'
And he is concerned about the delays which most financial institutions face
in creating software to meet new business needs - 'data processing
departments in financial institutions have become unresponsive to business
needs. They seem less attached to the business imperatives. What we have to
do is construct building blocks, using object-oriented technology, from
which we can assemble solutions quickly.'
Object-orientation, a new fashion in software development, involves the
construction of storable, re-usable software modules. An obvious idea,
perhaps, but one whose time has come.
Mr Temple says IBM is now moving staff to work with customers on the
development of the building blocks. A key element is the establishment of a
design standard (architecture) for applications in the financial services
area which will mean that different applications will work comfortably
together - 'Financial Applications Architecture is a data and process
architecture. We have committed ourselves to developing applications using
this architecture, but we are also providing bridges into other environments
so it has to be fairly open.'
A number of software development centres are being established in
conjunction with large customers to ensure a good fit between the
applications under development.
Since taking over his new job in May, Mr Temple has been busy establishing
the principles of how the new IBM will operate internationally. The essence
of the plan is to be able to operate globally and seamlessly - 'if an
Italian customer wants something done in Australia, we will be able to do it
without cutting across national sensitivities,' he says.
The idea is to get rid of the stultifying layers of bureaucracy which have
contributed to IBM's corporate sluggishness in recent years.
While in the past three years Mr Temple has been chiefly concerned with
curing IBM's structural faults, he has some telling criticisms of the way
his customers do business.
'I think many of the big financial institutions are concerned about a lack
of connection with their customers. Not the big corporate bankers - they
have often excellent relationships with large clients. But retail banks have
poor relationships with their customers and, as a result, customer
satisfaction is poor.'
He believes that banks, in spite of years of investment in technology, have
not created effective customer information systems.
'If you walk into your bank as a gold star customer and you are asked to
fill in a form, then something is wrong,' he suggests.
'Retail banks have a poor understanding of which parts of the business make
money and which do not. If they don't understand the profitability of each
transaction, how are they going to manage customer loyalty?'

FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (2): Keeping customers happy
 -New approaches to retail banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY

<TEXT>
Ten years ago, Ken Pilbeam was head of marketing at Compucard, a project to
promote telephone shopping. It was an era of unbridled optimism - and Mr
Pilbeam shared the common dream of technology sweeping through the retail
sector to revolutionise the most mundane purchases.
Today, he is head of operational systems management at Barclays Bank, and
despite commanding a formidable arsenal of technology, Mr Pilbeam is no
longer an IT visionary - 'with the remote shopping idea in the '80s, we
encountered significant consumer resistance. We didn't realise that social
interaction is important, that people want to get out and about when they
shop.'
This has proved a useful lesson for Mr Pilbeam: under the Pounds 100m
Customer System Project, 1,100 Barclays branches have joined a new approach
to the retail customer. A central database has been constructed to hold 14m
customer records. The big idea is to pull together previously separate
processes, such as current account versus deposit, and replace them with one
flow of data relating to each individual.
The Customer System is aimed at eliminating the delays that characterise
opening a new account. Rather than take forms from a customer, then process
the risk involved and get back to the customer after an extensive credit
check, Barclays wants to be in a position to approve and issue an account
number on the spot.
A central index held on an IBM 3090 mainframe at the bank's Gloucester data
centre is accessed via smaller IBM RS 6000 processors at each branch. The
central index integrates data from customer accounts at branch level,
Barclaycard and the bank's financial services operation. This goldmine of
information is also a mountain of data to store. The database alone holds
the equivalent of 72m sides of A4 paper.
Although the end-product should make itself felt at branch level, Barclays'
has had to take a strategic view of the IT requirement that powers the
Customer System. Huge quantities of data are best handled by a combination
of mainframe computer and dedicated storage capacity. The Gloucester data
centre, run under the aegis of Barclays' IT arm, Barclays Computer
Operations (BCO), has installed extra storage capacity.
US data storage specialist EMC supplied a Symmetrix 5500 system.
Essentially, a sophisticated series of interlinked hard disks similar to
those found in an office PC, the Symmetrix provides an electronic filing
cabinet that holds data for the IBM mainframe.
This box cost Pounds 750,000 including maintenance over a five-year period.
It is not wholly dedicated to the Customer System, but with a storage
capacity equivalent to 10,000 desktop PCs, the EMC 5500 illustrates the kind
of technology that is necessary to keep a huge retail project
up-and-running.
If this impressive investment is to pay off, the retail customer must sense
the bank is offering a reliable service. Sudden interruptions to normal
service attributed to the catch-all excuse 'the computer is down' are fatal
to customer relations in a competitive high-street market.
Keith Durham, a customer account executive at Barclays' Cheshire computer
centre, has studied the options for Business Resumption Planning Procedure
(BRPP). In the event of a big systems failure at Gloucester, the operation
could be run off another mainframe site within a couple of hours.
This is the dramatic end of BRPP. What it really boils down to is having
paper forms under the counter to cope with any collapse in the branch server
 -'we don't want our staff to have to twiddle their thumbs while customers
wait for a service. You've got to have procedures in place to handle any
type of failure,' says Mr Durham.
Telephone banking services such as Midland Bank's First Direct or TSB's
Teleservice are being touted as the obvious direction for retail banking.
Multimedia branches offering an array of automated terminals that stretch
existing Automated Teller Machine (ATM) technology into the world of
interactive video and live links to financial advisers are under review by
most large banks.
The Nationwide Building Society has been running a pilot remote banking
installation in Aylesbury, using technology from Siemens-Nixdorf, for the
last year.
In Italy, a large number of institutions compete in the retail banking
sector. So national branch networks are not as extensive as in the UK where
the historic competition has been between four operators. Italian banks have
been swift to install automated branches designed by Olivetti as a
comparatively cheap means of rapid expansion.
The impetus behind these developments is cost. A presence on every high
street is expensive in terms of real estate and staff salaries. One of the
Italian automated branches will cost around Dollars 1m to build and equip.
Reliability is a key component of retail banking. Pilbeam expresses
reservations about automated branches running intelligent multimedia
terminals - 'the technology is still not perfect. Even if the failure rate
is only one per cent, that can put people off. There will be resistance
until it becomes the norm.'
Barclays appears to be steering clear of the herd instinct in retail
banking. By putting appropriate data at the disposal of branch staff, it is
gambling that the customer still wants a human face behind the counter.
Relegating the computer terminal to a vital supporting role may prove to be
a crowd-puller.
