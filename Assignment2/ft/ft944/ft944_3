BUSINESS
Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, whose seven-month-old government
was toppled after a revolt by his Northern League coalition partner,
resigned rather than face defeat in a no-confidence drive in parliament.
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro is left with the delicate decision of finding
a new government or dissolving parliament.
The Home Office has asked the Court of Appeal to review the convictions of
the four original Guinness trial defendants because of allegations that
material evidence was withheld from the defence.
Britain's current account balance of payments moved into surplus for the
first time in 7 1/2 years in the third quarter.
John Major said that he would make peace with the Conservative party's
rebels over Europe only on his own terms.
The UK's 6m part-time workers are to have most of the statutory employment
rights of those in full-time jobs, the government announced. The decision
represents a climbdown for the government which two weeks ago vetoed a draft
European Union directive on part-time workers.
The Halifax Building Society plans to cut buildings insurance premiums by an
average of 20 per cent from January 1.
London Life Association, part of London Life Group, has been fined Pounds
50,000 by Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry,
for rule breaches that left client money at risk.
Serious breaches of regulatory rules emerged in the announcement of fines
imposed by Lautro, the life insurance watchdog, on two friendly societies -
Homeowners and Ideal Benefit.
Cruise operator Cunard blamed sub-contractors for delays in completing a
Pounds 30m refit of the liner Queen Elizabeth 2, which resulted in 500
passengers being turned away from its Christmas cruise. Cunard said
passengers unable to travel on this cruise could take two others next year -
should they want to.
The government will receive nearly Pounds 960m from the sale of British
Coal's mining assets. This emerged as details were announced of the sale of
the south Wales region for Pounds 94.5m.
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, decided not to refer the
proposed acquisition by the Halifax Building Society of Leeds Permanent
Building Society to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
US investors have provided the bulk of new capital committed to Lloyd's of
London for next year, partly filling the hole left by exiting Names -
individuals whose assets traditionally have supported the insurance market.
COMPANIES
The first contested take-over bid in the UK utility sector got under way as
Northern Electric, the regional power company for the north-east of England,
rejected a Pounds 1.2bn offer from Trafalgar House.
Trafalgar House decided to offer a Pounds 20 rebate to each of Northern
Electric's 1.3m customers. This, it claimed, was at the prompting of the
electricity industry regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild. Labour
questioned whether Littlechild had shown 'proper conduct' in asking
Trafalgar representatives what customers would gain from the bid.
Shares in troubled UK developer Stanhope Properties were suspended after the
breakdown of negotiations with banks owed Pounds 140m.
Unilever's problems with its revolutionary new detergents appeared to have
disrupted the orderly succession to the group's top job. The company
announced a postponement of previously announced boardroom changes amid
mounting evidence that Persil Power and Omo Power, the detergents launched
this spring, have failed to meet their targets.
UK bioscience company Zeneca is to pay up to Dollars 485m (Pounds 310m) for
Salick Healthcare, a Los Angeles-based operator of specialist cancer
centres.
Mercury Communications, the UK's second largest public telecommunications
operator, cut international call charges for its largest users in reaction
to intensifying competition.
SG Warburg has beaten other investment banks, including Morgan Stanley, the
bank with which it planned to merge until last week, in the competition to
advise the government on the privatisation of Railtrack.
A Pounds 1.5bn offer to buy the St Martins Property group, the leading
property business owned by the Kuwaiti government, has been made by Barings,
the London merchant bank, on behalf of an investment consortium.
Mars, the privately owned US confectionery and pet foods group, has launched
a review of the bulk of its Dollars 1bn (Pounds 640m) world-wide
advertising, in response to Maurice Saatchi's removal from the board of
advertising group Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.
Intel, the world's biggest computer chip-maker, offered to replace free of
charge the flawed Pentium microprocessors that are the 'brains' of millions
of high performance personal computers.
Shares in East Midlands Electricity rose by 5 per cent after the group
announced substantially better than expected interim results and a
surprisingly large dividend increase.
Peter Ward is to quit as chief executive of Rolls-Royce Motors, which has
signed a collaboration agreement with BMW of Germany. The move is believed
to reflect a disagreement with the parent Vickers board on the future of the
luxury car builder.
Robert Montague finally conceded defeat in his attempt to stave off
bankruptcy, resigning as chief executive of Tiphook, the trailer rental
company he founded 16 years ago.
UK security printer De La Rue's Pounds 682m offer for Portals was accepted
by the specialist paper-maker's board.
Shareholders in British Assets Trust have approved a capital re-organisation
but raised questions about the trust's relationship with Ivory &amp; Sime, its
fund manager.
Private investors have taken up fewer than a sixth of the shares available
to them in RJB Mining's sale of shares to fund the purchase of British
Coal's English regions.
MARKETS
Mexico's stock market fell heavily and short-term interest rates rose
sharply following Tuesday's 15 per cent devaluation of the peso, pulling
down other Latin American markets. The currency was driven to new lows and
the Mexican government was forced to float the peso - abandoning its fiscal
policy of keeping the currency in a specified target zone.
Sales of uncut diamonds remain near record levels, but the market is still
in turmoil and cutters continue to complain about lack of profitability.
The US stock market attempted a tentative year-end rally as the Dow Jones
broke through the 3,800 mark on Wednesday for the first time since November
18.
The present bull market in base metals probably will end in the third
quarter of 1995, according to analysts at the Merrill Lynch financial
services group.
The world's two major nutmeg producers, Indonesia and Grenada, have
suspended negotiations on a new joint marketing agreement amid concerns
about the involvement of a European marketing company. They will resume
their discussions in March.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Short-term pain, long-term gain - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bungled devaluation in Mexico is a salutary reminder that emerging stock
markets are intrinsically risky. What makes the lesson particularly hurtful
for Western investors is that Mexico has been regarded widely as relatively
stable.
This - and the fact that US investors find Mexico comfortingly familiar -
helped make it a major beneficiary of the recent flood of western money into
the stock markets of the developing economies of south-east Asia and South
America.
When the emerging markets' bubble was pricked by the rise in US interest
rates in February, all markets suffered, although the pain was not spread
equally. The recovery has been equally patchy. But, generally, Latin
American markets have tended to do better than the Asian ones which led the
charge in 1993.
Few British investors are likely to have a large proportion of their total
investment portfolios in Mexico. But even a broadly-spread emerging markets
trust has done well to make much headway this year: a sharp contrast with
the glory days of 1993.
Do not despair. The argument that investors from mature western economies
should have a stake in more dynamic economies remains compelling. But it is
a long-term strategy. If you cannot bear the short-term upsets, do not look.
*****
Super-active investors hate holidays. Deprived of their second by second fix
of stock market information, they loiter palely until the markets re-open.
Do not let them make you feel guilty. Over-activity is one of the curses of
the investing classes. Warren Buffett, the well-known American investor,
points out that high turnover is better for brokers than for investors,
adding: 'Investors should understand that what is good for the croupier is
not good for the customer. A hyperactive stock market is the pick-pocket of
enterprise.'
Buffett gives a simplified example of a company which earns 12 per cent a
year. He then assumes that the whole of the capital changes hands once each
year, and that there is a 1 per cent commission levy on both buyers and
sellers. So, in aggregate, the owners pay 2 per cent a year for the
privilege of buying and selling the shares to each other.
In other words, investors' excessive activity is subjecting their earnings
to a voluntary annual tax of 16 2/3 per cent - and that is just the cost of
buying and selling the shares. If you employ a financial adviser to tell you
when to buy and sell, your total additional 'tax' will be even higher. Or,
as Buffett puts it: 'Investors' penchant for financial flip-flopping also
lands them with investment management charges for chair-changing advice.'
Of course, if all your flip-flops are profitable ones, you can afford the
costs. But it is a hefty 'if'.
Most successful investors think hard before they make an investment decision
and expect to stick with it for a long time. Personal investors who put
money directly into shares and make their own decisions can imitate the
masters. But, increasingly, the system is loaded against personal investors
who rely on professional advisers.
Say you ask a commission-based financial adviser to handle your unit trust
portfolio. You are likely to pay an initial charge of between 3 per cent and
6 per cent (to cover the 3 per cent agent's commission) and 1.5 per cent a
year afterwards (of which half a per cent goes to the agent).
This does not sound extortionate - but it could eat up a third of your
investment over the next 20 years. And it takes no account of the 'tax'
imposed on the funds already by the costs of buying and selling the actual
shares.
Perhaps it is time to remember another Buffett suggestion. 'By periodically
investing in an index fund, the know-nothing investor can actually
out-perform most investment professionals. Paradoxically, when 'dumb' money
acknowledges its limitations, it ceases to be dumb.'
*****
Only 19 new names have signed up to join the Lloyd's insurance market next
year; 2,652 are pulling out. For contrarians, this could signal that now is
the time to take a plunge. On second thoughts, given that it's Lloyd's, keep
the padlock on your wallet.
*****
'The salary of the chief executive of the large corporation is not a market
award for achievement. It is frequently in the nature of a warm personal
gesture by the individual to himself.'
This quote from JK Galbraith comes from Matthew Parris's anthology Scorn.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Gardening: The Internet enters life at the Old Rectory -
Robin Lane Fox checks up on the Sloane Wallys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The wallflowers are already flowering in the herbaceous borders and there
are dozens of buds on the Pink Perpetue rose up the main front of the house.
Can it really be another Christmas in the Sussex Old Rectory to which Julian
committed Veronica Sloane Wally from their home in London's Onslow Gardens
eight years ago?
For those coming up the drive, it could be nothing else, thanks to
Veronica's recent whiting and lighting. An old Sloane friend, Annabel,
taught her last year how to spray her Christmas tree with white washing
powder, wet-mixed for needle application. This year, she has tried it on the
contrasting group of Leylandii cypress and gold-variegated eleagnus which
she and Julian planted as the ink dried on the Old Rectory contract in 1986.
Not every visitor has been as whole-hearted about this combination. The
cypresses are more than 20ft high, and Veronica jammed her Killa-spray while
trying to cover them with bio-degradable whiteness before draping them with
fairy lights. When nature is refusing to bring Christmas outdoors, it takes
a Sloane Wally to do it instead.
While Veronica has been simulating on her step-ladder, Julian has come round
to some simulation of his own after thinking through the problem of her
melancholia. Thanks to last year's City bonuses, properties in Onslow
Gardens are still sky-high; thanks to the market for private clients, the
price differential between Onslow Gardens and the Old Rectory is much too
wide to consider returning in style to London.
Every year, the dull, wet days of November do little for Veronica's
nostalgia. This year, daughter Victoria has done even less. It is amazing
what a second-class degree in Communication Studies now commands as a London
starting salary. Sloane Wallys always like to see enterprise rewarded, but
Julian and Veronica were not exactly expecting their newly-employed daughter
to declare seasonal war on Sussex and decamp with an office bonus, an office
partner and a free fortnight on Air Miles to Colombia until the new year.
Discussing things with friends at the office, Julian began to see how to
make virtuality out of necessity. For weeks, Victoria has been talking
impenetrably about Internet surfing, the sky highway and CD-Rom simulation.
Two weeks ago, the topics came up again over lunch with his old school
friend, Jeremy.
Several of Jeremy's contemporaries have been hit badly again by Lloyd's and,
this year, they have been forced under the hammer. Two of them are much less
bothered about losing the house than losing the garden: window boxes in
Pimlico are no compensation. So, they have teamed up in adversity and come
up with tomorrow's alternative. Inter-Dig, or global network horticulture,
aims to bring the experience, but not the reality, of English country
gardening to the house-bound, the bankrupt, and corporate lawyers on
postings to the Gulf.
In winter, Veronica's code name for the pony paddock has always been
Siberia. Until Jeremy spelt the address, Julian thought he was joking when
he told him to go down to Soho, find Charlotte Street and key in for a
session at Cyberia, London's latest state-of-the-computer-art.
Not only did they offer him some excellent slices of chocolate cake. For
Pounds 2.50, they made Julian the first Sloane Wally to sit at a keyboard
and join the Internet, bombarding him with a choice of bulletin boards from
Bill Clinton's Christmas message on screen to the CIA files on third world
agriculture.
Julian had no idea what possibilities were open to today's gardeners. At
cross-terminals, he found himself linked up with Duke in California, who was
sharing his experiences with crops of sun-dried tomatoes among ceanothus,
while an earth group of live-in feminist gardeners was advertising to swap
seeds of Jack-goes-naked for lady's smock.
Thanks to Cyberia, Julian no longer thinks of the information highway as one
more billeting about traffic jams on the M25. In half an hour he had girdled
the earth without digging it, and he felt himself to be part of a green
skyway far above the ground elder in his own camomile lawn.
Every winter, Veronica becomes wistful when the rain sweeps in from Horsham.
Why not Internet her for Christmas: wire her up and let her enjoy the
appearance without the experience, as Jeremy put it, cryptically? At a touch
on the keyboard, she could garden vicariously while surfing above Sussex on
the new computer networks in the sky.
Here is how to do it. For Christmas, Julian has bought her a year's link-up
with the Internet, focused specially on gardening and green issues, and
helmet membership of Inter-Dig, which aims to simulate any experience from
Sittinghurst to an evening with Penelope Hobhouse as soon as you plug it in.
(Perhaps Inter-Sloane would have been even more effective but, until Onslow
Gardens is Internetted, too, a day of apparent weeding without worms or any
pain in the hips will do something to take the edge off January outside
London).
There is one minor uncertainty. Sloane Wallys are emphatically in favour of
the free market, but Julian did learn at Cyberia that access to the Internet
is sans frontieres, totally free and unrestrictable.
It is not only that the CIA file on third world agriculture contains some
astonishing statistics about the scale of coca plantations in Colombia and a
fact-file on the coca plant's requirements, all of which would have been met
admirably by this year's very dry summer in the Old Rectory's paddock.
Worse, recipients can net in, swap details and surf off to the sky with
anyone who makes key contact and takes their fancy. Even on his trial run,
Julian Internetted with a girl in dungarees on an allotment who gave a new
meaning to the idea of a Green Goddess.
What, he wondered, if Veronica became locked in with some urban soul-mate on
a computer latitude far from the home counties? While it might work wonders
for the winter blues, Julian did spend last night, before wrapping up the
gift, reading the instructions to see if access could be controlled at the
giver's discretion.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Food and Drink: Why the next two vintages are crucial -
Jancis Robinson with the final part of an article on trends in Australian
wines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The words 'cautious' and 'nervous' are two unlikely adjectives which
accurately describe Australia's wine exporters at the moment. For the past
few years they have been justifiably gung-ho, with wine exports having risen
tenfold since 1985 to represent almost one bottle in every four produced.
Their much-vaunted plan is to continue to woo overseas wine-drinkers to the
tune of ADollars 1bn in total wine exports by 2000, but they are hitting a
few snags - even discounting a couple of natural disasters.
Frost dinted next year's vintage prospects in the all-important Barossa
Valley, the most famous wine region in the wine state, South Australia; and
a severe drought could well reduce the 1995 vintage in a country that is
already short of the premium grapes on which its export sales depend.
There has been a fury of new plantings, which will increase acreage by a
good 7 per cent (so much so that many fear there will be a grape glut in
five years) but they will not come into production in time to halt a spiral
in grape prices for the 1995 and 1996 vintages.
Almost all wine producers depend heavily on grape growers, and paid them an
average of 33 per cent more between June 1993 and June 1994, while average
domestic wine prices rose just 6 per cent and export prices rose an almost
unnoticeable 1 per cent.
Vines take three years to produce a viable crop, so plantings tend to
reflect demand with a pronounced lag. Fuelled by 1980s fashions, everyone
has been planting Chardonnay, so the most acute medium-term shortages are
predicted for premium red varieties such as Shiraz and Pinot Noir.
At the bottom end of the market, there is no lack of basic cheap Sultana and
Muscat grapes (which alternate between supplying the wine and dried grape
markets). It could be that Australia's fate in the big, bad wine world over
the next year or so will depend on producers resisting the temptation to
stretch the good with the heavily irrigated and distinctly less good.
Australians, like European wine producers, are allowed to blend in up to a
total of 15 per cent of grapes, vintages and regions other than those
specified on the label, but the catch-all 'South Eastern Australia'
appellation, devised for export, allows producers to source grapes more or
less anywhere except the isolated and relatively limited vineyards of
Western Australia. Australian wine folk, almost all of them male, are
inveterate travellers. There is already considerable discontent within
Australia about 'flying winemakers.'
These antipodean experts make wine in Europe during their quiet winter back
home, but there is concern that their activities are simply diluting
Australia's technical advantages by exporting them to its commercial rivals,
many of them with lower cost-bases.
Having themselves put pressure on the French in the late 1980s, Australian
exporters are all too well aware of the increased competition their wines
face from South America, South Africa, southern France and Eastern Europe in
the mid 1990s. They have won a 6 per cent share of the precious UK market
from a standing start, but on the basis of offering real value for money.
Many industry figures are concerned about how they will keep this enviable
reputation as prices rise. 'We have no alternative but to increase prices,'
maintains Robin Day, managing director of Pernod-Ricard's Orlando, whose
Jacob's Creek range has become Britain's most popular brand of bottled wine.
'We simply can't afford to absorb any more results of the currency movements
and the grape shortage.'
Brian Croser, who successfully negotiated a halt in the rise of domestic
wine tax in late 1993, is also chairman of the commercially significant
Royal Adelaide Wine Show. He had to report that this year's judging marathon
resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of gold medals awarded in the
cheaper wine classes, of wines destined both for export and domestic
markets.
'Australia has entered dangerous commercial territory,' he warned his fellow
wine producers. 'The thing central to our success - premium varietal wines
at good prices - is vanishing. As the cost-accountants rampage through our
cellars, we are becoming producers of FAQ (fair average quality) wines. We
must be careful as a viticultural nation that we don't lose sight of why our
wines have been successful on export markets.'
If by any chance the British did fall out of love with Australian wine (and
nearly half the exports from Australia/New Zealand went to the UK last
year), things could be very grim for the Australian market. The relatively
static domestic market Down Under would find it extremely difficult to
absorb the quantities involved without a repeat of the dumping which ruined
the market in its last down-swing.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Food and Drink: Food fit for another curtain call - Cookery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Entertainments work up the appetite. Circus and pantomime matinees are easy
to cater for. You lunch beforehand and when you spill out on to the streets
after the performance it is time for a slap-up tea.
Gunters, in London's Curzon Street, was the favoured venue when I was a
child. Warm and brightly lit with a Christmas tree, it brimmed with jovial
uncles. The sort of uncles who told silly jokes, who understood full well
that sandwiches were of little interest to girls and boys, and who pressed
half-crowns into the hands of their nephews and nieces at the end of the
day.
When such uncles were in charge, second helpings - even thirds - of ice
cream were a distinct possibility, and plates of desirably sticky buns,
biscuits and cakes were replenished as fast as they were devoured:
meringues, chocolate eclairs and walnut cake among them. An amazing
succession of treats when you consider that sweets were still on ration at
the time.
Grown-up theatre parties are more vexed gastronomically, as the timing
nearly always cuts across the hour at which one wants to dine.
You can of course grab a bite during the interval to spare you the
embarrassment of tummy rumblings during the third act. But in that case the
crush of the crush bar and the rush of eating quickly is liable to replace
hunger pangs with terrible indigestion.
Much more civilised, surely, is the old-fashioned habit of tucking into an
unhurried bonne bouche before the curtain goes up and returning home
afterwards for the main course and dessert. The alternative is to patronise
a restaurant close to the theatre that allows you to split your meal in this
way.
Traditional bonne bouches include smoked salmon sandwiches, potted shrimps,
oysters, oeufs en cocotte and scotch woodcock. More contemporary choices
include grilled aubergine with pesto, chicken liver crostini and roasted red
peppers with rocket and squid.
The post-theatre part of the supper, if taken at home, should be simple,
special and fast work - I mean capable of being brought to table within 10
minutes of opening the front door. And I can think of nothing more
appropriate to follow an evening at the opera than sumptuous little
tournedos Rossini.
Rossini was as passionate about food as music. As Harry Luke points out in
The Tenth Muse, he composed both The Barber of Seville and La Cenerentola
before he was 25 and he did not write another opera after he was 35. 'Become
rich and idle and concentrating thenceforth on good living, he settled in
France . . . and devoted the last 40 years of his life to culinary rather
than musical composition.'
Tournedos Rossini is arguably one of his finest works. It is a dish that
demands little time and no special cooking skills. It calls for few
ingredients - but the finest.
Escoffier gives the recipe in his Guide to Modern Cookery. 'Fry some
tournedos in butter. Dish them on crusts of fried bread. On each tournedos
lay a round slice of foie gras just a little smaller than the former; the
slices should be seasoned, dredged and turned in butter. On each slice of
foie gras, set a fine slice of truffle.'
The 1961 edition of Larousse Gastronomique offers a greedier interpretation,
specifying 'three good slices of truffle for each tournedos' and it
instructs the cook at the end 'to dilute the pan juices with Madeira and
demi-glace'. Take your pick.
Now, some of you may have gained the impression from my recent columns that
I do not consider foie gras and truffles good companions. Far from it. It is
true that cooking and preserving the two ingredients together strikes me as
a terrible waste, for most of the flavour and fragrance of a truffle is lost
when cooked. As Elizabeth Rostaing, of Gourmet Foods from France, puts it:
'Truffles substantially enhance the price but not the flavour of preserved
foie gras.' But combining foie gras and truffles at the point of serving is
a very different matter - it is a marriage made in heaven.
Fresh white truffles from northern Italy, the most expensive and best, are
usually in season until just after Christmas. The season for black truffles
from France runs until March. Rostaing is thinking of bringing some over
from Provence when they are harvested there in late January and February.
Interested parties should contact her in good time (tel: 081-788 6908 and
fax: 081-789 2732).
If tournedos Rossini seem a mite too extravagant even for the festive
season, or if some of your guests do not eat meat, an attractive alternative
choice for a theatre supper would be a fish soup-cum-stew served with aioli.
This is more work for the cook but most of it can be done ahead, leaving you
only to reheat the broth (rich fish stock spiked with saffron, wine, chunks
of fennel, potato, leek and red pepper) and to add the fishy morsels
(monkfish, cod, scallops, squid, prawns, mussels or what you will) on your
return home.
I suggest following either dish effortlessly with salad and cheese, and
offering Elvas plums with coffee as a final curtain call.

Amid the ballyhoo over the progressive watering of Britain's leading gin
brands, James Burrough, based in London's Kennington, emerged with its
reputation enhanced. Its Beefeater brand remained at the former standard
strength of 40 per cent alcohol, while many of the others slithered down to
37.5 in imitation of Gordon's.
Burroughs has now added to its range by creating Crown Jewel, a gin with a
proper cocktail strength of 50 per cent by volume. It has the juniperry
character which is the hallmark of all gins, allied to those citrus peel
aromas which are part of a 'London dry' recipe.
There has been a suggestion that the distillers might have used grapefruit
rather than the more standard orange or lemon peel. This could be true, but
there is also an intense orangey note to the spirit of almost Cointreau-like
intensity. This is a pretty, superbly made gin, ideal for lovers of proper
dry martinis.
For the time being it is available from duty free shops only. Prices vary
between Pounds 10 and Pounds 11 for a litre bottle.

Good chocolates always make good last-minute gifts and, in spite of the
inroads made by Belgian chocolatiers in the UK, there have always been
English manufacturers at the top end of the market.
For quality and presentation it is hard to beat Charbonnel et Walker, One
The Royal Arcade, 28 Old Bond Street, W1X 4BY (tel: 071-491 0939) which
still keeps lists of customers' preferred centres.
Selfridges, in Oxford Street, London, W1A 1AB (071-629 1234) offers a wide
choice including its own selection of truffles, English and Belgian filled
chocolates. For post-prandial nibbling, try Cafe-Tasse Santos roasted coffee
beans coated in plain, milk or white chocolate (Pounds 3.25 for 150g) or
hand-finished squares of fine Belgian chocolate, brittle as tree bark, at
Pounds 3.85 per box. Duchalet, a Swiss dark chocolate liqueur on an apple
and pear schnapps base (Pounds 11.99), would make a worthy dessert.
French chocolatier Michel Cluizel has produced an almost pure chocolate - 99
per cent cocoa with hardly any sugar. If chocolate has gone designer, this
is the extreme end of the catwalk. Austerely wrapped in matte black and
gold, it is sold in 30g bars (Pounds 1.35).
The Chocolate Society's grand crus chocolates are easier on the palate. It
produces 'single blend' bars from the rare Criollo, Guanaja, and Trinitario
beans which make up only 10 per cent of the world's production. The flavours
are distinctive and the society also produces truffles using its own
chocolate and fresh cream.
At Godiva's elegant shop at 247 Regent Street, W1R 7AE (071-495 2845) weary
shoppers can revive themselves with a cup of hot chocolate served with piles
of whipped cream while choosing from a sumptuous range of filled and moulded
chocolates. The coin-stamped Ecu - milk or dark chocolate filled with a
bitter hazelnut paste - does more for currency union than any economist.
A wide range of quality chocolate is increasingly available outside London.
At Sweet Seductions, 78 Regent Street, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, CV32
4NS (01926-431017), I found my chocolate choice of the season: a miniature
mince pie shaped out of white chocolate, enclosing a dark chocolate ganache
flavoured with rum and cinnamon - available singly (65p) or in packs of four
(Pounds 3.15p).
My other seasonal accolade goes to Fortnum &amp; Mason, Piccadilly W1A 1ER
(071-734 8040) for its aptly-named Elegant Thins: wafers of fine chocolate
in various flavours (Pounds 7.25 for a 250g selection).

Cyril Ray's unsponsored, elegantly written book on Bollinger champagne,
first published in 1971 and revised in 1982, was by no means limited to the
affairs and wines of that house. It is one of the best books on champagne
and its history, with special attention to the famous 1911 riots, when
troops were sent in to crush the rebellion of growers protesting at the use
by some firms of cheap still wines bought outside the region.
Bollinger was not affected. Now the book has been revived and updated by
Serena Sutcliffe (Bollinger, 221 pages and, at Pounds 20, less than the
price of a bottle of Special Cuvee). She has provided information on changes
in the last decade, details of the industry's structure and her personal
appreciations of Bollinger vintages from 1953 to 1988.

Overall winner of the 1994 organic food awards is Little Marcle Organic
Partnership, of Ledbury, Herefordshire. This company grows vegetables, packs
them in boxes of mixed seasonal varieties, and delivers them weekly to its
subscribers. A box containing enough for two people for a week, costing
Pounds 6.50, was commended by the judges for freshness, flavour,
presentation and value for money. For further information ring 0153-632892.
Winner of the poultry category was PJ Onions, of East Ashridge Farm, Newark,
Nottinghamshire (0949-850268) who grows organic oven-ready chickens.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Fashion: Comfort dressing can be as elegant as you like -
How to spend it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When you are all shopped out, your stilettos are killing you and the effort
of looking glamorous has begun to tell, then it is time for comfort clothes.
Of course, comfort clothes have long been with us - there are those who wear
nothing else. Whether it be an easy tracksuit, a floaty caftan or a
beaten-up pair of jeans, comfort clothes are what a woman puts on when she
wants to relax, when she is tired of holding in her stomach and when the
most appealing thing she can think of doing is to flop on a sofa with a
glass tinkling with ice in one hand and a book in the other.
But there is another sort of comfort dressing. These are clothes that are
just as easy to wear, just as forgiving, but infinitely more indulgent.
Forget cotton, Lycra or easy-care mixes. These are made of brocades and
velvets, cashmere, silks and satins. They are metropolitan in mood,
langorous and seductive. These are the clothes to wear when champagne or a
stiff Martini are on the menu and they are a million miles from the cup of
cocoa and a biscuit mood.
They all hark back to the days when the salon played a large part in the
social lives of the sophisticated metropolis, when being 'at home' wasn't a
synonym for sloppy dress but an invitation to the civilised indoor delights
of good conversation, of music, of fine food and entertainment.
Such clothes have more than a touch of the hedonistic about them, echoing
the heyday of the aesthetic movement, mirroring the richness of a Gustav
Klimt portrait or the turn-of-the-century love affair with Eastern
exoticism.
Clothes that tune into this new mood are everywhere. Knickerbox, one of the
cheaper chains, has soft and seductive pyjamas that are luxurious enough to
wear in company. Higher up the range, Georgina von Etzdorf has rich lush
velvets, while Caroline Charles is the place for gold-braided brocaded
jackets.
What they all have in common is that, being loose and unstructured with
fluid outlines, they are just as comfortable, as easy to wear, as anything
made of Lycra or acrylic, but are much more glamorous.
Since the fabrics are sumptuous and the workmanship intricate they usually
don't come cheap, but they can as easily be worn to the grandest gathering
as an evening home alone.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Arts: Vintage Rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH HEMMING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The curtain that greets the audience as they take their seats gives the cue
to this production of The Rivals. Showing a scene from Bath in the 18th
century, it is charmingly pretty, and looks quite authentic, but is somehow
insipid.
Richard Cottrell's staging (first shown in Chichester earlier this year)
gives us a flavour of how the original might have looked, with its clearly
artificial flat painted backdrops. The acting style too is vintage -
ornately mannered and involving plenty of appeals to the audience: comic
asides, sly glances and shrugs. But while the production emphasises
Sheridan's highly developed sense of the theatrical, this does not translate
into a wickedly funny critique of the contrived behaviour of fashionable
society. Sheridan's comedy has warmth, but it also has bite, and he is
merciless in his lampooning of pretentiousness, nowhere more so than in his
most memorable creation, Mrs Malaprop.
To be sure, Patricia Routledge, as Mrs Malaprop, is splendid. Decked out
like a lingerie department at Christmas, resplendent with ribbons and bows,
satin and lace, she arrives in full sail to hold the stage. Her performance
matches her appearance, with extra trimmings all over. She plunges into her
character's hopeless mauling of the English language with enjoyable relish,
while an occasional haughty snort reminds of us Hyacinth Bucket (the
stuck-up old harridan she plays in Keeping Up Appearances on television).
Richard Johnson is amusing as the crusty Sir Anthony Absolute, growling,
harrumphing and waving his stick, and James Simmons has dash and charm as
his wayward son Jack, whose secret disguise as Ensign Beverley is the
lynchpin of the plot. Scenes that involve any combination of these three
characters do take off: the reconciliation between father and son is
delightfully funny.
But elsewhere, the production feels half-hearted. It takes a long while to
crank up, and though Debra Beaumont is exquisitely pretty as Lydia Languish,
she is so straight there is no fun to be had out of her at all. Sheridan
spared no-one in his ridicule of fashionable society and if this does not
emerge the whole Acres sub-plot, detailing the absurd length this yokel will
go to to be thought au fait with proper social etiquette, seems rather
meaningless. Billy Doyle is good as a bluff, scornful Sir Lucius O'Trigger
and Adam Godley works hard as the maddening, simpering Faulkland. But it is
all rather like a bite from an old snake who forgot to put his fangs in.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Arts: Revolution to redemption - Sarah Hemming admires a
stage adaptation of 'A Tale of Two Cities'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH HEMMING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Best remembered by most of us for its opening and closing lines, Dickens' A
Tale of Two Cities is a tricky novel to adapt, with its intricate storyline,
constant shuttling between Paris and London and countless opportunities for
sentimentality. It says much for Matthew Francis's fine, intelligent
adaptation at Greenwich Theatre that it manages to embrace the scale, feel
and thrust of the novel, and convey the sense of perpetual motion and of
lives caught up in great events, while getting across (mostly) the
complexities of the plot and bringing out the novel's fascinating themes of
revolution, resurrection and redemption.
There are no tricks, no frills and no musical numbers: this is a
straightforward telling, and the better for it. Occasionally it plods, but
mostly it is wholly absorbing. Julian McGowan's versatile set of dark wooden
staircases, doors and platforms lowers over the auditorium and is both
atmospheric and practical. We move from the Old Bailey to a Paris tenement
to the walk to the guillotine with just a switch of lighting, no fuss and no
elaborate changing of scenes - which is invaluable in keeping the momentum
going. Beneath the staircase, centre stage, a pair of double doors and
casually placed wheels suggest the shape of a coach: a visual emblem of the
constant journeying to and fro that is at the heart of the book.
The set also offers several platforms, an ingenious device which keeps the
audience's eye moving round the stage and helps to overcome the fact that
the novel is a different shape and has a very different impetus to a stage
play. Francis's production, too, works hard to compensate for this,
dramatising some scenes, reading some aloud, constantly moving and changing
focus, to give the flavour of Dickens' original, as it see-saws between
light and dark.
The production is carried along by Timothy Walker's excellent Sydney Carton.
Hair hanging in his eyes, clothes never quite where they should be, he is
convincingly dissolute but manages to stay the right side of self-indulgence
and makes sense of the characters disillusionment and final magnanimous act.
And yes, he does speak those immortal last lines - and get away with it.
Julian Mitchell as Dr Manette has a quiet, compelling gravitas (though he
could do with quaking less in moments of great emotion) and Eleanor Tremain
is appealing as Lucie, one of Dickens' difficult, flawless heroines. Bernard
Lloyd is particularly good in the rather thankless role of Mr Jarvis Lorry,
the amiable old banker who reunites the father and daughter - a masterful
portrayal of decency and humanity; while Madame Defarge (Heather Tobias),
the ruthless French revolutionary, sashays round the stage with an
impervious, self-righteous smile.
There are a few duff scenes - a rather lame staging of the French
Revolution, for example - some heavy-handed sound effects, a few points
where the pace drops and the production becomes solid, and the story could
be clearer in places. Alexis Denisoff as Charles Darnay has little to go on,
and makes very little of what he has (in the prison cell you would never
believe he was a condemned man), while Susan Porrett wastes some of her
comic opportunities as Miss Pross. But overall, this is an atmospheric,
enjoyable production; not the best of adaptations, but far, far better than
many.
At Greenwich Theatre, SE10.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Arts: An old flame from Portugal - Antony Thorncroft salutes
Lisbon, bowing out as this year's European City of Culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So it's farewell Lisbon, 1994, hello Luxembourg, 1995. The European City of
Culture moves with the calendar and the artistic flame has been passed on
from Portugal's capital to the Grand Duchy.
Cities of Culture, an EC institution, attract little criticism; they also
attract little interest. It would take a cultural junkie to remember which
city glowed with creativity in 1989 (Paris) or 1992 (Madrid). Only Glasgow
(1990) and Antwerp (1993) managed to change their popular image by having a
heavy attack of the arts.
In Lisbon, the ending of the cultural year affected citizens in two ways: a
small group scattered around the Teatro San Carlos for the worthy
congratulatory speeches - while thousands milled on the banks of the Tagus
listening to Portugal's top rock band, watching fireworks, and patronising
the bars that were kept open all night.
In the immediate future there will always be a small audience for the high
arts in Lisbon. Venues which hummed with performances for most of 1994 will
return to weekly concerts and the short opera and dance seasons, but the
audience will grow now there is an infrastructure in place to support it.
The main tangible benefit is the way the authorities were forced to invest
in new, or revamped, theatres, concert halls and museums.
There were the usual sulks between a right-wing government and a left-wing
city council about footing the bill, but in the end more than Pounds 30m was
conjured up. The funds did not permit any splashy new structures, but the
main concert hall, the Coliseu, now gleams with the intimacy of a musical
bull ring and two of Lisbon's main museums, of modern art in the Chaido and
of Old Masters along by the river, are marvellous examples of how old
buildings can be decked inside with modern trimings without destroying the
historic exterior structure.
As Portugal, seaward-gazing and introspective, gradually absorbs European
culture, the refurbished buildings will tempt a larger audience. Not
surprisingly, with all the special exhibitions, there were 50 per cent more
gallery visitors during 1994. In all, about 1.5m tickets were sold for more
than 1,000 events, even though the organisers had to reduce seat prices by
20 per cent to attract decent audiences.
There were the usual grouses: that too much money was spent bringing foreign
creative artists to Lisbon and not enough on encouraging local talent; that
the events charmed the sophisticated minority while the man on the tram was
untouched. But visits from orchestras such as the LSO and the Philharmonia,
the Concertgebouw and the Czech Philharmonic; from dance companies such as
Pina Bausch and Merce Cunningham; plus the opportunity to see for the first
time opera productions of Peter Grimes, The Makropoulus Case, and Julio
Cesare must have opened the ears and eyes of many first generation EC
Portuguese.
There were setbacks, such as the cancellation of an exhibition by Portugal's
leading artist, the London based Paula Rego, and a poorly received Carmen.
Perhaps the biggest row was over the poor reception given to Wim Wenders'
movie Lisbon Story. The city wanted the best European director to capture in
fiction this significant moment in the history of Lisbon. Wenders was
tempted with a budget reported to be in excess of Pounds 1m, but produced an
over-long work which was as unimaginative as it was self-regarding. Shooting
tourist Lisbon, he missed exciting developments such as the rediscovery of
Lisbon's early 19th-century architectural grandeur in the 'Seventh Hill'
sector.
Lisbon worked as a city of culture because it gave a new angle on a
little-known but fascinating capital. Lisbon is at its best when being
itself, untouched by other-Europe: in the Museu dos Azulejos, attached to a
spectacular convent with a church, in which secular 18th-century scenes of
Lisbon in blue and white tiles compete with gilt baroque for wall space; and
in the special exhibition of fado at the Museu de Etnologia.
This describes how the spontaneous music of the street, the disregarded,
despairing 19th-century voice of the brothels and the beggars, became
gentrified as a tourist attraction in the 20th century. Its climax comes in
a darkened room where the greatest fado singer of all, Amalia Rodrigues,
sings of abandonment.
It is a cultural experience of unrelenting power and passion, and quite a
contrast to the formality which attaches itself to these cultural years. The
statistical guru John Myerscough has evaluated the impact of cultural
capitals. It is mixed: in Dublin only 5 per cent of those asked could
remember an event they had attended; in Glasgow, 61 per cent of citizens
voted it a success. Lisbon is happy that 48 per cent of the locals came down
in favour; 32 per cent against.
Capitals of culture are a good idea, but the idea alone is not enough. They
need planning, a rationale, and money, too. They work best in over-looked
cities like Lisbon.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Arts: Time for a voyage of rediscovery - The permanent
collections of the major galleries are full of forgotten treasures. William
Packer catalogues their delights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We are often inclined to take the constantly available treats of permanent
art collections for granted, leaving them to the tourist or the provincial.
We promise ourselves there will always be Easter or Christmas at which to
take them in.
Not that we can accuse gallery directors of accepting our indifference.
Nicholas Serota's policy at the Tate of a complete rehang every year has
refocused attention on the permanent collections. The 1995 displays are due
to be unveiled at the end of next month, but, by the nature of the exercise,
much is already in place, so this a good moment for an early scout around.
At the National Gallery, Neil MacGregor's thorough reordering of the
collections, which the opening of the Sainsbury Wing made necessary, is just
about complete. As to his success, that is a matter to which I hope soon to
return.
Even so, the temporary study exhibition drawn from the collections is a
special case. These are dressed up with full and scholarly catalogues, or
augmented by spectacular loans. The point is usually well made that here
indeed is something special.
At the Tate, on the other hand, even though the shows are no less
remarkable, the feeling is too often of something modest and incidental
tucked away in the farthest basement, over-shadowed by more important
special exhibitions and permanent displays upstairs.
Such self-effacement is, in part, the creature of the sheer richness of the
material available combined with the constraints imposed by limited funds.
We should, I suppose, be grateful for what we get.
The show that currently fills the Tate's lower galleries, of British
watercolours, prints and drawings from the mid-18th to the mid-19th century,
is remarkable for its quality and scope. Three rooms present, in turn, three
aspects of work in those media in which we British have long notoriously
prided ourselves. Furthermore, they are from the period in which the British
facility for such work supposedly achieved its fullest expression.
The room of landscape studies is an exhibition in itself, taking us from
Gainsborough to Ruskin through a variety of familiar names yet in unfamiliar
if characteristic images. All those we would expect are there - Wilson,
Cozens, Sandby, Cotman, Girtin, Constable, Cox, Bonington, de Wint, Lewis,
Lear and others beside, while Turner fills the corridor outside.
The works are by turns beautiful and surprising, funny and dramatic, from
Rowlandson's ripe wenches spying in a wood to Ruskin's freely-stated distant
view of Bologna through the trees. To pick out favourite things would be to
catalogue the lot - Callow's cliff-like palazzi along the Grand Canal, Cox's
no less cliff-like tenements along the Seine, Turner's House of Commons on
fire, Muller's stair cut into the rock, Varley's nod to Poussin in his
'Suburbs of an Ancient City', and on and on. But how fresh these things are,
and how direct. We sit at the artist's shoulder as he works, as if it were
but yesterday.
The room of prints takes us from engravings after Stubbs, Constable and
Turner to the etchings of Whistler and Keene, but is chiefly remarkable for
the series of abstracted rocks and mountain-scapes of Alexander Cozens. He
derived these from blots, his 'new method of assisting the invention in
drawing original compositions of landscape'.
The third room holds figure and composition studies, often very full in
their realisation, from Wilkie and Lawrence to Burne-Jones and Millais, with
Max Beerbohm's later satires upon life with The Brotherhood thrown in for
good measure.
Wilkie's drawing for 'The First Ear-ring' is especially charming, and indeed
the drawings from life throughout are very fine, from Lawrence's old lady
and John Jackson's portrait study of Wilkie, to the seated girls of
Rossetti, Wallis and Burne-Jones, and Arthur Hughes's brief first note of
his model for 'April Love'.
But in truth the room is dominated by the romantic medievalism of the
pre-Raphaelite imagination, with Rossetti the central figure and Burne-Jones
hardly less prominent. It is all highly enjoyable, dark, intense and
romantic with its knights in armour and swooning ladies, sweet-briar and
honeysuckle, Mariana at the Moated Grange and Fair Rosamund moving anxiously
away from Queen Eleanor. It is even gently comical - Ford Madox Brown's
'King Rene on his honeymoon' sits glumly in the garden as his wife kisses
him sweetly on the cheek.
Two lovely landscapes by Boyce and Seddon, and an oddly modern drawing of a
scrubby field by Wallis, should really be in the first room.
From Gainsborough to the Pre-Raphaelites: works on paper - the Tate Gallery,
Millbank SW1, until February 12.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Arts: Gifts for the glitterati - Our critics present their
seasonal greetings to leading figures in the arts world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN, ALASTAIR MACAULAY and CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As it was not exported to the Getty Museum after all, I shall give Canova's
'The Three Graces' to Jeremy Isaacs at the Royal Opera House. It will look
splendid at the top of the grand staircase that is planned for his new
building and should impress the chairman of the Arts Council when he drops
into the general director's office in the meantime.
How appropriate, too, that the figures seem to have acquired new identities:
Patience, Thrift and Ingenuity. Patience, because the signs are that public
opinion is against the Royal Opera House getting lottery money to fund its
ambitious Pounds 100m redevelopment plan. Thrift, in order to reduce the
company's financial deficit. And Ingenuity, to continue putting on a
world-class programme in the face of competition from massively-subsidised
opera-houses overseas.
If Mr Isaacs does not like my gift, he could always try selling it on the
black market. The Pounds 7m plus that it would raise could solve his
problems for years to come. Alternatively, he could swop the three buxom
ladies for The Three Tenors in concert. But then again - considering their
fee for that Los Angeles gig - perhaps not.
*****
For Peter Sellars, a desert island, on which he could stage The Oresteia,
with Bill T. Jones as Clytemnestra, Steven Berkoff as Electra and Agamemnon,
with William Forsythe on hand to choreograph the tap dances and Andrew Lloyd
Webber providing revised versions (tango, rock, waltz, etc.) of choral odes
at each performance, for an audience of surrounding sharks.
For John Barton at the RSC, a new production of Shakespeare's Richard
II-Henry IV-Henry V tetralogy at the Swan, with Mark Rylance as both Richard
II and Henry V, and Michael Gambon as Falstaff.
For Galina Gorchakova (a) a tuning fork (b) a house in London (c) a season
at Covent Garden singing in La Forza del destino, The Queen of Spades, and
Don Carlo, among others.
For Judi Dench, a revival of the Peter Hall Antony and Cleopatra (the
production also to be recorded on TV) and a new production of Beckett's
Happy Days at the Cottesloe.
For Harold Pinter and Tom Stoppard, two or more new plays each.
For Darcey Bussell, an injury-free season with intense coaching by Suzanne
Farrell in the Balanchine repertory; plus a revival of Ashton's three-act
Sylvia.
For Nicholas Hytner, new productions of Cos fan tutte, Il Trovatore, Lope de
Vega's The Great Pretenders, and a new play by Alan Bennett, with whichever
British companies he chose.
For Harriet Walter, an RSC season as Millamant, Hedda Gabler, Beatrice, and
Rosalind.
For Mark Morris, an Edinburgh Festival production of any Rameau opera, a new
staging of Handel's Terpsicore and a new work to commissioned music by
Michelle Shocked and Rob Wasserman.
For Stephen Daldry and Anthony Dowell, a fire in the scenery department.
For Anderson Country (Radio 4), a fire in the sound department.
For Bryn Terfel, every pre-20th-century Italian and French and Russian role
and every 20th-century British role he is ready for and has time to sing.
*****
Santa, that great deceiver, will probably let me down (again) but, if he
received that note I posted to him at the North Pole, he will make the
following deliveries:
To Jeremy Isaacs and the Royal Opera House, a large bundle of National
Lottery cash (which I trust will not prove to be Fool's Gold) so that prices
can be reduced. Those one-time 'regular' audiences at Covent Garden have
been priced out of their seats. Gone are the days when people could afford
to go to opera and ballet three or more times a week. A opera house is
vastly the poorer without the enthusiasms of these devotees, who give the
theatre a vital part of its atmosphere and spirit.
To Anthony Dowell and Derek Deane, as directors of two big classical
companies: a brace (each) of real thousand-watt, rampagious ballerinas.
Difficult, maybe, but certainly divine, these stars make sense of the old
repertory that the Royal and English National Ballets offer us. At the
moment we see nice, dutiful young ladies busy being Princesses, Swan Queens
and betrayed peasants. The heroine, alas, is not at home. It needs
temperament and a grand style to justify such ballets. And, as a bonus, the
box-office is swamped.
To Sadler's Wells Theatre: policies which will brings a brighter and more
vital air to the theatre. How welcome would be an end to visits from awful
and awfully optimistic dance troupes. Let there be coffee rather than
dish-water in the pit cafe; a general sprucing of the theatre's facilities;
an end to mindless pop music in the De Valois room; a foyer less like the
rush-hour on the Northern Line (move the bar]).
And to London - a city where dance was once vital - the much-needed Dance
House, to be a home for English National Ballet and Rambert Dance, an added
stage for the Royal Ballet, and a serious port of call for large visiting
troupes.

Not very seasonal, I'm afraid, but a phrase that has resonated through the
week referred to 'the extraordinary resilience of bad ideas . . . They come
round year by year'. Thus did the excellent Radio 4 series Scapegoats leave
us with the gloomy prognosis that, when it comes to the Pharisee thanking
God he was not as other men, human nature is condemned to 'relive the same
old mistakes'.
Tchaikovsky understood. Radio 3's Pride or Prejudice? trotted out the now
familiar theory that the composer was forced to commit suicide by a kangaroo
court of his academic colleagues, worried that his homosexuality might shame
the old school. The proponent of this theory compared it with a Russian
version of Eton. An opponent said nothing of the sort, the school produced
several reprobates and disreputables, some of whom were homosexual. As an
argument against the Eton comparison this seemed a trifle sanguine.
The forced suicide idea strikes me as far-fetched but the incidentals were
fascinating: the Russian press came out in favour of Oscar Wilde during his
disgrace, the male companion of Tsar Alexander III's brother was referred to
as his 'mistress' by the blase Parisian press. The programme's presenter,
Stephen Johnson, wondered whether the phenomenon even aroused disapproval -
rather naively; whatever the attitudes among the enlightened or the
privileged, or even the lawmakers at any particular time, homosexuality has
never been accepted by Christendom.
Which was why Mum, I've Got Something to Tell You (Radio 4) was so
engrossing. Three young men, with contributions from their families,
recalled coming out as gay to their parents. The mother of a Jewish
violinist from a supportive East End family remembered: 'We all cried
together and cuddled together.' A Mancunian student told his dad when he
came back from snooker. 'He said, well, there it is, and took the dog for a
walk.' Mother added that he was a long time: 'I'm sure the dog's legs were
much shorter afterwards.'
Their worlds did not fall in. Only with the Roman Catholic from Belfast was
there a hint of bitterness. Goaded into telling his parents, ironically, by
anger at the unsympathetic priest, he betrayed a certain bitterness at his
family's attitude. 'They don't ask me how my partner is. It hurts a little
bit. Sometimes I think, why did I tell them?' This programme was funny,
touching and oddly reassuring. Taking the dog for a walk is a civilised
response to familial upheavals.
Radio has a gentle, unhectoring way of insidiously introducing slightly
dotty strangers into your home. In Radio 4's Personal Obsessions I suddenly
became aware of a collector of old gramophones verging on the quietly
fanatic as he spoke of the survival of chocolate records, played with a
glass stylus. 'The sound quality's not brilliant,' he said wistfully. Unless
I imagined it all.
On Sunday Radio 3 went magnificently to town, many towns, several countries,
for a 15-hour musical jaunt around Europe. The odd technical hitch (notably
in the charmingly secular-sounding Anfossi, into whose operas Mozart
interpolated arias, cut off from Italy) is pardonable; less so sloppy
editing of a reading by Robert Hardy. But there were fine things here, from
Finland to Israel. I suppose it was salutary to hear the modern Russian
composer Schnittke's variations on 'Silent night' on Radio 3's On Air. Sour,
jagged, dissonant, as spiky as barbed wire, they reminded us that the frost
is no less sharp, the wind no less bitter on those turned away from the inn,
and their numbers grow no less; just as bad ideas come round year after year
and mankind relives the same old mistakes.

<TEXT>
A New Yorker cartoon shows a man using an axe to attack one of those
mile-a-minute Russian vines at the corner of his house. His wife, at an
upper window, is looking the other way to where a few leaves are appearing
round the corner, and shouting, 'Look out, here it comes again]' It reminds
you of Christmas television: no sooner have you repulsed one onslaught than
the next is upon you.
The worst thing about the programmes - apart from the movies - at this time
of the year, however, is the falseness. No matter how bounteous the
bonhomie, it is hard to forget that it was all contrived in a hot studio in
September.
So let us look ahead to 1995. BBC2 will mark the hundredth anniversary of
the Lumiere brothers first showing films to a paying audience in 'Cinema
Century' which will run right through the year. This will include The BBC
100, a collection of films which are being insistently described as 'NOT the
hundred greatest films ever made', but 100 of the more significant works
from the 3,500 held by the BBC.
Those likely to be screened in the first quarter of the year include Top
Hat, King Kong, 42nd Street, The 39 Steps, Bringing Up Baby and The Maltese
Falcon. They kick off with Citizen Kane on January 2, then, on January 7,
Terry Gilliam begins presenting The Last Machine, which investigates film
before 1913.
At the end of January Channel 4 starts Visions Of Heaven And Hell, a series
looking at our 'headlong rush into the arms of technology'. In the first
programme, people such as Bill Gates of Microsoft and Peter Cochrane, the
head of research at BT, talk about the advantages that technology can bring.
The second considers such social phenomena as the changes in work practices
brought about by modems - not to mention 'cyber hippies' and 'cyber
anarchy'.
The final programme ponders the question of whether social divisions may
increase rather than diminish thanks to the new technologies. It is all very
well for the information rich to regard their home work stations as a boon,
but to the information poor the new habits may look like a way for the
privileged to cut themselves off electronically from a threatening outside
world of pollution and crime.
One of the most heavily promoted series will be The Private Life Of Plants,
starting on BBC1 on January 11. This is the latest part in what will,
surely, be seen eventually as one of the key achievements in the first 50
years of television: David Attenborough's remarkably successful attempt to
explain the natural world.
Beginning in 1979 with the monumental series Life On Earth, he has
progressed via The Living Planet and The Trials Of Life to the more recent -
and technically more astounding than ever - Life In The Freezer. We are
promised that during this forthcoming six-part series on plants the intrepid
Attenborough jumps across savannah fires in Kenya and dangles 200ft up in a
rainforest canopy in Borneo. The trouble is, of course, that every director
he works with is trying to outdo that blasted gorilla sequence.
On January 3, John Thaw moves yet another rung up the ladder of the legal
fraternity when he makes his first appearance in Kavanagh QC on ITV as a
barrister, though with a northern, working-class background.
Ted Childs, who was responsible for the Morse series, is again executive
producer, and the casts are glossy and expensive. In the opening two-hour
episode, Kavanagh's wife is played by Lisa Harrow and the housewife who
accuses a student of rape by Alison Steadman. Geraldine James is the
prosecuting counsel. Subsequent episodes will last 90 minutes; what a shame
they could not bring them down to 60.
Ever alive to the potential of an anniversary, the BBC will be marking the
tercentenary of Purcell's death with a sequence of programmes on BBC2 and
Radio 3 throughout 1995. They begin on New Year's Day with a documentary,
Henry Purcell, The English Orpheus, providing a picture of his life in the
London of Charles II, and continue on the same day with a live concert relay
from the Banqueting House, Whitehall.
The finale is 'Welcome, Welcome Glorious Morn' which Purcell wrote in 1691
for Queen Mary's birthday. Fitting that someone so involved in the
anniversary business should have his own celebrated.

THIS I CANNOT FORGET
by Anna Larina
Hutchinson
Pounds 25, 384 pages
THE AKHMATOVA JOURNALS 1938-1941
ed. by Lydia Chukovskaya
Collins
Pounds 20, 320 pages
For Russians, to mention one of the years 1937, 1938, 1939 is to evoke
pictures of arrests, tortures, and death. Anna Larina's memoirs and Lydia
Chukovskaya's journals are accounts of two who survived. At the centre of
Anna Larina's memoirs is the politician Nikolai Bukharin, a leader of the
Bolshevik party. The focus of Chukovskaya's journals is one of the most
brilliant Russian poets of the 20th century - Anna Akhmatova.
But these books are also the sagas of two women, Anna Larina and Lydia
Chukovskaya, who lived in the presence of great people and who devoted their
memories to them.
Born in 1914 and adopted by Yuri Larin, an old Bolshevik and Lenin's close
ally, Anna Larina grew up in the luxurious rooms of the Metropol Hotel, the
residence of the party elite. It was here that, at the age of 11, she wrote
her first love-letter to Nikolai Bukharin, then 41 and 'favourite of the
entire party'. Too embarrassed to deliver it herself, she gave it to a
stranger. This 'stranger' was Stalin. Nine years later Anna Larina married
Nikolai Bukharin. Three years after that, in 1937, Bukharin was arrested,
tortured and destroyed both mentally and physically. His 23-year-old wife
was also arrested and sent to the Gulag, where she spent almost 20 years.
The first few chapters of Larina's book show us camps, humiliating
interrogations and KGB cells. But her account reveals that Stalin had
decided to destroy Bukharin, one of his strongest opponents, back in 1928.
Only in 1937 had Stalin gained enough power to implement his plan. By this
stage, simply to kill Bukharin was not enough: Stalin needed a show trial.
The most powerful part of Larina's book describes the last months of
Bukharin's life in the Kremlin before his arrest. The slow and sadistic
demolition of the human will, the detailed description of the
'theatricality' of Stalin's methods of moral destruction, are more
disturbing than any of the Gulag scenes.
The book reads as though Larina is still defending Bukharin in the
interrogator's office. The western reader may 'regret Larina's loyalty to
the Bolshevik's Revolution of her childhood', writes Stephen Cohen in his
introduction. Yet the book is strikingly honest; it was written by one of
the generation of devoted idealists, and it takes us into the very depth of
a revolutionist's mentality.
In 1986 Bukharin was rehabilitated and Anna Larina was able to deliver his
letter, 'To A Future Generation of Party Leaders'. Yet his vindication did
not last long. As one of the initiators of the New Economic Policy in the
1930s, Bukharin is now blamed as a communist and one of the discredited
founders of the Socialist system in Russia.
While the court drama unfolded in the corridors of the Kremlin, in a small
flat in Leningrad Akhmatova was composing some of her most powerful poems.
Akhmatova and Lydia Chukovskaya, daughter of a famous Russian children's
poet, were brought together by the arrests of the poet's son and
Chukovskaya's husband. Since she was aware that her diary could be
confiscated at any time, most of the entries are concerned with
conversations on literary matters and the arrests are not mentioned.
Russians of this generation had to have good memories because everything
that it was unwise to write down had to be mentally recorded. Anna Larina
had memorised Bukharin's last political testament. Chukovskaya, who had a
photographic memory, recorded by heart many of Akhmatova's poems. Akhmatova
would write parts of her Requiem down on scraps of paper, and give them to
Chukovskaya to memorise. Afterwards they would be burnt. Many of these poems
are printed at the end of the book.
Akhmatova had been educated in the same prestigious lyceum as Pushkin, had
married a man who was both an officer of the White army and a brilliant
poet, and was a member of the most elite literary circles in Russia. Then,
during the 1930s, she was locked into a small room in a communal flat in
Leningrad, and denied all opportunities to write and publish. 'Her face is
grey, drawn, her feet are swollen. She does not leave the house' recorded
Chukovskaya in 1939; a sorry comparison with the portrait painted of
Akhmatova by Modigliani in Paris in 1910.
Chukovskaya's accounts do not contain horror stories about camps and
prisons, but record the doomed, paranoid atmosphere of Akhmatova's life in
Leningrad. Perhaps the poet's real name, 'Gorenko', contained a prophesy
about her tragic life: in Russian, the name contains the roots of two words
 -fire and grief.

CIRCLE OF PROTEST: POLITICAL RITUAL IN THE TIBETAN UPRISING
by Ronald D. Schwartz
Hurst &amp; Co
Pounds 12.95, 263 pages
RESISTANCE AND REFORM IN TIBET
ed. by Robert Barnett &amp; Shirin Akiner
Hurst &amp; Co
Pounds 12.95, 314 pages
China's stranglehold on Tibet, the restless Himalayan region which it
occupied in the 1950s, has tightened these last few weeks. Fierce propaganda
campaigns against the Dalai Lama took off in Lhasa last month and fresh
Chinese investment began to pour in. This is all part of China's classic
strategy of pacifying sensitive border areas with hordes of Chinese
immigrants. Beijing has updated it by adding money in the hope of swamping
disaffection with greater prosperity.
This bad news for Tibetans makes the appearance of these two excellent books
doubly welcome. Both deal with modern Tibet - modern in this context meaning
after 1970, the initial year of China's post-Cultural Revolution reform.
Both seek to explain the 1900s political protests against China by analysing
Tibetan religion and society.
Until the Chinese occupation, Tibet had been isolated and remote, ruled by
the Dalai Lama and with a unique and ancient Buddhist culture. While not
rich in the modern sense, it was easily self-supporting. In preceding
centuries it shifted in and out of Chinese influence, never (contrary to
Chinese claims) moving fully under Beijing rule. After the fall of the Qing
empire in 1911 it gained total independence.
The l950s occupation set off a series of desperate revolts. In 1959 the
Dalai Lama fled to India, and Tibet then endured almost 20 years of
oppression and hunger. In the Cultural Revolution nearly all its 13,000-plus
monasteries were destroyed and its traditional agriculture ruined. With the
reform in the late 1970s came a yearning to practice Buddhism without
constraints and a new generation of young Tibetans to protest at Chinese
rule.
Both books are indirectly the upshot of the demonstrations in Lhasa in
September-October 1987 in which the police killed and beat up a number of
participants. Schwartz, a Tibetan-speaking Canadian sociologist, arrived in
Lhasa as a tourist on October 12 that year. He found a group of foreign
travellers already collecting information to pass on to journalists and
human rights workers who were barred from Tibet. Barnett is the director of
the London-based Tibet Information Network which sprang from the same group
and now publishes documents on contemporary events in Tibet.
There are few modern book-length studies on the area and, as Tsering Shakya
points out in his introduction to Resistance and Reform in Tibet, this
absence of scholarly interest has allowed the field to be dominated by
polemics from Beijing and the exiled government.
The vacuum generated a conference at London's School of Oriental and African
Studies in 1992 (the revised papers form the backbone of the Barnett book)
and these two volumes between them go a long way towards remedying the
deficiency.
Schwartz's account is an analytical narrative of events since the 1987
protests, fleshed out with his considerable knowledge of Tibet. These
protests culminated in three days of riots in March 1989, after which
martial law was imposed on Lhasa for 13 months. Arrests and prison brutality
followed, many monks and nuns were expelled from their religious houses and
troops posted in the monasteries. Since then Lhasa has been ringed with
troops and the plain-clothes police presence on the streets has become
overwhelming.
The Barnett book deals in aspects of Tibet rather than narrative. History,
ethnicity, nationalism, religion, all figure as part of the bigger picture
it provides of Tibet's struggle for its own identity. Perhaps uniquely for a
western book on Tibet, it contains contributions from Chinese scholars.
One is Wang Xiaochang, an economist, who though he clearly respects aspects
of this Himalayan culture (unusual for a Chinese since most despise Tibetans
as savages), simply cannot understand why Tibetans do not want riches,
preferring to spend their money on renovating temples. His comment
encapsulates the yawning gulf between Chinese and Tibetan culture.
Both books reveal key facets of modern Tibet, especially the importance of
Buddhism. While urban Tibetans sometimes succumb to the blandishments of a
consumer society, in the countryside villagers rebuild monasteries with
their own funds and staff them with their sons and daughters. These young
recruits to the religious life (and not the 'Dalai clique', as the Chinese
unremittingly allege) have been the mainspring of the chiefly non-violent
protest movement.
Interesting and previously unpublished details of political intrigue in
Tibet are hinted at in these pages. These are not just a matter of Tibetan
versus Chinese, or even of who's who in the Chinese hierarchy appointed by
Beijing which is how China scholars traditionally approach Tibet. There are
key rivalries among the local Chinese military from different armies and
between Tibetans from different backgrounds. These can significantly affect
how policy is implemented.
Though still deeply Buddhist, Tibet is no longer isolated in a medieval
mindset. Voice of America now has a Tibet language broadcast and important
news like the Dalai Lama's 1989 Nobel Peace Prize travels fast. For all its
harshness, the Chinese occupation has updated attitudes. In fact its very
brutality has given Tibetans a greater sense of unity and nationalism.
Both books refrain from predicting the future. China's hard line makes it
difficult to be upbeat about autonomy for Tibet, let alone independence. The
Buddhist ethic counsels against violence and Tibet's moral weapons mean
little to Beijing. While foreign tourists - mainly young backpackers - have
immeasurably strengthened the pro-Tibet lobbies back home, there is no sign
that China plans to respond to pressure either internal or external for
greater freedoms.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Books: The myth behind those merrie men - The legend of the
quintessential outlaw, Robin Hood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AC GRAYLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBIN HOOD
by Stephen Knight
Blackwell
Pounds 45, 308 pages
Robin Hood is a fixture in the consciousness of the English-speaking world.
By a kind of Pavlovian reflex the name prompts images of Errol Flynn or - a
good deal less convincingly, because he always looked uncomfortable and
faintly surprised in his tights - television's Richard Greene. Just how
long, and in how many ways, this bow-twanging merrie man of the greenwood
has been haunting our collective imaginations is astonishing. The whole
story, myth and fact alike, is thoroughly explored by Stephen Knight in this
new study.
One of the great questions about Robin Hood is: was there actually such a
man? According to the 'empiricists' there was, and according to the
'mythicists' there was not. In the marvellously absorbing way of these
things - historical detective work beats the fictional variety by a million
miles - the answer turns out to be that there were many Robin Hoods, most of
whom were named so after the really real Robin Hood - viz. the mythical one
 -to mark their outlaw status. Or so Stephen Knight suggests, for, after a
judicious examination of the arguments, he comes down on the side of the
'mythicists' .
Robin Hood is an emblem of liberty, anti-authoritarianism, and natural
justice. He robs the rich to pay the poor; he outwits the sheriff and his
men; and lives the rural idyll with his happy band of companions (and,
later, Maid Marion). In earlier sources - chronicles, ballads and the
'performances' which were the forerunners of theatre - Robin is an outlaw,
sometimes even a 'cut-throat'.
But by the 17th century he had been gentrified: he had become the Earl of
Huntington, dispossessed of his property by a usurping king, and in revolt
not against genuine authority in the form of the absent Good King Richard,
but against the treasonous tyrant Bad King John. Thus was his outlawry made
legitimate, and the outlaw himself transformed into a suitably aristocratic
hero.
It is this good outlaw of noble birth who, along with his accretions of
Little John, Friar Tuck and Maid Marion, gives us the romantic and Hollywood
Robin we all know.
Robin Hood is now associated with Sherwood Forest or with Barnsdale (Knight
shows that this must be the Rutland, not the Yorkshire, Barnsdale), but in
the 14th century, when the legend was beginning to flourish - it reached its
apogee in the 16th century - any number of localities from the West Country
to Scotland laid claim to him. There are assorted Robin Hood Fields, Robin
Hood Crosses and Robin Hood Caves, and the ballad and chronicle sources have
him popping up in all sorts of localities. This multiplicity of place is
echoed in the multiple nature of the legend in its sources; which is why
Knight concludes that the Robin Hood story is mythic. Perhaps it became
popular because it struck a chord among people who for three centuries had
been living under foreign lords - the Normans - and were only just beginning
to regain an identity.
In the year 1213 or sometime soon after, one Robin Hood, servant to the
Abbot of Cirencester, slew a man called Ralph. Fifteen years later a
fugitive called Robert Hood was being sought in Yorkshire. In 1262 another
fugitive called William Hobehod is recorded. At the beginning of the 14th
century the surname 'Robynhod' appears in Sussex. In 1354 a man called Robin
Hood was held for trial in a prison in Rockingham Forest. And so on:
intriguing intimations - the 'empiricists' say, glimpses - of something at
the root of legend. Knight provides a chronology of references to Robin Hood
between the 13th and 17th centuries, and they show how the legend grew,
suggesting that the name Robin Hood came to stand as a pseudonym for any
outlaw, whether his real name was known or not.
In some of the earliest chronicles reference is made to the popularity of
Robin Hood among ordinary people. He became a favourite figure in
performances at fairs and festivals, often associated with Whitsun. The
gentrification of Robin from the 17th century onwards can be seen as a
characteristic English response to anything potentially threatening, as a
symbol of resistance to authority must always be: it neuters him by
domesticating him, transforming him into a safe figure who is not against
the establishment, but a true defender of it: and thus a worthy hero after
all.
Knight is as fascinating on recent Robin as he is on medieval Robin. Films,
cartoons, musicals and books have kept the outlaw firmly in popular
consciousness - as witness the fact that five Robin Hood films were made
before 1914. All these representations, Knight shows, were reinventions; yet
at the same time the majority of them preserved the kernel of the myth as it
had settled after 1600 - the gentrified Robin, the Robin of merrie men and
true justice. Perhaps, in an otherwise unbelieving age, such myths have
their place.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Books: Murder and more - Anthony Curtis concludes a two-part
look at anthologies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bernard Shaw, you will recall, divided his dramas into plays pleasant and
plays unpleasant. The same division applies nowadays to anthologies. The
unpleasant kind was put firmly on the map with The Oxford Book of Death. Now
we have The Faber Book of Murder edited by Simon Rae (Pounds 17.50, 575
pages). It proceeds alphabetically: Axe (Lizzie Borden), Cement (Doctorow's
Billy Bathgate), Dismemberment (Ian McEwan's The Innocent), Double (R L
Stevenson's Jekyll and Hyde), Garotte (Patricia Highsmith's Ripley's Game),
Hanging (Kipling's Danny Deever), Quits (Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus) and
Zarathustra (Nietzsche). And there are many more just as ugly.
'Whether we like it or not' says Rae, 'murder is a regrettable scarlet
thread running through the human tapestry'. He decided early on to spare us
'all contemporary murders of a private nature' but this does not exclude
mass murder and genocide. The book is ballasted with an extract from Freud's
Totem and Taboo and from the deliberations of De Quincey and other thinkers
who have pontificated about murder. It is, I must admit, a compilation of
undeniable fascination.
Stephen Brook has made an equally thorough trawl through the literature of
personal betrayal, sometimes in extreme cases leading to murder, in The
Penguin Book of Infidelities (Viking Pounds 17.00, 376 pages). A painful
topic makes for some entertaining reading.
On the pleasanter side of the scales, The Faber Book of The Theatre edited
by Ronald Harwood has now appeared in paperback (Pounds 8.99, 267 pages).
The well-known playwright, formerly an actor and a stage-manager, includes
some amusing extracts under the headings of Before the First Performance,
Performance and Players, After the Performance. Meanwhile the
ever-industrious Sheridan Morley has compiled The Methuen Book of Movie
Stories (Pounds 15.99, 270 pages) which contains fictional accounts of
film-making in Hollywood and elsewhere.
Anthologies are not merely aimed at the Christmas market. They burgeon all
the year round. One about to appear in the spring likely to appeal to FT
readers is The Oxford Book of Money edited by Kevin Jackson. Naturally he
quotes Oscar Wilde in the person of Lord Darlington defining a cynic as 'A
man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing'. But he also
includes the often-forgotten pay-off: 'And a sentimentalist, my dear
Darlington, is a man who sees an absurd value in everything and doesn't know
the market price of any single thing'.

MORNING GLORY: MEMOIRS FROM THE EDGE OF HISTORY
Somerset de Chair
Cassell
Pounds 20, 397 pages
Somerset de Chair, the son of Admiral Dudley de Chair, was born in 1911. At
17 he interviewed Mussolini, at 18 published a book on the future of Europe,
The Impending Storm - 'England has no need to worry for its future so long
as it can produce such a prodigy as Somerset de Chair' wrote a Hungarian
newspaper.
At 21 he married Thelma Arbuthnot (the first of his four wives), who
resembled the film star Norma Shearer: they visited Hungary, where they were
treated like royalty; at 23 he was adopted as Conservative candidate for
south-west Norfolk, and was elected the following year. On the outbreak of
war he joined the Household Cavalry, was quartered in Palestine, and was the
intelligence officer of the force that took Baghdad and, later, Palmyra, in
1941. During the latter campaign he took a bullet from a French fighter
plane through the ankle, and Morning Glory ends with him convalescing in a
hospital in Jerusalem.
This is not a new book: it was first published privately in 1988, and the
second half, describing the campaigns in the Middle East, is a reprint of
two earlier books, The Golden Carpet and The Silver Crescent. On their
appearance in 1943 these were hailed as equal to Seven Pillars of Wisdom.
Though de Chair shares some of Lawrence's characteristics - Sir Ronald
Storrs described the books as 'a pleasurably egocentric narrative of events'
 -this is an overstatement; they are, however, full of youthful vitality and
effective descriptions. Though not a regular soldier, de Chair was a
resourceful and unorthodox intelligence officer, and took iconoclastic
pleasure in the illogicalities of military life. He was particularly amused
by the fact that the RAF had mistakenly designated the municipal brothel in
Palmyra as a munitions store: 'the vicious attempts of our pilots to bomb it
were attributed by the French to jealousy or puritanical instincts.'
By contrast, the first half of Morning Glory, written much later, reads at
times like an odd blend of Dornford Yates and Frank Harris. The overblown
lyricism of the descriptions of the countryside or of the author's houses is
Yatesian; Harrisian, on the other hand, is the author's egregious
self-satisfaction, his praise of his own writings, and his frank account of
his sexual progress.
He lost his virginity at 18, not to the New York hooker he had engaged for
the purpose, but the following day, to a middle-aged Norwegian hotel maid.
As an undergraduate he would drive up to London two or three times a week in
his 1921 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost (bought for Pounds 50), to hunt for tarts.
Thelma took a dim view of this, as she did of his affair with Vivienne
Wooley-Hart (who gave a party featuring a live pink elephant), consummated
on the floor of her flat in Prince's Gate, he dressed as Lord Nelson, she in
a leopard skin. Carmen, the second wife, was more accommodating, giving him
a tart for a birthday present in Paris. But he gave tarts up after they
vanished from the streets, remarking 'I think that the decline of the
British Empire coincided with the removal of these healthy distractions from
the heart of London's West End.'

FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Revenue's error -
Briefcase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In May 1993 I was made redundant and my redundancy money was taxed via PAYE
(the excess over Pounds 30,000). In June, I applied for and received a tax
rebate as I had no intention of working for the rest of the tax year, nor
claiming unemployment benefit. In August 1994, I completed a return for the
tax year to April 1994. Recently, I received another tax rebate with my
notice of assessment. It appears that the IR did not take into account the
first tax rebate from June last year.
Am I obliged to point out this error, which is in my favour? If I do not,
what happens if or when the error is discovered?
Wilful failure to point out the over-repayment could constitute a criminal
offence under the Theft Act. The procedure for recovering over-repayments of
tax is set out in section 30 of the Taxes Management Act 1970, as amended.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Terminating a Tessa -
Briefcase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My wife and I have each substantial investments in self-select personal
equity plans and Tessas. Our wills provide for leaving our possessions to
each other. As far as our investments in Peps are concerned, which of the
following options are open to our executors:
1. To terminate the respective Pep, sell the investments and transfer the
proceeds to the beneficiary?
2. To terminate the Pep, not sell the underlying shareholdings but merely
transfer them to the beneficiary?
3. Not to terminate the Pep or the investments but to transfer the Pep (plus
underlying investments) to the Pep of the survivor, where the investments
will continue on a tax-free basis?
With Tessas, will these have to be terminated? And will the interest
credited up to the date of death be paid gross without deduction of tax,
even though the stipulated period of five years from the start of the Tessa
was not completed at the time of death?
The tax-exempt status of a Pep will terminate automatically on the death of
the plan-holder so the third option is not available to you. In theory,
options 1 and 2 both are possible, although it should be noted that the
transfer of investments or cash will be made by the plan manager to the
personal representatives of the deceased.
Many plans, however, operate on the basis that the underlying investments
will be sold automatically on death, so it is important to check the
position with the particular plan manager concerned.
Tessas also terminate automatically on death and the proceeds are paid gross
by virtue of S326A(2) ICTA 1988, providing all other conditions have been
met. (Reply by Andrew White).

FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Charity and the law -
Briefcase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Following the death of my grandfather a few years ago, a sum of money was
raised and put into a trust. This money is now being used for educational
and cultural purposes.
The trustees, of whom I am one, have been considering whether to seek
charitable status. I have read the relevant literature produced by the
Charities Commission. But I need to do further reading on the powers and
duties of trustees. Could you refer me to the standard works covering this
area of the law?
The Charities Commission produces a series of leaflets and we would
recommend Responsibility of Charity Trustees (CC3) and Investment of
Charitable Funds: Basic Principles (CC14). If these are not sufficient, the
commission also publishes a video: Charity Trustees: The Crucial Guide to
Trusteeship.
For more detailed information, you might like to consider Tolley's Charities
Manual, published by Tolley Publishing Company, 2 Addiscombe Road, Croydon
CR9 5AF as being the most comprehensive work on all aspects of the subject.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): When a gift is taxable -
Briefcase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I own a half share in a plot of land leased to a petrol company, on which it
built a petrol station 30 years ago. Eight years of the lease remain.
If I were to give my share (value Pounds 70,000) to my two nieces, would I
be liable to pay capital gains tax immediately on valuation? Or am I correct
in thinking that this can be put off so long as my nieces do not sell the
property? And is there any top limit to the value of a gift?
You can make gifts of any value without inheritance tax being payable if you
survive for seven years from the date of giving. There is no limit to
potentially-exempt transfers, which become fully exempt after seven years.
You are correct in your concern over CGT. You are gifting an investment and
CGT could be payable. It is not possible to defer tax if your nieces do not
sell the property, as it is not possible to obtain hold-over relief on the
gift of an investment.
If there is likely to be a large CGT liability, you could consider putting
the assets into a discretionary trust as a gift for the benefit of your two
nieces, so that hold-over relief is available.
While this gift would fall within your nil rate band, this band would become
available again in full after seven years. Within the next 10 years, the
assets could be transferred out of the trust to your nieces, or the trust
could be changed so that it became a life interest trust; IHT could be
avoided in this way.
I suggest, however, that you take legal advice if you wish to pursue this
matter further and contact your accountant regarding the likely CGT which
could be involved. (Reply by Barry Stillerman of accountant Stoy Hayward).

FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (International Equity Markets): Players and
stayers in a game of extremes - There was money to be made on global equity
markets for those quick on their feet, but the unwary found a multitude of
traps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is playing the markets worthwhile - or should you just get a broad spread
and stay put? Anyone investing in the World Index in January would have seen
little return from their initial stake. But an inspired trader could have
done far better. Michael Morgan's hypothetical Foresight Fund shows how an
international manager who made all the right switches would have trebled his
money.  But don't get too excited: the equally hypothetical Hindsight Fund
shows his accident-prone colleague losing almost 80 per cent of his initial
capital.
It has been the best of times, and the worst, in the world equities markets
this year.
Those able to read political runes, forecast currency movements and spot
improving economic trends found there was money to be made. But sudden and
aggressive shifts in asset allocations by some of the big global investors,
and the recurrent theme of rising US interest rates, have hovered in the
background to trap the unwary.
The Foresight Fund has, however, lived up to its name: indeed, it could not
have done better. The fund ignored the blandishments of those proffering
bonds, cash and commodities as alternative investments and remained
full-bloodedly in equities. Allocations were switched each month, with
returns calculated in dollar terms, as measured by the FT-Actuaries world
indices.
The strategy has been, quite simply, to be invested fully in the month's
best market.
JANUARY: Finland, Europe's best performer in 1993, had more miles to run as
a sharp slide in interest rates prompted a shift out of bank deposits and
into mutual funds. Optimism grew about the economic outlook, and foreigners
continued to buy as a strengthening local currency also increased
substantially the market's attraction for the dollar investor.
FEBRUARY: There was a switch to Malaysia, 1993's best market overall, as
Kuala Lumpur put in a renewed spurt after the previous month's
profit-taking.
MARCH: Hopes of a political re-birth grew in Italy as media tycoon Silvio
Berlusconi arrived on the scene ahead of the general election at the end of
the month. Enthusiasm for Italian shares seemed unbounded, with some
analysts talking in extravagant terms of the market's potential to rise.
APRIL: South Africa came into focus, also on the election theme. European
funds, which had begun flowing in after Nelson Mandela was released from
prison, were augmented by American money around the turn of the year as the
last of the US city, county and state restrictions on pension fund
investment in South Africa were lifted.
April's spurt accompanied the appearance of specialist funds for South
African investment from several leading US money managers.
MAY: Hong Kong was good value after the ravages of the early part of the
year. Worries about the health of the senior Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping,
were put aside as US and European investors returned, cheered by US interest
rate developments and plans to resume Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's
airport.
JUNE: Austria went to the polls to decide whether to join the European Union
and the market rose strongly ahead of the result, anticipating (correctly) a
'yes' vote.
JULY: Finland re-asserted its presence, powered higher by Nokia, the world's
second largest maker of mobile phones, which accounts for more than a
quarter of Helsinki's total FM180bn market capitalisation. Nokia's share
price has more than doubled this year in response to booming sales and
surging profits.
AUGU
Malaysia rallied after the declines in previous months on expectations of a
good corporate profits outlook, take-over speculation, and moves by the
central bank to spur investment, particularly by foreigners.
SEPTEMBER: Singapore had its moment of glory on the prospect of new foreign
money coming into the market in the form of Asian equity mutual funds.
OCTOBER: Finland was again the best performer.
NOVEMBER: Mexico's appearance at the top of the league table, as President
Carlos Salinas de Gotari prepared to hand over power to President-elect
Ernesto Zedillo after the election, was not so much a reflection of a strong
run in the country as an indication of poor performance elsewhere.
DECEMBER: Norway's vote against membership of the European Union at the end
of November at least dispelled one important source of uncertainty and had
been largely factored into the market already. The removal of remaining laws
discriminating against foreign shareholders was another positive factor.
Not a bad year overall, however, and as the chart (above/below) shows, each
Dollars 100 invested in January has now grown to Dollars 305.22.
Regrettably, the best that can be said for the Hindsight Fund is that it is
easy to see now where it went wrong. It has, on a monthly basis, shown an
unerring ability to select the world's worst-performing market.
JANUARY: Kuala Lumpur was the world's best market in 1993, rising by 126 per
cent. But it then fell prey to worries that it had risen too far, too fast.
Comments to this effect by Daim Zainuddin, a former finance minister, were
followed by central bank measures to sap liquidity and flush out hot money
in the banking system.
FEBRUARY: Hong Kong, the world's second-best performer in 1993,
traditionally rallies into the lunar new year, and this seemed a safe bet
again after the traumas of January when a number of US and Japanese banks
and brokers advised clients to cut their holdings. But hopes were not
fulfilled as US speculators played the futures market, destabilising the
cash markets, and worries about higher US interest rates put a cap on the
market's advances.
MARCH: Renewed life in Kuala Lumpur during February raised hopes that it
might be back on the upward path. The opposite proved true as the Pergau dam
row with Britain erupted and foreign investors again took the opportunity to
cash in some of their massive profits from 1993.
APRIL: Hong Kong took another tumble over such worries as US interest rates,
who might succeed Deng Xiaoping, the outlook for Sino-British relations, and
US renewal of most-favoured nation status for China.
MAY: Italy turned back from an eight-year high as election euphoria waned
and protracted negotiations over the composition of the new government gave
a hint of problems to come.
JUNE: Political traumas as Mexico began to prepare for August's presidential
election, on top of a sliding currency, took their toll.
JULY: Foreign investors took advantage of the strength of the yen to take
profits in Tokyo, while domestic Japanese investors worried about the
depressing effect of the high currency on the country's exporters.
AUGU
A raft of disappointing corporate results, including the 85 per cent drop in
pre-tax profits reported by Den Dansk Bank, Denmark's largest, took
Copenhagen lower.
SEPTEMBER: Weak German bonds, particularly in the second half, and the
shadow of the coming Federal election, left Frankfurt wanting.
OCTOBER: Re-evaluation of Mexico's political situation after the murder of
Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, secretary-general of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, unnerved the market early. Worse than
expected third-quarter results from Telmex, the market bellwether,
compounded the misery later.
NOVEMBER: Hong Kong started the month with its biggest one-day rise in two
months. But recurrent worries about the outlook for US interest rates, and
asset re-allocations by a number of banks and brokers, took the colony back
into negative territory.
DECEMBER: Mexico was back in the frame as the financial crisis facing the
new government intensified and the peso fell sharply, undermining the value
of any attempt at a rally by the stock market. By Thursday night, Dollars
100 invested in January was down to just Dollars 21.47.
So, what are the lessons to be learned from this year's experience? First,
that past experience really is no guide to future performance. Second,
perhaps, that while hindsight usually is beneficial, a little foresight can
prove a great deal more profitable.

<TEXT>
Pibs are the closest you can get to holding ordinary shares in a building
society. They are fixed interest securities with no redemption date - so
your capital cannot be guaranteed. You can realise your investment only by
selling them on the open market - with the chance of capital gain or loss.
They provide a relatively high yield, as the table shows. This is partly
because a building society is theoretically not obliged to pay out if doing
so would drive it into loss. Also, the market is relatively small and the
shares are not always easy to buy and sell.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: CGT indexation allowances - November
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The table shows capital gains tax indexation allowances for assets sold in
November. Multiply the original cost of the asset by the figure for the
month in which you bought it. Subtract the result from the proceeds of your
sale: the balance will be your taxable gain or loss. Suppose you bought
shares for Pounds 6,000 in November 1985 and sold them in November 1994 for
Pounds 13,000. Multiplying the original cost by the November 1985 figure of
1.519 gives a total of Pounds 9,090. Subtracting that from Pounds 13,000
gives a capital gain of Pounds 3,910 which is within the CGT allowance of
Pounds 5,800. If selling shares bought before April 6 1982, you should use
the March 1982 figure. The RPI in November 1994 was 145.3.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Gilt issues - best value v tax status
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Your capital gain on a gilt - a UK government bond - is tax free. However,
you pay tax on the interest. Therefore, gilts which deliver a higher
proportion of their total return as capital gain are more tax efficient, and
 -other things being equal - more attractive to higher rate taxpayers.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Books: Monstrous metaphors - The Frankenstein myth

<TEXT>
FRANKENSTEIN, CREATION AND MONSTROSITY
ed. by Stephen Bann
Reaktion Books
Pounds 25 (Pounds 10.50 pbk), 215 pages
Readers who have seen the Kenneth Branagh film will feel surprised and
relieved, in embarking on Frankenstein, Creation and Monstrosity, to
discover that Mary Shelley's novel and the myth that it founded can still
generate reflective, happily exploratory forms of commentary. All the
contributors, in other words, seek out complexities and eschew easy
generalisations.
Ludmilla Jordanova, for example, emphasises that Frankenstein, 'far from
being a simple, moralistic tale of masculinist, scientific overreaching', is
'a remarkably precise exploration of the internal conflicts felt by
practitioners in a variety of fields'. In locating an abnormal intensity in
Frankenstein's thirst for knowledge and devotion to secluded study, Mary
Shelley 'pointed up the importance of balancing acts, not the
unproblematically 'bad' qualities of scientists in general or of
Frankenstein in particular'. Jordanova sees Shelley's novel as participating
in a more general 'ambivalence surrounding a thirst for natural knowledge'
in early 19th century Britain; at the same time, she presents the novelist
as grasping perfectly 'the fantasies of (at least some) medical
practitioners of the time', fantasies that prompted doctors and scientists
to express themselves in the heightened language of 'sudden light', sublime
visions, and an eroticised unveiling of nature.
Many of the essays concentrate less on the creator than on the monster and
on monstrosity in general. Louis James's essay includes an entertaining
account of monsters on stage: Mary Shelley's novel was first performed as a
play in 1823, five years after its publication. James places the moment when
Frankenstein brings the monster into being in the tradition of 'the moving
statue' sculptures that come to life, as the statue of Hermione does at the
end of The Winter's Tale. Moving statues, he suggests, provide metaphors for
the power of theatre itself to combine 'intense subjective experience' with
'objective, highly stylised forms of appearance, speech and situation'.
Stephen Bann, in his introduction, firmly steers the book away from the
usual preoccupations of literary critics - Mary Shelley's troubled life, the
struggle between sublime aspiration and contented domesticity  - by touching
on some quite different early 19th century monsters: the composite creatures
that the Roman Catholic country squire and impassioned taxidermist Charles
Waterton put together out of diverse stuffed animals, adapted in some
instances to acquire human faces. Waterton provides, amusingly, a fortuitous
point of contact between the Frankenstein myth and the Dracula tradition:
during his travels in South America, he not only collected specimens as both
the raw material for monsters and for feats of taxidermy in which he sought
to shock his audience into the impression of a live animal, but displayed a
parallel fascination with vampires by habitually sticking his foot out of
his hammock in the hope that a vampire bat might bite it]
Jean Louis Schefer, in the concluding essay, establishes a more general
thematic connection between 'the two great fantastic novels': 'If the frenzy
of the test tube monster suggests that feelings have been pumped into a
creature that is not ready for them then it is also true to say that Dracula
marks the return, in a different guise, of this shattered, or unfulfilled,
state of equilibrium.' He moves on to trace links between vampire legends
and the Christian doctrine of the Eucharist: 'The resurrection of the
deceased, his presence which remains real in defiance of time, the blood of
sacrifice as a means of regeneration, the consecrated bread: all of these
themes in Bram Stoker's Dracula are present in two different ways: they are
available for sacred purposes, but also for evil ones, in a devilish form of
parody that follows the same ritual.'
Michael Fried introduces monsters of a less familiar kind: the array of half
humanised animals, gradually reverting to their bestial nature, produced by
the eponymous doctor in HG Wells's Island of Dr Moreau. He traces within
this 'scientific romance' an obsession with monstrous faces, which he sees
as characteristic of a more general recurrence of 'the disfigured, usually
upward turned face with staring but unseeing eyes' in writings that he terms
impressionist ('the practice of ten or so authors - Conrad and Kipling, for
example - working in the English language chiefly between 1890 and World War
I').
Fried pursues the role of upturned, monstrous faces as metaphors for 'those
things that, before all, actually lay before the writer's eyes: the upward
facing sheet of paper itself, in the first place blank but soon covered with
script'.
It should be clear by now that this book goes off at many tangents,
energetically taking up the themes of creation and monstrosity as a source
of productive starting points. To adopt a cinematic parallel: reading it is
more like admiring the bolt through Boris Karloff's neck than averting the
gaze from Robert de Niro's puckered scars.

IN SEARCH OF TUSITALA
by Gavin Bell
Picador
Pounds 15.99, 333 pages
THE TELLER OF TALES
by Hunter Davies
Sinclair-Stevenson
Pounds 17.99, 290 pages
Robert Louis Stevenson died 100 years ago this month, so it is no surprise
that this year has brought a batch of books by and for fans of the great
man. Two of the latest are first-person travel books 'in the steps of'
Louis, as he was called; this is certainly not a new genre, but one of the
pair - Gavin Bell's In Search of Tusitala - is almost entirely successful in
a modest, unpretentious way.
Bell is a Times foreign correspondent who took a handshake from Murdoch and
went off to the Oceania for eight months to track down the last years of his
fellow Scot. He simply tells the story of what happened to him as he
zig-zagged around the Pacific, following as precisely as possible the route
of the two South Seas voyages of RLS, his wife Fanny, his stepson and his
mother: from San Francisco to the Marquesas, the Tuamotus, Tahiti, Hawaii,
the Republic of Kiribati (which used to be called the Gilbert Islands) and,
in the end, Samoa.
'The 20th century, by and large, has not been kind to Oceania,' writes Bell
 -he had been there before and was not expecting a tropical paradise - but
he seems to have had a happy and occasionally dramatic time, which included
an erupting volcano, a visit to Father Damien's leper settlement, and a
terrifying underwater encounter with a 13-foot silver-tip shark. He recalls,
and agrees with, Stevenson's comment that among these islands he had drunk
'that warm. light vin du pays of human affection . . .'
He finishes, as all disciples must, at Vailima, the grand house (complete
with a seldom-used Scottish fireplace) where RLS spent his final
three-and-a-half years. It was derelict, forlorn, unmagical, and about to be
restored by three Mormons.
Hunter Davies gives a fuller, slightly more recent picture of Vailima, but
in other respects The Teller of Tales is a less satisfying book. He follows
Stevenson not just in the South Seas but round the world and makes a stab at
a distinctly chatty biography, while not claiming to have any particular
revelations. This style encourages him to embark on speculation, often of a
sexual bent, which rarely seems helpful: what were the marital relations of
Mr and Mrs Stevenson senior? Did 'intimacy' occur between the young boy and
his beloved nanny, Cummy (what an outrageous notion)? Did he sleep with
Fanny Sitwell? Was the second Fanny - his American wife - mad or just
menopausal? (or both, or neither?)
But the root mistake is to interleave the biographical chapters with
Davies's own 'Letters to Louis' - 'I'm writing these present-day letters
because I thought it might amuse you to hear what's been happening to some
of the places you once knew so well . . .' It is a device no doubt intended
to allow Davies to write about his own travels, but the tone is so matey, in
contrast with the sparkling brilliance of Stevenson's own letters, that it
is surely a gimmick from which his publisher might have deterred him.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Books: A suitable case for treatment? - Jackie Wullschlager
on a skewed interpretation of the life of the youngest, saddest Rossetti
sibling
</HEADLINE>

CHRISTINA ROSSETTI
by Jan Marsh
Cape
Pounds 25, 634 pages
Once upon a time there were four beautiful gifted Anglo-Italian children who
lived in a happy family in London. They grew up in great harmony, drawing
and writing precocious poems, but then suddenly they were adults and their
fates diverged.
The two boys had bright careers as a civil servant and an artist. They were
agnostic and open minded and socially popular; they had romantic
entanglements and both eventually married for love. In their forties they
earned between Pounds 800 and Pounds 2,000 a year. But the two girls stayed
at home and turned away suitors in favour of a blazing religious fervour.
One became a nun, the other looked after Mama, wrote devotional verses, and
suffered a series of nervous breakdowns and illnesses. Their annual income
rarely rose above Pounds 50.
The story of the Rossettis is a dazzling illustration of the social,
economic and emotional conditions of middle-class Victorian England, and as
fascinating a tale of family dynamics as any novel. It threads in and out of
this biography of the youngest and saddest sibling, Christina, like gold
braid, illuminating her loneliness with the lively colour of her brothers,
Dante Gabriel and William; bringing warmth into her often arid and bigoted
life.
Virginia Woolf once said that if she were bringing a case against God,
Christina Rossetti would be her first witness. Christina's pious rhapsodic
verses - the Christmas carol 'In The Bleak Midwinter' and the self-denying
funeral poem 'Remember Me' are now best known - were so popular among the
Victorians that she was a strong contender to be Poet Laureate when Tennyson
died. But her religion brought her little comfort. As Dante Gabriel's famous
portrait of her in 'Ecce Ancilla Domini' and 'The Girlhood of Mary Virgin'
suggest, she was awkward, over-serious and tormented. She slashed her arms
in frenzies of self-disgust, and she was so fanatically guilty that she
would not tread on a piece of paper in case the word God were written on it.
In a conversation about economics, she believed it blasphemous to refer to
the 'almighty dollar'.
She is not an easy focus for a biographer, and Jan Marsh has fallen into the
fatal trap of using wild speculation to make her subject seem more
appealingly contemporary. Why was Christina depressive and earnest and
secretive? she asks. Compare her with the other great Victorian writers
whose creativity came out of frustration and spiritual agony - Hopkins and
the late black sonnets, Charlotte Bronte and Villette - and the answers seem
clear: lack of opportunity, emotional and social repression, the
strangleholds of narrow moralism.
They are not enough for Marsh, however, who locates the heart of Christina's
life and work in the trendy theory of child abuse. The evidence? Afternoons
spent alone with Papa when he had lost his job and Mama went out to teach.
The result? The oppressive sexual imagery of characters like the voracious
Mouth Boy and the boys and girls studded with quills and slime in
Christina's children story Speaking Likenesses and her fairy poem 'Goblin
Market'.
If every work of literature which employed this sort of imagery were rooted
in sexual trauma, the history of literary biography would be the history of
child abuse. Both unhappy (eg Dickens) and happy (eg Nabokov) childhoods are
the vital inspiration for some of our most haunting literature. But it shows
grave critical misjudgment to interpret images and symbols as revealing of
childhood experiences in the literal way Marsh does here.
Fleshed out with quotations from contemporary abuse victims to substantiate
the unprovable, and written in thudding prose, this is a skewed biography.
Christina Rossetti died 100 years ago this month and her story is still of
historical interest; this book, with its emphasis on an obsession from 1990s
psychoanalysis, makes nonsense of the art of historical reconstruction on
which biography depends.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Books: A lust for possession - Christian Tyler falls for
Gibbon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was VS Naipaul's Mystic Masseur, I think, who bought books by the yard to
impress his visitors and - more important - to flatter himself.
You will know the feeling. It overcame me, this unworthy, guilty desire, a
couple of weeks ago when I found myself gazing at a boxed set as big as a
breeze-block in the window of Thornton's bookshop in Oxford. It was Edward
Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, the complete work in three
volumes, seductively dressed in black and white designer jackets with
chipped inscriptions and broken columns printed on the cover.
'It was at Rome on the 15th of October 1764,' wrote Gibbon, 'as I sat musing
amidst the ruins of the Capitol, while the barefooted fryars were singing
Vespers in the temple of Jupiter, that the idea of writing the decline and
fall of the City first started to my mind.'
Did I want to read Gibbon? I don't know. Like everyone else who has never
done so, I had been taught to think of him as the father of modern history
and the finest prose writer of his age. Occasionally, people would nominate
the Decline and Fall as the book to take to the desert island.
Fear of the question 'Have you read Gibbon?' has never kept me from mixing
in polite society. After all, how many people could honestly answer 'Yes'?
Did I, then, want to fill a gaping knowledge gap? Perhaps. At school we
followed the Romans up to the time of Trajan and Hadrian. The Dark Ages
remained dark and Byzantium was a brilliant blank. Nothing was allowed to
happen until the Italian Renaissance.
Also, I was conscious, standing outside that bookshop, of the youthful
pretension which in the 1970s made me collect all 11 volumes of the
definitive modern edition of Samuel Pepys's diary. They have stood,
accusingly, on the top shelf ever since.
There were any number of excuses for buying Gibbon's great tome, but no
convincing reason. It was like buying a pair of shoes without trying them
on, or an expensive wine just for the look of the label. The fact is, at
that moment, I just had to have it.
When I got the box home, I unwrapped it carefully and carried it like a baby
to the bathroom scales, proudly watching as the arrow swung over 9lbs. I
took out the three volumes, sized them up, smelt the chemical whiff of the
pages and took off the jackets to inspect the chubby black bodies beneath.
I even sampled some paragraphs, picked at random. The connoisseurs are
right. Even read silently Gibbon's sentences have a majestic rhythm, like
the gentle pounding of heavy machinery, which propels his meaning
effortlessly off the page. It is not the familiar iambic rhythm of a
Shakespeare, more the triple-time beat of Latin verse hexameters. If prose
was music, Gibbon would be a Haydn or Mozart, showing off his wit and
invention within the familiar limits of classical style.
There are two modern editions of the complete Decline and Fall on the market
now. The three-volume version is published by Allen Lane at Pounds 75, and
is edited and introduced by David Womersley. For Pounds 50 Everyman is
offering a six-volume, two-box set, a revision of its 1910 edition with an
introduction by Hugh Trevor-Roper.
The Everyman version is attractive, a bargain at the price, and a good deal
more portable than the other. But Womersley's imposing edition has the
advantage of a somewhat larger typeface, is stuffed with notes and
appendices, and includes Gibbon's own Vindication, the reply the historian
made to critics outraged by his secular account in chapters 15 and 16 of the
growth of Christianity.
Womersley's 100-page introduction, an essay on Gibbon's 'philosophic
historiography' is hard going for the inexpert and had me running for the
dictionary more than once. (Try 'stochastic' for size.) Not surprisingly,
his own writing appears to have been infected by the Gibbonian beat - not
always to good effect. But I liked his comment on Gibbon's way of life:
'Because of an amiable tendency to regard luxuries as necessities, his
expenditure comfortably exceeded his income.'
So it is the lust of possession, tempered by self-satisfaction, which has
brought me at last to the foothills of Gibbon's prose mountain. All that
remains is to climb it. I hope the view is as wonderful as they say.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Directors' dealings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIEN MACDONAL, the Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The largest transaction to be reported was in The Telegraph, writes Vivien
MacDonal of the Inside Track. Its chairman Conrad Black has carried out
transactions as Hollinger. This has meant his dealings have come, rather
unusually, under the heading of a major shareholder rather than a director.
Since the share price crashed in the summer after the cover price of the
paper had been cut, The Telegraph group has actually out-performed the
market by a margin of almost 4 per cent. Black has been buying quite
consistently at the lower price level - but he still has some way to go to
buy back the 12.5m shares he sold in May. Computer People, the company that
places information technology specialists, has been a star performer in the
market since 1992. With very little to check its progress it has seen its
share price out-perform by a factor of 144 per cent in the past twelve
months.
Much of the stock in the company is held by the directors. The largest sale
of the week was recorded when one of these directors, Anthony Lambie, sold
200,000 shares at 233p, about 10 per cent of his holding. This leaves him
with more than 1.7m shares and, given the performance, would represent a
more than reasonable profit take.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Battle of Trafalgar begins - Bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and CHRIS PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first take-over of a privatised utility began this week with Trafalgar
House's Pounds 1.25bn bid for Northern Electric, writes David Lascelles. It
should provide an interesting test for what could be a wave of take-overs
and mergers in the power sector.
Northern was quick to reject the bid as coming from 'a financially
challenged conglomerate', a reference to Trafalgar's troubled recent
history. It also said the bid consisted of 'paper of uncertain value'.
These, though, are the clashes one expects in a contested bid. Northern's
private shareholders (and there are 120,000 with fewer than 1,000 each) can
afford to wait many weeks, even months, for the smoke to clear before having
to make firm decisions.
The bid is worth Pounds 10.48 a share in cash, or slightly more in a mixture
of cash and convertible shares. The offer price is not far enough above the
price of the shares themselves (Pounds 10.06 at last night's close) to
guarantee success, but there is a long way to go.
A big question is whether the bid will be referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission where, being the first of its kind, its fate would be
hard to predict. Here, Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity
regulator, could play an important role.
He said this week that the bid raised a number of issues which he would like
to examine. At his prompting, Trafalgar has offered Pounds 20 already to
each of Northern's customers to make it more acceptable.
The government itself owns a blocking 'golden share' but this expires on
March 31 and is unlikely to play a big role in the bid (which could not be
completed much before then, anyway). Politically, however, Labour might try
to portray this as yet another bonanza for privatisation stockholders, which
could be another reason for sending it to the MMC.
Whether the debate touches on the merits of the bid itself remains to be
seen. Trafalgar is thought to be making the sally to get its hands on
Northern's strong cash flow; it has nothing special to offer managerially.
On the other hand, financial analysts feel Northern's management could do
with a bit of gingering up.
Portals, the specialist paper supplier, this week succumbed at last to the
overtures from De La Rue and accepted a Pounds 682m offer from the world's
biggest commercial bank-note printer, writes Chris Price. The move will give
De La Rue control of one of its main paper suppliers and boost its access to
Portals' customer contacts among the world's central banks.
Jeremy Marshall, De La Rue's chief executive, said: 'With Portals' paper
manufacturing and our printing expertise, the enlarged group will be able to
enjoy greater technological focus, particularly in anti-counterfeiting, and
a strengthening of customer relationships.'
The deal is expected to dilute De La Rue earnings slightly for the year to
March 31 1995, be neutral in 1995-96, and enhance earnings the year after.
De La Rue will pay Pounds 403m in cash for Portals, with the rest being
covered by a fully underwritten issue of new shares. The offer of nine
shares and Pounds 124 in cash for every 20 Portals shares values the latter
at Pounds 10.50 per share.
Portals' shareholders will be offered a full cash alternative of Pounds
10.11 1/2 a share and a mix-and-match facility.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Cadbury Schweppes - Pick of Lex /
A selection of comments from this week's FT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cadbury Schweppes is in a bind. Its trading this year has been better than
that of most food manufacturing companies, yet the immediate future looks
troubled. The shares are down almost a fifth in the past year. Investors'
concerns are understandable, if overdone. They centre on Coca-Cola Schweppes
Beverages, the UK bottling operation 51 per cent owned by Cadbury. While
this has been the motor of the group's growth in recent years, the
reliability - and, therefore, the quality of earnings - from this business
has clearly deteriorated. The culprit is the outbreak of cola wars as the
supermarkets bring out their own products in an attempt to under-cut the
traditional premium prices enjoyed by Coke. Packaging prices are rising and
next summer's weather is unlikely to be so clement as in 1994. It is, thus,
probable that CCSB's operating profits will fall sharply next year.
The impact on Cadbury's earnings per share will, however, be diluted by the
fact that CCSB is not fully-owned. Moreover, trading is strong in
confectionery, and Cadbury's earnings are likely to beat those of the sector
as a whole next year notwithstanding brokers' reduced profits forecasts. The
period of underperformance for Cadbury should be coming to an end.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): De La Rue/Portals - Pick of Lex /
A selection of comments from this week's FT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Portals' shareholders may be disappointed that its board failed to fight: a
contested take-over would probably have raised the final price paid by De La
Rue. But in an industry where customers are governments, and discretion is a
byword, the damage wreaked on both businesses during a hostile bid could
have been significant. Shareholders are being offered a fair price for a
fair business.
The rationale for combining De La Rue's printing expertise and Portals'
paper technology is impeccable. Governments are increasingly concerned about
counterfeit bank-notes. De La Rue will be able to marry the two groups'
anti-fraud technologies, offering worried customers a comprehensive service.
And Portals' paper distribution network will help De La Rue market its high
denomination, high-margin bank-notes to governments which are unwilling to
invest in expensive technology for low-volume print runs. Finally, De La Rue
will be able to market verifying machines based on paper technology to
clearers and central banks.
Fears that De La Rue is deepening its exposure to paper money, when a
cash-less society is on the horizon, are groundless. Use of cash is set to
expand rapidly in the developing world, while a cash-less first world will
remain a pipe dream in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, concerns
remain. De La Rue needs to allay fears that competing bank-note
manufacturers will be unwilling to buy paper from its new subsidiary. Given
few opportunities for cost cutting, the group will have to demonstrate the
synergies of putting the companies together are real. The acquisition is
sensible if not sensational.

selection of comments from this week's FT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rise in Glaxo's share price this week is truly astonishing. The stock is
up 8 per cent and its market capitalisation by Pounds 1.6bn. The rationale
is supposed to be the impact of a provision in Gatt that could extend by 19
months the patent life of Zantac (Glaxo's biggest drug) in the US, its
biggest market.
The market's euphoria is premature. The Gatt provision allows generic
equivalents to be sold during the period if the manufacturers make
substantial investments before June 8 next year, and if they pay the
original manufacturer a licence fee. In any case, the shares' increase is
out of proportion to any potential additional revenue, estimated at between
Pounds 500m and Pounds 900m. The accompanying, though smaller, rise in other
drugs stocks is equally bizarre. Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham are not
affected by Gatt, and Zeneca only marginally. Bristol-Myers Squibb, up 3 per
cent, may benefit from a limited extension to its largest product's patents.
But, for most other companies, the benefits, if any, will not be until the
next century, well beyond the market's normal time horizon.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Rolls-Royce/BMW - Pick of Lex / A
selection of comments from this week's FT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Both Rolls-Royce, the Vickers luxury car subsidiary, and BMW have reason to
congratulate themselves on their supply agreement. BMW has outsmarted its
rival, Mercedes-Benz, to forge a link which will considerably strengthen its
position at the very top end of the automotive market. So soon after the
Rover acquisition, it has again demonstrated its nimbleness in seizing the
strategic initiative.
For Rolls-Royce, the alliance will secure its future as an independent
company beyond the present generation of cars. Vickers has been good at
cutting Rolls-Royce's costs and improving its efficiency, but does not have
the financial clout to develop a luxury car for the next century out of its
own resources. Under the agreement, Rolls-Royce will get engines and other
components more cheaply than if it developed or made them itself, while BMW
will be able to spread the costs of producing such large engines over higher
volumes.
The deal has been done without Vickers having to cede a ha'porth of
Rolls-Royce's equity, but the question of control may in time prove an
irrelevance. In 10 years or so, the German company is likely to have made
itself indispensable to Rolls-Royce, so that BMW would be the obvious buyer
should Vickers choose to sell. In the meantime, shareholders in both
companies should benefit.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Property perks up - Pick of Lex /
A selection of comments from this week's FT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Deals by Citibank and Land Securities, and a Pounds 1.5bn institutional
offer for the Kuwait Investment Organisation's St Martins Property offshoot,
have shattered the silence of an inactive property market. They have also
given some impetus to a recovery in what has been one of the worst
performing sectors in the stock market this year. Investors are not allowing
Stanhope's problems to infect their new enthusiasm for the sector.
Nevertheless, they should not brace themselves for a re-run of 1993 when the
property sector climbed 80 per cent. Recent sales have reflected an
acceptance of lower prices, rather than an improving market. And there is
still no sign of the supposed Pounds 10bn that property agents claimed was
waiting to pour into UK property earlier this year.
There are positive signs, however. Rental growth of 4 per cent should be
achievable next year, and this will feed through into property prices. The
situation should also be helped by a return, albeit subdued, of the property
developer. This removes further supply from the market in the short term. In
the face of gradually rising property values, the sector's 20 per cent
discount to asset value should, therefore, start to dissipate. This does not
translate into a bull market: portfolio management will be the key to
increasing asset values in a low-inflation environment. Thus, performance
within the sector will be disparate, but at least the trend should start to
turn positive.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): New issues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A quiet week in the new issues market was enlivened by the news that BAS
International Holdings, a supplier of low-cost soft toys, stationery and
giftware, intends to float in the new year.
BAS, which is based in Manchester, is hoping for a market capitalisation of
between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m after its debut. It plans to raise about
Pounds 12m through the float.
The company said that the money raised will be used to fund organic growth
in the distribution business, and help finance a new regional distribution
centre in north-west England.
BAS is owned by Martin Abramson, chairman and founder, who has a 70 per cent
stake, and Tyrone Farber and Richard Rosenburg, both managing directors, who
hold 15 per cent each.
The company, which operates through four subsidiaries, had total annual
sales of around Pounds 22m and pre-tax profits for 1994 are forecast at
Pounds 2m, against Pounds 992,000.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Perspectives: A little something for the weekend - Letter
from Lagos / In Nigeria, the police use roadblocks to ensure motorists pay
their Christmas bonus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How's the weekend?' said the policeman as I wound down the window of my car
in a dark slip road lit only by the waving torches of the officers flagging
me down.
It was not the weekend, it was a Tuesday, and the policeman was not
interested in how I spent my spare time, he was asking for money.
In the month before Christmas in Nigeria this question comes any day of the
week from people who stop your car, ranging from a gate man at a carpark to
a soldier on patrol with a Kalashnikov rifle.
In many parts of the world, you can see from the tinsel in shop windows that
there are fewer than 30 shopping days to Christmas; in Nigeria you can tell
from the number of roadblocks.
Officially, the roadblocks are to stop crime. In practice, the roadblocks
are also a prime source of income for security forces whose basic salaries
are below subsistence level, that is if they have been paid at all.
Surprisingly for a military regime, even the armed forces get no pay for two
or three months at a stretch.
If confronted by armed police or soldiers, it is risky not to stop. If it is
late at night, it can be risky if you do stop: a friend was recently
attacked by a drunken policeman at a roadblock. In the daytime the police
are on the look-out for traffic offences and will jump into the car and
seize the keys or insist on being driven to 'the station' which usually
means a quiet corner where he can negotiate the 'fine'.
At most roadblocks a joke and a few words in pidgin English or a local
language, even from a foreigner, can often do the trick. Demanding your
rights gets you nowhere at all.
The seasonal message sometimes comes with as much humour as menace. 'It's
December, time for Christmas bonus,' a jovial policeman told us at a
roadblock between Lagos and Benin recently. 'We haven't had our salaries and
we have to eat,' said another.
They searched a jerry can in the car, thinking that we were illegally
carrying petrol, but found it contained water, then demanded to see the car
documents. 'No. They are all in order,' said the driver. They gave up and we
drove off. 'They are rogues, thieves,' said the driver. 'They do not stop
criminals. They take money from them as well and let them go.'
Not only professional drivers are hardened against the police. Many
Nigerians regard the spate of roadblocks with contempt. But the police do
not always get their way. Last week a friend came to see me unusually late,
even by African time. 'I'm sorry,' she said. 'I had to go to my home with
the police. They wanted the originals of my car documents. They know that no
one here carries originals, just the copies, in case of armed robbery.
'It would have been easier just to give them money, but they were so rude
and arrogant I decided not to give them anything. I told them the originals
were at my house. They got into my car, we went home and I showed them the
papers. Then they said they had no transport to get back to work and I told
them that was their own fault. I gave them nothing,' she said.
In Nigeria, cheques and credit cards are often useless: people need to carry
cash, sometimes large sums of hard currency since foreign exchange controls
were imposed this year.
A businessman taking a taxi to the airport to go on holiday was recently
stopped by the police in a dark street. 'They ordered me out of the cab and
frisked me,' he said. 'In my top pocket I had Dollars 2,000 in cash. I
refused to open the pocket so they said we would have to go to the police
station. They knew that if they delayed me long enough I would miss my
flight.
'The taxi driver and I got back in the car and as the policeman walked
around to the other side to get in, the driver put his foot down and left
him standing. I ducked my head just in case but they did not shoot at us,'
he said with a grin.
Officially, the roadblocks are increased to deal with the higher rate of
crime which is part of the run-up to Christmas. 'Our people are working
overtime and we have put administrative staff out on patrol to curb crime
and we have been successful - the crime rate is much lower than this time
last year,' said a spokesman for Lagos state police.
They are fighting an uphill battle. Last week, the spare wheel was prised
off the underside of my car in full view of six security guards outside a
'secure' block of flats. Recently, the chief of security at the British High
Commission had his car hijacked by three armed robbers.
The police are powerless to deal with these gangs, who roam Lagos at night
and attack private homes and cars, often with military precision and
automatic weapons. Sometimes the military are the source of the weapons,
particularly disgruntled soldiers returning from the war in Liberia.
In some cases, the robbers are soldiers. A senior Lagos police officer
recently told a local magazine that he had appealed to the state governor to
curb crime among the army. A sergeant earns N800 a month (worth Dollars 36
at the official exchange rate, but much less in real terms). This is less
than half the pay of many domestic servants. Yet the police can see military
personnel driving new cars that it would take more than a lifetime's salary
to buy.
The police say that they do not tolerate extortion and bribery. 'If a
policeman demands money, you should report it to us. Members of the public
are our mirror,' says a police spokesman. But the public know that the
victim of a crime can find himself arrested when reporting it if the
criminal has squared the police. Corruption in the security forces, as in
most services and professions in Nigeria, has become a way of life.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Perspectives: The plot thickens for the century's final
chapter - The novelist Ian McEwan explains how to read history like a book
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN MCEWAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Listen, my friend,' a French academic once said to me in the early 1980s,
'you are talking as if history actually happened.'
We were speaking of the Suez Crisis of 1956 which I had written about in a
film. 'But didn't it?' I said to the pitying smiles and good-natured shrugs
of a roomful of continental European critics. Did I not know, they asked,
that history was a text to be deconstructed? It had no other reality.
Ten years later, I met the same group and this time we were talking about
the fall of the Berlin Wall, which I had written about in a novel. 'You
lot,' I said, hoping to tease, 'don't believe that anything actually
happened in Berlin at all.' Once again, the same pitying smiles. Oh that] No
one believes that old stuff any more . . .
But don't mock. Fashion is the very breath of our cultural energy, and we
should no more deny it to intellectuals than we do to teenagers or dress
designers. Spawn a thousand creatures of thought, and time and usage will
select out those fittest to survive. And it is in this spirit that I want to
revive the mental miniskirt or skateboard of yesteryear and consider history
as a text.
We have all been reading an immensely long novel and though we are in the
final pages, no one quite knows how it is going to end.
Its accounts of human misery and courage make the works of Primo Levi pale;
its least unlovely characters could only be drawn by a godly Dostoyevsky; it
has moments of invention that would have made Calvino weep with envy, and it
attains peaks of tragic absurdity that would have sent Kafka cowering for
solace into the arms of his father.
The pages teem with interlacing plots in the manner of A Thousand and One
Nights and the reader has to pick a way through. Like that classic, and like
The Canterbury Tales, this book has about it a democratic plenitude because
everyone gets to tell a story. The title is a little dull, but don't be put
off; it is, after Marquez: A Hundred Years of Europe. Or shall we simply
call this novel, The Twentieth Century?
It's pretty hard to begin talking about a book this long. We all have our
favourite bits, so why not be anecdotal? Personally, I like that moment near
the beginning when the obscure young clerk with specs twirls his conceptual
lasso and binds time, matter, space and gravity into two beautiful theories
from which springs a whole new scientific paradigm.
I was on the edge of my seat for the first performance of The Rite of
Spring, and I was stirred by the tale of the young doctor who, one grey
afternoon on an Oxford running track, pushed himself to the first
four-minute mile.
In fact, if you only read the chapters on scientific discovery, artistic
expression and sporting achievement and skipped the rest, you would end the
novel beaming with pride and love for modern Europeans. What tumultuous
intellectual energy and curiosity] What humour, and brave, beautiful barings
of the soul] What physical prowess and courage] What a people]
But what you would have to skip is long, hard to read, and harder to
understand. There are world wars, slaughter, torture, induced famine, forced
migration, lies, propaganda and crazy ideologies and every cruelty and
barbarity imaginable, with corpses piled a million deep page after page.
The reader is insulted and disgusted by a mad and sickeningly repetitious
tale of frenzied genocide in central Europe, of death factories and
bureaucratic evil that seems finally to demolish his self-esteem, and cause
him to damn all modern literature as an indulgent obscenity. Are we
Europeans, with our 'Demoiselles d'Avignon', our heroic discovery of DNA,
our European Cup, truly as bad as this? If so, can we ever forgive
ourselves? And might we do it again? Troubled readers will suspect that
applauding or deploring disparate episodes will take us no nearer to an
understanding of this mighty novel. What we need is to discern the plot of
all the plots, and we could do worse than try to think of a shape.
A few years ago, when we were three-quarters of the way through, a plausible
pattern for many was in the form of a V. From the imperial certainties and
prosperity of the late 19th century, we descend into the mayhem of two world
wars, reaching rock-bottom degradation with the Holocaust; from this point,
roughly mid-century, we rise through postwar reconstruction, social
stability, the German and Italian economic miracles, the entrenchment of
liberal democracies, and European integration.
True, there are the grey tyrannies of the east, but even here optimistic
readers thought they could detect slow, if erratic, liberalisation. This
simple, satisfying plot appears triumphantly vindicated by the events
symbolised by the fall of the Berlin Wall. The second world war is finally
over. Liberal democracies are inevitable everywhere. It is the end of
history, some readers proclaimed, the end of this novel.
But unread chapters remained, and to some the V is beginning to look like a
zigzag, plunging from the peak of 1989 as the old viruses of the European
disease, frozen to inaction by the Cold War, begin to swarm back into the
bloodstream; on the fringes are racism, nationalism, xenophobia and
anti-semitism.
Among the political elites, there is a new nervousness about the European
project, and helplessness before genocide in former Yugoslavia; there is
unemployment, homelessness and recession; and everywhere that deep pessimism
and ungenerosity of spirit known as the far right.
Even as our novel squares up to its resolution, we may yet see this zigzag
transformed into an asymmetrical W, for in these days of the information
revolution we cram far more on the page, and events move quickly. Also, it
seems unlikely that the postwar generations of Europeans, with the
nightmares behind them, will easily abandon the consensual ideas that
brought them prosperity and peace.
Besides, the plots I have been talking of here belong to the mainstream of
the political culture, and there are almost certainly other grand patterns
that may turn out to be more important.
The lives of women have been transformed, as have those of many working
people. The environment has been degraded even as our anguish about it
intensifies. Our electronic machines are becoming ever more interesting. The
old are getting older, and migration is on the increase, as are
anti-rational cults and religions of all kinds, with their attendant
consolations and intolerance.
According to literary fashion, it is for every reader to deconstruct this
text. As we begin to turn to the final chapters we had better start thinking
about the reviews we will prepare, not for newspapers and journals, but for
bars, cafes, kitchens and bedrooms.
Our chosen literary form is democratic: the more we listen to the reckonings
of others, hear how they shuffle the priorities and try to see the different
shapes of plots they discern, the better we will understand for ourselves
this gigantic sprawling novel that no one can put down.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Perspectives: Delusions about charity - Truth of the Matter
/ Max Wilkinson debunks one of the most enduring fables of the season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX WILKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been called the Wenceslas myth. Right-wing politicians give it ruder
names. Modern socialists try to escape from it. Lady Thatcher battled
against it. It is an obvious fallacy. Yet we are all, at one time or
another, seduced by this powerful illusion.
The myth, as my colleague, Samuel Brittan explained*, is to believe that the
state has money to spend generously on the people's welfare. Politicians
often exploit this idea, for example by giving pensioners supplements at
Christmas.
The truth is that, unlike Wenceslas, elected governments have not a penny of
their own money to give to the poor. Governments spend other people's money,
or money obtained by forcing taxpayers into debt.
Politicians may claim to express the generous impulse of voters when they
distribute cash and benefits to the less well-off. We may heartily approve
of this; but we should never allow our rulers to assume moral superiority,
nor delude ourselves that the government can give us anything that we have
not given to it.
Wenceslas's winter walk, Brittan says, was a different matter. Like the
present Queen of England, he had money of his own to spend on castles,
trumpeters, banquets, dogs (even, had he been less saintly, on loose women
and song). So when he and his shivering page-boy took food and wine to the
poor man underneath the mountain, Wenceslas put his hand in his own pocket.
Brittan used the Wenceslas myth to explain the limits of government powers:
that 'what comes out must go in'. The puzzle is that this economic truism
has been so widely ignored and is even now considered by lecturers in some
former polytechnics to be right-wing propaganda.
But there is a greater puzzle: why does anyone admire Wenceslas for his
charitable exploit? Let us not be diverted by the 'real' history of the
10th-century Bohemian chieftain (never a king) who inspired the carol. The
question is, why should this songwriter's version of the story appeal so
strongly to western imaginations?
Consider: it was (as told) an obvious publicity stunt. A more thoughtful
Wenceslas would have sent the food to all the neighbouring poor a day or two
before the feast of Stephen. Or at least he might have taken a manservant
rather than an ill-shod page-boy. And apart from this thoughtlessness, why
did he not call the poor man into the palace kitchen when he first saw him,
rather than waiting until he had carried his bundle a league or more back to
his cottage by St Agnes' fountain?
Suppose a modern version were told of Bill Clinton, Boris Yeltsin or even
John Major. How ridiculous, the columnists would opine. The publicity people
must be completely out to lunch. And a little boy in the snow, you say? Pass
the Kleenex.
It is 'obvious' that there are better ways to help the poor than by acting
on a sudden sentimental impulse as Wenceslas did. So why do we so treasure
this myth? And resent the attempt to debunk it?
An intriguing answer is suggested by recent biological studies into the
'problem' of altruism. This old problem, simply stated, is: if we are
descended by Darwinian selection only from those who succeeded in a ruthless
struggle for survival, why does anyone give to the poor?
The good king Wenceslas types would have been eliminated thousands of
generations ago by the Joe Stalin and Adolf Hitler tendencies. A
comparatively recent insight, explained by Richard Dawkins** nearly 20 years
ago and superbly developed in a recent book by Matt Ridley***, is that
Darwinian selection does not necessarily make people selfish - just the
genes that they inherit and pass on.
Even in the rawest Darwinian world, it is now clear that total wickedness
does not pay. (Because, after the crooks have destroyed the naive altruists
they rob each other.) Computer models show that the best survival strategy
is 'do as you are done by': fight the crooks but be nice to the nice guys.
Even so, as Christopher Badcock points out in a fascinating new book****, it
will always 'pay' an individual (genetically speaking) to exploit his fellow
man if he can get away with it. Naturally, the fellow man has reacted by
evolving ways to avoid being exploited. One of these is the ability to see
through con men. But con men retaliate by evolving ever more subtle ways of
appearing plausible.
The best exploiters, says Badcock, will have been programmed genetically to
believe genuinely in their own goodness. Then they can pretend to be saintly
without betraying themselves. But since human genes are all mixed, we are
all now partly 'altruists' and partly 'exploiters' (genetically). So we all
believe in good moral behaviour for all of us. This gives us the best chance
to jump the queue.
Unfortunately, this belief makes us vulnerable to really plausible rogues,
fanatics, impenetrable con men and yes, just the kind of person who would
take a small boy on a charity walk through deep snow on a stormy night.
And if you think this is going too far, reflect that the real Vaclav
Wenceslaus killed many of his neighbours in the conquest of other tribes. He
was made a Christian saint after his murder in 929, but many whom he
converted to the God of love had been made widows by his sword.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (UK Equities - Winners and Losers):
Table-topper counts the costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON

<TEXT>
As usual, the winners and losers among smaller companies are a disparate
bunch, writes David Wighton. Top of the table in the index is Yorkshire-Tyne
Tees, a company that has hardly covered itself in glory lately.
Having bid too much to retain its ITV licence, Yorkshire's previous
management got itself into a terrible tangle by over-selling its advertising
slots. The new team has cut costs ruthlessly, but the share price reflects
hopes that the government will relax the rules that prevent Yorkshire being
acquired by another ITV company.
Shares in Greggs rose nicely after its June acquisition of the Baker's Oven
business owned by Associated British Foods; this almost doubled its size and
made it the UK's biggest retail baker.
The revival of Michael Page's fortunes was perhaps more predictable given
that its executive recruitment business is geared highly to economic cycles.
A sharp recovery in activity in the middle management market drove the
company's profits up strongly. Goode Durrant, a conglomerate which has been
focusing on its commercial vehicle and equipment hire businesses, also saw
business pick up.
Macallan-Glenlivet had less help from its markets, with sluggish growth in
whisky sales. But thanks to the continued success of The Macallan malt, the
company increased first half-profits by almost a fifth.
There were even more spectacular gains among the smallest companies. The
all-comers title goes to UAPT-Infolink, a UK credit reference company. Its
shares rose by more than 800 per cent thanks to a bidding auction which
eventually saw it acquired by Equifax, a US credit data group. The runner-up
was Hawtal Whiting, an automotive design consultant, with a rise of more
than 400 per cent. It was followed by Ransomes, which makes mowers, with an
increase of nearly 370 per cent.
Among the laggards, the best-known name is Wembley, the heavily-indebted
stadium and greyhound track operator; its shareholders now are paying for
its ill-judged acquisition spree in the late 1980s. The problems of Brown &amp;
Jackson also hit the headlines with the Poundstretcher discount store
chain's financial problems ending in a rescue by South Africa's Pepkor.
Shares in Merrydown fell flat when the cider-maker revealed its premium
brands were losing market share to cheaper rivals. Intercare saw its profits
fall by more than half, due partly to disappointing returns from ventures in
new medical products.
Not quite in the dunce's half dozen, but nearly, were GBE and Trio. GBE
International, the engineering group once known as Downiebrae, fell into
loss in the first half of the year while Trio, the money and securities
broker, saw profits halve as market activity slumped.
But investors in all these laggards can count themselves lucky compared with
Colorgen, a US-based manufacturer of colour-matching equipment with shares
traded on the USM. The company's bank called in its loan in July, and the
business had to be sold at a knock-down price. Shareholders were left with
nothing.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (UK Equities - Winners and Losers): Famine
follows a market feast - It has been hard to avoid losing money this year.
David Wighton looks at some sectors that bucked the trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON

<TEXT>
After three years of plenty came the famine. Between the beginning of 1991
and the end of 1993, UK share prices rose by more than 60 per cent. It was
hard not to make money in the stock market. In 1994, it was hard not to lose
it.
Even those shares that did well showed dramatically lower gains than in the
previous year. In 1993, four members of the FT-SE 100 index more than
doubled. In 1994, only one rose by more than 20 per cent.
The fate of particular sectors also contrasted sharply with 1993, reflecting
the (for the UK) unusual character of the economic recovery. While
industrial profits have risen sharply, companies closest to the consumer
have struggled, particularly those related to the still stagnant housing
market. So, general retailers and building merchants languished, while
engineers and paper and packaging companies did much better.
The strong showing of the latter sector illustrated the importance of
another of the year's trends - rising prices for raw materials. Many
manufacturing companies saw such costs increase alarmingly but had
difficulty raising their own prices in the new, low-inflation world. As a
result, many had their margins squeezed. But paper and packaging companies -
including Bowater, the sector's largest constituent - managed to pass on
most of the increased costs to their customers.
De La Rue, the bank-note printer, also had a good year and gave the sector
another boost before Christmas with its bid for Portals, which makes paper
for the notes. Portals' shares took the top spot in the FT-SE Mid-250 index
(the companies ranked from 101 to 350 in terms of stock market value).
One of the companies responsible for other manufacturers' higher raw
material costs is British Steel, which is surging back into profit helped by
a string of price increases. Metal ore prices also rose, pushing the mineral
extraction sector up the table.
The oil price improved over the year, too, helping the exploration and
production companies, while the integrated companies like BP also saw
recovery in their chemicals operations. BP capped a good year by regaining
its position as the UK's most valuable company.
While British Steel's top placing represents the continuation of a strong
run - it was the Footsie number two last year - others have seen a sharp
reversal in fortunes. In 1993, shares in leading supermarket chains tumbled
on fears of an escalating price war. But Sainsbury and Tesco seem to have
held off the discounters' assault this year and the shares have staged a
strong comeback. Tesco, which was six from bottom in the Footsie in 1993, is
fifth from the top this year, with Asda fourth.
The pharmaceuticals companies also had a much better year, with SmithKline
Beecham enjoying a particularly good run. Passing them on the way down were
the commercial property companies, which won prizes in 1993 but languished
near the bottom of the class this year.
Another fallen star is HSBC (the Hongkong and Midland Bank group) which, on
top of the general fall in world bond markets, has been hit by the slump in
the Hong Kong stock market. So, too, has Cable &amp; Wireless, which gets the
bulk of its profits from its stake in Hongkong Telecom; while C&amp;W's Mercury
subsidiary has seen profits dip due to competition from BT and other new
entrants into the UK telecom market.
Given the sharply higher profits being reported by UK insurance companies,
the poor performance of their shares might seem odd. Both Guardian Royal
Exchange and General Accident were in the last 10 of the Footsie, and the
sector was second from bottom.
As usual, the stock market is looking ahead. Investors in the sector are
worried about the impact of low-cost direct insurance operators on the
established companies, while life and pensions business is expected to be
hit by regulatory changes. At the same time, the companies' investment
returns will be hit by lower share and bond prices.
Shares in BAT Industries, which constitute the bulk of the tobacco sector,
were affected because of the group's insurance companies as well as the
regulatory and legal threats to its US tobacco business. But the regional
electricity companies had another good year thanks to a friendly regulatory
review of Trafalgar House's bid for Northern Electric. Eastern took the
sixth spot in the Footsie.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Perspectives: Seasonal sweatshop greetings - Letter from
China / From Shanghai to Shenzen, lowly-paid workers are producing
decorations for the west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is nothing sacred? Chinese entrepreneurs have gone into business producing
Father Christmasses with both Oriental and Caucasian features for the local
and international markets.
According to Xia Jinglan, the sales agent in Beijing for Xianfeng, one of
the manufacturers based in China's southern Fujian province, 'western'
Father Christmasses have bigger noses, deeper eye sockets and a sterner
visage, while their Chinese counterparts appear more benevolent with
rounder, happier, less threatening oriental features.
'When we think of an occasion like Christmas,' she says, 'we imagine our own
symbols of happiness like a plump, smiling baby carrying a big fish at
Spring Festival.'
Generations of children in the west might not agree with the Chinese
perception of a sterner, gruffer Santa Claus, but increasingly they are
being exposed to Christmas ornaments and decorations, including the
ubiquitous Saint Nicholas (or is it Nicolas) himself, carrying the 'Made in
China' label.
At hundreds, if not thousands, of sweatshops in China's southern regions
from Shanghai to Shenzen, the economic zone adjacent to Hong Kong,
lowly-paid workers, most of whom know nothing of the Christmas story, are
producing what are called 'seasonal' items for a huge western market.
In the Baoan district near the Hong Kong boundary, which has emerged as the
headquarters in China of the Christmas-decoration trade, there are more than
200 factories making gifts mainly for North American consumers. No reliable
statistics are available as to the sheer volume of Chinese output of
so-called 'seasonal' products, but according to Tony Cheng, the Taiwanese
owner of Delta Smooth Ltd, which manufactures poly-resin items, China
supplies 'at least' 50 per cent of the Dollars 2bn US market for such
festivals as Christmas, Hallowe'en, and Thanksgiving.
Much of that production comes from a tangle of anonymous grey structures in
the muddy streets and alleys of Baoan which has proved a magnet for hundreds
of thousands of workers from China's impoverished hinterland, including
particularly the provinces of Hunan and Sichuan.
It requires a considerable leap of imagination to make the connection
between these dank and depressing surroundings and the perfumed counters of
top department stores where some of these escapist products are destined for
the pleasure of middle America.
Gaily-painted glass-domed musical boxes with nativity scenes and fake
swirling snow could hardly contrast more sharply with the 19th century
'workhouse' surroundings in which they are produced. The Yuletide spirit
evoked by tinny-sounding tunes such as 'We wish You a Merry Christmas' could
not be further removed from the experience of the country waifs who work
10-hour shifts moulding and painting these items.
But to local officials, such as the deputy party boss of Songgan township in
Baoan country, there is no 'contradiction' involved in the world's largest
atheistic state producing items for religious festivals: after all,
'business is business'.
'We don't care about this religion or that religion. We only care about
production,' says Yang Bateng. 'We don't produce these souvenirs for
Christianity, we make them for business sake.'
So the manufacture of souvenirs continues around the clock in Baoan, a huge
outpouring that is flooding western consumer markets in a rising tide of
seasonal kitsch, mass-produced at an unbelievably low cost. Cheng's business
is a perfect example of the explosive growth in Chinese souvenir trade. He
established his factory in 1989 with a staff of about 200. Five years later,
he is employing 1,100 and is about to open a third enterprise - in Shanghai
 -to produce 'high tech' items.
He has invested Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) in his business and is planning
a further Dollars 1m investment. In his first year of operation he shipped
Dollars 1.5m worth of goods, mostly to the American market, and this year
expects exports to reach Dollars 12m. Production in 1994 includes 1m Santa
Clauses based on more than 50 different designs, including an improbable
Santa armed not with a stave, but with a baseball bat.
'Every day, almost, we have a new item. That's how we survive here.
Otherwise we would have to compete on price, and that's very difficult,' he
says, in a reception area dominated by an incense-burning Buddhist shrine
and a wall-slogan that reads: 'To attract fortune and expel ghosts.'
Cheng's experience is, in a way, revealing of the difficulties of doing
business in China . . . and also the rewards. In the past year dozens of
local Chinese enterprises have begun producing seasonal decorations,
including counterfeit copies of Delta Smooth's own designs: such is the
cut-throat nature of business in China these days.
But Cheng is not complaining. With labour costs in Baoan a fraction of those
in Taiwan, labour-intensive activities are proving a winner for early
entrants to the field, although costs are rising. Wages have shot up by 35
to 40 per cent in the past year, but still remain about one-tenth of those
paid in Taiwan.
Incredibly, low labour costs also proved enticing for the Tung Tat
Electrical Co of Hong Kong which, in 1988, established a factory producing
Christmas lights for the international market with an initial workforce of
70, now grown to 700.
Again no reliable statistics are available, but China's production of 'fairy
lights' accounts for at least 50 per cent of the world market, and Tung Tat
is merely one of dozens of such factories churning out lights of various
shapes and sizes to satisfy the fantasies of western consumers.
Luk Yeuk Chun, one of those producing decorations in Songgan, says: 'There's
money in Buddhism, too. Any religious belief can generate good business.'
On the Tung Tat production lines, where young men and women, many still in
their teens, fashion strings of lights from bits of wire and glass,
questions about Christmas drew blank looks. Miss Song, a 19-year-old from
Guangdong province, who has been working in the factory for more than a
year, said simply: 'I heard it was somebody's birthday.'
But ignorance at the shop-floor level of Christmas is not preventing more
affluent Chinese consumers in the larger cities and towns from beginning to
'celebrate' the Christian festival in increasing numbers. Many shops
throughout China now adorn their windows with Christmas decorations and the
sound of Christmas carols wafts through the interiors of some of the smarter
emporiums to encourage a buying mood, as in the west.
At the Yaohan department store, on Beijing's main boulevard, business around
the Christmas decoration counter is brisk with smartly-dressed young Chinese
buying baubles, tinsel and Santa Clauses of various sizes and shapes to
decorate Christmas trees at home. One door-knob decoration improbably
invited purchasers to buy it so they could offer their friends a 'jingly,
Kris-Kringly welcome'.
Liu Fang, an employee of a joint venture company, is typical of a growing
number of Chinese consumers who seem prepared these days to embrace almost
any new fad, or fashion, especially if it has a western flavour. 'More and
more of us are celebrating western festivals,' she said, 'like Christmas,
Valentine's Day and Thanksgiving. This is partly because many of our friends
have spent time in foreign countries and we are associating more with
foreigners.'
Christmas western-style is also infecting the very young. Among children
clustering around the Christmas decoration counter at the Yaohan store was a
young man who said that his parents had for the past several years put
presents in a stocking at the end of his bed. He also revealed that 'when I
was very little I saw Father Christmas once . . . and he was a foreigner'.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Perspectives: A whiff of sanity in the trenches - Alasdair
Steven recounts a wartime outbreak of goodwill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASDAIR STEVEN

<TEXT>
It is 80 years since the momentous first Christmas of the Great War. When
Tommy and Jerry stopped sniping at each other, met in the middle of No Man's
Land and played football. A simple act but one that was never repeated and
caused consternation among the High Commands.
Over that festive period, amid the carnage, mud, barbed wire and rotting
corpses, sanity prevailed for a flickering moment.
Christmas 1914 was always meant to be historic. The German troops had been
told at the outbreak of war in August that they would be home 'before the
leaves fell'. The British that they would be home by Christmas.
Disillusionment and homesickness were setting in in those inhospitable
freezing trenches. The ghastly reality of unrelenting savage war was
begining to dawn.
Accounts differ. But what is not in doubt is that on those barren flat
fields close to Ypres, in the north of France, the soldiers of the two sides
met and shook hands.
In The Times there are letters from officers in the field saying that
'everything on Christmas Eve was dead, even our own pet sniper who normally
sends over a good-night kiss at 9.15. Someone came running along the line
and announced a truce had broken out.'
Just how did such a thing happen? A graphic account in the Illustrated
London News suggests that a German soldier walked through the lines bearing
a Christmas tree. 'He invited the troops to go over and have a smoke and a
palaver; with one accord a truce for the night was signed. The compliments
of the season were passed with much enthusiasm between friend and foe.'
That story owes, perhaps, a certain amount to journalistic colouring. The
accepted and authentic story goes thus: the lines at Ypres were only 25
yards apart. From the German lines came the strains of Stille Hacht, Heilige
Nacht. The Germans shouted at the end: 'Come on Tommy, it's your turn now.'
The British replied first with The First Nowell and then a rousing account
of O Come All Ye Faithful. The Germans followed with Adeste Fidelis.
The soldiers from both sides huddled in their trenches desperately trying to
keep warm. The North Sea is only a few miles away and the winds blow around
Ypres and the surrounding countryside with an icy rawness. Arctic squalls
make a visit to a place such as Hill 60, close to the scene of the 1914
meeting, a chilling experience.
Through this bleak mid-winter a German called out: 'Come on Tommy, stand
up.' No Briton dared move. Snipers were about. The war was still very much
on. No Christmas truce had been intimated.
Then the British soldiers spotted a German silhouetted against the wintry
sky approaching singing a solo of Stille Nacht. Slowly, and with
understandable caution, both sides slowly crept over their trenches. With
mounting emotion this motley collection of foes met amid the shell holes and
craters.
Both sides were suspicious from the outset. Was it a trick dreamt up by
Jerry? Suddenly there was chatter and laughter. People embraced, cigars were
exchanged and jokes made. Tommies larked around in Jerry's Pickelhaube, the
German spiked helmet, and photos were taken of stern officers and men not
quite knowing how to look. But in the gruff, heavily-moustached faces there
is evidence of a smile. The eyes look relieved and at peace.
A young German who had been to university in America did the translation. A
German lieutenant asked a rather stuffy British major if he would send a
photograph of himself to his sister in Liverpool.
The weird truce spread along the line for about two miles. A surreal
atmosphere hung over those windswept acres.
And yes, a football match was played. At first with a tin can, then a proper
ball was found. Jackets and scarves were used for goal posts and 'the Saxons
beat the Anglo-Saxons 3-2'.
The dead of both sides were buried with padres from each nation assisting at
the service.
There was even a local rule agreed: 'If by any mischance a single shot had
been fired it was not to be taken as an act of war and an apology would be
accepted. Firing would not be opened without due warning on both sides.'
The report in The Times ended rather colourfully with a grand overall
picture of the incredible sight: 'There were so many lights that it looked
like Henley Royal Regatta on a Saturday night.'
In certain places the truce lasted until new year. The Highland Light
Infantry were settling down to celebrate the serious matter of the new year
when a German popped his head round their dugout and wished them all a happy
day: 'We told him amidst much laughter that we were at war with him and he
must play the game and pretend to fight.'
But the High Commands were furious. Central to the British war offensive was
the belief that the Hun was an evil beast. If the ordinary British soldier
started thinking otherwise he would automatically lose his will to fight and
kill. A letter from a sub-lieutenant to his mother in Birmingham bears this
out.
'It was amazing to realise,' he wrote, 'that the Germans were rather cheery
characters, it seems silly to be fighting them.'
Any further fraternisation with the enemy was banned. Indeed two British
officers tried to repeat the experience the following year and were
court-martialled.
Today the truce of Christmas 1914 is one of the few attractive memories of
the war. An oasis of sanity among four years of slaughter and misery.
Strangely, the papers of the day were remarkably cool about reporting the
event. In The Times, among the (horrifying) list of deaths and the
advertisements for Harrods Sale (corsets on special offer at 13s9d) and a
full-page Horlicks advertisement (at 1s6d invaluable for a genuine soldier)
there are about half a dozen reports on the dash for peace at Ypres.
But Christmas 1914 proved the compassion of the ordinary man. With
unremitting turbulence and death scattered all about him the human spirit
proved indomitable.
If only the High Commands had listened to Tommy and Jerry the history of the
the 20th century might have been very different.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Perspectives: Christianity's cost-benefit analysis - As They
Say in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In western Europe at this time of year, it is not unusual for politicians to
try to square their practices and beliefs with those of Christianity. But
their audience does not easily detect a specifically Christian heritage and
rarely demands it. In Germany, political parties maintain the adjective;
elsewhere, it has fallen by the wayside through irrelevance or corruption.
The New Testament provides an ambiguous guide to what is the 'right' form of
social organisation. In one parable, chaps get the same payment for working
for an hour as others do for a day. In another, the shrewd investor of his
master's money is rewarded with extra prizes, whereas the man who merely
ensures the capital value stays intact is treated as a wastrel. It is not
clear from such examples if one should prefer a corporatist egalitarianism
or a devil-take-the-hindmost capitalism.
Then we have the endless repetition of the saying: 'To him that hath shall
be given.' This normally is used in a fatalistic manner - when millionaires
win the lottery, for example, or bosses receive huge pay increases.
The contrasting traditions of political Christianity are, in fact, reflected
in the American and the European way. The most powerful religious force in
the US seems to reject any element whatever of social responsibility except
in the spreading-the-gospel sense.
The good Samaritan is entitled to give a helping hand to the man beaten up
by the lynch mob (although, in the Bible belt, helping the lynch mob has
been the traditional obligation), but he would not want his tax dollars used
for such support. The Christian right rarely puts forward any social policy
beyond individual redemption.
In Europe, the welfare state has been as much the product of the pulpit as
of the political party. Many Christian politicians have seen it as a way to
express their view of social morality in a secular world while still
maintaining a religious thread.
The welfare state emerged as the charitable obligation of the well-off
Englishman who believed that his privileges had to be paid for, through his
own and other people's taxes. It was the preferred instrument of left-wing
Catholics, such as Charles Peguy or Jacques Delors, who saw society as
weighted permanently against the under-privileged.
In western Europe, the ideology of the welfare state has, over decades, been
subject to the same rise and fall that characterised the history of
Christianity. It was the shared, universal faith, but is no more. It acted
as a form of social cement, but now is just as likely to exacerbate social
division. Its decline started when people asked: 'What's in it for me?'
Those who work in the caring services were once a kind of priesthood; now,
only medical staff enjoy the same prestige.
The welfare state seemed to guarantee a stable and even dynamic society;
today, it is compared unfavourably with the anti-welfare practices of east
Asia and even the US. Its opponents argue that extensive benefits for the
unemployed mean high levels of unemployment which, in turn, creates a
thriftless and potentially unstable class.
Providing generous old-age pensions creates benefits for those who do not
bother to make due provision for themselves, who fail to make their talent
fructify. Even in Sweden, many have come to see the welfare state as the
motor of economic decline, budgetary chaos and financial instability.
Yet, in the European mind it holds sway. Most remain true believers and
resist government attempts to shrink welfare. The problem is that, like
Christianity, it was meant to include everybody. Every citizen in many
countries is born into the welfare state and still is a beneficiary to a
greater or lesser extent. It even fulfils the demand that to him that hath,
shall be given.
Today, in Britain, the talk is of 'targeting' benefits. But once the welfare
state is turned into the property of the poor and underprivileged alone, it
will lose its popularity - and that will augur its demise. If middle-class
taxes are paid into welfare funds that work exclusively for the benefit of
other groups, the system will die in a tax revolt.
It is instructive to see why there is no such revolt in the most
heavily-taxed nation in Europe: every Dane employed in the private sector
pays out huge sums out in taxes, then sees their partner get it back in
unemployment pay or an equally highly-taxed state wage.
The system works in Denmark because every cost is seen as a benefit; in
Britain, every benefit is a cost. Like Christianity, the welfare state will
survive where individuals welcome its obligations in the firm belief that
sacrifice today brings its rewards tomorrow.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): It was the week before Christmas .
. . - Wall Street / . . . and usually nothing stirs. This year has been
different
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The week before Christmas is usually one of the quietest trading periods on
Wall Street. From Monday on, business winds down rapidly as investors and
dealers tidy up their books ahead of the holiday and Christmas shopping
trips, office parties (and office party hangovers) take their toll on both
enthusiasm and trading volumes.
Not this week, however. Since Monday, the stock market has been buffetted by
(in chronological order): the fall-out from last Friday's record-breaking
'triple-witching' session; Intel's hamfisted handling of the flawed chip
fiasco; Microsoft's announcement of yet another delay in the introduction of
the new version of its Windows software; a Federal Reserve open market
committee meeting; chaos in Latin American debt and equity markets; growing
concerns about Russian military intervention in the breakaway republic of
Chechnya; and, just to top it all, a firebomb explosion at a subway station
in the financial district which revived memories of the devastating bombing
of the World Trade Centre in 1992.
All in all, a pretty lively pre-Christmas week, and the fact that the market
managed to come out of it ahead was a testament to the power of this year's
belated December rally.
Some of the credit for the gains should go to the Fed, which decided at its
open market committee meeting on Tuesday not to raise interest rates one
more time in 1994. Although the decision to keep rates unchanged was
expected, investors were still relieved. It looks as if the market has six
weeks of breathing space before the Fed's policy makers next sit down to
discuss interest rates, six weeks in which investors can try to build on the
modest, but seemingly solid, gains of the past 14 days.
The chances of the rates going up early next year, however, remain strong.
Judging by the statistics released this week, the economy is still growing
at an impressive - and potentially inflationary - clip. Data on durable
goods orders, consumer spending, and merchandise trade all painted the
picture of an economy in robust health. The trade figures were particularly
revealing. In November, the deficit widened to Dollars 10.14bn (the second
largest ever) because of a sharp drop in exports and a big jump in imports,
which totalled a record Dollars 70bn.
Although imports have been rising sharply for most of the year, there is no
sign yet that this is having much of an effect on inflation. At some point,
however, analysts expect import growth to fuel inflation - most likely early
next year. This expectation, plus the fact that the widening deficit only
adds to the downward pressure on the dollar, increases the chances for
another monetary policy tightening in late January or early February.
Yet, for now, investors appear content to put their interest rate fears to
one side. While the Dow posted declines on Monday and Tuesday this week,
most of the selling was attributed to a technical follow-through from
Friday, when massive buying related to 'triple-witching' (the simultaneous
expiration of various stock options and futures) boosted share prices and
lifted volume close to record levels.
By Wednesday, the December rally was back on track, and the Dow broke above
3,800 for the first time in more than a month. Some of the credit for the
gains went to the technology sector, where stocks continued to rally in the
wake of Intel's decision to finally get to grips with the problem of its
faulty Pentium chips. After stalling for several weeks, the company
announced on Tuesday that it would, after all, replace the flawed chips for
customers - free of charge, and no questions asked.
The decision helped Intel's share price rebound strongly from last week's
losses, and prompted a sector-wide rally that was vigorous enough to lift
shares in Microsoft, even though the software giant was still suffering
negative publicity following its announcement that the release of Windows 95
 -the keenly-awaited new version of its best-selling program - will be
delayed yet again, possibly until as late as next August.
By Thursday, external political events were weighing on investors' minds.
Although the escalating conflict between Russia and Chechnya was troubling,
it was still too distant and too small to frighten the market. Of more
immediate, and local, concern was the financial crisis in Mexico, where the
peso's woes sparked a devaluation, then flotation, of the currency, followed
by a sharp sell-off in Latin American bond markets.
Yet, the implications of Mexico's money problems were not entirely negative
for US stocks. While the shares of big US banks with significant business
interests south of the border suffered, and the ADRs (American depositary
receipts) of Mexican companies took a predictable beating, the rest of the
market held up well, with analysts proclaiming that the turmoil in Latin
American markets would persuade international investors to redirect some of
their capital to the relatively safe haven of US stocks.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Brewers droop and spirits are
lower, too - Drink / But prospects for the industry over the next year are
far from gloomy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the volume of drinks sent, received and consumed by the City at this
time of year, it is no surprise that the beer and spirits indices normally
outperform the market in November and December. After all, the upsurge of
activity must be benefitting somebody's bottom line, personal or corporate.
This year, though, they have not - for only the second time since the 1987
crash. Since November 1, the breweries sector of the FT-SE Actuaries
All-Share index is down 1.5 per cent against the market and the spirits
sector is down 3.4 per cent.
The problem with spirits was clear from the recent results of Guinness,
Grand Metropolitan and Allied Domecq, the three largest spirits groups in
the world. Slow economic recovery in many of their country markets makes it
very hard for them to raise volume and prices.
Analysts also had some specific niggles with Grand Met and Allied when
results fell short of forecasts, and many downgraded their estimates for
this year.
The case of the drooping beer index is a little harder to fathom. For the
first time since the recession, brewers and pub owners expressed some modest
confidence as they announced their results over the past month. Profits
matched forecasts and analysts nudged up their estimates.
An unexpected excise duty increase in chancellor Kenneth Clarke's
mini-Budget soured investor sentiment, but the index's weakness is more
relative than absolute. Brewers' earnings will grow this year, but probably
at a slower rate than earnings of the overall market. Yet, the sector is
still on a prospective market rating and is, relatively, a touch too
expensive.
All the medium-term trends for brewers and publicans are still at work: beer
volume will be down about 1 per cent this year; premium brands and cask ales
are growing strongly; people are drinking less in pubs and more at home;
trade discounting is deep and widespread; and pubs that push food and
amenities are increasing their trade.
Some of those factors came through strongly in the results. Good summer
weather in parts of the UK stimulated beer sales and many brewers said the
upturn continued during the autumn.
Premium brands proved particularly strong for Whitbread. Its sales of
Heineken Export, Stella Artois, Boddingtons and Murphy's showed percentage
growth in the teens for the six months to end-August.
The best news on pubs came from Scottish &amp; Newcastle, which has reaped more
than expected from its Pounds 703m acquisition last year of the Chef &amp;
Brewer chain. But its plans to spend even more on developing its various pub
formats, mirrored by many other companies' plans, raises an awkward question
for the sector. Is too much money chasing the same development sites and pub
themes?
'Its quite frightening that everybody seems to have read the same Henley
Centre report on eating out,' says one analyst. If any of the forecasts are
slightly wrong, a lot of people will be caught out.
Differentiating its own brands of, say, food-serving pubs from those of a
rival will be a challenge for any of the brewers. Whitbread is acknowledged
as the best at the game, and Bass the one with the most still to do to
segment its estate into brands.
Picking a beer stock is a matter of taste. Whitbread has the proven record
in premium beers and pub branding, but its price reflects that. Scottish &amp;
Newcastle offers growth from its pubs and leisure interests. Bass is the
biggest gamble, while Greene King is the regional brewer recovering from the
lowest base.
Similarly, the choice varies among the spirits stocks, although none looks
alluring given their modest earnings outlook. But when volumes and prices do
begin to rise, perhaps late next year, the effect on profits will be
dramatic.
One leading analyst estimates that a 1 per cent rise in prices adds Pounds
20m to the pre-tax profits of Guinness, while 1 per cent on volume adds
Pounds 13m.
Of the three companies, Guinness has the best array of premium brands should
drinkers start to move back up market. Moreover, its beer profits exceed
those of Bass, Scottish &amp; Newcastle and Whitbread combined.
Allied Domecq, hurt by a Mexican downturn in its latest results, will take
time to derive benefits from its purchase of Domecq, a leading Spanish and
Latin American spirits producer. But, of the three, it is the most narrowly
focused on spirits.
Grand Met's spirits division, IDV, needs a long list of minor repairs and
renovations, judging by the omnibus re-structuring charge the group has just
taken. And it is still trying to plug the gap left by losing the Absolut
vodka franchise in the US.
For any investor spoilt by the choice of drink stocks, perhaps the best
approach would be to try the products of each company over the next 10 days
 -in moderation, of course.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Stop, proceed with caution - Diary
of a Private Investor / Kevin Goldstein-Jackson explains his share warning
system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The alarm sounded. I raced upstairs to find my Market Eye prices screen
showing that shares in one of the companies in which I had invested had
fallen to my stop-loss level, so triggering the warning. What should I do?
Some people regard their stop-loss level as the price at which they must
sell, if only to protect themselves against a further fall. I regard the
alarm as a reason to think more seriously about the future for the shares
concerned. I ask myself: is the fall just a temporary blip?
After all, I do not wish to incur dealing costs by selling, only to pay more
to buy back the shares a week or so later when market confidence in the
company has returned. In any case, I tend to be a longer-term investor,
holding on and riding out what I hope will be minor setbacks - although, in
the event of really bad news, I am prepared to sell immediately.
So, on hearing the alarm, I investigate immediately what has caused the
share price fall? I look at the Shares on the Move and announcements pages
on Market Eye and scan the teletext financial pages on BBC and Channel 4.
I am particularly wary of companies issuing profits warnings unexpectedly,
especially if they have produced a recent interim or annual results
statement in which everything appeared to be progressing well. Why did the
company not foresee the downturn in trade or other event that compelled it
to issue the warning?
The advantage of the Market Eye service is that it uses 'real-time' prices
direct from the stock exchange, so it is possible to see movements as they
happen. The problem is that a company's shares sometimes can fall so fast
that, by the time I have telephoned my broker, they have dropped below my
stop-loss level.
This year, there seems to have been an exceptional number of sharp price
movements in shares of individual companies. One was Silentnight: in March,
its shares dropped by 18p in a day because of a profits warning.
Fortunately, I did not have any Silentnight shares - but I did see my
pension fund's holding in OIS International drop by 18p in a day because of
a profits warning in July.
A stop-loss system is particularly useful in protecting against shares that
rise one day, fall another, then rise and fall again regularly - but with
each fall being greater than the rise. In such a case, it is all too easy to
lose track of the fact that, overall, the shares are on a downwards trend.
This is especially important with a widely-spread portfolio where it is
difficult to remember exactly all the details of every share: original
purchase price, pattern of trading and so on.
Market Eye recently has launched a service in which real-time share price
information can be imported automatically into spreadsheets, technical
analysis and charting programmes on personal computers. An investor can
create his own alarm system which could be activated because of particular
patterns in the price movements of an individual company, or even a sector
as a whole.
The problem still remains, however, that most people are like me: they have
neither the time nor inclination to sit at home watching a share price
screen or waiting for an alarm to sound. It is all too likely that the alarm
will go off when the investor is out at work, walking on the beach or
travelling overseas.
I asked the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and
Stockbrokers if it had a list of brokers who might be able to operate a
simple stop-loss system on behalf of a private client. It could not help.
Even Fidelity, a large execution-only broker, offers a stop-loss service
only for US shares.
Private investors must be especially careful in order to protect the value
of their investments in a jittery market. In my case, I have stuck to the
top of my Market Eye screen the details of what my holdings cost and the
expected dates for each company to announce results.
Every Saturday, I look at the Results Due columns in the FT to check that
these dates have not been brought forward (or put back). A delayed
announcement could be a warning signal.
On a results day for one of my holdings, I try to ensure that, if I am not
at home, someone looks at the screen and the teletext services and tries to
contact me if there is any unexpectedly bad news.
Recently, I re-adjusted all the price limits held on my portfolio pages on
Market Eye. The alarm now sounds when the share price approaches my 'sell'
level, rather than when it actually reaches it. The hope is that this
advance warning will give me enough time to consider selling before a sharp
fall. I also set limits not only to help prevent losses but to protect
profits. When a share price has doubled, for example, I consider selling
half my holding. This means I have recouped the cost of my entire investment
while retaining half of it.
Admittedly, capital gains tax usually will have to be paid on the profits.
But, having made such a profit, at least I can be more relaxed about the
future performance of the remaining shares.
For some people, a long-term investment often is one that was bought in the
hope of short-term profits that have not materialised. Instead, the price
has fallen steadily but the investors hold on in the hope the shares might
recover one day.
Stop-loss alarms help to concentrate the mind on retaining only investments
that are likely genuinely to perform over the longer term.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Rally holds fire but hope lingers -
London / David Wighton finds a dash of seasonal spirit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like Billy Bunter's postal order, the oft-predicted year-end share rally
failed to materialise. But there was at least a dash of seasonal spirit this
week.
There were Christmas presents for investors in Northern Electric and Portals
as the promised bids duly arrived, and the good cheer spread as the City
predicted a New Year full of take-over promise.
Apart from the actual bids from Trafalgar House and De La Rue, there were
potential offers for Pict Petroleum, Wills Group and Jupiter Tyndall.
The FT-SE 100 index rose steadily until yesterday when, with dealers
deserting their desks, it slipped back a shade to end at 3083.4, up 69.8 on
the week.
Adding to the Christmas cheer was the announcement of the UK's first surplus
on the current account of the balance of payments in nearly eight years. The
Pounds 846m third-quarter surplus was much bigger than the City had forecast
and was seized on by the government as further conclusive evidence that the
UK is making a textbook economic recovery.
Unfortunately for the government, the voters are finding it far from
enjoyable. Besides, most observers believe the surplus is likely to be
short-lived because it is the result not just of strong exports but also of
weak imports.
These have been subdued, partly because UK industry has not been investing
in capital goods - which tend to come from abroad.
Those who see resurgent inflation at every turn take little comfort from the
surplus. They maintain that unless industry starts investing, rising demand
will lead merely to inflation. The determinedly gloomy add that if industry
does start investing it will hit the trade figures, weaken the pound and
fuel inflation.
Back in the stock market, the electrical excitement spilled over into the
water sector. Despite the dangers of mixing the two, the suggestion
re-surfaced that electricity and water companies might combine to make
themselves less attractive to predators. Hanson was mentioned as a potential
bidder for both - and many others besides.
Property shares also were enlivened by bid hopes. The FT revealed that a
Pounds 1.5bn offer to buy the St Martins Property group, owned by the
Kuwaiti government, had been made by an investment consortium headed by
Barings, a merchant bank. The offer is thought to have been rebuffed, but
the news provided a shot in the arm for the sector.
Among this year's worst performers, property shares have been hit by the
rise in bond yields and the lack of the predicted rise in rents. But the St
Martins offer follows other recent signs of renewed activity. Land
Securities shares ended the week up 18p at 604p, while MEPC added 17p to
395p.
It all appears to have come too late, however, to save Stanhope Properties,
half-owner of the City's Broadgate development. Stanhope's shares were
suspended this week after negotiations with its bankers broke down.
Retail shares, which have fared scarcely better than property, also perked
up a bit. After quick trips to count the heads in Oxford Street, analysts
decided Christmas trading might not be as bad as feared. Kingfisher, this
year's Footsie's back-marker, recovered 19p to 414p over the week.
BAT Industries, another of the year's laggards, ended on a better note, too,
after winning US government approval for its planned Dollars 1bn takeover of
American Tobacco.
Two more of the UK's biggest concerns also had a good week, with British
Petroleum regaining its place as the most valuable UK company (overtaking
British Telecom) while Glaxo, which once held the title, surged by 7.5 per
cent.
This followed the news that, because of a provision in the Gatt trade
agreement, the US patent on Zantac, Glaxo's anti-ulcer treatment, could be
extended by 19 months. Analysts estimate that this could provide Glaxo with
extra revenue of between Pounds 500m and Pounds 900m - which, although very
welcome, hardly justifies a Pounds 1.5bn increase in the company's market
value.
Insurance shares were left out of the party after the Halifax announced it
was cutting an average of 20 per cent off building cover from next year. Sun
Alliance closed at 295p, down 6 per cent on the week.
The week also brought a clutch of profit warnings from smaller companies.
Canadian Pizza, the pizza-base supplier, had offended once already since it
came to the stock market last November and its shares crumbled to 73p
compared with 200p at flotation.
New issues apart, there have been fewer disappointments than might have been
expected this year, with overall profits growing more strongly than most
observers predicted. Some are expecting even faster growth this year.
Merrill Lynch forecasts total market profits up 24 per cent - almost twice
the consensus - driven by rapid economic recovery in continental Europe and
good growth in domestic demand.
Yet, the firm's Footsie prediction for the end of next year is only 3,250,
in line with its contention that earnings multiples are due to fall more
sharply than believed generally.
In part, this reflects the increased number of quoted utilities, shares of
which command a lower than average earnings multiple and higher yield.
Because of this change, it could be argued that the UK market is not quite
as cheap as it looks by historic standards, or relative to other European
markets.
Even so, UK shares do look attractive compared with the US and most
continental markets. Following London's sharp underperformance in the first
half of 1994, the optimists argue that the more recent recovery looks set to
continue.
The City's Billy Bunters insist that the year-end rally is still in the
post.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Twilight crusade of an obdurate Pope: John Paul II's
absolutist approach is upsetting Roman Catholics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Karol Wojtyla, Pope John Paul II, bishop of Rome, vicar of Christ,
infallible in matters of faith and morals for the world's 950m Roman
Catholics, emerges tomorrow on the main balcony in St Peter's Square to
deliver his traditional Urbi et orbi Christmas message, there will be the
usual cheers of 'Viva il Papa'. But there will be none of the spontaneous
explosion of enthusiasm which greeted his first appearance on the same
balcony 16 years ago.
The crowds and the Roman Catholic church as a whole were stunned by the
election of the first Polish Pope and the first non-Italian in 455 years to
sit in St Peter's chair. He described himself as a man 'from a far country'
amid the roars of the faithful.
They saw a vigorous and charismatic man - a swimmer, footballer, skier, and
actor - who had fought communist oppression in his native Poland and seemed
decidedly the man to lead the Church into modern times: a social reformer
launching a revanchist crusade to re-introduce Christianity into the modern
secular societies of the west and re-invigorate the Church's missionary
drive in the developing world.
But with old age creeping up on him, the Pope's photogenic figure is
increasingly stooped. Although he continues to attract huge crowds and his
spirituality remains unchallenged, his reputation is more and more at risk
from his conservatism.
Instead of confidently leading a united Church into the third millennium,
his moral and theological conservatism is creating divisions within the
Church by alienating Catholics in modern industrialised society as well as
provoking unholy wars between radicals and traditionalists in the developing
world.
Some accuse him of fundamentalism in his uncompromising views on abortion
and artificial contraception. Many have been angered by his intolerance
against dissenting Catholic theologians such as Hans Kung, the German who
questioned the Pope's infallibility. The Pope's defence of celibacy has
continued to drive priests away from the priesthood in large numbers.
Just before he died, Graham Greene, a Catholic convert and critic of John
Paul II, said the Pope reminded him of Ronald Reagan: 'He was a former actor
and liked crowds and cameras.'
In Latin America, his refusal to endorse the message of Marxist-inspired
'liberation theology' has led to fierce battles within the Church between
radical priests and conservative bishops and a loss of Catholics comparable
to that during the Reformation.
In North America - with 60m Catholics, the Church's single largest source of
funds - he has alienated many different interest groups, ranging from
feminists and homosexuals to New Age devotees, all seeking an individual
expression of their faith.
In Africa and Asia, the appeal of traditional native religions are
threatening the Roman mould. Even in his native Poland, the popularity of
the Church has fallen.
'Send the priests to the moon' ('Ksieza Na Ksiezyc') and other anti-clerical
slogans appear regularly in the streets of this most Catholic of countries.
'Those who save most are the people who avoid the priests,' is another
favourite. But probably the most cruel is a variation on the old
anti-communist slogan, 'get rid of the red'. Now they are saying, 'get rid
of the black'.
For the younger generation, the Church has to some extent replaced the old
communist authoritarianism. It still commands the approval of 53 per cent,
but that compares with more than 90 per cent when the communists were in
power. Although 63 per cent of Poles still go to church once a week, one
third of these do not believe that the Church serves society well.
These dangers - and criticisms of the Wojtyla pontificate - are increasing
at a time when the Pope's health can no longer be taken for granted. Since a
fall in April breaking his right leg, he has appeared frail. Rumours of his
illnesses abound. And, at the age of 74, he looks like a man working against
the clock.
'Everywhere the Pope looks in the world, he sees religious decay and
decline,' explains John Cornwell, an author and Cambridge University
academic. 'He is wonderfully holy, but the Church is not only about good and
evil but also all about politics with its right-wing, centrist and leftist
factions.'
John Paul II's mission remains unchanged: 'You must lead the Church into the
third millennium,' his Polish mentor, Stefan Cardinal Wyszynski, told him
when he was elected in 1978. Now, the main tasks he has set himself are to
achieve a reconciliation with the Orthodox churches and to organise a
special jubilee for the third Christian millennium.
Meanwhile, his global odyssey continues: his 63rd pastoral visit, in
January, will be one of his most arduous embracing the Philippines,
Australia, Papua New Guinea and Sri Lanka.
Nevertheless, the question of which direction the papacy might take under
his successor is inevitably beginning to pre-occupy the Church.
The forces for conservatism are strong. The Pope has ensured that the
college of cardinals is well stocked with his own appointees. The formal
proclamation of 30 new cardinals, on November 26, ensures that the conclave
electing his successor will bear the stamp of the Polish pontiff's views.
In the event of a new conclave, 100 of the 120 cardinals who are under the
age of 80 and are allowed to vote have now been chosen by the Pope. This has
led to further criticism from liberals, yearning for a less autocratic
successor. Their favourite is the 66-year-old archbishop of Milan, Cardinal
Carlo Maria Martini, a Jesuit with a reputation as a conciliator who is
described frequently in Italy as the 'pope in waiting'.
In all this, the Pope's health has become the greatest imponderable. In July
1992, a benign tumour was removed from his colon. Then, in April this year,
he slipped in his bathroom. As a result of the fall, he has had metal alloy
replacements for part of a broken thigh bone and has not recovered fully.
Yet, the Pope refuses to rest. Joaquin Navarro Vals, the Vatican spokesman
and one of the few with daily access to the Pope, says: 'The holy father
works every day of the week, 16 hours a day, and he is 74 years old. No
weekends.'
The media, which he exploited so successfully in the early years of his
papacy, is now taking an intense interest in his age and infirmities. The
effects are cruelly visible on television and in photographs.
In October, when the Pope confronted a crowd in front of St Peter's shouting
'Viva il Papa', he said as an aside: 'Per ora vive' ('At least he's still
alive').
Despite this good humour, the Pope is becoming more distant and withdrawn in
public, often slumped in meditation. There have always been two sides to his
complex character - the philosopher wrapped in abstract thought and the
emotional, poetic man of action. Now, the meditative side is taking over.
This impression is reinforced by the interview with the Pope conducted by an
Italian journalist, Vittorio Messori, and published in book form this
autumn. Despite its frequently dense philosophical prose, the book has
become an international best-seller - proving the extraordinary magnetism of
Pope Wojtyla. It has topped the lists in the US and the UK; in France, it is
in its fourth edition; in Italy, more than 830,000 copies have been sold.
Editions are being prepared in Chinese and Russian.
Yet, this evidence for the continuing influence of the Pope's strong
conservative views has worried many of his critics within the Church. The
danger, they argue, is that the Church risks finding itself with another
'Pio Nono' - a reference to Pius IX who, in 1870, consummated his 32-year
pontificate with the First Vatican Council and the declaration of papal
infallibility.
They fear John Paul II will become even more reactionary and continue to
rein in the process of collegiality and democratisation launched by the
Second Vatican Council under Pope John XXIII. The Pope, they add, has
suggested he is keen to draw up a new definition of infallibility.
They also argue that he has already, on occasion, made some serious
political and diplomatic errors of judgment. One example was his decision to
grant Kurt Waldheim, the former Austrian president who concealed his
war-time involvement with German intelligence in Croatia, a papal knighthood
for services to human rights.
The Pope's efforts to achieve a rapprochement with Orthodox churches have
been far from successful. The collapse of communism in eastern Europe -
which he helped to bring about - has, if anything, exacerbated long-standing
rivalries. The Russian Orthodox Church had been forced to collaborate with
the Soviet regime and took over some Catholic institutions. Now, it views
Rome as a proselytising threat and an institution that could reclaim
property.
In the former Yugoslavia, civil war has been given an added vicious twist by
the rivalry between the Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats. Indeed, the
Vatican was so anxious to back the Croats that it was the first, along with
Germany, to recognise independent Croatia and Slovenia.
Since then, the Holy See has being doing its best to minimise the
consequences of this hasty diplomatic recognition. But the Serbs have not
forgiven the Pope, and they forced him to cancel a visit to Sarajevo earlier
this year.
The Pope's big project, which he hopes will reunite the Church and revive
its prestige and popularity, is to hold a special jubilee to mark the
millennium, attracting perhaps 40m pilgrims to Rome during the year and
large numbers to the Holy Land.
A Catholic jubilee has, historically, been the occasion for individuals to
seek pardon for their sins. The Pope is expected to use this jubilee to
re-examine the Church to see where it, too, may have erred. This will
include a re-assessment of the inquisition, the persecution of intellectuals
and scientific thought (as with Galileo), its support of the colonisation of
the Americas and, more recently, the role of the Church during the
Holocaust.
Yet, the jubilee also contains many pitfalls for a Pope identified with the
most conservative side of Catholicism. As the gap widens between what the
Vatican preaches and how modern industrialised societies behave, he is
vulnerable to criticism for being obstinately out of touch.
This gap was much in evidence at the recent United Nations population
conference in Cairo. A strong Vatican delegation fought tenaciously to avoid
acceptance of artificial birth control, much to the dismay of the conference
organisers. Although it was unsuccessful, the Vatican was pleased to have
forced moral issues on to the agenda.
Taking a moral stand might not be enough. The Church cannot indefinitely
ignore public opinion on issues such as birth control, women in the
priesthood, and priestly celibacy. Of all the issues splitting liberals and
traditionalists, the Pope's uncompromising view on birth control is the
single biggest divide.
Many Catholics disagree with the official doctrine and use artificial
contraception. Many Catholic countries also have some of the lowest birth
rates in the world. For them, the Pope's crusade against what he has termed
the 'contraception mentality' has simply turned them away from the Church,
just as the Vatican's insistence on priestly celibacy (which became
obligatory only in the 13th century) has been largely responsible for about
100,000 priests leaving the priesthood in the past 25 years.
John Paul II has clearly been touched by these criticisms. In his book, he
insists: 'I must repeat that I categorically reject every accusation or
suspicion concerning the Pope's alleged 'obsession' with this issue.'
He adds: 'We cannot afford forms of permissiveness that would lead directly
to the trampling of human rights, and also to the complete destruction of
values which are fundamental not only for the lives of individuals and
families but for society itself.'
Even inside the sacred college, there are advocates of a more pragmatic
approach. In an important interview with John Cornwall, the papabile,
Cardinal Martini of Milan conceded that the Church's teaching on
contraception had not been expressed 'so well'.
The problem was a relatively new one. 'The Church, on the other hand, thinks
very slowly, so I'm confident we will find some formula to state things
better, so that the problem is better understood and more adapted to
reality,' he said.
Martini was also confident that the holy spirit would guide the Church to
resolve the problem, just as the Church had overcome other moral problems in
the past. Usury was considered a serious sin in the middle ages although
everyone practised it. Little by little, the Church began to see usury in a
different light, although it took centuries to resolve the problem.
No one questions the power of the Pope's conviction, his role in helping to
bring down communism and setting forward a serious intellectual alternative
to the consumerism of capitalist societies which, he feels, has created a
godless world without values. But can the Church afford to wait centuries to
resolve the problem of birth control? And can it be achieved under a Pope
with an absolutist view on dogma?
As John Paul II enters the twilight of his papacy, the biggest challenge
facing the Roman Church is to reunite its flock. Whether Karol Wojtyla is
the right shepherd to lead it into the next millennium remains an open
question.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Truth of the Matter: Hosannas in the high street - Hugh
Dickinson enjoys a throng carolling all the way from the cathedral to the
shops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH DICKINSON

He - or she - was 'Shocked and Dismayed'. I think the signature was
deliberately illegible. He or she was shocked and dismayed to see a senior
dignitary of the church rubbing shoulders with the president of the chamber
of commerce, the pantomime dame, the mayor, the chairman of the district
council and the giant hobnob on an occasion 'which simply advertised the
commercial materialism of Christmas'.
It all started quite innocently with a friendly glass of dry sherry for
civic officials in the cathedral chapter house. The occasion was the
switching on of the city lights for Christmas. We processed into the
cathedral to find about 800 citizens of Salisbury eagerly waiting to sing
their first carols. Various official personages read the familiar lessons -
the protocol for these events is always tricky. Which bit of the story is,
as it were, senior?
Everyone was in fine voice and as we processed out we had to step over
round-eyed children sitting in the middle of the aisles waving silver
balloons. No shock or dismay yet.
Outside the Cathedral, in the windy darkness, the Salvation Army Band
waited. As we oompahed our way out into the high street a further 1,000
citizens coalesced around us.
There, awaiting us, towered the 15ft high figure of Hobnob, his face freshly
painted and his cheeks rouged. He tends to swing in the wind a bit as he
rotates on the four pairs of legs beneath him.
We surged after him to the entrance of the shopping mall - he had to go
around as the archway is too low. Gathered around an empty fountain, the
Salvation Army trombones struck up with festive sonority. Startled pigeons
leapt out of the eves. 'Thus spake the seraph and forthwith appeared a
mighty throng . . .'
The mighty throng at the other end of the mall was singing the same carol
but a different verse. A group of teenagers outside Millets were singing
their own words amid shrieks of laughter - I wonder if they were the same
words I laughed at 50 years ago?
Crammed against the window of a charity shop, full of artificial snow and
secondhand dresses, we bump into the theatre director wiping the steam from
her glasses. 'Fancy seeing you here]' we say with equal surprise. The wife
of a local landowner, with two long-legged daughters in incredibly short
skirts, blows kisses at us across the singing heads. The good humour is
almost tangible.
The pantomime dame, in a scarlet wig and a saffron ball-gown, has climbed
into the fountain. 'Ooh] There's the vicar]' She screams in mock horror,
blowing kisses, too.
'All glory be to God on high,' we yell back. Her bosom has slipped and is
wildly asymmetrical. Familiar faces and complete strangers smile and sing.
The mayor, a small and sprightly woman, is in danger of being swamped. She
has a minder who seems far more worried about her heavy gold chain with
enamelled medallions than about her personal safety. A quick grab and it
would disappear in the crowd.
She might, too. Some doughty councillors close in around her and we push on
to the market square.
Hobnob has already arrived and another 2,000 people are crowded in front of
the guild hall by an avenue of four Christmas trees. The traffic has come to
a resigned halt with drivers leaning out of their windows.
Children climb on to their fathers' shoulders waving glowing wands or
wearing Martian head-dresses with iridescent feelers. Somewhere another
choir is cheerfully battling with the elements and a complex eight-part
carol.
We struggle through the crowds behind the Salvation Army which is heading
the final push for the safety of the steps up to a Palladian portico.
On a small floodlit stage to one side, a comedian in white bow tie and tails
has been keeping the crowds amused over a loudspeaker system which carries
to only the first 15 rows. Beyond that is jolly pandemonium. A bus honks
wearily.
A flock of starlings takes off from the plane trees. On to the stage climb
the mayor, the panto dame, the council chairman, the mayor's minder (his
eyes glued to her neck) and Mr Tourism and Leisure.
The church hides discreetly behind a white stucco pillar where a small girl
is being quietly and efficiently sick. Pink ice cream. Two pink ice creams
by the look of it. I get 10 yards of loo paper from the toilets to mop it
up. So I miss the district council chairman's speech. A reporter spots me
and prays fervently. 'O God, I wish I had a camera.' Prayer, mercifully, not
granted.
Now the panto dame has the microphone. He is a real pro and knows just how
to work the crowds. 'Did you hear the one about Father Christmas and the
rain, dear? He got dreadfully wet]' They love it. But here comes the big
moment. The council chairman starts the countdown to the Big Switch On.
'Ten, nine, eight. . .two. . .one. Bingo]'
The Christmas trees light up. All the shops around the square follow with
their own illuminations. From the roof of the guild hall, fireworks scatter
burning embers on upturned faces. Those of us in the portico rush out into
the crowds to get a glimpse of all those angels in the sky.
A baby in a pram looks up and chuckles. Embers are falling all around so I
hold my umbrella over it. 'It's raining stars,' says a boy perched on his
father's head.
As the laughing crowds disperse we wedge our way against the tide, heading
for mulled wine and mince pies with the civic authority, the mayor and the
dame. We look back over the seething square. This is what it is all about -
the holy and the secular rolled into one rich human texture.
You can keep Regent Street. And Oxford Street. This is community. A little
bit of heaven. Sorry, Shocked and Dismayed.
The Rt Rev Hugh Dickinson is the Dean of Salisbury.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Santa's package for rich executives - Barry
Riley pens a heart-warming seasonal story on top people's pay, ho] ho] ho]
</HEADLINE>

Thud] Swoosh] Father Christmas landed his sleigh just outside his front
door. 'Whoa]' he shouted to the reindeer. 'Jolly good. Another blooming
Christmas over. But my feet are just like blocks of ice. Time for a good hot
cup of tea.'
He looked round at his old, familiar kitchen. The kettle had begun to bubble
on the gas cooker. The boiler cast a red glow as he stretched his feet
towards it. 'Ho] ho] ho]' he laughed as he thought of the presents being
unwrapped all over the country.
All the same, his contentment was tinged with regret. Another long year
stretched before him with nothing much to do except feed his reindeer and
re-paint his sleigh. With the new Jobseeker's allowance scheme being
introduced, he might even find it more difficult to register on the dole.
'Things are getting so much tougher,' he complained, with a sigh. 'There's
hardly a proper decent chimney left across the land and I have to try to
squeeze through all those blooming balanced flues. What a lack of
consideration. And, anyway, how can I satisfy all the requests sent to me
when every blooming Power Rangers toy is contracted exclusively to Toys 'R'
Us? And I still have an attic full of Cabbage Patch dolls.'
It couldn't go on like this, he thought. 'There's no doubt I need another
job in the new year. Something part-time so I can continue to carry out my
Father Christmas responsibilities. But who will employ me when all I know
about is giving presents to everybody? I would be no use as a banker -
except, perhaps, in a property boom, ho] ho] ho] And I couldn't become
chancellor of the exchequer until just before a general election.'
Sighing, he picked up the jobs section of the newspaper. 'What's all this?'
he said, turning the pages and reading aloud. 'Excellent remuneration
package . . . highly competitive package to be negotiated . . . flexible
compensation package plus benefits. Well, I certainly know all about
attractive blooming packages.'
He sat up, abruptly. 'That's it,' he exclaimed. 'I will become a
compensation consultant.'
So it was that, early in the new year, Father Christmas went to a nearby big
city and looked around for a place to start finding work. Very soon, he
passed an expensive-looking office block with a big new sign above the door:
North Trent Electric.
'This will be one of these newly-privatised utilities which the government
gave away for almost nothing the other Christmas,' he recalled. 'At the
time, I thought it was trying to put me out of a blooming job. Now, the
electricity companies are trying to do the same thing by giving lots of
money away to investors.
'Anyway, with such big profits, they must have plenty of gen-erous pay
packages to work out in here. I'll go in and see the human resources
director immediately.'
He was shown into a large office which, for some reason, was full of piles
of documents labelled P45. 'Blooming delighted to meet you, Mr Snipstaff,'
boomed Father Christmas.
'Have you ever thought what I could do for you as a remuneration consultant?
I can suggest all sorts of bonuses and packages. I've been spreading
happiness around for many years. I can guarantee you that lots and lots of
new employees will want to work for you. After all, new boys and girls are
writing to me all the time. No blooming advertising, just word of mouth.'
Snipstaff looked at him in disbelief. 'You don't seem to be very
well-informed, if I may say so, Mr Christmas,' he snapped. 'We're
down-sizing here. The saving from every job we de-emphasise goes straight on
to the bottom line. Not that we really like it, of course, but it's the way
the regulatory regime was designed. So we can't use you - unless . . .'
He paused for a moment and glanced at a folder on his desk marked Global
Remuneration Benchmarks. 'Wait a minute. How about boardroom pay? Will you
advise on top executive pack-ages?'
Father Christmas beamed. 'Of course,' he replied. 'Rich kids, poor kids,
they're all the blooming same to me, ho] ho] ho] But there is just one
condition: you must convince me that you really believe in Father
Christmas.'
Snipstaff's eyes narrowed for a moment, then he nodded. 'In this respect, at
least, you can be sure that we sincerely do,' he conceded.
And so Father Christmas was appointed formally as consultant to the
remuneration committee of the board. The committee consisted of three
non-executive directors: the chairman, Lord Duffer, and two outsiders who
happened to be the chief executive officers of South Midlands Electricity
and West Central Power.
His advice was simple. The chief executive's pay should be as good as that
of any of his competitors, plus a little bit for luck. The two outsiders on
the committee agreed this was a fine idea and asked if Father Christmas
would like to become a consultant to their companies, too.
He was overjoyed. In fact, he said, this was just like having Christmas
every single day. They all agreed.
Father Christmas had a busy year. His reputation spread rapidly and he was
called in by many big companies, including manufacturers and retailers -
even some big City of London finance companies which agreed that their
directors must be awarded competitive rolling packages. Otherwise, they
would not have the incentive to act as responsible investors and
proprietors, making sure that the companies in which they put money were run
properly.
'After all,' said Father Christmas, as he recommended they adopt rolling
three-year contracts, 'we must make sure that market forces will blooming
well operate in this risky environment.'
Sometimes, he got repeat consultancy calls. One came from North Trent
Electric, which called Father Christmas back to consider what Lord Duffer
called the 'knock-on consequences of unforeseen trends in top executive pay
elsewhere in the electricity industry'.
'Yes, we must add a bit more,' Father Christmas advised. 'We can't have
anybody being paid less than the average, can we?'
All too soon, it was autumn. 'Crumbs,' said Father Christmas, 'I must soon
overhaul my sleigh and start loading it up. I have time for only one more
consultation before I prepare for Christmas Eve, ho] ho] ho]'
Who was it to be? The phone rang, and a voice said: 'British Gas here. Come
at once, we need some urgent advice.'
At British Gas headquarters the chairman, a charming American, came quickly
to the point. 'Frankly, it's a bit embarrassing,' he said. 'My pay is Pounds
450,000, although I work only part-time as a non-executive. But our
full-time chief executive, Mr Brown, is paid only Pounds 270,000. It looks
out of line. What do you advise?'
'Well,' said Father Christmas, 'you could reduce your own pay. But after
all, it is nearly Christmas. What's more, I have a database of top executive
pay all around the world - except in poor countries, of course - which
proves that Mr Brown is blooming well substantially under-compensated.
'Now, Pounds 500,000 might look a bit much, so let's split the difference.
Therefore, I recommend that you pay him, er, Pounds 475,000. Plus, of
course, the right to test all the latest luxury gas appliances free in his
own home. But no bloom-ing balanced flues, please.' Outside, it was snowing.
'I must hurry,' said Father Christmas. 'It would never do to be late. This
is my real job.' The sleigh was packed in no time and the tarpaulin fixed
over the presents. 'If I just harness the blooming reindeer, we'll be
ready.'
The sleigh flew through the sky. 'Work, work, work,' grumbled Father
Christmas. It was almost dawn when he finished and led the reindeer back
into their stable.
Father Christmas turned on the gas cooker to make himself a good hot cup of
tea, but it blew itself out with a loud pop. 'Never mind,' he said. 'I'll
just nip down to the gas showroom after the holiday. They are so helpful
with service enquiries there. It's because they are happy and well-paid, I'm
sure.'
So, he put the kettle on top of the boiler and settled down in front of the
fire to open his own cards and presents. The biggest envelope of all
contained a huge Christmas card with a glowing flame pictured on it.
It said: 'Thanks for everything - Cedric Brown. PS: To think that, until
this year, I didn't believe in Father Christmas]'

FT  24 DEC 94 / BNF loses German contract for Thorp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Nuclear Fuels has lost a multi-million-pound German contract for its
Thorp reprocessing plant because of pressures from the anti-nuclear lobby.
The cancellation is a blow for BNF, which is currently negotiating a number
of long-term contracts for the plant at Sellafield, Cumbria, which was built
over 10 years at a cost of Pounds 2.5bn.
It comes just a year after BNF won a licence to operate Thorp, after a
bitterly contested battle with environmentalists in which BNF put great
weight on Thorp's economic prospects.
The Krummel nuclear power station in northern Germany has told BNF that it
has decided to dispose of spent fuel from its reactors in an underground
repository instead.
Krummel is 50 per cent owned by Hamburgische Elektrizitatswerke, the
municipal utility controlled by the city of Hamburg which is run by the
Social Democrat party. The Social Democrats oppose nuclear reprocessing
because it produces plutonium.
Direct disposal has become possible in Germany this year after law changes
and the start of construction of a repository in Gorleben, north-west
Germany. Direct disposal is cheaper than reprocessing.
The cancelled contract covers the second 10 years of Thorp's operation, from
2004 to 2014, and involves around 125 tonnes of spent fuel. Krummel still
has a contract for the first 10 years which it will see through because
Gorleben will be unable to accept spent fuel for a number of years.
BNF said it was disappointed by the cancellation, but pointed out that the
contract represented only 4 per cent of the order book for Thorp's second 10
years. The owners of the Krummel plant would also have to pay 'significant'
cancellation charges.
The company said the value of the contract was less than 1 per cent of the
Pounds 9bn revenues so far secured for Thorp.
In order to secure German contracts, BNF has been offering opt-out clauses,
but the cancellation charges rise each year. They are due to rise again on
January 1.

FT  24 DEC 94 / B&amp;B to sell home loans by telephone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society is set to become the first high street
lender to provide a 'phone alone' service, offering mortgages at a lower
interest rate than those provided through its branch network.
The scheme, to be launched in the spring, is intended to compete with Direct
Line, the telephone-based insurance subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland.
Direct Line began selling home loans earlier this year and offers repayment
mortgages to existing customers at 7.14 per cent. The standard interest rate
charged by most mortgage lenders is between 8.09 per cent and 8.14 per cent.
B&amp;B's telephone-based mortgages will have an interest rate similar to that
of Direct Line, which will be achieved partly through not having to carry
the costs of a branch network.
The pricing is also helped by the fact that it should be a lower-risk
operation. The percentage of the property value available as a loan is
likely to be about 75 per cent - some mortgages sold through branches are
available for up to 95 per cent of the value of the home.
B&amp;B, the UK's seventh-largest society, aims to attract new customers through
the venture. To differentiate the product, the marketing will use just one
bowler hat where the society's trademark is two.
The scheme carries some risk that the society may deter potential customers,
as they will not be able to apply for this type of mortgage with branch
help.
Other building societies and banks have already set up telephone services,
but these have been combined with a branch service and complement the
branches rather than competing with them.
Interest rates charged have been the same throughout, and have not reflected
the lower costs of not having to maintain a branch network.
That trend will continue next year when the UK's two largest building
societies - Halifax and Nationwide - enter the telephone mortgage market in
a substantial way.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Scalfaro gains support in fight to avoid early polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro received an important boost yesterday
for his plan to avoid early elections in the wake of the resignation of the
Berlusconi government.
Support for prolonging the parliament came from Mr Roberto Maroni, the
interior minister and head of a large faction within the Northern League, a
former coalition partner. His faction had been reluctant to break with the
outgoing rightwing coalition headed by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, who wants the
president to call early elections.
Mr Scalfaro, who can either find a new government or dissolve parliament,
made clear that he viewed a snap election as disastrous for Italy.
The president believes elections can be held only when electoral laws have
been improved and clear guidelines and controls are established for the
media, as three commercial television channels are controlled by Mr
Berlusconi's Fininvest business empire.
Mr Berlusconi said 'a very important company of the group' could be sold in
coming days. 'Elections are inevitable,' he insisted.
Mr Maroni opposed the decision by Mr Umberto Bossi, the Northern League
leader, to bring down the Berlusconi government by putting forward a
no-confidence motion. In the past week, he has been co-ordinating some 40
'dissidents' among the movement's 105 deputies.
That split within the League appeared to strengthen the hand of Mr
Berlusconi and his allies, the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, which has
insisted there is no alternative to early elections.
However, Mr Maroni's position now means that almost 60 per cent of the
deputies in parliament oppose early elections. He is also against Mr
Berlusconi being allowed to form a second government, and wants him to
resolve the conflict of interest with his ownership of Fininvest.
Mr Maroni stated publicly for the first time the motives behind Mr
Berlusconi's strategy of early elections: 'He (Berlusconi) wants to
capitalise on (public sympathy) immediately because he won't be able to
sustain this wave of sympathy for more than two months.'
In beginning a series of formal political contacts yesterday, the president
started with former presidents Giovanni Leone and Francesco Cossiga. The
main discussions will not be until next Wednesday.

FT  24 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: US mutual funds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
US small shareholders have been looking at their investment returns for the
year to date, and are disgruntled. Domestic equity investments have not
risen at all, while bonds are down about 6 per cent. The poor performance
has led to a marked decline in investment in mutual funds during the course
of the year, combined with a gradual increase in redemptions. In the first
10 months of 1994, net inflows into domestic bond and equity funds ran at a
monthly Dollars 10bn, half last year's level. Net domestic investment shrunk
to Dollars 3.1bn in October.
Data due next week for the month of November are likely to show a further
acceleration of this trend, although the full impact of the 75 basis point
increase in US short-term rates in late November will be seen only later.
Higher rates encourage a switch into cash. The impact of outflows will be
felt not just in US financial markets but also elsewhere in the world:
approximately one eighth of mutual funds' assets is held overseas.

FT  24 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Japanese economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest batch of economic statistics confirms the weakness of Japan's
economic recovery so far. Next year also looks set to be below par. The
government's 1995 budget, promising the lowest rise in public works spending
for five years, will offer much less of a fiscal stimulus than last year's.
Meanwhile, capital investment, the foundation of previous recoveries,
continues to lag. Although it may be near the bottom after a four-year
decline, any pick-up in corporate investment is likely to be muted. Industry
is ambling along at less than 75 per cent of capacity. That is about the
same level as during the aftermath of the first oil shock 20 years ago.
Despite the recent upturn in corporate profits, the average return on fixed
capital remains miserly, explaining companies' inclination to keep their
money in the bank.
Given the economy's sluggish progress, the Bank of Japan would be wise not
to raise interest rates. The Bank is clearly concerned about inflation, its
worst nightmare after the late 1980s bubble economy and its disastrous
aftermath. But the large output gap which has emerged during the recession
suggests that inflation fears are, for now, unfounded.
As government spending weakens in 1995, the industrial economy will need an
easy monetary stance just as much as it did in September 1993, at the depth
of recession, when the Bank cut the official discount rate to resist a
deflationary slide. The Bank has been nudging overnight rates down over the
past week. That augurs well. It is, perhaps, evidence that its new governor
is - contrary to the markets' worries - trying out an accommodative monetary
policy.

FT  24 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: European cyclicals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
German steel, chemical and engineering companies' shares have given the
German stock market a fillip this week, raising a broader question about the
investment attractions of so-called cyclical stocks. These are manufacturing
companies with earnings strongly geared to the ups and downs of economic
cycles. Their share price performance tends to run in advance of
developments in the real economy, but not to the extent seen in the current
cycle.
With some obvious exceptions, such as British Steel, the best performing
share in the FT-SE 100 index this year, shares in European manufacturing
companies have underperformed consumer goods companies in 1994. Since July,
the underperformance amounts to more than 10 per cent, paralleling in a
subdued way what has happened on Wall Street, where consumer stocks have
outpaced manufacturers by more than 20 per cent since March. That this
should be happening at the point where cyclical companies are generating
large increases in earnings is not in itself anomalous: expectations of such
increases powered outperformance in the shares long before the companies
moved out of losses.
But arguably cyclical companies' earnings power is stronger than expected
this time round, and the path to the peak of cyclical profits longer than
predicted. This reflects improvements in the productivity of European
manufacturing industry following widespread rationalisation. For next year
alone, European manufacturing companies' earnings are set to grow
approximately three times faster than consumer goods companies - by nearly
50 per cent compared with 18 per cent. Hoechst's announcement this week that
it will be raising prices for some of its fibres by 5 to 10 per cent early
next year points to encouraging price resilience. Consumer goods companies
have defensive qualities but cyclical stocks are due for a second round of
outperformance.

FT  24 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Year-end options
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
So far, this has been a remarkably poor year for equities. The FT-SE 100's
efforts at a rally petered out yesterday, leaving the index down nearly 10
per cent since the start of the year. The total return on equities has been
minus 6 per cent, only the third time in 20 years the rate has been
negative. The average return on gilts during the past five years is now
higher than for equities.
But the year is not yet over. Last December, the index achieved a 6 per cent
rally, posting a 50 point rise in a single day between Christmas and New
Year. The surprise holiday period increase was caused by the expiry of a
series of over-the-counter option contracts. The contract writers and their
clients can make significant profits if the index ends at a certain level.
Given the traditionally low volumes during the holidays, it is easier for
them to drive the index where they want. Hence the surprising volatility.
That does not mean the market will move sharply upwards - it could equally
fall. But the year-end could yet prove interesting.
The forces driving this month's short-lived rally - merger and acquisitions
 -will not disappear. Companies, holding ever greater quantities of cash,
are on the hunt for targets. The market's fall this year make these look
decidedly cheap. The favoured sectors include merchant banks, electricity
and water, and the second-oil stocks following Premier Consolidated
Oilfields' disclosure it was interested in Pict Petroleum. Little is likely
to happen until the new year, but further M&amp;A activity should support the
market in the coming months.

FT  24 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Tokyo counts its blessings, up 25% in
Dollars terms - After some pessimism latterly, analysts are beginning to be
hopeful about 1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of the pessimism which shrouded the Tokyo stock market for the
latter half of this year, the holiday season seems to have brightened
sentiment.
Investors trying to look on the brighter side of things might have focused
on the fact that, to date, the leading Nikkei index is still 12 per cent
higher in local currency terms since the end of last year, and 25 per cent
higher in dollar terms thanks to the sharp appreciation of the yen.
However, the 225 average is off 9.7 per cent from the year's high of
21,552.81 in mid-June. Although share prices surged in the first few months
of this year thanks to buying by overseas fund managers trying to join the
expected economic recovery, the reluctance of domestic institutions to
follow suit has been partly responsible for the slack performance.
Not only have Japanese institutional investors, life assurers and banks,
failed to purchase shares during the past year due to the decline in
unrealised profits on stock holdings, but they have been selling shares to
counter losses from bad loans and insurance payouts. According to Credit
Suisse, unrealised gains of stock holdings at the country's top 18 life
assurers for the year to March this year totalled Y12,500bn, down 72 per
cent from the peak in 1988.
In short, demand for Japanese shares this year has almost been limited to
foreign fund managers and public pension and postal insurance funds which
have bought shares to prop up the equity market rather than for strictly
investment reasons.
In the midst of this low demand, the government, in November, proceeded to
float Japan Tobacco. The cigarette monopoly absorbed about Y570bn from the
market.
Mr Jason James, a strategist at James Capel in Tokyo, expects buying by life
assurers to remain muted as their investment strategies continue to be
conservative. He believes that life companies have a problem with their
solvency margin levels and that they are plagued by bad debts. Investment
trusts, which have been sellers during the past few months, are not expected
to return to the stock market in the short term.
So it is noteworthy that Japanese analysts, who have largely been painting a
weak scenario for the Tokyo stock market for most of the year, have become
more optimistic. Some market participants are becoming cautiously confident,
and see the Nikkei index rising above the 20,000 early in 1995.
Mr Yuichi Matsushita, strategist and manager of Nikko Securities investment
strategy section, feels that share prices have now discounted many of the
unfavourable factors surrounding the Japanese economy and corporate profits.
"The bad loan situation at the banks, corporate restructuring and the high
yen are not going to go away, but have been around for some time now,' he
says. He places his hopes with overseas investors, who remain underweight in
Japan.
According to James Capel, UK pension funds, for instance, had average
weightings of 5.1 per cent in Japan at the end of September against a
neutral weighting within the overall overseas equity component of around 6.3
per cent.
Mr Matsushita also detects waning enthusiasm towards emerging markets, and
increasing wariness towards senior competitors like New York and Hong Kong.
Overseas investors, reassessing their asset allocation for the new year, are
once again looking at Japanese shares, he says.
He sees the Nikkei index rising to between 23,000 to 24,000 next year. 'On a
global level Japan is still attractive and Japanese investors could be left
behind if they are too pessimistic,' he says.
The economic argument for a rise in share prices is still strong. Overall
corporate profits are expected to rise by 8 per cent for the year ending
next March and companies are expecting a further rise in profitability for
the following year. Higher corporate profits means less pressure for
companies to sell stock in order to prop up their profit and loss accounts.
'In retrospect, the market this year has risen in line with corporate
profits,' says one Japanese fund manager.
Meanwhile Mr Kazuo Tamayama, fund manager at Yasuda Kasai Brinson Investment
Management, notes a recovery in the liquidity situation. Excess liquidity,he
says, has stabilised and seems to be on the verge of bottoming out.
In spite of the favourable economic fundamentals, however, most analysts
agree that heavy selling is expected around the 20,500 to 21,500 levels. Mr
James reckons that the Nikkei may not clear the 21,500 level until late next
year.

FT  24 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Taipei down 1.6% as
institutions sell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo was closed to mark the Emperor's birthday, and other Asia Pacific
markets were also in holiday mood.
TAIPEI was sharply lower, following Thursday's consolidation, on last-minute
selling by institutions of previously overbought stocks.
The weighted index fell 107.73 or 1.6 per cent to 6,857.95, for a 0.6 per
cent fall on the week.
Turnover shrank to TDollars 85.3bn from Thursday's TDollars 114bn.
Steels encountered heavy profit-taking, with China Steel down TDollars 1.3
to TDollars 31.2.
Late selling also focused on textile issues that had supported the market in
earlier sessions. Hualon was down 80 cents to TDollars 38.3.
SEOUL saw sharp early gains wiped out as institutional investors unloaded
large quantities of shares on rumours of a Won2,000bn central bank issue of
monetary bonds to absorb liquidity.
The composite index ended 0.35 ahead at 1,040.55, after a high of 1,053.95,
and for a 1.6 per cent rise on the week.
Investors showed little response to a cabinet reshuffle announced about half
an hour ahead of the close because, according to one dealer, most of the
current economic ministers were retained.
HONG KONG fell on profit-taking, after four days of rises, in thin trading
in the absence of Japanese buyers.
The Hang Seng index lost 100.78 to 8,311.88, for a 1.8 per cent rise on the
week.
Turnover was a meagre HKDollars 1.72bn, the third-lowest this year, against
HKDollars 3.26bn on Thursday.
KUALA LUMPUR fell prey to profit-taking and a lack of buying which sent the
composite index down for the first time this week. The index lost 5.47 to
988.87, but was still 4.4 per cent higher on the week.
Brokers said some investors were still optimistic about the market's
prospects, although the index had met strong resistance at the 1,000 level.
The utilities stocks, Telekom Malaysia and Tenaga Nasional, which performed
strongly in recent days, pulled back as institutional buying quietened down.
Telekom fell 40 cents to MDollars 18.0 and Tenaga lost 10 cents to MDollars
10.60.
Yeo Hiap Seng rose 25 cents to MDollars 8.55 after its 'designated security'
status was lifted.
SYDNEY edged ahead in light volume of just 95m shares after Wall Street's
continued rally.
The All Ordinaries index ended 1.1 higher at 1,909.3 for a 0.6 per cent rise
on the week.
BHP added 10 cents to ADollars 19.72 in active trade after its ADRs closed
firmer in New York.
CRA was 2 cents higher at ADollars 17.82. On Thursday, the company said it
had moved nearer to closing the Southern Copper smelter and refinery by
buying out the other shareholders and booking an abnormal loss of ADollars
115m.
MANILA was pulled lower by a mild selldown in blue chips as investors
lightened their portfolios ahead of the Christmas holiday.
The composite index fell 21.57 to 2,785.50, for a 2.8 per cent rise on the
week, as foreign funds took quick profits, while local investors who were
left behind by the weakening of the market in the past weeks have started to
lighten up their portfolios.
BOMBAY picked up as sentiment improved after the resignation of three
ministers named in two national scandals.
The BSE 30-share index rose 26.69 to 3926.90 for a 0.4 per cent fall on the
week.
Brokers said that the ministers' resignation was seen to have restored the
prime minister's credibility in the ruling Congress party, which lost
heavily in recent regional polls.
SINGAPORE edged down, with light buying of some key stocks helping to shore
up the market.
The 30-share Straits Times Industrials index edged down 0.30 to 2,219.29 for
a 2.3 per cent rise on the week.
BANGKOK was slightly lower, the SET index losing 2.95 to 1,361.35 for a 1.9
per cent rise on the week.
Thai Airways was Bt2 higher at Bt55 on news of the appointment of a new
chairman.

Wall Street
US blue-chip stocks posted solid gains yesterday as investors and traders
celebrated the last trading day before Christmas by sustaining the market's
increasingly impressive December rally, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 18.51 at 3,833.43.
Secondary indices were in mixed form. The more broad based Standard &amp; Poor's
500 finished up 0.15 at 459.83, the American Stock Exchange up 1.26 at
428.78 and the Nasdaq composite up 2.85 at 742.19. Trading volume was 199m
shares.
As expected, trading was thin yesterday, with many participants taking the
day off or leaving early. Prices benefited from the lack of activity, with
modest buying - notably of blue-chips - having an exaggerated effect on
indices.
Dow stocks were in particular favour, which is quite normal for December as
institutional investors seek to pack their portfolios with quality issues
and stocks that have fared the best this year (the Dow outperformed all
other leading indices in 1994). This 'window-dressing' contributed to the
sharp early gains. At one stage the Dow was up more than 30 points, before
slipping back later in the day.
Bond prices, meanwhile, were slightly firmer, which also helped buoy shares.
A modest early rally among Mexican ADRs, following the heavy selling midweek
related to the country's financial crisis, supported the market, although
the stocks fell back before the close.
Telmex initially rallied, but ended Dollars  1/8 lower at Dollars 40 1/2 ,
and Grupo Financiero closed down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 8 3/4 . But Grupo
Tribasa added Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 19 3/4 and Grupo Televisa jumped
Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 32 5/8 .
Among Dow stocks, the most popular were General Motors, up Dollars 2 at
Dollars 41 1/8 , International Paper, up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 76 5/8 ,
and Disney, Dollars  3/8 higher at Dollars 46 3/8 .
Bank stocks, hit earlier by concerns about earnings and the slump in Latin
American markets, rebounded. JP Morgan rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 56,
Citicorp added Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 41 1/2 and Chase Manhattan firmed
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 34 1/4 .
Genentech tumbled Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 47 7/8 after the Swiss group
Roche declined to add to its 65 per cent stake in the company.
Canada
Toronto was afflicted by pre-Christmas sluggishness, with the TSE-300
Composite index closing up 10.48 at 4193.20 in volume of just 30.41m shares.
The market re-opens on Wednesday, though analysts expect little activity
next week.

FT  24 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexican recovery stalls
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican Bolsa ended with a solid gain in a volatile session dominated
finally by selective buying.
The key stock index closed up 39.59 points, or 1.54 per cent, at 2,341.85 on
strong volume of 120.3m shares.
Brazil's Bovespa index had a less volatile career, moving from a session
high of 43,395 on bargain hunting, following a 12 per cent fall on Wednesday
and Thursday, to close at 43,514.
Argentine's Merval index was showing an early gain of 2.2 per cent after
losing 3 per cent on Thursday.
In terms of real money, Mexican equities had a lot of ground to make up. The
IPC index, on Thursday evening, was up 3.3 per cent in three days in local
currency terms; but the peso had fallen from 3.45 to the dollar to 4.9 over
the same period, meaning a three day loss on the IPC, dollar adjusted, of 27
per cent.

FT  24 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Cyclicals more mixed as
Frankfurt eases on session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Market Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Political hopes continued to move Italy, but its hard currency neighbours
made a more sedate approach to the Christmas holiday, writes Our Market
Staff.
FRANKFURT suspended its recent enthusiasm for front line cyclicals, and
chemicals, carmakers and engineers were mixed as the Dax index eased 6.64 to
2,094.01 on the session, up 1.1 per cent on the week.
Turnover fell from DM5.2bn to DM4bn. In the post bourse, shares edged higher
with Wall Street, the Ibis-indicated Dax closing at 2,100.98. In cyclicals,
Bayer fell DM4 to DM360.10 Mannesmann rose DM5 to DM420; Ms Barbara Altmann
at B Metzler in Frankfurt said that some foreign, judicious profit taking
had been balanced by 'window dressing'.
The latter might explain why Allianz moved from a loss of DM6 on the session
to a gain of DM10 at DM2,510 after hours. Otherwise, financials were weak on
unrealised hopes for a bond market revival.
PARIS, as a market, moved quietly towards Christmas Eve with the CAC-40
index off 2.2 at 1,949.85, but 1.3 per cent higher on the week.
However, there was more cheer at the level of individual stocks. On Thursday
night, L'Oreal said that its Paravision International unit had sold about
300 films to Canal Plus, the French pay-TV channel. Yesterday L'Oreal rose
FFr26 to FFr1,145 and Canal Plus FFr11 to FFr898  - suggesting, somehow,
that both sides had got the better of the deal.
Meanwhile, Valeo said that it would have 75 per cent of a joint venture with
Siemens to produce systems and electric motors for car heaters and air
conditioners, and the French company's shares rose FFr3 to FFr257.
MILAN continued higher as hopes rose that the country would avoid early
elections which might postpone action on the budget deficit and possibly
bring higher interest rates. The Comit index picked up 1.70 to 629.00, with
the weakness of the lira still prompting foreigners to buy. The index had
risen by 3.8 per cent during the course of a highly charged week on the
political front which saw the resignation of the prime minister, Mr Silvio
Berlusconi on Thursday.
Olivetti, popular with foreign investors, rose L87 or 4.5 per cent to
L2,040, but analysts were unable to point to any news to account for the
rise.
Other blue chips found strong demand taking Fiat L136 higher to L6,024 and
Telecom Italia up L75 to L4,193.
Credito Italiano slipped L17 to L1,678 amid concern that it might relaunch a
bid for Credito Romagnolo. Rolo, for which a group headed by Cariplo is also
bidding, rose L151 to L19,073.
ZURICH featured a 3.7 per cent fall in Holderbank as the cement producer,
which has companies in Mexico and in other Latin American countries, fell
prey to the Mexican financial crisis. The SMI index finished 1.2 higher at
2,651.0for a 1.8 per cent rise on the week.
One leading domestic bank was said to be a major seller in Holderbank, which
also saw foreign sell orders. The shares fell SFr38 to SFr1,003, although
some analysts commented that the fall seemed to have been overdone.
UBS was again seen as a buyer of its own shares, which have been under
pressure recently, and the bearers rose SFr16 to SFr1,111.
AMSTERDAM finished with modest falls after a shortened session and the AEX
index lost 0.95 to 414.40. It was still 1.5 per cent ahead on the week.
Among chemicals shares, Akzo was up 40 cents to Fl 198.10, helped by
positive comments about higher 1995 and 1996 sales. DSM was Fl 1 higher at
Fl 139.30.
Other leading shares were uninspired with Philips down 20 cents to Fl 52.30
and Royal Dutch off 60 cents to Fl 188.30. Heineken lost Fl 3 to Fl 261.50
on profit-taking after recent gains, while other food and drink issues were
mixed.
MADRID staged a technical recovery in low volume, the general index rising
1.68 to 292.88, 1.7 per cent lower on the week in turnover of just
Pta13.4bn, close to the lowest measure of market activity this year.
STOCKHOLM edged lower with the market's lacklustre performance exacerbated
by an early close on the debt market and higher government bill rates and
bond yields. The Affarsvarlden General index eased 0.5 to 1471.1.
MoDo, the forestry group, rose SKr5 to SKr346 after a large block trade in
the stock led to speculation that its fellow paper products group, SCA, had
sold some of its large holding.
HELSINKI revived after news that a pay deal had averted strikes in the
forestry and paper industries. The Hex index rose 19.0 to 1,813.7, a
fraction better on the week, with Repola up FM4 at FM84.

FT  24 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Down Mexico way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Food and drinks group Allied Domecq reflected the stock market's nervousness
over the Mexican economy and the shares tumbled 8 to 544p.
The devaluation of the Mexican peso and fears about the simmering rebellion
in Chiapas have cast a further cloud over Allied's acquisition of Pedro
Domecq earlier this year. The Mexican market, where it sells brandies such
as Presidente and Don Pedro, accounts for about half Domecq's profits.
Allied shares, which stood at 612p before disappointing interim figures a
month ago, were yesterday on a sub-market rating and one of the highest
yields in the sector.
There was some support for drinks issues via an encouraging and festive
piece of research from US investment bank Lehman Brothers. The
pharmaceuticals and drinks specialists have pooled their respective skills
and concluded that alcohol is good for you.
Couched in the sober terms of city analysts, the team cites the refreshing
fact that in Ireland pregnant women and nursing mothers got their Guinness
on the national health service until a few years ago. As evidence, it pours
in the findings of a 13-year study on 12,300 male UK doctors, among whom
modest drinkers were healthier than abstemious colleagues.
The research is not encouraging investors to rush for the sherry, but to
pick up stocks which might experience 'beneficial effects regarding
price/earnings multiples'. Guinness shares were steady at 451p, Greene King
up a penny at 528p and GrandMet a penny firmer at 409p.
Activity in utilities was subdued, with the market's main focus among the
regional electricity groups seemingly shifting north of the border. Scottish
Hydro put on 6 to 323p and Scottish Power added 6 at 346p, but turnover in
each case was minimal.
Northern Electric, which this week received a hostile cash and paper bid
from Trafalgar House, retreated a penny to 1006p, with the market - caught
up in seasonal festivities - momentarily losing sight of an anticipated
white knight and increased offer possibilities.
British Gas dipped 2 1/2 to 310 1/2 p in 2.1m tuurnover.
Among water stocks, Wessex Water, unchanged at 300p, saw fair volume trading
4.1m shares while Welsh Water improved 5 to 655p.
Telecoms shares remained active despite the seasonal pressures clamping
trading volume generally. BT and Cable and Wireless notched up 11.9m
turnover between them, with the former easing to 382p but C&amp;W advancing a
further 4 to 385p as rumours of talks with US telecoms giant AT&amp;T continued
to circulate.
The odds on a deal with AT&amp;T appeared to shorten yesterday, with C&amp;W shares
seemingly shrugging aside the latest round of price cuts by its Mercury
subsidiary, which is cutting the price of day-time calls to the US for big
corporate customers by 55 per cent in the face of vicious competition.
Analysts suspect some sort of link between AT&amp;T and Mercury could be forged
early in the new year, with best bets pointing to the US group taking a
sizeable minority stake. Bell Canada paid Pounds 480m for 20 per cent of
Mercury in 1992, but that was before the present competitive squeeze took
hold.
TeleWest Communications lost further ground, closing at 172p - 10p below the
recent flotation price - with only a handful of sessions before the the
issue's stabilisation period ends on December 30.
Irish building materials group CRH, which has announced nearly Dollars 33m
of US acquisitions in the past two months, jumped 9 to 355p. Among
merchants, Wolseley dipped 4 to 780p.
Former building society Abbey National improved 2 to 436p as its subsidiary
Abbey National Independent Financial Advisers announced an acquisition. It
has bought the WF Company, which advises on the establishment and operation
of small self-administered pension schemes.
Pharmaceuticals group Zeneca eased despite approval of its latest
acquisition in the US as drug stocks were sold down following their recent
gains. NatWest Securities described the company's acquisition of cancer-care
group Salick as 'a superb move vertically to integrate the group's cancer
business'. However, the shares fell 10 to 883p on profit taking after
reaching a new high earlier in the week.
Elsewhere, Glaxo dropped 8 to 673p, Wellcome 4 to 705p and SmithKline
Beecham 5 to 466p.
Many analysts are looking for a strong performance from the sector in 1995.
Analysts said that after three years of lagging badly, it should benefit
from rotation from cyclicals and a more upbeat picture for the industry
worldwide. The sector has a 1995 p/e ratio of 13 times, broadly matching the
market.
Mr Mark Brewer, analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, argues that it could
regain a 10 to 15 per cent premium on the market by the end of next year.
Among engineering stocks, FKI hardened to 146p after NatWest Securities put
out an add note following recent significant underperformance. The shares,
lately hit by programme trades, have lagged behind the market by 12 per cent
over the past month. NatWest pinpoints robust profit margins and - in the
longer term - the possibility of a 'sizeable' acquisition.
Motor trading and bus group Cowie put on 7 to 224p as hopes built for the
success of the recent Pounds 33.1m rights issue. Lex Service gained a
similar amount to 300p but Inchcape retreated 4 to 435p following a cautious
note from NatWest Securities.
Among transport shares, National Express added 4 to 291p while Stagecoach
closed unchanged at 225p following news of its latest acquisition, the
Pounds 4.25m takeover of a Scottish bus company with a fleet of 75 vehicles.

FT  24 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAT up after US go-ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International tobacco and insurance group BAT Industries rose 3 to 445p
against the trend after the group finally reached agreement with the US
Federal Commission over its proposed acquisition of American Tobacco.
There was also believed to be at least one upbeat recommendation for the
group in circulation, and BAT was the most actively traded stock in a quiet
market following the clearance of the Pounds 600m deal.
The trade-off is that BAT will sell off a range of cigarette brands and a
cigarette manufacturing facility to an independent competitor to preserve
competition in the US industry.

FT  24 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: The pre-Christmas rally finally runs
out of steam - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a distinct shortage of genuine trading activity on the London
equity market yesterday as the City wound down for the Christmas holiday.
However, there was no shortage of anguish around the trading desks which,
the Stock Exchange insisted, had to stay open until the usual 4.30pm close.
'Everyone was happy to work the half-day, which would have tied in perfectly
with the futures market closing at 12.10pm. But to keep the cash market open
until 4.30pm was simply silly,' said the head dealer at one of the big
European banks.
He said most of the large marketmaking firms cut manning levels to the
minimum after lunch, leaving only a skeleton staff.
Earlier in the session there was talk that a large OTC option was due to
expire at the official close and that the market could have been driven
sharply higher pre the expiry. It was a series of OTC expiries that were
deemed responsible for the steep rise in the FT-SE 100 index between
Christmas and the New Year last year, when the index jumped almost 50 points
in a single session.
In the event the market went out with a whimper, with equities never
appearing to struggle but simply lacking any upward impetus and suffering
from an acute attack of turnover starvation.
Turnover for the whole session crept up to 291.8m, with non-FT-SE stocks
accounting for almost 70 per cent of the total, well ahead of the usual
ratio between leaders and second-liners. Disgruntled dealers pointed out
that turnover in the truncated pre-Christmas session last year was 242.1m.
The FT-SE 100 index ended the day a net 8.3 off at 3,083.4, its first
decline in six trading sessions, but remained 69.8, or 2.3 per cent, higher
on the week. The driving force behind the market this week has been the
emergence of the much expected agreed bid for Portals, the security paper
manufacturer, from De La Rue, and the Trafalgar House bid for Northern
Electric. The Northern bid triggered a wave of takeover speculation
throughout the utilities areas.
Second-liners, strongly outpaced by the leaders, held up reasonably well,
with the FT-SE Mid 250 managing a modest 1.4 improvement at 3,487.3, for a
week's gain of 50.2, or 1.5 per cent.
The 100 index kicked off the session around 4.4 lower at 3,087.3, and
ignored the latest good showing from the US, where the Dow Jones Average
closed 13 points higher. Dealers were impressed with the Dow's performance.
They said it came in spite of a poor outcome to the latest bond auction, of
five-year notes, and worries about Mexico and other South American
countries.
But with very little genuine business being offered to the market, share
prices did no more than drift easier throughout the day. Another firm
opening by Wall Street, had little impact on sentiment in London, and the
City's dealing desks were vacated the second the market closed.
Features in equities were few and far between, but the property sector
continued its recent strong showing and provided the FT-SE 100 with its two

FT  24 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Dollar firmer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar was yesterday the beneficiary of Mexico's woes with the US
currency profiting from a flight to quality, writes Philip Gawith.
The reverberations in Latin American markets, and beyond, of the sharp
devaluation of the Mexican peso were still the focus of attention.
Activity was, however, very quiet. Trading desks were lightly manned, and
activity in Europe effectively died after the lunchtime release of the US
durable goods data.
The dollar shed some of the gains it made on Thursday, but maintained its
firmer tone to close in London at DM1.5783 from DM1.5805. Against the yen,
it finished at Y100.205 from Y100.495. Elsewhere, the lira was firm after
the excitement earlier in the week, culminating in the resignation on
Thursday of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister. The lira finished
unchanged at L1,039.
Also attracting some attention was the New Zealand dollar, which touched a
six year high of Dollars 0.643 in Asian trading.
Analysts said that the ramifications of Mexico's devaluation were
potentially more serious for the region than the collapse of the ERM had
been for Europe.
The slide in the peso, from around 3.46 on Monday, to 4.70 yesterday, has
spilled over into other countries like Brazil and Argentina, prompting a
heavy liquidation of assets held in the region by US funds.
'From a sentiment standpoint, the market has perceived this will be money
coming home, and that will be good for the dollar,' said Mr Shandi Modi,
chief economist at IDEA, the financial advisory service, in London.
Trade remained very thin, with an enormous bid-offer spread of around
4.60/4.80 pesos.
Although the peso appears to have achieved a modicum of stability, analysts
said it remained vulnerable to further sale of the underlying assets. On the
other hand, recovery over the past two days in the stock market has provided
a glimmer of hope.
Before the devaluation, most observers believed the peso was 10-15 per cent
overvalued, suggesting it is now oversold.
The only figures released of any note were US durable goods orders. They
rose by 3.4 per cent in November, compared to a consensus forecast of 1.7
per cent. The series, however, is very volatile and was ignored by traders.
Mr Modi said the bias of the market was 'to walk in next year and buy
dollars.'
The New Zealand dollar touched a fresh six year high, buoyed by buying from
a local bank in thin trade. Dealers said the 'Kiwi' was also benefiting from
Standard &amp; Poor's sovereign upgrade of New Zealand on Thursday, with some
local institutions caught short by the move.
The Kiwi finished in London at Dollars 0.6425/USDollars from Dollars 0.6409.
The French franc recovered off a low of FFr3.4592 to close at FFr3.454
against the D-Mark, from FFr3.455. Business, however, was light and dealers
said it was difficult to see why the currency had fallen to its lowest level
in a year.
The franc has been in retreat ever since Mr Jacques Delors announced he
would not be standing for the presidency next year. This prompted fears of a
swing towards the Eurosceptic right in French politics.
The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 900m money market shortage at
established rates. Sterling was barely changed, with the trade weighted
index finishing at 79.7 from 79.8.

FT  24 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The only wool auction this week was in New Zealand, and prices were
generally a little firmer. The official market indicator closed 7 cents
higher at 517 cents a kg. and only 11% was unsold at growers' reserves, a
little better than recent clearances. Wool markets for some weeks have
managed to hold firm, and closed firmly before the Christmas recess, despite
some loss of confidence in the strongly rising price trend which applied for
most of 1994. There is uncertainty about price changes ahead. Statistically
the evidence points to strength in the outlook, but there is powerful
resistance to price rises already established in primary markets, but not
yet passed on to consumers. The problems in absorbing raw material price
increases are not confined to wool or to textiles and trade opinion is that
a further price rise would not make things easier.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Commodities (Week in the markets): Copper's price rally
halted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's commodities markets broke up for the Christmas holiday at lunchtime
yesterday in a relatively subdued mood. Recently strong markets, like some
of the base metals, generally edged back a little, while recently week ones,
like coffee, clawed back some of their losses.
At the London Metal Exchange copper, which has been setting the trend for
most other base metals, ended at Dollars 2,969.75 a tonne for three months
delivery, down Dollars 11.75 on the day and Dollars 15.75 on the week. But
that was still Dollars 25.25 above Tuesday's low and dealers were not ruling
out a renewed attempt to break decisively above the Dollars 3,000 mark after
the festivities.
Yesterday's reversal was influenced by news of a rise in LME warehouse
stocks, not a big one, but none the less an unwelcome interruption to a long
sequence of falls. The decline on the week could also be seen as modest in
view of the easing in the concern about nearby supply tightness that had
been an important factor in the market's recent strength. That was reflected
in a narrowing in the cash premium over three months metal to Dollars 20 a
tonne from Dollars 70 at the end of last week.
LME markets following copper's retreat yesterday were nickel, zinc and tin,
but aluminium continued to make its own luck. The three months price rose
Dollars 3.25, helped by another big stocks fall, to Dollars 1,943.75 a
tonne, up Dollars 20 on the week and Dollars 78.75 above Monday's low. The
publication of Russian industry data showing lower production and exports in
1994 also aided aluminium.
The London Commodity Exchange robusta coffee market sprang to life on
Wednesday after Central American producers unveiled an export retention plan
aimed at reversing the recent price slide - at the end of last week London
futures prices were more than 35 per cent below the highs reached in the
summer.
Although many traders were sceptical about the plan, which would take about
20 per cent of supplies out of the market until more remunerative price
levels were restored, the March position at the LCE leapt Dollars 218 a
tonne on the day. By yesterday's close it was still Dollars 153 up on the
week at Dollars 2,791 a tonne.
The producers were 'strong on words', one trader told the Reuters news
agency on Wednesday, 'but are not likely to be as strong when it comes to
shipments. . . There is little incentive for them to withhold coffee at
current prices'.
The producer move focussed dealers minds on the state of the market,
however, and they seemed to come to the conclusion that the sell-off
following US Department of Agriculture's recent report on the world crop
situation, had been overdone.
Another bearish pronouncement by the USDA - suggesting that world
consumption of coffee in 1994-95 would be 3 to 4 per cent below its June
forecast (before frosts and drought in Brazil drove up prices) - sparked off
a Dollars 75 price retreat on Thursday. But buyers were attracted back
yesterday after Indonesia said it was backing the Central American plan.
Cocoa prices made slow but steady progress meanwhile, until they were
trimmed back marginally yesterday. The March delivery price at the LCE ended
at Pounds 993 a tonne, down Pounds 3 on the day but Pounds 26 up on the
week.
Much of the buying had been encouraged by the tightness of the expiring
December futures position, which widened its premium over the March contract
from Pounds 15 to Pounds 21 over the course of the week.

FT  24 DEC 94 / International Company News: Matif clears hurdle in its bid
for UK recognition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Matif, the French futures and options market, has cleared an important
hurdle in its bid to gain recognition as an investment exchange in the UK.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of the Office of Fair Trading, said
yesterday that two features of Matif, while potentially anti-competitive,
did not have that result at present.
The OFT said it would keep 'under review' the effects of the two rules,
which cover a limit on membership numbers and the capital requirements upon
them.
It nevertheless recommended that Matif be granted permission to operate and
thereby cleared the way for Matif futures and options to be offered on
electronic trading terminals in the UK.
Trading on Matif takes place on an exchange floor using 'open outcry'. Out
of hours, however, Matif products are bought and sold on the Reuters Globex
system and recognition will allow UK traders to use this facility.
From the end of 1995 two Matif contracts are scheduled for quotation on
terminals of Deutsche Terminborse, the German futures exchange. If both
Matif and DTB gain formal status in the UK, products from both exchanges
will also become available on-screen in the UK during working hours.
Liffe, the London exchange, said recognition of Matif was an inevitable
consequence of the opening of European markets. It said it was in close
discussion with the Paris authorities on winning reciprocal access in
France.
Futures traders said the spread of terminals of different exchanges would
help them save costs by concentrating execution of transactions in fewer
hubs. The Globex system has lacked liquidity and the inclusion of Matif
products will increase its attractions to users.

FT  24 DEC 94 / International Company News: Revamped Acer hits on winning
formula - Taiwan's biggest computer maker is heading for fresh records
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A few years ago, some doubted that Acer would survive the crippling price
wars being waged in the personal computer industry. This year, Taiwan's
biggest computer maker has exceeded all forecasts and its share price has
almost quintupled since mid-1993.
In 1991, Acer sank into the red for the first time since it was founded in
1976. Its net loss of TDollars 607m followed the costly acquisition of
California-based Altos Computer Systems in 1990 and aggressive expansion in
marketing computers under the Acer brand name. The company returned to
profitability in 1992, and by 1993 posted net profits of TDollars 1.07bn.
Securities analysts forecast net earnings will top TDollars 3bn (USDollars
113.6m) in 1994.
They attribute the recovery to a group restructuring, a turnround in US and
European sales under the Acer label and increased orders from US and
Japanese computer makers.
Another factor has been strong demand for dynamic random access memory
(D-Ram) chips which has pushed up profit margins on this product. TI-Acer, a
venture with Texas Instruments, brought in 90 per cent of Acer's earnings in
1993 and is expected to produce 40 per cent of earnings in 1994.
Whether Acer can keep up the pace is the subject of debate. Some analysts
feel that the reorganisation has given Acer the flexibility to adapt quickly
to changing market conditions.
'What matters in the PC industry is technology and speed,' said an analyst
at a UK brokerage house.
'Many people believe there will be a shake-out in the computer industry in a
few years. When that happens, there will be only 10 or 12 big companies
left, and Acer will definitely be one of them.'
Others believe that while Acer should continue to perform well in the near
term, it remains vulnerable to the US personal computer market and to memory
chips, a heavily capital-intensive industry subject to cyclical swings in
prices.
'Profit margins in the PC business have improved but they are still quite
low - for Acer the margin is about 4 per cent at the operating level,' said
an analyst at a Hong Kong-based securities brokerage. 'We're concerned that
Acer is heavily exposed to high-risk areas.'
Further rounds of price-slashing in the US market or increased supply of
chips could damage profitability. Currently, TI-Acer is Taiwan's only
producer of D-Ram chips. There have been shortages of D-Ram chips this year,
but at least four ventures have been set up to produce such chips in Taiwan
and should begin operations in 1996.
Until then, at least, Acer's visionary chairman, Mr Stan Shih, appears to
have hit upon a formula which will allow the company to thrive in an
industry in which product cycles are constantly shrinking and
high-technology components obsolesce during shipment.
Using what Mr Shih calls the 'fast-food franchise' strategy, the logistics
of production and distribution have been fine-tuned to allow speed and
efficiency while keeping fast-depreciating inventory to an absolute minimum.
Semi-finished computers are shipped to remote assembly sites located in the
markets in which they will be sold, where key components such as the
microprocessor and the hard disk drive, which quickly lose value, are
installed. With offices in 75 countries, Acer now has 20 such assembly
plants and expects to set up 10 more in the next few years.
Under the reorganisation, marketing and production units separated along
regional and product lines within the Acer group were spun off into
quasi-independent entities responsible for making decisions as well as
profits. 'Vertical integration in a company is no longer competitive,' Mr
Shih says.
The group has been transformed into what Mr Shih calls a 'client server'
structure under which 'each unit is independent but acts as a server for its
sister clients', the other companies in the Acer group. Business units are
not required to source materials from other units in the group if components
can be had more cheaply elsewhere.
Acer plans to spin off 21 business units for listing on local stock
exchanges around the world by the end of the decade. The group will apply to
list Acer Computer International, an assembly and marketing unit, in
Singapore in 1995. A joint venture with Computec de Mexico, a Mexican
computer company, will be set up on January 1 and is expected to list on the
Mexican stock exchange in late 1995.
Listing plans met a temporary setback recently when Taiwan securities
authorities turned down applications to list Acer Peripherals, which makes
colour monitors, and Acer Sertek, a distribution arm, on the Taiwan stock
exchange. Regulators cited the two companies' brief record as independent
entities and Acer will reapply next year.
Another key element of Acer's turnround was a decision to refocus on
original equipment manufacturing (OEM), or producing under contract to major
computer companies. Acer is one of the few Taiwan computer makers to promote
its own brand name alongside OEM production. But in the late 1980s the group
decided to devote more resources to brand sales and cut OEM business from 40
per cent in 1988 to 25 per cent in 1992. In 1994, OEM sales had risen to 35
per cent and Mr Shih hopes to reach 50 per cent.
Acer's commitment to building a brand name, in contrast to other Taiwan
computer companies, means going head-to-head with the industry's giants. It
also means having to fight against prejudices left over from the days when
Taiwan was simply a high-volume, low-cost producer. 'The made-in-Taiwan
image is a burden,' concedes Mr Shih. 'People still have the idea that a
Taiwan company must be worse than a US company. It will take a long time to
overcome this problem.'

Standa, the retail group controlled by Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest,
yesterday said it was seeking to sell Euromercato, its hypermarket chain,
Reuter reports from Milan. It said it had already received concrete offers.
On sale will be the assets of Euromercato but not the company name. Industry
sources said Standa could not sell the full company for tax reasons as it is
written in its accounts at well below book value.
The company said its chairman, Mr Giancarlo Foscale, had been authorised to
handle the sale, fixing a price and conditions. Company sources have valued
Euromercato at around L1,000bn (Dollars 608m).
Six serious bidders were believed to be in the market for the group,
including Benetton, the sportswear maker.
Euromercato runs seven hypermarkets in northern Italy, with expected
turnover this year of L1,300bn and net profits of L40bn.

FT  24 DEC 94 / International Company News: JP Morgan acquires share stake
in Banesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Santander said yesterday it had sold 1 per cent of Banco Espanol de
Credito (Banesto), the troubled banking group it acquired in April, to the
US bank JP Morgan. The sale, at Pta830 per Banesto share, is worth Pta5.8bn
(Dollars 44.3m).
The development renews Morgan's association with Banesto and cements its
relationship with its new owners. The US bank is now part of a core of
shareholders brought in to Banesto by Santander that includes the Royal Bank
of Scotland, First Fidelity and Metropolitan Life, of the US, a group of
Mexican investors led by the Modelo drinks group and the Barcelona-based
savings bank La Caixa.
Morgan was the financial adviser to the Banesto board which was dismissed by
the Bank of Spain a year ago, scarcely four months after it had led
international equity issues that raised almost Dollars 700m for the Spanish
banking group.
In the rights issue last year the Corsair fund, a Morgan-managed portfolio
backed by US institutions, invested Dollars 175m in Banesto to own nearly 8
per cent of the banking group. Corsair's Banesto equity was, however,
diluted to 3.1 per cent following a Pta780bn rescue plan that involved after
a write-down of the par-value of Banesto shares and the institution's
recapitalisation.
The Banesto core shareholder group that Morgan has joined controls 9 per
cent of Banesto. Santander now owns 48.5 per cent of Banesto following the
disposals and after placing 6.3 per cent of its equity in the bank with
Santander shareholders in a 3 Santander shares for one Banesto share offer
priced at Pta783 per Banesto share.
Mr Matias Rodriguez Inciarte, second vice-chairman of Santander and a member
of Banesto's board, said yesterday Santander did not foresee any significant
variation of Banesto's shareholder structure in the mid term.

FT  24 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Scantronic and Menvier-Swain terminate bid
talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A dispute over a confidentiality agreement resulted in the termination of
discussions between Scantronic Holdings and Menvier-Swain, a potential
buyer, Scantronic announced yesterday. The shares fell 2p to 17 1/2 p,
against a high for the year of 90p.
Mr Chris Brookes, chief executive of Scantronic, the security components
company, said: 'They refused to sign a confidentiality agreement which they
were involved in negotiating.' Scantronic had asked for such an agreement
before disclosing financial information to Menvier-Swain.
Mr Carl Hadley, finance director at Menvier-Swain, the emergency lighting
and alarms manufacturer, said that it had no comment to make on the
discussions. He said that the company was yet to decide whether to proceed
with plans to bid for Scantronic.
On October 27, Menvier-Swain announced that it might make an offer for
Scantronic, after it had analysed the company's financial position. At the
same time it increased its stake to 4.49 per cent.
Scantronic has appeared vulnerable to a takeover bid in the last year. In
the six months to September 30, it incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.4m
against a profit of Pounds 1.4m.
Acquisitions have resulted in net debts rising from Pounds 3.5m in March
1993 to Pounds 10m at present.
In June Mr Ray Dias, the then finance director, left after the board said
that he had failed to alert it to the impact of increased borrowing and
difficult trading conditions.
Silvermines, the Dublin-based electrical services and property group, is
also thought to be a potential bidder.

FT  24 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Kelsey at Pounds 1.46m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A substantial improvement in its soldering products business enabled Kelsey
Industries to report profits for the year to September 30 ahead from Pounds
212,000 to Pounds 1.46m. Turnover was little changed at Pounds 50.1m,
against Pounds 49.7m.
The Hertfordshire-based company, which also has interests in automotive
components and industrial roofing, said the result would have been even
better but for depressed conditions which affected the UK roofing business.
However, with an improved order book, the roofing arm is expected to return
to profits.
After tax of Pounds 463,000 (Pounds 385,000) and minorities of Pounds 66,000
(Pounds 30,000) earnings per share came out at 24.5p, against losses of
12.2p. A doubled final dividend of 10p raises the total to 13p (8p).

Illingworth Morris and Woolcombers, both part of Mr Alan Lewis's group of
textile companies, reported pressure on margins in the six months to
September 30.
However, improved efficiencies and lower costs enabled both companies to
show increases in pre-tax profits.
Illingworth reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 797,000) on
turnover of Pounds 25.9m, against Pounds 27m of which Pounds 2.83m related
to discontinued activities. Basic earnings per share were 1.9p (1.1p).
Woolcombers reported pre-tax profits static at Pounds 1.08m (Pounds 1.07m)
on turnover for continuing activities of Pounds 11m (Pounds 10.5m). Earnings
per share were unchanged at 2.4p.

Farringford, which operates a hotel of that name on the Isle of Wight,

August 31, against Pounds 42,000. Turnover edged ahead from Pounds 403,000
to Pounds 431,000.
The improvement reflected a better showing from the hotel and reduced head
office overheads. Directors stressed, however, that the period under review

half.
Losses per share narrowed to 0.1p (0.21p).
Directors said they were still seeking suitable acquisitions.

A 'welcome and sustained' upturn in demand helped Jones &amp; Shipman, the
machine tool manufacturer, to cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 973,000 to
Pounds 897,000 in the six months to September 30.
This upturn, however, had only a limited effect on turnover - up from Pounds
5.41m to Pounds 6.13m - because of the nature of lead times across the
company's product range, said Mr Len Weaver, chairman.
Losses emerged at 3.5p (8p) per share and the company's shares closed up 1p

FT  24 DEC 94 / UK Company News: The year of the tweaked snouts - The
changing attitudes towards boardroom pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For one institutional fund manager, 1994 holds fond memories: 'I will
remember it as the year those with their snouts in the trough - Maurice,
Cedric and all the others - finally had them tweaked.'
The tweaking of snouts refers to huge changes in attitude which have taken
place over the past 12 months towards the spicy issue of boardroom pay.
Government, fund managers and even directors all now accept the need for
change.
'What has happened is that the net of legitimate interest in directors' pay
has widened so that many people representing a variety of interests now
believe they can have a say,' the fund manager explained.
For Maurice Saatchi, the proposing of Pounds 5m-worth of super share options
recently led to US and UK institutional shareholders forcing his departure
from the board.
Cedric Brown's 75 per cent pay rise, which took his basic salary to Pounds
475,000, has been followed by a government examination into the issue of
executive pay. The Cabinet inquiry is the first time in several years that
the government has deviated from its traditional stance that directors' pay
is a matter for shareholders only.
Another area of controversy, large pay-offs by companies to directors who
have been forced to resign, has also been tackled for the first time this
year.
In June Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of PosTel, the fund
management group, launched a campaign to reduce the length of directors'
contracts and therefore the size of pay-outs to directors who are forced
out.
Mr Ross Goobey announced he would be using PosTel's shares to vote against
the election and re-election of directors who had rolling service contracts
longer than two years.
'At the end of the year, it looks like two-year rollers are now the norm,'
Mr Ross Goobey said yesterday. 'But we will have to wait and see over the
next two years or so if the shortening of contracts will make much
difference to the level of pay-offs'.
The significance of 1994 for corporate governance is recognised elsewhere in
the City. 'Enormous strides have taken place in the past year,' confirms Ms
Anne Simpson, joint managing director of PIRC, the corporate governance
consultancy. 'Shareholders are now more aware of their responsibilities.'
An academic report, published in August, bolstered the case for change.
Drawing on research involving about 170 companies, the National Institute
for Economic and Social Research concluded that there was only a small
connection between the performance of a company's share price and dividend -
the so-called shareholder return - and increases in top executive pay. Worst
of all, it stated that there was no relation between directors' pay and
profit performance.
There were plenty of examples of this during 1994, particularly among
directors of the privatised regional electricity companies and water
companies. Yesterday, Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow Chancellor, published
research which claimed that since privatisation every rec chairman had made
a million.
'We do not need to scour the country to find men who win the national
lottery every year,' Mr Brown said, 'they are sitting in the privatised
boardrooms.'
While there is little evidence to suggest that directors have tempered their
pay rises, the year has seen companies willing to provide a far greater
level of pay details to shareholders.
At the heart of this move has been Mr Richard Giordano. As chairman of
British Gas and BOC, he has pushed both companies towards providing far more
details about executive pay in the companies' annual reports. BOC, for
example, now gives five pages of information on pay including, for the first
time, directors' pension details.
This trend is likely to continue next year with Grand Metropolitan, the food
and drink conglomerate, and British Gas expected to provide the same level
of detail.
Mr John Rogers, investment committee secretary of the National Association
of Pension Funds, spotlights several other areas to watch in 1995:
US pension funds: rule changes in the US mean that fund managers are now
likely to vote their shares in the UK. Executive share options: companies
are likely to come under pressure to make directors' exercising of their
options dependent on more stringent performance measures.
Non-executives: the NAPF believes that companies' remuneration committees
should comprise solely non-executives, who should stand for re-election
annually.
Length of directors' contracts: a majority of NAPF members want the norm to
be one year rolling contracts.

FT  24 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Dares launches rights issue to fund
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dares Estates has acquired Milelodge, a property company, and various
properties for Pounds 23.3m, funded by the issue of 167m new ordinary shares
at 4p apiece, the assumption of Pounds 10.7m of debt and Pounds 5.9m cash.
To help satisfy the cash element of the acquisition, Dares will raise Pounds
5.54m by way of a rights issue of up to 138.5m new ordinary shares also at
4p, a significant discount to yesterday's close of 9 1/2 p.
Shares will be offered to shareholders on a 14-for-5 basis for the ordinary
and 28-for-1 for the first convertible preference. The properties being
acquired have been professionally valued at Pounds 30.2m.
Mr Ervin Landau, chairman, said: 'This scheme revives the company; net asset
value will be Pounds 12.4m, gross rental income from the new properties is
Pounds 2.8m, and profits will be sheltered by substantial tax losses.' The
proposals will enable Dares to benefit from available tax losses of Pounds
19m, capital losses of Pounds 11m, and unrelieved ACT of Pounds 3m.
Dares is also to undertake a restructuring involving the hive down of all
existing assets and certain of its existing liabilities to Runtrump, a
wholly-owned subsidiary, along with the release of Dares from certain
guarantees and all floating charges.
Upon completion of the acquisitions, Mr Tom Farmer, chairman and chief
executive of Kwik-Fit Holdings and one of the vendors of Milelodge, will
join the Dares board.
Dares reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 133,000 on turnover of Pounds 2.62m
for the half year to June 30.

FT  24 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Stanhope renews talks with British Land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stanhope was still trying to avoid receivership last night, more than 24
hours after its banks asked for repayment of their Pounds 148m loans.
The board, headed by Mr Stuart Lipton, was meeting to consider its position
after a day of talks with British Land, the property investment company run
by Mr John Ritblat.
British Land's earlier rescue offers were rejected because they asked
Stanhope's banks to write-off of more than 20p in the pound on their loans.
On Thursday, at least four of Stanhope's 16 banks voted not to extend the
deadline for repayment of the company's credit facility.
The banks had granted a three-day breathing space on Monday but any further
extension required unanimous consent of the syndicate led by Barclays.
Stanhope's main asset is its 50 per cent stake in Broadgate Properties,
which owns much of the Broadgate and Ludgate office developments in the City
of London.
Other than British Land, the most credible rescue offer came from PosTel,
the post and telecommunications pension fund run by Mr Alastair Ross Goobey.
PosTel had proposed a Pounds 250m rights issue which would have enabled
Stanhope to repay most of its debts and buy the other half of Broadgate
Properties from the receiver to Rosehaugh, Stanhope's former development
partner which went into receivership two years ago.
However, negotiations with Rosehaugh's receiver broke down this week when
PosTel's Pounds 106m offer for the other half of Broadgate Properties was
rejected.
The receiver, with the support of Rosehaugh's banks, asked for at least
Pounds 110m. At this price, PosTel could not offer Stanhope's banks enough
for its plan to command their support.
Under the guidance of Mr Lipton, Stanhope was behind some of London's most
admired developments, including Broadgate and Stockley Park, the innovative
commerce park near Heathrow Airport.
The company was floated on the Unlisted Securities Market in 1987. Its
shares peaked at 321p in 1988, valuing the company at Pounds 500m, and were
suspended on Thursday at 8p.

FT  24 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Beverley may face legal action from
creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Disgruntled creditors at Beverley Group, the insolvent engineering company,
yesterday said they were considering legal action to overturn a company
voluntary arrangement endorsed by its shareholders this week.
Creditors owed some Pounds 500,000 want the voluntary agreement thrown out,
forcing the group into liquidation and clearing the way for an investigation
of Beverley's management.
The company, however, warned that a legal challenge was unlikely to succeed
and said it was pursuing its own action against the creditors involved.
Mr Colin Robinson, chairman, said: 'These creditors are acting maliciously.
They have no interest in the future of Beverley, and we are suing a number
of them for money they owe us.'
The creditors, however, claimed they could pursue legal action by proving
that voting on the voluntary agreement was mishandled.
The agreement was approved after the company agreed to two amendments
proposed by the Inland Revenue, one of the company's principal creditors.
'Had the company not agreed to these amendments, the Inland Revenue would
have voted against the CVA and the management would have been defeated,' the
dissident creditors said.
'We believe those amendments should not have been put to the meeting without
prior notification.'
The amendments called on the group to set aside enough funds to pay for
liquidators should the CVA fail to restore Beverley's fortunes, and imposed
a 60-day deadline for repayment of outstanding taxes.
Buchler Phillips, the insolvency practitioner which conducted the vote, said
it had followed the correct procedures.
'I don't think there's any possible challenge that would result in legal
action,' said Mr David Buchler, the firm's senior insolvency partner.
While providing for partial repayment of creditors, the CVA should leave
Beverley as a clean shell company with Fluid Engineering, its only operating
subsidiary, as a solvent operating business.

FT  24 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Flotations provide stronger swimmers -
Christopher Price analyses the themes to emerge from a bumper year for new
issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A volatile year for new issues ended with a seemingly familiar refrain - a
profits warning from a recently floated company. Yet Thursday's admission
from Canadian Pizza, which came to the market little over a year ago, and
other headline-grabbing incidents have been the exception rather than the
norm, and have spoiled an otherwise sound performance by the rest of the new
issues market.
The picture is confirmed by research from James Capel and UBS, the
stockbrokers, and mirrors analysis by the Financial Times in October,
showing new issues overall outperforming the FT-SE-A All-Share Index. Even
where new issues have underperformed the index, they have usually
outperformed their sectors.
Privatisations aside, it was a bumper year for flotations in terms of the
money raised and the number joining the market.
According to Capel, which surveyed companies with a flotation value of more
than Pounds 25m (excluding investment trusts and international offerings),
68 companies floated between January 1 and November 30, with a collective
market capitalisation of Pounds 8.7bn. In 1993 there were 58 new issues for
a total of Pounds 5bn.
Over the past two years, new issues have outperformed the All-Share by 3.1
per cent and their sectors by 8 per cent, according to Capel. The larger UBS
report, which surveyed all debutantes capitalised at more than Pounds 10m,
found an average outperformance of 4.6 per cent against the All-Share.
The most hectic period came in the last quarter of last year and the first
quarter of 1994, with the period either side also very active. Institutional
investors, sensing an economic revival and keen to invest in fast-growing
'recovery' stocks, turned to the new issues market with enthusiasm.
The result was a rush to the market by private companies, encouraged by City
financiers and assured of a warm reception from fund managers.
Critics say the stampede produced overpricing of some issues and encouraged
some companies to float which would not normally have done so.
While this bears some truth, the volatile and generally downward performance
of the stock market during 1994 has been as significant. This has thrown the
underperformance of many new issue stocks into perspective.
Beazer Homes, for example, which came to the market in March, has seen its
shares drop by 17 per cent against their issue price and underperform the
All-Share by 15 per cent, using Capel figures. Yet the stock has
outperformed the building and construction sector by 12 per cent.
Among other issues highlighted in the reports, are the underperformance of
the high- tech sectors, and the generally strong showing by management
buy-outs.
The falling market, some spectacular flops and a lack of funds have driven
investors away from new issues. While there were 52 flotations in the first
half of the year, only 16 came in the second, according to Capel, with
dozens of others pulled as prices plummeted.
'The flotation frenzy of the last two years is over,' said Mr Tom Attwood, a
director at Capel. 'The market will not support anything other than top
quality issues. And even then they will haggle over the price.'
Of last year's winners and losers there is a fairly sombre view of the
vagaries of the stock market.
DRS Data, the scanning equipment manufacturer, came to the market in May and
issued a profits warning in September. It was this year's second worst
performer.
Mr Malcolm Brighton, managing director, said: 'This has been the most
damaging six months of my career. I was not prepared for the astonishing
level of cynicism from City analysts and institutions.'
He said the group was a victim of circumstances beyond its control. 'People
just think we are trying to pull a fast one,' he said. 'Trying to convince
them of what has actually happened has been awful.'
He did not think the process of flotation had been at fault, nor the group's
pricing. 'We listened to our advisers,' he said.
Aerostructures Hamble is the name synonymous with the bad publicity rained
on new issues during the past year. It floated in June and had issued two
profits warnings by November. Mr David Ring, acting chief executive, said
the company had no complaints about its flotation, nor the hostile reaction
from the City.
'It was a rigorous and fair process. Some things happen to companies which
can't be seen. But we have no bitterness towards the City - the market set
the price then and is setting the price now. We are concentrating our
efforts on getting the business back on track.'
Unforeseen circumstances were also cited by Mr Garth Riley, chief executive
of Telspec, in denying that the shares had been underpriced. The telecoms
equipment manufacturer was the best performer since December 1993.
'The price was struck against certain market conditions. It could not take
into account business we were fortunate enough to subsequently win.'

FT  24 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Stagecoach makes Pounds 4m acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stagecoach Holdings, the bus company, announced yesterday its ninth
acquisition since it was floated last year. It is paying Pounds 4.25m for
Ayrshire Bus Owners, which operates as A1 Service.
The company is paying Pounds 1.7m cash with the balance to be satisfied in
new shares.
Mr Keith Cochrane, company secretary, said the company did not expect a
reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. 'We do not operate in
direct competition with A1 Service,' he said.
A1 Service operates 75 vehicles in the Ayrshire towns of Irvine, Ardrossan
and Saltcoats.
Stagecoach is currently the subject of three MMC inquiries concerning its 20
per cent stakes in SB Holdings, the Strathclyde bus operator, and in
Mainline Partnership, Sheffield, and a general investigation into bus
services in north-east England.
Stagecoach has spent Pounds 91.3m on acquisitions since it was floated in
April 1993.

FT  24 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Wembley finalises refinancing proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wembley, the stadium and greyhound track operator, yesterday said it had
finalised its long-awaited refinancing proposals with creditors owed some
Pounds 140m.
The scheme, thought to involve a Pounds 60m debt-for-equity swap and rescue
rights issue, will be put to institutional investors by Sir Brian Wolfson,
chairman, in the new year.
Moves to revive the company have gathered pace in recent weeks following a
decision by its bankers not to enforce a December 31 deadline for up to
Pounds 40m of debt repayment.
Sir Brian refused, however, to confirm whether the group had opted for one
of three rival refinancing packages, which it has been considering since
July, or had decided to pursue an independent strategy.
City analysts expect Sir Brian to seek a reconstruction without resorting to
schemes proposed by either City entrepreneurs Mr Luke Johnson and Mr Hugh
Osmond; Mr Harvey Goldsmith's Allied Entertainments; or Apollo Advisors, the
US investment group led by Mr Leon Black.
Although Sir Brian can rely on support from investors controlling at least
20 per cent of the ordinary shares, the process could still be derailed by
opposition from preference shareholders. Guinness Peat, the UK investment
vehicle of New Zealand entrepreneur Sir Ron Brierley, said it had not yet
decided how to use its 26 per cent preference holding. 'We are in a pivotal
position. We could support or halt the reconstruction.'

FT  24 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Call for probe into N Electric share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Derek Foster, opposition chief whip, yesterday urged the Stock Exchange
to investigate the unbroken increase in the price of Northern Electric
shares in the weeks following a meeting between Trafalgar House, now a
hostile bidder for the company, and Professor Stephen Littlechild,
electricity industry regulator.
In a letter to Mr Michael Lawrence, the chief executive of the Stock
Exchange, Mr Foster writes: 'It appears to me that it is beyond the bounds
of coincidence that the shares should gain in price every day after the
conclusion of that meeting.'
Trafalgar House and some of its advisers met Prof Littlechild on November 25
and the conglomerate confirmed on December 14 that it was considering a bid
for the north-east of England's regional electricity company.
Between those two dates, Northern's share price closed higher each trading
day. It rose from 787p on November 25 to open at 910p on December 14,
closing 100p higher, after the announcement.
Mr Foster points out that in the four days preceding the meeting, the shares
fell each day. 'In the circumstances I firmly believe the public are
entitled to an explanation that can only be given if an immediate
investigation is carried out by the Stock Exchange Council.'
On December 15, Northern Electric asked for an exchange inquiry into the
movement in its share price before the Trafalgar announcement. Yesterday the
exchange said the investigation launched at the rec's request was
continuing.
Trafalgar House and the Office of Electricity Regulation (Offer), of which
Prof Littlechild is the head, both declined to comment on Mr Foster's
observation about the share price movement.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Status quo on taxes is not perfect
but it's the best we have
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms MARGARET WILKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan (Economic Viewpoint, December 15) quotes my conclusion
to Paying for Public Spending: is there a Role for Earmarked Taxes? (Fiscal
Studies, November 1994), which rejects large-scale earmarking in favour of
the current practice of spending from general revenues, and comments: 'It is
precisely this unrealistic demand for omniscience by governments which
convinces some of us that there must be a better way.'
However, I did not 'demand omniscience'. My support for the status quo was
not unqualified. In particular, I wrote 'scepticism that earmarking would
not greatly promote democracy is not a rejection of the public choice 'black
box' criticism of the traditional approach'. I do not think that it is
perfect, but it is the best we have.
The political right wants earmarking to lead to opting out and
privatisation. However, James Buchanan (guru of the right, a leader of the
public choice school and critic of big government), in a seminal paper on
earmarked taxes, drew attention to the variety of practical and cost
problems which made him very tentative about recommending earmarking.
In particular, he noted that if decision-making costs were included in the
segregated revenues model this might make it 'inefficient' relative to
consolidated revenue schemes'. He also pointed out that services that
benefited sub-groups in the community (eg education, health services) would
suffer from earmarking.
I think that the right, which expects that earmarking would lead to spending
cuts and opting out, is more likely to be correct than those, like the
Liberal Democrats, who think that it would get people to pay taxes more
willingly.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Right product for TV target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LYNDON HARRISON MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I write to congratulate Christopher Dunkley on his excellent and
perceptive article regarding MTV (Television: 'For dedicated followers of
fashion', December 21). I have two qualifications:
First, MTV does occasionally step out of the seamless robe of pop music. It
chose to feature one set of elections this year. Predictably, for a channel
which embodies the idea of young Europe integrating, it was the June
elections to the European parliament.
Second, Dunkley cites Kylie Minogue's pop video Confide in Me as
indistinguishable from the adverts it carries. That is as may be. But I have
been using this particular example in hip speeches which I give to
astonished youth audiences, as an example of a new product tailored for a
Single European Market. Its use of five screened European languages to
evince common teenage sentiments implies a common European youth culture. It
is a pity that it is a petite Oz who leads the way in teaching us the
fundamentals of business: first know your market then fashion your product
appropriately. Lyndon Harrison,

FT  24 DEC 94 / Measure for measure: A new law on serving wine by the glass
is about to come into force in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Eurosceptics who sought refuge from Brussels legislation over a gin
and tonic or a glass of wine will from the new year have to seek alternative
solace.
On January 1 measures that date back to 1990 will finally become law and a
new metric quantity, 25ml or multiples, will become the norm for dispensing
gin, rum, vodka and whisky instead of the quarter, fifth or sixth of a gill
(a gill is a quarter of a pint).
This much is straightforward. But when Brussels turns its attention to the
dispensing of wine by the glass - an increasingly popular way of drinking
good wine - restaurateurs, wine bar owners and customers may feel not only
confused but that their individuality is being encroached upon.
The same legislation will now dictate that wine by the glass can be served
only in quantities of 125ml or 175ml, or multiples. More significantly, it
specifies how these can be dispensed. In future, a restaurant or bar, no
matter how smart, can serve a glass of wine, no matter how cheap or
expensive, only into a lined glass, stamped by a government-approved body,
or into a free-standing, government-approved measure known as an 'optic'
that is then emptied into the restaurant's own glass.
The restaurant industry is upset for two reasons.
First, it has accommodated customers' orders for less but better wine over
the past five years - demands induced by the recession, health concern,
tougher drink-driving laws and wider appreciation of fine wine. Many
restaurants now offer far more than just house wine by the glass and in
glassware superior to the formerly ubiquitous spherical Paris goblet.
Such gentility is now at an end. The Upstairs Bar at The Savoy will
henceforth be dispensing glasses of chablis premier cru and Cloudy Bay
sauvignon blanc at Pounds 6 each into the Savoy's own glasses conspicuously
marked with a government line and stamp on the side.
Second, restaurateurs feel their attempts to discuss the legislation have
met with an unenthusiastic response. Mr John Davy, who controls 50 wine bars
around the City and sells 50,000 cases of wine a year, describes the
legislation as 'ridiculous'.
'It's like trying to control the quantity of smoked salmon served on a plate
in The Ritz. The legislation has nothing to do with quality - the overriding
factor in the wine we buy and serve - and everything to do with quantity. In
fact the new laws will hurt our customers, as until now my staff have been
free-pouring 130ml of good wine for a small glass and 180ml into a large
glass.'
When it became obvious that this legislation would become law in August
1994, Mr Davy made various attempts to incorporate his company's etched logo
on to the glass with the required line as the bottom of the logo. This, he
felt, would at least detract from the ugliness of the lined glass. All
aesthetic suggestions, however, have been rejected and Mr Davy has to buy an
extra 1,000 dozen stamped wine glasses, with the stamping costing an extra
20p per glass.
The Department of Trade and Industry, which will be supervising this
legislation, says it is intended 'to bring us into line with the rest of
Europe'. This does not seem to be borne out by the situation in Paris, where
one leading restaurateur who has been serving exciting wines by the glass
for the past 15 years reports that French law dictates only that the
quantity of wine served by the glass be clearly stipulated. He serves 110ml
of wine in a glass in one of his restaurants, 120ml in another and 80ml of
sherry in both.
But UK law enforcers have little faith in French measures, it appears. On a
recent visit to Paris, one leading London chef/restaurateur, in anticipation
of these new measures, went to Verrerie des Halles, the specialist supplier
of glassware to French bars, restaurants and cafes, and bought a 25ml optic
for his bar. This his staff now uses. But when he phoned the DTI to
establish whether this would be acceptable after January 1, he was told he
would have to have the optic checked, approved and stamped by his local
standards officer. Reciprocity of liquid measures, the DTI added, would not
be possible for at least two years.
The DTI's defensiveness may have something to do with an imprecise knowledge
of the world of wine. The new legislation will cover only table wines.
Champagne, port and sherry are excluded, as are digestifs such as brandy and
armagnac which can be free-poured.
When I asked a DTI spokeswoman about Sauternes, the sweet wine of Bordeaux,
she said that this was a digestif and so could be free-poured. When I
pointed out that Sauternes is a sweet table wine, she replied that therefore
it had to be served in measures of 125ml or 175ml. This is a bad precedent.
Such a drink coming at the end of a meal should be sipped and served in
measures no larger than 90ml or 100ml.
Any visit to a restaurant from January 1 could now involve the following: an
aperitif served from a 25ml optic, a glass of wine poured into a lined,
stamped glass and a digestif free-poured from the bottle.
As one restaurateur comments: 'It's confusing enough to turn anyone to
drink.'

FT  24 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: No plan for lottery tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRIS SMITH MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am writing to put the record straight. Your story, 'Labour looks at
'windfall' tax on lottery group' (December 22), alleging that Labour wants
to tax Camelot's proceeds from the lottery, is incorrect. At present,
Camelot is spending large sums of money establishing the complex
infrastructure for the lottery, advertising it, and preparing further games
to come into play next year.
The income stream from ticket purchase has its ups and downs, and it will be
impossible to determine the balance of income, cost and profit with
certainty for months to come. Any discussion of Camelot's share of the
proceeds is therefore wildly premature.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Shareholder power lost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PHILIP OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Edward Leigh MP (Letters, December 16) makes a strong point about
the need to empower shareholders to control executive salaries. He also
makes a point of great significance concerning the powerlessness of
investors to have any influence upon fund managers whatsoever.
But he misses a point when he suggests that purely fiscal measures to
encourage direct share ownership are involved. Rolling settlement has been
used by stockbrokers as an excuse for forcing small shareholders' investment
into nominee accounts. Once in these accounts, the small shareholder's
rights to receive annual reports and to vote are extinguished. Nominee
accounts also allow the brokers to charge fees where none was necessary
before, thereby further raising the barriers to private share ownership.
Fiscal incentives to compensate for these fees would have to be substantial.
There is no longer a route for the active small investor to have a direct
influence on the public company in which they have invested.
This does matter; small investors have performed a valuable role in
highlighting issues of corporate strategy in the past, as when Alan Sugar
proposed to return Amstrad to private ownership.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Hark, the herald cash tills ring . . .: Andrew Scott
explains how Christmas has changed - though not to the disadvantage of
retailers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW SCOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once more, Christmas has been heralded by the sound of UK retailers
complaining of disappointing sales. The main cause of disappointment this
year is cyclical: consumers are not spending as much as they normally do at
this stage of economic recovery. But the cry is a familiar one: it seems
that Christmas is often a disappointment for the retail trade.
This is strange, because a study of UK consumption data shows the Christmas
season is normally anything but a retail disappointment. In 1993, for
example, seasonal factors contributed an extra Pounds 5bn to fourth-quarter
consumption, compared to the third-quarter level. Given that consumption as
a whole rose by just Pounds 8bn in 1993, it becomes obvious why retailers
have high expectations for Christmas.
Examining these seasonal fluctuations in consumption gives a fascinating
insight into the Christmas habits of the UK. We may all think we
over-indulge enormously at the end of year. But food consumption rises by
only about 2.75 per cent in the fourth quarter of the year.
We certainly drink and smoke a lot more as a nation at Christmas - the
seasonal effect generates an extra 19.8 per cent of alcohol and tobacco
expenditure. The combination of cold weather and new winter fashions leads
to a substantial increase in expenditure on clothing and footwear, with
fourth-quarter consumption 23 per cent higher.
The data also reveal that the additional spending at Christmas has been
steadily rising over the years and is now at its highest since records
began.
The seasonal boost to consumption of non-durables - food, drink, clothing,
energy and the like - has risen from Pounds 1.6bn in 1960 to Pounds 4.8bn in
1990. Between 1960 and 1993 this increased Christmas effect boosted
consumption by more than Pounds 57 per head of the population (in 1990
prices).
The table shows which goods and services are most affected by this increased
Christmas effect. It shows the percentage growth in fourth-quarter
consumption which is entirely due to seasonal factors - and how this have
changed over the years. Most notable is the surge in Christmas spending on
drink, tobacco and 'other goods' such as sports equipment, toys, books,
toiletries and jewellery.
If the Christmas seasonal effect has increased over the years, what has
caused this change? Economic commentators invariably explain changes in
consumption by reference either to changes in household income or interest
rates.
However, neither of these can explain why Christmas consumption is becoming
more important. The variation in household income between seasons is not
large - and has been getting smaller.
There is a seasonal pattern in interest rates: bank base rates tend to be
highest in the last two quarters of the year. However, there is no evidence
that this seasonal pattern has altered over the years, so it cannot explain
the growth in consumption at Christmas.
Similarly, the weather offers little explanation of what is going on. While
the weather clearly influences how much we spend, it does not explain the
growth in Christmas spending.
It is to social customs that we must look if we are to explain these
seasonal consumption changes. We tend to think of Christmas traditions as
fixed and unalterable, but in practice the English Christmas has changed
considerably.
The social historian John Pimlott has investigated the changing features of
the English Christmas in his fascinating book The Englishman's Christmas
(Harvester Press, 1978). Far from finding that Christmas present is the same
as Christmas past, he concludes that 'it is part of the tradition that
Christmas is never as it used to be'.
These changes can be seen by looking at consumption of particular
commodities. In 1955, for instance, more chicken was eaten than turkey at
Christmas. By 1977, more chicken was eaten in a normal week of the year than
at Christmas.
At the level of total aggregate consumption, the changes in the English
Christmas have been marked over the longer term. In the 17th century,
Christmas was banned by the Puritans in 1647 and revived in 1660 (though the
legalisation of festivities only partly restored its former glories).
The publication of A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens in 1843 gave a new
boost to the festivities. It was in the 1840s that so much of current
Christmas tradition was established - trees, crackers, cards and so on.
For the retailing industry, however, the most important change in social
customs happened in the 1870s. Previously, presents had been given mainly to
children and mostly at New Year. But it began to be the practice to give
them at Christmas and to adults as well - to the benefit of almost the whole
range of the retailing business and industry. From that time on, the
commercial and social importance of Christmas continued to increase, a
process which the data suggest is still occurring.
Will this upward trend in Christmas spending continue? Studying historical
trends in consumption seasonality, there is considerable evidence that while
seasonality changes only very slowly, when it does change it changes
permanently. In other words, once new social customs are established, they
remain in force.
This suggests that the enhanced importance of Christmas to the retailer is
likely to remain, long after any temporary disappointment over this year's
sales has disappeared.

<TEXT>
Sir, Reflecting on David Richardson's informative and amusing article
(Farmer's Viewpoint, December 20) on the rise and fall of the mistletoe
futures market, I suggest it may spark off frantic scenes at Tenbury Auction
during the run-up to next Christmas - international traders talking urgently
into their mobiles and giving knowing winks towards the gavel as another
couple of pounds of the precious twigs and berries pass over the trading
floor.
Aside from all that, I wonder if Mr Richardson could enlighten me on any EU
rules regarding the possibility of grubbing up my holly bush. This is the
second year in a row it has failed to produce a single berry. I am seriously
considering a set aside policy for that part of the garden. This Christmas
we have again had to buy the stuff.

FT  24 DEC 94 / The search for a meaning: Yuletide celebrations in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER and EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Tokyo this December, the Christmas trees are out in force, tinny carols
are rattling from loudspeakers and thousands of shops are filled with
seasonal merchandise. But there is a more than usually hollow ring about the
festivities. Money no longer flows so freely in Japan and, without it,
people are starting to wonder what Christmas is really about.
In a country where less than 2 per cent of the population professes any
Christian belief, the celebration was always a copy. The Japanese took
Christmas to their hearts not because they wanted to understand what the
event was supposed to commemorate. What mattered was that Americans and
Europeans were enthusiastic about it. This was enough to show that it must
have some value. And so the Japanese set about giving themselves a bigger
and incomparably better Christmas than the authentic ones in the west. In
Japan, better meant more expensive, and what developed was the brassiest
Yuletide in the world.
Traditionalists in the west might bemoan the passing of the true Christmas -
of carols, midnight mass, and perhaps even spiritual reflection - but in
Japan, there never was anything but a commercial, tinselled affair. The
story of the Tokyo department store that sold images of a crucified Father
Christmas might be apocryphal, but there is little doubt that, to most
Japanese, Christmas was never more than an ingenious marketing device: a new
way of persuading the financially incontinent to part with their money.
The traditional Japanese Christmas (circa 1989) was a dream for the
marketing people that focused heavily on the younger generation. Christmas
was sold as 'the most romantic time of the year' and an occasion to cement
those special relationships the material way.
In the bubble years companies were generous with their winter bonuses, and a
really good Christmas Eve meant spending around Y100,000 (Pounds 645) - more
than a third of a month's salary - taking that special someone to a dinner
show, exchanging presents and spending a night at an upmarket international
hotel.
Tokyo's Tiffany stores were crowded with teenagers and young salarymen in
their blue suits shoving people aside to buy trinkets for their girlfriends.
Christmas fever was such that to avoid being left without a hotel
reservation for next year's Christmas Eve, the meticulous trend manuals even
advised men to wake up early the next day to book a room.
But that was in the time of unbridled confidence about Japan's economic
prospects - the days of rapid growth rates and an explosion in wealth.
The ending of the bubble economy, and the four sluggish years through which
Japan's economy has since toiled, have made conspicuous consumption
irredeemably outmoded among the fashion conscious. Extravagant spending on
Christmas Eve is now sneered at as baburee, or a typical 'bubble
phenomenon', the most crushing of put-downs.
'Eating at expensive restaurants and hotels wasn't part of my real world,'
says Mr Nobuhiro Hirasawa, an office worker who says he spent Y45,000 last
year wining and dining on Christmas Eve. 'I want to enjoy Christmas without
spending so much money.'
But there is the nub. What, to a nation that can't tell a crib from a
crucifix, is meant by 'enjoying Christmas'?
The materialist credentials are still impeccable. One thing the new spirit
of Christmas means is value for money.
The Hot Dog Press, a fashion weekly for young men, has cut its special
Christmas pages, once over 60 at the peak, down to 10. 'Telling people to
spend lots of money at Christmas doesn't necessary sell the magazine any
more,' says Mr Morihiko Katabuchi, an editor. Instead of the Y50,000 Tiffany
pendant or the Y100,000 Cartier ring, Hot Dog suggests its readers buy
girlfriends a cafe au lait mug for Y1,400 or a pair of photo frames for
Y1,600.
The economic changes have also brought about new tastes among consumers. The
search for value rather than brand names has given rise to new types of
shops. Discounters, superstores and warehouse-style stores selling one
category of goods at knockdown prices are becoming mainstream, hurting the
sales of traditional retailers, the department store and the corner stores.
But the end of the urge to splurge has done more than prompt a search for
value. It has seen the Japanese looking for alternative means of renewal
this Christmas. Many are rediscovering their families. In the past, New
Year's celebrations have been Japan's main year-end family event, with
mountains of good luck foods, such as rice cakes, herring roe and seaweed,
washed down with sake. But in the past few years spending time with family
and close friends on Christmas Eve has become popular.
Since Christmas is not a holiday, 'the fall in overtime working hours due to
the recession has also helped in getting the family together', says
Ajinomoto, the largest food and beverages company. That means - well, it
means shopping, of course for cheap imported chicken and bargain French
sparkling wines.
So, it has become a cheap Christmas certainly, and maybe even a family
Christmas. But that comes no closer to answering the question, 'Why bother?'
In the most material of a materialist world, what is a 'Christmas' without
the money? There is no sign of any religious awakening - the same small
groups of the faithful will turn up at the midnight masses at the Christian
churches dotted around town. Some will even take to the streets to hand out
food and a few comforting words of the Christmas spirit to Tokyo's growing
homeless population.
But the vast majority of the population will spend the holiday focused even
less on its significance than before - perhaps they are closer to emulating
the west that way than they were in the past.
One world-weary salaryman provides a hint that perhaps the Japanese have,
after years of trying, discovered the real essence of a western-style
Christmas. 'I spent about Y30,000 on Christmas Eve last year, including
Y10,000 on a bottle of champagne,' says Mr Chikara Kondo. 'But this year I'm
staying home and watching television.'

FT  24 DEC 94 / Convulsions of the body politic: John Lloyd reviews the
changes that have followed the death of Soviet communism, during his
four-year posting in Moscow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You are transported by calamity Thither where more attends you - William
Shakespeare, Coriolanus.
It is a banal conclusion to draw after four years in the former Soviet
Union, but it is worth remembering - that so much, here, is not what it
seems. The rational expectations of the western mind smash against
contemporary Byzantinism - a brew of secrecy, bureaucratic inertia and a
love of dissimulation.
Russia and the other former Soviet republics preserve, in living form,
traces of previous ages which the less subtle and happier states of the west
have suppressed and mummified. The layers of Russian political society - the
liberals, the modernisers, the communists, the nationalists, the Slavophiles
and the imperialists - remain. They find expression still in the labyrinths
of the bureaucracies, in the media, in the government and regional
leaderships and apparatuses, and most influentially in the network of
competing aides, advisers and guardians of Boris Yeltsin.
I moved to Russia at the low point of Mikhail Gorbachev's efforts to
modernise the Soviet Union - as commandos killed demonstrators in Lithuania
and Latvia, the least assimilated of the former Soviet states. I cease to be
correspondent as a more brutal assault is launched against Chechnya,
territory of a people who have kept warm their wrath against Russia for over
a century and who - it can be judged - will not let it cool again soon.
Plus ca change . . .? On the contrary. Everything is changing, as the death
throes of the greatest social engineering project in history - Soviet
communism - convulse the political body, and the order that will replace it
refuses to take choate shape.
The Financial Times has been part of a western liberal consensus on the
break-up of the Soviet Union: it was enthusiastic for the disintegrative
process. The new elites of the post Soviet states appeared to want a liberal
order: Mikhail Gorbachev was unable to provide it, caught as he was in the
contradictions of his chaotic programme - a 'market' which could not be
based on private property and a 'democracy' which would always choose
socialism. Gorbachev's manoeuvres were seen as the tactics of a fatally
constrained man with a vision of himself as a guardian of progress, endowing
the Soviet people with elements of western liberalism while restraining them
within the bounds of an empire they had not chosen and an economy in which
they could not be free actors.
This view, widely held abroad and by the post-Soviet democrats, was (I still
believe) correct - but it did not, perhaps could not, comprehend the
consequences of the fall of the communist system. Those of us whose tour as
reporters spanned the end of the Soviet Union and the beginning of the
post-Soviet states saw the latter as struggling to be free from the coils of
the former. Our natural inclination, as westerners whose mindsets were
formed in a postwar world where material standards were constantly rising,
was to be optimistic - to assume that the remnants of tyranny would be
succeeded by the sturdy shoots of independence.
I had seen something which could plausibly be described in that way in three
years of reporting in central and eastern Europe. The belief was - it was
not subjected to much analysis - that the Soviet system had been a prison of
belief, of nations, of free thought and association, of enterprise. It had:
but the prisoners had in most cases known nothing else but prison life. Like
old trusties, many liked it, or at least found it impossible to adapt to the
loss of confinement.
Generalisations should always be qualified. The Baltic states are different
societies from the Central Asians; Moldova has little in common with
Azerbaijan. In attempting to rediscover, or fabricate, their own traditions,
the new states plunder the traditions of Islam, Orthodoxy, Lutheranism and
Catholicism; tribalism, autocracy and democracy; mercantilism, corporatism
and neo-liberalism.
The Pope visits Vilnius to give a liberated flock a sense of belonging to
the Catholic family; Professor Jeffrey Sachs seeks to ingrain liberal
economics in the mindsets of the post-Soviet reformers in Russia and
Ukraine; Mr Lee Kuan Yu calls on the President of Kazakhstan and proposes an
authoritarian capitalism. In a late 20th century world, the educated elites
can travel to and observe a political supermarket of social and political
developments to which they may aspire, but cannot attain. The 15 states
which made up the union now have in common a past: but their capacity to
deal with it varies hugely.
Much of my time was spent reporting 'reform'. The reformers in Russia were
men and women who had largely been in the middling ranks of the professional
intelligentsia and who were suddenly given vast power. Their vision,
especially their economic vision of a liberal market economy, was given the
imprimatur of the Russian president even before the union collapsed, because
it appeared to be the only one available. It was the theoretical opposite of
communism: it fitted with the internationalisation of capital which is the
dominant theme of our times; it was promoted by men of brilliance, such as
Yegor Gaidar, Anatoly Chubais and Boris Fyodorov.
Reform in Russia is not dead. The liberations promoted by these men and
their associates have entered the bloodstream and are dynamising its
society. Their inherent belief - that freedom depends on independent
economic actors - is being sorely tested and lacks the support it enjoyed
from a now ailing and isolated president. But ranged against it there are
only the (powerful, to be sure) remnants of now dysfunctional faiths and
reflexes, capable of disruption but without the cohesive and ruthless
philosophy-in-action of communism.
Like other foreign media, the Financial Times reports on the 15 states of
the former Soviet Union from Moscow - though with the advantage of
colleagues in Ukraine, in Central Asia and in the Caucasus. The experience
of travelling (on the fearful Aeroflot and its still more fearful scores of
successor companies) has been one of sharing in small measure the
disorienting experience for Russians of seeing a centralised empire
dislocate as new leaderships attempt to make states of what had been
satrapies. In each there was an initial burst of energy and support for the
new leaders - in many cases, especially in Central Asia, the old leaders
hastily repainted themselves in nationalist, even sometimes in religious,
guise. In each, as time wore on, there has been a closing of the political
space: a hasty re-buttressing of power and privilege, an appalled
realisation of the malignity of the Soviet legacy and the frailty of the
tools of their 'independence'.
But the passage of time also revealed the vast differences in cultures which
had been smothered by Sovietism. Its collapse faced societies with the often
purgatorial task of defining in what their statehood might consist. It was
not a surprise to see Estonia take off smartly in a Scandinavian direction.
It has been more surprising to see little Kyrgyzstan struggle to embed an
unfamiliar democracy in its impoverished valleys.
Ukraine, in which the FT has had a correspondent since 1991 and to which it
has rightly devoted much space, suffers from travails less dramatic than
Russia's but in some ways more wrenching. Its best-known split is between
the 'nationalist' west and the 'unionist' east.
More deeply, most Ukrainians - a people even more cruelly devastated this
century than their neighbours, the Poles - are also torn between belief in
national development and uncertainty as to how it is to be given a solid
base distinct from Russia, whose reflex is still to view such efforts with
derision.
It, and all other post Soviet nations, have played a large part in the
suddenly revived debate on nations and nationalism - a discipline which may
fill something of the yawning gap left by the sudden disappearance of
Sovietology.
A unionist Scot myself, I disliked nationalism, seeing it as narrowing,
kitsch-ridden and coercive: the past four years have produced substantial
modifications in that view. For it became clear that the Soviet Union, the
last great, perverted Enlightenment fantasy of internationalism, could not
and cannot be used as a basis for either modernisation or democratisation.
The successor states have nothing else on which to base their search for
both (if search they will) but nation statehood - even if that is the
artificial construct of a system which never meant them to be nations in the
first or last place. They are thus doomed to find statehood under terrible
conditions.
My last trip as correspondent in Moscow was to Grozny, the capital of
Chechnya - where, as this is written, colleagues are still reporting from
under the now-constant bombing raids, in a courageous display of what our
trade can do at its best: producing the evidence of the effects of power. It
was a terrible trip - not for the discomfort and the fear, but for the
hellish vision it presented. The Chechens, most ferocious of the Caucasian
tribes who pinned down Tsarist armies for the middle decades of the last
century, are led and inspired by men who see no immorality in subjecting
them to the most hopeless odds - indeed, who glorify it as the will of
Allah, as much a prophet of peace as the one whose birthday is celebrated
tomorrow.
The Russians, by turns doubtful and brutal, are driving towards what the
liberals here in the capital see as a fatal collision with the frail gains
of the past three years. Right now, it is hard to shrug off their pessimism.
The president has all but disappeared, his least savoury aides wield most
power, the parliament's purchase is meagre, the military and the secret
services act largely independently - and, more dangerously, in mutual
distrust.
Pushed to defend national integrity by the screeching of the nationalists,
Russia has shed blood in a land whose culture demands that the stain be
exorcised, and whose young men will see honour in revenge. The Caucasian
circle comprehends more than this theatre of war: Abkhazia and Nagorno
Karabakh have both been (uncounted) killing grounds and may be again. This
is not yet the scale of the Bosnian barbarisms, but it begins to court
comparison.
No happy ending. Civil society, the prize promised to those who survived
communism, yet remains out of the reach of most: the ending of the old order
accomplished much more readily than the attainment of a new.

FT  24 DEC 94 / The Power of Communications: United across the airwaves -
The hope given to Rwandan refugees by a radio station
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In its broadcasts from the Rwandan refugee camps in Bukavu, Zaire, Radio
Agatashya proclaims that it is 'the humanitarian radio'. The claim is not a
redundant one, in a community that knows only too well the horrors that can
be initiated by radio.
For most of last summer, the river which marks the border between Rwanda and
Zaire on the southern tip of Lake Kivu was stained with blood. The rickety
wooden bridge at the frontier was blocked to Tutsis attempting to flee the
massacres inside Rwanda. On the Zairean bank, the residents of Bukavu
watched a killing frenzy unfold just metres from where they stood.
One private radio station - Radio Television Libre des Mille Collines -
whipped up the mass hysteria responsible for the extermination of more than
500,000 Tutsis. The mouthpiece of Hutu extremists, it urged Hutus to 'take
your spears, clubs, guns, swords, stones, everything. Sharpen them, hack
them, those enemies, those cockroaches . . .' Even educated Hutus believed
the blood-curdling accounts of alleged atrocities committed by Tutsi rebels
as they swept the country.
'Hunt out the Tutsi,' the radio commanded. 'Who will fill up the half-empty
graves? There is no way the rebels should find alive any of the people they
claim as their own.'
Even after the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front drove the Hutu regime out
of Rwanda, Radio Mille Collines continued to broadcast from mobile stations
inside Zaire.
The Hutu extremists and their militias now rule over the teeming,
cholera-ridden refugee camps in Zaire, Tanzania and Burundi. Under pressure
from UN peacekeepers, however, Radio Mille Collines was dismantled in
August.
In the same month, a team of Swiss journalists from the Lausanne-based
Reporters sans Frontieres launched Radio Agatashya in the refugee camps in
Bukavu. They were determined to restore the refugees' faith in impartial
information.
The station's maiden transmission, on the morning of August 4, came from a
makeshift studio inside a container near the grounds of Bukavu's Jesuit
school. Agatashya means 'the swallow of hope' in Kinyarwanda, the language
chosen for the radio's broadcasts because only one in 10 refugees
understands French.
With time, programmes have been added in French, Kiswahili and English.
Seven Rwandan journalists - all active in human rights organisations during
the civil war - and three Zaireans have been recruited to the reporting
team. For the Swiss journalists, the most important task has been that of
guaranteeing the station's political impartiality and independence. They
carefully screen every programme before it goes on air for possible signs of
bias.
Establishing the radio's credibility with a community haunted by genocide
and saturated with hate propaganda has not been easy. In Rwanda, radio has
been the tool of one side or another. It has not been neutral.
'It has been difficult to win acceptance by both sides of the Rwandan
conflict,' says Mr Philippe Dahinden, the radio's project co-ordinator. 'If
we had based ourselves inside Rwanda, we would have been automatically
branded as pro-Tutsi. So we chose Bukavu, to reassure the 340,000 refugees
here that this radio is meant for them.'
Locating in Bukavu has generated other problems. Agatashya's journalists
were threatened by Hutu extremists for reporting on the acrimonious
departure of Medecins sans Frontieres from Bukavu's refugee camps last
month. The medical charity, shocked at the killings of refugees wanting to
return to Rwanda, pulled out of Bukavu, arguing that it had become
'ethically impossible for MSF to continue aiding and abetting the
perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide'.
But the threats against the radio station were only that. Mr Dahinden
believes Hutu leaders have refrained from harming Radio Agatashya or its
reporters because it is virtually the only source of independent information
available to them.
'Everyone listens to Radio Agatashya. We are recognised instantly in the
camps. Even if there are few radios among such a huge refugee population,
news is often passed on by word of mouth. And because we transmit in
Kinyarwanda, there is less risk of manipulation, because people are not
dependent on someone translating from French or English.'
The radio is also heard in south-western Rwanda and, with the expected
arrival of transmitters, will soon penetrate deeper into Rwanda and reach
the refugees in Goma, on the northern shores of Lake Kivu.
Much of Radio Agatashya's airtime is devoted to the provision of public
information services.
Lists of children in the care of the International Committee of the Red
Cross are read out regularly, helping many families to reunite. Parents also
put out search appeals for missing children or lost relatives.
There are programmes on how to prevent cholera and dysentery - which killed
tens of thousands when the refugees first flooded across the border - and on
how to improve hygiene in the overcrowded camps. There are also health
programmes for pregnant women, on the care of infants, and on the dangers of
Aids and other sexually transmitted diseases.
But it is the twice-daily news bulletins that pull in the listeners. The
refugees still do not trust Radio Rwanda - controlled by the new government
in Kigali - while Radio Zaire has little relevance to their lives. Radio
Agatashya, which has reporters working in Rwanda as well as Zaire, is the
only station capable of breaking the terrible isolation that engulfs them.
'The refugees are desperate to know what is happening in Rwanda,' says Mr
Dunia Hategekimanam, the Rwandan co-ordinator of Agatashya's bureau in
Kigali. 'We try to get out to the villages and interview those who have
returned; and say what state the crops are in, and what the security
situation is like in different districts.'
So far, Radio Agatashya has refrained from broadcasting appeals for the
refugees to return home. Rwanda has yet to restore its judicial system and a
civilian police force. Amid verifiable reports of arrests and summary
executions conducted by former Tutsi guerrillas, now known as the Rwandan
Patriotic Army, the Agatashya team believes it may be too early to disband
the refugee camps. As a result Radio Agatashya, which began life as a
six-month project, has been extended, with Swiss government aid, for another
year.
'National reconciliation will be difficult and it will take time,' Mr
Dahinden says. 'The criminals have still not been separated from the
ordinary Hutu refugees. But there are men and women of good faith who are
striving to overcome the fear between both communities. As journalists, the
best we can hope to achieve is to restore their faith in accurate and
non-partisan information.'

FT  24 DEC 94 / Leading Article: On earth, peace?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
English-speaking Christians have for centuries proclaimed 'on earth peace,
good will toward men' at this season, following the Authorised Version of
the Bible. The words attributed by St Luke to the heavenly host outside
Bethlehem, however, are more exactly rendered as 'on earth peace among men
of good will'. This is quite an important distinction. The passage in its
original form gives no warrant for pure pacifism. It implicitly recognises
that there are also men of ill will, who pose a threat to peace and should
not expect to benefit from it.
It is a perennial dilemma, and not only for Christians. The value of peace
has always to be weighed against the danger of rewarding aggression,
consecrating injustice, and thereby encouraging men of ill will to persist
in the threat and use of force. The definition of 'men of good will' is
inevitably subjective. In many cases peace can only be made by accepting
professions of good will from those who hitherto have given and received ill
will in abundant measure; and by allowing them to keep what seem thoroughly
ill-gotten gains.
Topical examples abound. Black South Africans have had to accept leaders of
the National party, which devised and implemented apartheid, as men of good
will; and to accept, as part of the price of peace, the perpetuation of
gross disparities in average wealth between white and black. Palestinians
are being told, without any assurance that they will get a state of their
own, that the path to peace lies through acceptance of the permanent loss of
many of their homes, and the greater part of their country.
Israelis are asked to accept that peace involves giving power to a man whose
whole career was built on violence against them and denial of their state's
right to exist; while law-abiding people in Northern Ireland are told that
peace requires concessions to people who have sought them through terror and
violence in preference to the ballot box.
Public opinion
In these cases, world public opinion applauds those who put peace before
justice, and condemns those who believe the price they are asked to pay for
peace is too high. Yet few argue that Britain would have been right to make
peace with Hitler in 1940; and most people still recoil at the suggestion
that Bosnia should accept a peace based on the simple ratification of Serb
conquests.
In all such discussions, the claims of equity have to be weighed against
those of realism. No one nowadays argues (as in the past many did) that war
is good and healthy in itself. All agree that it is at best a necessary
evil, and therefore those who argue for it in some circumstances have to
demonstrate that the net result of pursuing it will be less bad than the
alternative.
The Catholic doctrine of the just war, which requires among other things a
reasonable prospect of victory, is not as Machiavellian as it sounds; or
rather, it shows that Machiavelli is not as unethical as he is often
painted. Ethics does not forbid political leaders to weigh carefully the
practical consequences of their decisions. On the contrary, it requires them
to do so, most of all when faced with a choice between war and peace.
Complex conflicts
In the early 1990s, the end of the cold war and the reversal of Iraq's
aggression against Kuwait gave rise to hopes that justice could henceforth
be effectively upheld by international action, and that realism would no
longer dictate the acceptance of flagrant injustice as the price of peace.
But since then, attention has focused on more complex conflicts, where
citizens of the same state are ranged on opposite sides, so that consensus
is not easily reached among outsiders about the precise balance of right and
wrong, or about the degree of external aggression, if any. International
intervention in these conflicts has been confused, half-hearted and
agonisingly slow, especially in contrast to the decisive and spectacular
action against Iraq.
In Somalia and Bosnia, 'humanitarian' intervention may only have served to
prolong conflict. In Rwanda, intervention came too late to prevent the
massacre of up to a million people. The result is disillusionment and a
return to passivity. Not only is Russian brutality in the Caucasus
considered beyond the reach of western influence. In Algeria, on the
doorstep of western Europe, a civil war is now claiming 700 lives a week,
yet is virtually ignored by the outside world. The UN Security Council has
not even discussed the matter.
Peace has become divisible. After briefly glimpsing a new world order, the
victors of the cold war have resigned themselves to tolerating anarchy in
large areas of the globe, so long as their own material interests are not
directly threatened. No doubt a dose of realism and modesty was required,
after the euphoria of early 1991. But between euphoria and abdication there
is, or should be, a sense of the responsibility that goes with wealth and
power, and of the longer-term risks involved in letting men of ill will have
their way.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Appeal could hinge on tribunal report: Defence lawyers say
evidence would have made material difference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the main elements of the Guinness Court of Appeal applications is a
little-known December 1988 tribunal report into TWH Management, a licensed
share-dealing company.
The tribunal, chaired by former circuit judge Lord Grantchester, was held to
consider an appeal against a Department of Trade and Industry ruling that
the company be stripped of its licence.
The tribunal sat in private to consider a series of share transactions
carried out by TWH involving indemnities against possible losses given to
the purchaser of the shares.
It examined seven cases of indemnified share support operations being used
at about the same time as Guinness's Pounds 2.6bn takeover for Distillers in
January 1986. One of these was TWH's own involvement in the share support
scheme used in the Guinness takeover.
The tribunal judgment was known to the Serious Fraud Office at the time of
the first Guinness trial in 1990, but the SFO failed to make it available to
the defendants.
Lawyers of the four men who were convicted at that trial, including
stockbroker Mr Anthony Parnes and entrepreneur Mr Gerald Ronson, believe
that had the tribunal report been made available to them, it would have made
a material difference to the conduct of their defence.
The tribunal report came to light during the second Guinness trial, which
collapsed in 1992, involving Mr Roger Seelig, former director of Morgan
Grenfell, the merchant bank, and Lord Spens, former director of Henry
Ansbacher. That trial was abandoned due to the ill-health suffered by Mr
Seelig, but Lord Spens, who was subsequently acquitted, believes disclosure
of the tribunal report would itself have led to the case being dismissed.
'There is nothing wrong with indemnities,' Lord Spens said. 'But the
existence of the report had been well and truly hidden.'
In a letter to the Financial Times in June, Lord Spens said: 'The evidence
and judgment of this tribunal were kept secret by the government for some
three years (for reasons that will become abundantly clear) and not revealed
to the defence in the second Guinness trial until forced out of the
prosecution on the evening of the 54th day.'
Lord Spens wrote: 'I am satisfied that, had this evidence been made
available to the first Guinness trial, it too would have collapsed and none
of those defendants would have been convicted.'
The TWH tribunal considered six other cases involving indemnities given to
the purchaser of shares:
October 1985 - an indemnity to cover purchases of United Newspapers shares
to assist that company in its takeover bid for Fleet Holdings.
February 1986 - an indemnity to cover BPCC share purchases.
April 1986 - indemnities to cover purchases of Extel shares to assist in the
takeover of CFE Publications.
June 1986 - indemnities to cover purchase of Next shares during its bid for
Grattan.
September 1986 - indemnities to cover purchases of Lowe Howard Spink Bell
shares to assist in its takeover bid for Good Relations.
September 1986 - indemnities to cover purchases of Allied Plant shares to
assist in its takeover bid for George Dew.
Directors of TWH claimed in interviews with the SFO that they believed such
practices were proper and common.
In the report, Lord Grantchester said: 'There is nothing intrinsically
improper in the purchase and sale of shares in the market under an indemnity
arrangement entered into between the dealer and a third party. In principle
there is little or no difference between such a transaction and a purchase
in the name of a nominee.' The tribunal recommended to the trade and
industry secretary that TWH's licence should not be revoked.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Queen's broadcast goes on Internet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christmas television is going to be launched in cyberspace for the first
time on Christmas day with the Queen's broadcast leading the way.
In what is claimed to be the first rudimentary television schedule to be
transmitted on the Internet global computer network, a London consultancy
called Intervid is offering three hours of programmes.
After the midday launch fanfare, the Christmas schedule will get under way
with Xmas With the First Family - breakfast with Mr and Mrs Clinton courtesy
of the White House pages of the Internet World Wide Web.
Then it is Herbie Hancock live from Japan via a feed from NHK, the Japanese
broadcaster. The Queen will be broadcast later - one minute after the real
thing.
Internet users with special software - CU-SeeMe - will be able to see the
schedule with the majority of viewers likely to be in California and Japan.
University College London has helped by making bandwidth available to the
service.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Labour urges curb on 'board excess'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday outlined proposals for clamping down on what it says are
excessive executive salary increases. It claimed that all 12 regional
electricity company chairmen had made Pounds 1m out of privati-sation.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said the government was 'vulnerable to
defeat . . . over the issue of boardroom excesses' during debate on the
finance bill.
He called for the following proposals to be adopted:
Executive share options should be taxed as income.
New powers should be given to regulators enabling them to cut prices where
there are 'boardroom excesses'.
More information should be provided in company accounts on 'pay perks and
handouts' to top directors.
Remuneration committees should be opened up to make them 'more
representative'.
Mr Brown said the proposals would force ministers to 'come off the fence on
the scandal of salary excesses in the privatised boardrooms'. His attack
came as Labour released figures indicating that 63 electricity company
directors held share options entitling them to notional profits of an
average of nearly Pounds 500,000.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Late surge by shoppers dispels sluggish mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Regional Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shoppers have been out on the high streets and in the retail centres with
growing enthusiasm over the last two weeks, in contrast to predictions of
gloomy Christmas trading.
The pattern has varied but the evidence points to what Mr George McDonald,
manager of the Eldon Square shopping centre in Newcastle, called 'a late
thrust'. Yesterday afternoon he said that the number of shoppers was rising:
'It's stronger at this point than in the last two or three days and it's
still building.'
In London Mr David Elliott, merchandise director at Selfridges department
store, said: 'We have had a brilliant Thursday and a brilliant week.' At
Brent Cross in north London, Mrs Mary Cullen, the marketing manager, said:
'We would normally see around 250,000 people a week but this week there have
been 300,000 to 400,000.'
Transax, which provides a cheque guarantee service to 48,000 UK retailers,
has noted the build-up. In the four weeks to last weekend, the value of
cheques it guaranteed was 2.8 per cent higher than in 1993, this week the
value has been growing at 3 per cent a day.
Steady increases in business have been particularly marked at the newer
regional shopping centres. At Meadowhall in Sheffield the number of visitors
rose 14.7 per cent between mid-September and mid-December, while last
Saturday was a record day.
The number of visitors at Merry Hill in the west Midlands during the
Christmas trading period has been 5 per cent higher than in 1993 and they
have spent 14 per cent more. At MetroCentre, Gateshead, there has been a 15
per cent rise in the number of visitors.
Smaller centres also claimed to have bucked the sluggish trade trend. 'We
have found it an exceptional Christmas with most retailers trading up to 30
per cent better than last year,' said Mr Colin Antrobus, manager of the
Regent Arcade in Cheltenham. People were waiting two hours to see Father
Christmas.
In Manchester, city centre trading has been less dramatic. At the Arndale
centre there have been 8 per cent more shoppers than last year but retailers
are cautious about whether turnover is level or a little higher.
Sunday trading provided cheering news. Ms Jackie Prosser, marketing manager
at the Arndale, said: 'There has definitely been more business, not a
thinner spread of what was there already.'
Ms Lesley March, marketing manager at Merry Hill, said: 'Sunday trading has
been brilliant for us. There's never been a bad weekend.' She added that
Sunday trading now accounted for 16 per cent of turnover.

FT  24 DEC 94 / SFO chief defends its actions over Guinness: Cover-up
allegations denied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Staple, the director of the Serious Fraud Office, yesterday
defended the actions of the SFO in the Guinness trial and said it would
fight the appeal involving the four original defendants.
He strongly refuted allegations of a cover-up made earlier yesterday by Lord
Spens, another Guinness defendant.
He told the Financial Times: 'What Lord Spens is saying is pretty
extravagant stuff frankly. It's not true. We are not here to deny people's
human rights. We are here to ensure, so far as we can, that people have a
fair trial.'
He added: 'Of course we are here to secure convictions where we believe
somebody has committed fraud . . . but we are not here to win at all costs.
We are here to ensure that the court receives the fullest information so
that ultimately the jury can decide.'
The appeal relates to a claim that the SFO withheld material evidence from
the four defendants in the first Guinness trial. Mr Staple was not in charge
at the SFO when the case was put together but he yesterday assumed full
responsibility on behalf of his organisation. He said the office had taken
the view at the time of the first Guinness trial that material showing that
share support operations, of the kind practised in the Guinness case, were
common practice in the the 1980s was not relevant.
'Only when Lord Spens' trial began, did it become apparent that the material
was relevant to his defence and it was produced.' He added: 'It was produced
entirely voluntarily. There was no suppression in any sense.'
A successful appeal could open up claims for an unprecedented amount of
compensation. Based on the fines given to the defendants, and additional
claims for personal and associated business losses, some estimates yesterday
were putting these at between Pounds 30m and Pounds 40m. Mr Staple said: 'It
sounds to me a huge amount of money to compensate anybody for but I can't
say whether it is right, near right, or wildly exaggerated.'
He also defended the SFO's conviction rate - he put it at 80 per cent of
cases against the Labour party's estimate of 40 per cent.
A draft report on the future of the SFO is soon to go before government. Mr
Staple seemed to anticipate an overhaul in the way fraud cases would be
dealt with in the future.
He said some cases that the SFO prosecuted through the criminal courts could
in future be dealt with by tribunals.
He refused to accept however that Guinness had sounded the death knell for
the SFO after other setbacks such as the Blue Arrow case.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Nightmare before Christmas on the QE2: The trials and
tribulations of passengers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY, RICHARD TOMKINS and WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Early last Sunday Andrew Lennox was cold, stiff and fed up. After sleeping
for three hours in a corridor, he got up, adjusted the hard hat he had put
on for safety, and set off to find somewhere more comfortable.
A sign saying Purser's Office reminded him where he was. This was not an
unfinished Spanish hotel but the Queen Elizabeth 2, the world's most famous
passenger liner and what the chief executive of Cunard, its owner, would
later call a 'national heritage monument'.
As Mr Lennox wandered deeper into the ship, it hardly resembled a monument.
Cables and pipes protruded from holes in the ceiling, building equipment was
strewn everywhere, and cabin furniture stacked in open spaces. Some
passengers without cabins were sleeping on mattresses, while some of the 400
workers still on board were making themselves comfortable as best they
could.
Later this week, as news of conditions on the QE2 filled the newspapers,
what started as an inconvenience for passengers turned into a public
relations disaster for the liner and its operator. The reputation of the
British ship outfitting industry was also threatened as tales of the 'Horror
Cruise' emerged.
For Mr Lennox, the priority was getting to sleep. Spying an empty cabin on
3-Deck which at least had a bed in it, he lay down. Not the ideal start to
his 30th birthday.
It was also not the way Cunard executives had planned the QE2's Pounds 30m
refit. Twenty-five years after the liner's maiden voyage, the refurbishment
was supposed to prepare it for the 21st century.
'We had to invest in the vessel or take another course,' said Mr Robin
Wilkins, Cunard's commercial director. The 'other course' was building a new
liner.
In addition to structural alterations, all 963 cabins - 720 with en suite
bathrooms - were to be re-equipped; three restaurants, the casino and the
library rebuilt; and two new nightclubs and a pub constructed.
To save on the costs of keeping the liner in dry dock, the refit was to be
attempted in just a month. Although workmen would be on board from July, the
ship would be out of service only from November 14 to December 14 - leaving
it ready to sail on its Christmas cruise on December 17.
That meant thousands of workers from more than 50 companies being flown to
Hamburg's Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard to work to a complex timetable. Cunard
admitted the programme was ambitious but said it was achievable.
'All the contractors knew what they were undertaking and were prepared to
tender for it. They convinced us they could finish on time,' said Mr Michael
Gallagher of Cunard.
By late November, the QE2 was in dry dock and virtually unrecognisable,
buried under a mass of cables, cranes, ladders and workers. On December 13,
as planned, it sailed for Southampton, the vast majority of the work
complete.
But inside, a small number of contractors had fallen behind. When the ship
docked in Southampton the next day, Cunard officials were alarmed at the
state of the cabins and neighbouring corridors, but said they were assured
by contractors that hundreds of men working round the clock could transform
the ship in just a few days.
On Friday December 16, further inspections convinced Cunard officials that
not everyone due to sail on the QE2 the next day could be accommodated.
Determined not to cancel the cruise, Cunard decided to contact some of the
passengers and offer compensation if they abandoned their trip.
'We felt we had a duty and obligation to fulfil the holiday requirements
over the Christmas period. We felt it was very important to stick to that
schedule,' said Mr John Olsen, Cunard's chief executive.
Only 300 passengers could be contacted. Several hundred others arriving in
Southampton the following day faced an unpleasant shock.
Most passengers knew nothing of the problems. They checked in about 2pm and
settled down in the passenger lounge to wait for the 5pm departure.
At 4.30pm Cunard announced there had been a short delay and the ship would
sail at 6pm. Boarding began, with round-the-world cruise passengers escorted
on first.
Two hours later, stewards entered the lounge where almost 300 passengers
were still waiting and made an announcement: owing to delayed completion of
refitting work, insufficient cabins were available and no more passengers
could be taken on board.
'That was perhaps the worst moment of all,' said Mr Lennox. 'There was
absolute chaos.'
The next few hours passed in confusion, as 190 passengers agreed to go home
in return for a full refund, and a free cruise next year, plus Pounds 250
spending money. Added to the 300 whose holidays were cancelled the day
before, that made 490 passengers left behind.
Another 80 insisted on boarding the ship anyway, knowing their cabins would
not be ready. The ship sailed six hours late at 11pm, with many still
looking for somewhere to sleep.
Many of the public areas, as Cunard claimed, had been finished to a high
standard. But in some areas, especially towards the rear of the ship and on
3-Deck, conditions resembled a 'building site'.
Mr Andrew Coad, a Briton living in Montclair, New Jersey, said: 'The higher
up the deck, the less dissatisfied people were. The predominant problems
appeared to be on 2-Deck and 3-Deck.'
Mr Coad, who ended up on 3-Deck, said he and his wife were originally given
a room that had water slopping in the entrance, no carpet, and builders'
materials in the middle of the floor.
'Eventually we went to the purser's office and they told us the ship was
about to sail.' He demanded that the ship did not sail until they had
satisfaction.
Mr Coad and his wife were taken to another cabin that at first seemed
acceptable but had no running water. 'It was three days before we got
running water and 3 1/2 days before the toilet would flush,' Mr Coad said.
Mrs Katherine Justice, 70, and her friend Mrs Megan Taverner, 73, said they
were both suffering from sickness and diarrhoea, but their cabin had no
water, no air conditioning and no flushing toilet.
'We washed in a carafe with two flannels,' Mrs Justice said. 'They gave us a
wine carafe - they put that in there, with ice - and as soon as the ice
melted, we used our flannels to wash: her flannel first, then mine after,
for two days.
'It's horrific what happened to us. We are not the nouveaux riches. It's a
dream, isn't it, the QE2 - somebody kind and loving to look after your every
need. We couldn't even get water.'
Mr Stewart Manville, a 67-year-old museum archivist from White Plains, New
York, said: 'I think the basic problem was that the plumbing job was done in
too much of a hurry. Several times a day you would hear the announcement
'Niagara] Niagara] Niagara]' which meant that the special team that was
there to stem the leaks would come running.
'When I first got on, my toilet worked, thank God. But I was helping a
contractor find bedrooms for some of his workers, and we tried several
cabins where the toilets weren't working. Eventually we figured out that if
you took the douche spray from the bath and sprayed it into the toilet, you
could make it flush.'
To cap everything, the QE2 ran into force nine gales shortly after leaving
Southampton. Seasickness among passengers and workers caused further delays
to refitting, and on Tuesday another 158 UK passengers due to join the
cruise in New York had their holidays cancelled. Cunard's nightmare was
worsening.
Back in London, Cunard found the spotlight trained on its handling of the
affair. Industry observers believe it made many mistakes. The first was
going ahead with the cruise.
A hotel company executive aboard the ship said: 'The best option would have
been to cancel the cruise, apologise and give everyone their money back.'
A second mistake was the failure to take on public relations consultants,
but rely instead on Cunard's two beleaguered press spokesmen to handle
hundreds of calls from the world's media.
'They should have taken on a good agency and begun a massive damage
limitation exercise as soon as the problems began last Saturday,' said a PR
consultant.
Perhaps the biggest mistake, having allowed the cruise to go ahead, was to
fail to make any apology or compensation offer to passengers as they crossed
the Atlantic.
'That was what really irritated us,' said Mr Lennox. 'We never got any kind
of apology from Cunard. But we knew people left behind had already been
offered compensation.'
'We have no complaints about the crew, who were absolutely marvellous,' he
added. 'But Cunard's attitude was terrible.'
Disgruntled passengers met the liner's captain, Ron Warwick, last Tuesday
and asked him to secure an apology and compensation offer from Cunard.
On Wednesday, at an angry meeting with about 250 passengers, Capt Warwick
reported that Cunard had simply advised passengers to write to their nearest
Cunard office when they arrived home.
Some passengers were incensed. About 150, of whom Mr Lennox emerged as
leader, threatened a sit-in in New York until Cunard directors came on board
with offers of compensation.
Not all passengers agreed on the action to be taken, however. Speaking from
the ship on Wednesday, Mr Peter Ludlow, a passenger travelling with his
girlfriend on a Pounds 7,500 cruise to the Caribbean, remarked: 'It's all
getting quite factional here, among the passengers. It's getting a bit like
Bosnia.'
The next day Cunard began its fightback. Mr Olsen gave a press conference in
New York to confirm he would meet the ship.
As the QE2 docked in New York on Thursday night, 11 hours late but in a
better condition than it had left Southampton, Mr Olsen was waiting with
soothing words, an offer of reimbursement for the transatlantic leg of all
passengers' journeys and 25 per cent off another Cunard cruise. The
threatened sit-in was averted but yesterday passengers faced further delays
in sailing after the US Coastguard refused to give the ship a safety
certificate.
US passengers were reported to be planning a class action suit which, if
successful, could cost Cunard millions of dollars. In total, the company
already faces the cost of reimbursing about 1,000 passengers who had paid
between Pounds 500 and Pounds 5,000 for transatlantic cruises and of
providing many with free cruises next year.
There may also be longer-term effects, both for Cunard and other cruise
operators.
'The cost in terms of consumer confidence in the company could be high,'
said Mr Keith Betton of the Association of British Travel Agents.
However, Mr William Gibbons, director of the Passenger Shipping Association,
did not believe the QE2's problems would damage the image of the cruise
industry.
'People perceive the QE2 as a one-off, prestige vessel,' he said. 'Generally
people have a high opinion of cruise holidays and they have short memories.
They will have forgotten about this in a few months.' Those who travelled on
the ship might not forget so quickly.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Nuclear levy to be held at 10%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nuclear Electric, which operates nuclear power stations in England and
Wales, has agreed to postpone revenues from the nuclear levy in order to
prevent an increase in the controversial tax on electricity bills.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, announced
yesterday that the levy would remain at 10 per cent for another 12 months
even though receipts were running Pounds 300m behind plan.
Prof Littlechild said the levy should have gone up to 13 per cent next April
to make up the shortfall. Nuclear Electric was willing to forgo an increase
because it had enough short-term cash.
Yesterday's announcement means it is unclear how the shortfall will be
recouped. It could foreshadow a much steeper increase in the levy in
1997-98. However, Prof Littlechild said that he hoped an increase would not
be necessary.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Mayhew hints at big cut in RUC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, has hinted that the
Royal Ulster Constabulary may eventually be cut to little more than a
quarter of its present strength, David Owen writes.
He told the Yorkshire Evening Press that the province's policing needs 'in
ordinary times' might be 'of the order of 3,500', compared with 12,000
officers at present.
But Mr Ken Maginnis, security spokesman for the moderate Ulster Unionist
party, said he thought Sir Patrick was 'way, way out'.
He said the existence of 'mafioso-style' protection rackets and drug
trafficking meant the province needed at least 7,500 police officers. He
said he doubted if a reduction to even this level would be achieved in the
next five years.
The Rev William McCrea of the hardline Democratic Unionist party said Sir
Patrick was talking about a 'hypothetical situation'. He added: 'There is
not a genuine peace.'

FT  24 DEC 94 / BSkyB and Reuters on verge of partnership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television company, and Reuters, the
news and information group, are on the verge of an international television
partnership deal.
The deal, expected to be finalised early next year, will give Reuters - an
organisation with an illustrious brand name in international news in text
form - its biggest push so far into television.
For BSkyB, the link will help to cut the Pounds 30m-a-year cost of the
lossmaking Sky News, the 24-hour satellite service, while greatly expanding
its network of correspondents.
The partnership will also provide the platform for Sky to go international
and challenge both Independent Television News and the BBC, which is
expanding globally through BBC World, a 24-hour satellite television news
service.
Earlier this year, Mr Sam Chisholm, chief executive of BSkyB, a consortium
in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, is a significant
shareholder, confirmed he had been talking to ITN but emphasised that the
organisation was only one of a number of potential partners.
ITN was offering to supply Sky News in its entirety, under contract for
BSkyB - something that would have seriously hit jobs at Sky News.
The precise structure of the BSkyB-Reuters partnership is still being
negotiated although it is believed to be unlikely that it will be a simple
50-50 deal.
One of the main possibilities that could flow from a formal agreement is a
central challenge to ITN in the UK market.
Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act, the Independent Television Commission has
to decide by the end of next year how many news suppliers there should be
for commercial television.
At the moment ITN, chaired by Mr Michael Green, the Carlton Communications
chairman and chief executive, is sole news provider to both ITV and Channel
4.
The commission will review ITN's performance towards the end of next year
and decide whether there is room for competition from a second commercial
television news supplier.
A Sky News-Reuters partnership could become a credible rival to ITN and
might be supported by a number of ITV companies which are not ITN
shareholders. They would have an obvious commercial interest in at least
using the threat of competition to reduce the cost of news supply.
In the international arena, the possibilities range from a special version
of Sky aimed at the Asian market through Mr Rupert Murdoch's Star satellite
television service, to going on DirecTV, the recently launched digital
satellite television system covering the US.
Reuters is already in the television news agency business through Reuters
Television, formally Visnews, and more recently has expanded into
specialised financial television for European dealers and marketmakers.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Fishermen angered by Spanish deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fishermen yesterday voiced their anger at the deal agreed by European Union
ministers to allow Spanish trawlers increased access to coastal waters
around the UK.
Mr Geoff Bullus, a Newlyn fisherman and director of the Cornish Fish
Producers Association, said: 'We've been totally screwed. How much more bad
language can you listen to?' He added: 'The Spanish fleet will destroy
whatever stocks of fish are left out there.'
Under the deal agreed by ministers on Thursday night, Spain will be allowed
access to the Celtic Sea - between south-east Ireland and south-west England
 -and will be able to send 40 trawlers to the sensitive Irish Box, the
waters around south-west Ireland where many fish have their breeding
grounds.
Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, abstained on the vote which
agreed the compromise deal. He succeeded in excluding Spanish trawlers from
the Irish Sea and the Bristol Channel but Mr John Sayles, a Shetland
fisherman, said: 'This is just a stepping stone, soon they'll be claiming
access to the North Sea.'
Mr John Ashworth, who runs the Save Britain's Fish campaign, said increased
access would lead to cuts in British fishing capacity. 'This won't happen
overnight, but sadly, the Brits will have to go in order to make room for
the Spanish.'
Mr Ashworth is campaigning for Britain to leave the Common Fisheries Policy
and claims support from 75 per cent of the nation's fishermen.
Mr Bullus said the deal would force the British fleet to ignore quotas and
other regulations to survive.
Mr Waldegrave said: 'I'm not saying this deal is perfect. I would have liked
more. But at the beginning of the week we would have been rather happy to
know we were going to get this much.'

FT  24 DEC 94 / Training body's failure reveals funding minefield
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The appointment of receivers by the Department of Employment at South Thames
Training and Enterprise Council on Wednesday singled out the Tec for weak
financial controls and trading losses. But it also illustrated some of the
funding pressures that are faced by the employer-led training bodies.
Leaders of Tecs, which administer government training in England and Wales,
say they operate under one of the most rigorous funding and auditing regimes
in the public sector.
Tecs are audited up to five times a year - by the Department of Employment
head office, one of its regional offices, the National Audit Office, the
European Commission and Companies House.
The 82 Tecs are set up as companies and receive most of their funding - a
total of about Pounds 2bn a year - from the government. But unlike quangos,
which are funded by grants, Tecs are paid in arrears for services delivered.
The Tecs act as purchasing authorities, contracting with private-sector
training providers to deliver services such as Training for Work, the scheme
for the unemployed.
If a Tec fails to meet the targets that it sets with government, it does not
get paid. It must also prove that the contracted services have been
delivered before payment is received.
It is understood that South Thames Tec has lost Pounds 2m over the past
eight months, primarily because it did not provide satisfactory evidence of
its claims to the government.
Ms Gwynneth Flower, chief executive of Centec in London, said the claims
evidence had to come from training providers, and therefore financial
control was crucial. 'The principal threat I would see in a Tec is if it
does not manage its contractors effectively.'
Tecs must also provide extra services - such as childcare - which the
government does not fund.
These are paid for with the surpluses they make on government-funded
programmes. They find contractors to provide training for less than the
amount the employment department would pay the Tec for the service.
It is believed that South Thames Tec was trying to provide services it could
not afford as it was not making a surplus.
Mr David Liddell, acting chief executive who replaced Mr Michael Hanson when
he resigned in August, said: 'We would have been spending over the budgeted
government income deliberately because we thought we had surpluses from the
previous year.'

FT  24 DEC 94 / LME member fined Pounds 60,000 for rules breach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Metal Exchange has imposed a fine of Pounds 60,000 on Sucden
(UK), part of the Compagnie Financiere Sucres et Denrees (CFSD) group of
France. It is believed to be the first substantial fine imposed by the LME's
disciplinary committee under its self-regulatory system.
The LME said that its rules had been breached in May when Sucden (UK) had
applied to change from associate membership to one of the LME's 18
ring-dealing members. Sucden (UK) had not disclosed that CFSD was looking
for a partner - and possibly a majority shareholder - in Terminvest, its
immediate parent.
The exchange's rules insist that every applicant for change of membership
status should disclose all material information, including any possible
change in ownership, even of a minority interest, in an immediate parent
company.
The LME said its fine would have been more severe were it not for the fact
that the offence was one of omission and 'no statement of fact was made to
the LME which constituted a positive misrepresentation by Sucden'. There
were also circumstances that 'rendered the failure to disclose partially
excusable'.
Negotiations took place for the Winchester Commodities group to take over
Sucden (UK) after it gained ring-dealing status, but these were called off
at the end of November.
CFSD recently restructured its futures trading operations and said Sucden
(UK) was no longer for sale.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Mexico put on negative credit watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico was placed on negative credit watch yesterday by the international
rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's, as both investors and the government
struggled to make sense of the implications of this week's 29 per cent
devaluation of the Mexican peso.
Ms Lacy Gallagher, Mexico analyst at S&amp;P, explained that Mexico's long-term
rating was likely to stay in the BB spectrum, but that the credit watch
meant the current BB+ could be downgraded to BB or BB- in the next months.
'The basic question is how the government is going to manage the crisis in
confidence that has arisen. We are going to be watching very closely how
they follow through on the commitments (about economic policy) they have
made to investors over the past few days,' Ms Gallagher said.
Analysts said that, after the 'hostile' meeting in New York on Thursday of
70 money managers and Mr Jaime Serra Puche, Mexican finance minister,
confidence could only be restored if questions about inflationary pressures,
privatisation revenues and monetary and fiscal policy were adequately
addressed - something that did not happen in the meeting.
'The investors asked for complete details - with numbers and projections and
everything - and frankly that is very difficult at the moment,' said a
senior Mexican finance ministry official. 'We are going into brainstorming
mode and, by the end of next week, we ought to have an outline that will be
satisfactory.'
The official said projections would be hard to make until the peso had
stabilised.
The spot middle peso weakened late yesterday to finish at 4.925 to the
dollar. The main Mexican stock market index was up 1.54 per cent at the
close, but analysts said it would not be a good reflection of confidence
until the peso rate was stabilised and equity prices could be valued in
dollars. Mexican stocks trading in New York were virtually unchanged on the
day.
Analysts estimate that Mexico's budget will have to be cut by between 2 and
4 per cent of GDP, or approximately Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn) to Dollars
10bn, in order to make up for increasing interest payments on foreign debt
and for lower tax revenues from an expected slowdown in the economy. Some of
this gap will be closed by lowering resources available to development
banks.
Privatisation revenue, generated by sales of existing electricity and
petrochemical plants, is being touted as a potential saviour. Executives in
those industries say they are interested, especially because serious
bargains might be found, but that financing those purchases will be very
difficult.
Inflation is the other problem, especially as merchants in Mexico City and
on the US border began to ignore the government freeze and raise prices.
'Its simply not clear how they are going to keep wages and price pressures
down,' said Ms Joyce Chang, analyst in the emerging markets group at Salomon
Brothers.

<TEXT>
West German import prices moved up sharply between October and November,
bearing out the Bundesbank's determination to combat future inflation as
expressed in its latest money supply target for 1995. The November import
price level was 0.8 per cent above that for the previous month and 2.2 per
cent above November 1993, the federal statistics office said. The yearly
rate is higher than the 1.9 per cent recorded in both September and October.
Producer prices have also been rising more rapidly. Both indicators suggest
a later upturn in inflation rates.

Farmers, the US insurance group owned by BAT Industries of the UK, was
ordered by California's insurance commissioner yesterday to repay Dollars
183m (Pounds 117m) of premiums to policyholders under the state's
controversial Proposition 103 law. The 1988 law, which required insurers to
roll back premiums and pay rebates to Californian holders of car and other
insurance policies, was recently upheld by the state's supreme court, in
spite of opposition from the US insurance industry.
The Farmers directive comes a month after Mr John Garamendi, the Californian
insurance commissioner, ordered 28 other US insurers to make a total of
Dollars 1.25bn in Proposition 103 repayments. In a separate action, Mr
Garamendi ordered Farmers to end its policy of issuing earthquake insurance
policies with deductibles of up to 25 per cent.

Greece's Socialist government said yesterday that it had picked Germany's
Hochtief to build a Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.5bn) airport for the capital.
Hochtief, a consortium that includes Flughafen Frankfurt/Main, will have a
45 per cent stake in the airport. The state will retain the other 55 per
cent for 30 years, after which it will buy out Hochtief and take full
control. The new airport will be built at Athens's eastern suburb of Spata
and is expected to take 4 1/2 years to build. It will initially be able to
handle 16m passengers per year. The Socialists defeated a conservative
government last year and scrapped an agreement giving Hochtief 60 per cent
control of the new airport for 50 years and exclusive rights to exploit a
large area of nearby state land.

An indefinite strike due to begin on December 26 in Finland's paper and pulp
industry, the country's biggest exporting sector, was called off yesterday
when employers and the trade unions accepted a settlement proposal by a
state arbitrator. The Finnish Forestry Industries Federation complained that
the 13-month agreement, giving an average 6 per cent increase in wages,
eroded the sector's international competitiveness. But the award was
significantly less than the 10 per cent union claim and rejected most union
demands for a cuts in working hours. The settlement, more than three times
the current annual rate of inflation, will fuel fears of an inflationary
upturn in Finland.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US economy grew strongly last month, but the pace of growth could ease
in the new year, figures for industrial orders and personal spending
indicated yesterday.
The Commerce Department said new orders for durable goods rose 3.4 per cent
between October and November, twice the increase projected by most analysts.
However, two thirds of the increase reflected a surge in orders for
transport equipment - a volatile sector. Excluding transport, orders rose
0.8 per cent and by 13.9 per cent in the year to November.
Consumer spending rose 0.5 per cent in real terms last month following a 0.6
per cent gain in October. Spending on durable goods surged for the second
month running, increasing 1.9 per cent in real terms after a 2.3 per cent
increase in October. Spending on services was more subdued, rising only 0.1
per cent.
The strong demand for durable goods, typically bought on credit, may reflect
fears that short-term interest rates will rise sharply after Christmas as
the Federal Reserve renews attempts to curb the pace of economic growth.
Yesterday's figures, however, raised doubts about the sustainability of
personal spending. After-tax personal incomes fell 0.3 per cent in real
terms last month, following a 1.3 per cent gain in October. The personal
savings rate fell to 4.1 per cent, historically a very low level.

Two Lebanese policemen died when an Israeli helicopter launched a missile at

self-proclaimed security zone.
The clashes began when Hizbollah opened machine-gun and mortar fire at
Israeli strongpoints and villages controlled by the pro-Israeli South
Lebanese Army in the eastern sector of the nine-mile-deep security belt
north of the international border. Israeli artillery fired back at Hizbollah
targets. A military spokesman in Tel-Aviv claimed that they inflicted

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong's anti-corruption watchdog may have its powers reduced after an
inquiry yesterday recommended transferring some to the courts and greater
judicial oversight of its operations.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) has wide powers of
inquisition bolstered by laws prohibiting the unauthorised publication of
its activities. These powers have given rise to fears that after Hong Kong's
transfer to China in 1997 they could be abused by the incoming government.
Any changes to the ICAC's powers, however, could strain further the already
tense relations between Britain and China. Beijing has said in the past that
it will not recognise changes to Hong Kong's law made this close to the
colony's reversion to Chinese sovereignty. It has charged that Britain is
simply seeking to 'loosen the screws' of control and make it more difficult
for the post-1997 administration to govern.
But the review committee, headed by Dr Helmut Sohmen, chairman of the
World-Wide Shipping group, yesterday said some of the commission's powers
should be transferred to the courts. These include powers to obtain certain
types of information, powers of search and powers to restrain the disposal
of property. In addition, a suspect who has had his travel documents
confiscated should be allowed to seek judicial review of the decision. At
present his only right of appeal is the commissioner.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Argentina opts for austerity to keep parity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's economic convulsions have produced a swift and emphatic response in
Argentina, where President Carlos Menem announced a policy of 'total
austerity' and vowed to maintain, at all costs, the dollar-peso parity
enshrined in law since April 1991.
'We are not Mexico and we will not devalue. Argentina will not vary its path
in the slightest degree,' he said late on Thursday, after his unprecedented
attendance at the National Economic Council.
Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minster, announced a series of emergency
austerity measures aimed at calming international investors, after fears of
repercussions from Mexico had sent shares and bonds tumbling and had led to
a near-tripling, to 25 per cent, of short-term interest rates.
Argentina would emit no new debt of any kind while interest rates remained
high, Mr Cavallo said. Far from 'flexibilising' the convertibility plan - by
which the law handcuffs the peso to the dollar and forbids the Central Bank
from issuing unbacked local currency - Argentina would make it 'more
rigorous and pure', he said.
To show its resolve, the government would cut Dollars 1bn (Pounds 645m) from
the Dollars 42bn draft budget next year.
'We are going to demonstrate that we will maintain the rules of the game and
 -within a few weeks, or perhaps months - the international financial
community will see that we are capable of facing up to such adverse
circumstances,' the minister said.
At yesterday's close, the Buenos Aires stock market's Merval blue-chip index
had recovered by 1.9 per cent on the day, having lost 10.6 per cent in the
previous three days.
However, some analysts were not convinced by Mr Cavallo's performance. Mr
Juan Arranz, country manager at Santander Investment, described the
emergency measures as a 'show'. Of Mr Cavallo's pledge to issue no new debt,
Mr Arranz said: 'It is not that he won't borrow any more money; it's that
no-one will lend him any.'
Mr Cavallo warned against 'simplistic' attempts to draw parallels between
Mexico and Argentina. Some analysts had done just that last December, he
said, when they had compared riots in Santiago del Estero, in northern
Argentina, with the Chiapas uprising in southern Mexico last January.
A year later, Chiapas was still in turmoil whereas Santiago del Estero was
calm. 'Politically, socially, economically and financially, Argentina is not
Mexico,' Mr Cavallo said.
Mr Menem, who will not welcome having to take austerity measures so close to
the presidential election next May, has shown, even so, his commitment to
the convertibility plan, which has brought inflation down to below 4 per
cent a year and spurred rapid economic growth.
Mr Nicolas Grose-Hodge, chief manager at Lloyds Bank in Argentina, said:
'There is no possibility that the government will devalue - it would lose
them the elections. The whole credibility of the administration is based on
the stability of the currency.'
He also backed the Central Bank's decision yesterday to suspend, for the
second day, all repurchase agreements (short-term peso loans) after a sharp
move into dollars on Wednesday. In December as a whole, however, demand for
pesos has caused the Central Bank to buy a net Dollars 423m in dollars,
suggesting there is, as yet, no pressure on the peso.
Mr Grose-Hodge said that Argentina's bimonetary system 'makes things easier
in the sense that people still have access to dollars irrespective of what
the peso is doing.' Because the dollar has an important presence in
Argentina's financial system, where about half of deposits are in the US
currency, high peso interest rates need not have an immediate effect on
economic activity.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Joggers ignite dissent in Bahrain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Middle East Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The violent clashes between demonstrators and police, which have erupted in
Bahrain this month are a timely reminder of how brittle relations can be
between Gulf governments and important segments of their own people.
Bahrain is the third member of the six-nation Gulf Co-operation Council  -
which also links Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE - to have
been forced to acknowledge public dissent on a small but significant scale
in the past six months. Between May and August, several hundred people were
arrested in Oman for sedition, and many more than the 110 officially
acknowledged by the Saudi authorities were arrested in September at
Buraidah, centre of the kingdom's conservative heartland.
The Bahrain clashes started a month ago as a local village incident. On
November 25, participants in a road marathon, including female foreigners,
were stoned by villagers at Jidhafs, a poor and mainly Shia area a few miles
west of Manama, the capital.
According to diplomats among the runners, one participant was severely hurt.
Joggers, particularly scantily clad ones, have long been the object of
ridicule and resentment among the poorer and more conservative segments of
countries in the Arabian peninsula.
The police, still advised by a former British police officer who won his
spurs in the Kenya campaign against the Mau Mau, then arrested several
villagers. When a local Shia cleric, recently returned from theological
studies at Qom in Iran, denounced the arrests, he in turn was detained.
The government sought to play down the trouble, but rumours and stories of
police brutality grew. As tension rose, the demonstrators added to their
list of complaints. Further attempts to crush the popular action led to more
violence and at least two people, including a policeman, were killed. The
demonstrations continued this week and now include demands for a return of
Bahrain's parliament, dissolved in 1975.
The violence appears not to have affected most of the estimated 547,000
population, of which a third is foreign. But the continuation of the
month-long disturbances this week was especially embarrassing as Bahrain
played host to the annual summit of the GCC.
While oil prices were high and economic development kept entire populations
busy making money, public disenchantment was rare, even among the poorest
members of national communities. Now that governments are finding it harder
to lubricate their economies with liberal cash hand-outs and across-the-
board subsidies, dissatisfaction among poorer people is becoming more
widespread and closer to the surface.
Traditional rulers find public exposure of their governmental deficiencies
hard to accept, especially as the demonstrations in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia
have highlighted the fault lines running through all GCC countries.
These are superficially economic: flat oil revenues; persistent and rising
budget deficits; unemployment (particularly among graduates of home-grown
universities supposed to reflect gloriously on the 'wisdom and
far-sightedness' of their respective rulers); cuts in state hand-outs
(including subsidies on water, electricity, health and transport which
governments can no longer afford).
Most of all, however, the fault lines reflect GCC governments' failure to
explain to their own people how material circumstances have changed.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Sweeping reshuffle in S Korea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON, Seoul Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Korean President Kim Young-sam yesterday replaced more than half of
his cabinet, in a sweeping reshuffle meant to revive his faltering
administration. It is the biggest cabinet shake-up since the Kim
administration took office in February 1993, with 15 of 22 ministers being
changed.
Key appointments indicate that the president is determined to push through
economic deregulation, while signalling what may become a tougher attitude
toward North Korea, in spite of the recent nuclear agreement that Pyongyang
signed with the US.
The reshuffle had been expected after Mr Kim, earlier this month, ordered a
reduction in the bureaucracy, eliminating several ministries.
The president's popularity has fallen in the past 18 months from an approval
rating of 90 per cent to less than 40 per cent, as his programme of economic
and political reforms has lost momentum. The administration has also been
damaged by corruption scandals and public disasters such as the recent
collapse of a Seoul motorway bridge in which 32 people died.
Mr Hong Jae-hyong, deputy prime minister for the economic planning board
(EPB) and earlier a finance minister in the Kim administration, will become
the head of the country's new enlarged economic ministry, the Finance and
Economic Board. This powerful agency is a product of a merger of the EPB and
the finance ministry, approved by parliament yesterday.
Mr Hong's appointment 'reflects the president's intention that the EPB take
over the finance ministry, rather than vice versa', said a presidential
aide. The EPB is considered a stronger supporter of financial liberalisation
and economic deregulation than the conservative finance ministry.
Mr Park Jae-yoon, current finance minister, will replace Mr Kim Chul-su,
trade and industry minister.
Mr Park was chief economic adviser to the president before becoming finance
minister in September. He is considered one of the main architects of the
economic reform programme.
In foreign affairs, Mr Han Sung-joo, seen as a moderate on the North Korea
issue, was replaced as foreign minister by Mr Gong Ro-myung, a career
diplomat and now ambassador to Japan. Mr Gong's appointment represents a
victory for foreign ministry officials, who did not fully accept Mr Han
because he was an academic rather than a diplomat.
Mr Lee Hong-koo, deputy prime minister for unification, who was appointed
the new prime minister last Saturday, is regarded as the only remaining
voice in the cabinet to be urging a conciliatory approach to North Korea.
His replacement as unification minister, who is responsible for inter-Korean
relations, is Mr Kim Deok, current head of the intelligence organisation,
the agency for national security planning, and seen as a hardliner on North
Korea.
The US-North Korean nuclear accord has been criticised by South Koreans for
offering too many concessions to Pyongyang, including western aid and US
diplomatic ties, in return for dismantling its nuclear programme.
The military is also gaining influence in the cabinet after Mr Kim, a former
dissident, had distanced himself from the armed forces which controlled
South Korea in 1961-87.
Mr Kwon Young-hae, a retired army general and former defence minister, will
become the new head of the intelligence agency. Air force General Lee
Yang-ho, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, will be the defence
minister.

FT  24 DEC 94 / A first saint for Down Under: Nikki Tait tells of an
Australian woman about to be beatified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Candles will burn a little more brightly this Christmas in Penola, a small
town in rural South Australia.
A 19th-century nun called Mary MacKillop, whose quarrels with the Roman
Catholic Church prompted a temporary excommunication, is due to be beatified
by Pope John Paul II in Sydney next month. She will become Australia's, and
Penola's, first saint.
Mary MacKillop - or Sister Mary of the Cross, as she was known - looks
likely to prove a popular figurehead. In a country which has always admired
gritty pragmatism rather than cloistered intellectualism, and has a soft
spot for well-meaning rebels, she fits the bill nicely.
The elevation is timely. Despite the general decline in institutionalised
religion in many western countries, Australia is one place where Catholicism
appears to be on the rise. More than 27 per cent of Australians, or 4.6m
people, gave this as their faith in the 1991 census, making it the country's
largest religion.
This was not always the case. In the mid-1970s, for example, the number of
Anglicans outstripped Catholics, despite the country's Irish and southern
European links. But Australia's population rose by about 24 per cent in
1976-91, while the number of Catholics increased by a third.
Her gender also may help the Church. As Ms Janet West, an Anglican
historian, pointed out recently: 'The Catholic Church has witnessed an
erosion of support from younger women accustomed to greater equality in
society at large.'
What's more, Mary MacKillop's elevation is seen in some quarters as a
further sign that Australia is 'coming of age'. Debate over the country's
constitutional ties to the British crown and the possible redesign of the
Australian flag is vigorous.
These are plainly secular matters but the notion that the country should
have its own saint plays to the same sensibilities.
'Beatification . . . will be one more sign of Australia's maturity,'
concluded Lesley O'Brien, author of a recently published biography of
MacKillop. 'It will be clear that the Australian Catholic Church is not an
outpost of the European Church, but an arm of the universal Church, with its
own identity.'
MacKillop was born in Melbourne in 1842, the daughter of first-generation
Scottish immigrants. She moved to Penola in her late teens as a governess,
where she met Father Julian Woods, an English-born parish priest who had
worked as a journalist on The Times in London.
They established the Order of the Sisters of St Joseph, with the aim of
bringing Catholic education to poorer communities. Later, they opened
women's refuges and orphanages.
The fiercely egalitarian outlook of the order and its refusal to accept
diocesan control brought MacKillop into conflict with the Church
establishment. In 1871, she was excommunicated. The ban was lifted fairly
quickly but she continued to battle the authorities for several decades.
Only in 1888 were the Josephites formally recognised as an Order and their
constitution approved. Mary died in 1909.
The campaign for sainthood has been under way for more than half a century.
It began in the 1920s but was halted when earlier, unsubstantiated
allegations of alcoholism resurfaced.
Her cause was pressed again from the 1950s. This year, the Vatican formally
recognised her role in one miracle - the cure of a woman suffering from
leukaemia. Beatification was agreed.
According to local church authorities, this will mean that she may be
revered as a saint in Australia - she will have her own saint's day, for
example. However, another miracle needs to be accepted before she can be
canonised and fully recognised as a saint within the Catholic Church.
A local industry built around the recalcitrant nun is thriving. Her life
story featured in a recent Qantas in-flight magazine, a documentary about
her beatification has been aired by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation,
a film of her story, backed by the Australian Film Finance Corporation, is
in cinemas, and several paperback biographies are in the bookstores.
Nowhere is this surge in interest more marked than at the Mary MacKillop
Secretariat in North Sydney, where the Josephites are based. An office
groans with paraphernalia ranging from postcards and pamphlets to a
specially designed toile fabric.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Fear of failure may reunite the Northern League: A snap
election could spell the end for Italy's divided regionalist party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If a thick skin is a prime requisite for a successful politician, then Mr
Umberto Bossi, the garrulous leader of the populist Northern League, is set
to be very successful indeed.
This week he has been pilloried with insults of betrayal from within and
without his party for provoking the downfall of the Berlusconi government.
Mr Berlusconi was the most vicious, labelling him a 'despicable traitor' for
bringing a no confidence motion against the government his party had agreed
to join.
But the League leader has given as good as he got, with his gravelly voice
and rude vocabulary. Indeed he now bears the impish smile of a schoolboy
whose prank has gone slightly wrong.
To regard Mr Bossi as a traitor within the coalition is a gross
over-simplification. He made an electoral pact with Mr Berlusconi which was
based on mutual convenience. The League brought to Mr Berlusconi's
newly-born Forza Italia the political respectability of a vigorous reformist
movement that had toppled the long- standing hegemony of the Christian
Democrats in northern Italy.
In return Mr Berlusconi provided funds, his media power, and his media
appeal as new political figure.
Mr Bossi and Mr Berlusconi may share a common identification with their
northern roots, but politically they have little in common. Mr Bossi, as the
head of a lively regional party that has grown from the grass roots upwards,
is wedded to the idea of a more federal Italy. Mr Berlusconi has national
political ambitions and leads a political movement which is tailored for his
self-promotion and which was set in motion by supporters drawn from his
Fininvest business empire. Ideologically, Mr Bossi is a liberal; Mr
Berlusconi embraces an ill-defined right-wing demagogy.
The outcome of the March general election results altered the marriage of
convenience to a more unequal relationship. Although the League had won a
similar number of deputies to Forza Italia and the neo-fascist MSI/National
Alliance, Mr Berlusconi's electoral partner in the south, Mr Bossi had only
one bargaining chip. This was the threat of withdrawing the League's support
from the coalition - without which Mr Berlusconi could not survive.
Mr Bossi cleverly used this threat from the outset, which explains why the
premier was permanently exasperated by him. Mr Berlusconi countered the
danger of withdrawal by the League by threatening early elections and
dropping Mr Bossi as an ally.
With an electoral system under which 75 per cent of deputies are chosen on a
first-past-the-post basis, League candidates would be extremely vulnerable
if they stood alone when other parties have formed coalitions.
This counter-threat lasted only so long as Mr Berlusconi's standing in the
opinion polls remained high. Since September his ratings have fallen, and it
has simply been a question of when Mr Bossi would make the break. Not
surprisingly, he chose the moment the premier came under investigation for
corruption by Milan magistrates and had been humiliated by unions
threatening a general strike.
Having now brought down the government, Mr Bossi and the League still face
the same threat, as Mr Berlusconi is determined to force early elections.
The League's candidates cannot fight elections alone without the risk of
being wiped out. They need allies to succeed in the majority voting system.
The collective fear of becoming a vanishing political force could prove
sufficient glue to keep the movement together in the wake of Mr Bossi's
'treason' against the government. As many as 40 of the 105 League deputies
have said they will remain loyal to Mr Berlusconi and have formed a
dissident group headed by Mr Roberto Maroni, the wily interior minister and
long-time intimate of Mr Bossi.
Mr Maroni, like Mr Bossi, knows full well a snap election could finish the
League. He is equally aware that should the dissidents wish to abandon Mr
Berlusconi, the options are few and unattractive. The League's natural
allies should be Forza Italia; but this is an ill-defined movement lacking
proper organisation and wholly dependent upon the political fortunes of Mr
Berlusconi.
Of the alternative allies, the small Christian Democratic Centre - the rump
of the old Christian Democrat party - is too small; the MSI/National
Alliance is too right-wing for many in the League; and the former communist
PDS is too left-wing.
Thus suggestions that the League will break up are premature, especially if
its members realise the value of the principle: united we stand, divided we
fall.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Russian budget is passed as economic fears grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian parliament last night passed the 1995 budget against a
background of increasing difficulty for economic policy and growing doubts
among international financial institutions expected to provide assistance.
Mr Anatoly Chubais, the first deputy prime minister, said the passing of the
budget in the lower house - after 14 attempts in three days of voting -
'strengthens the overall stability of the country, which is very important
in the context of a nervous social and political situation of the last few
days'.
Mr Sergei Alexashenko, deputy finance minister, welcomed the vote - by 230
to 127 - but said the main battles would be fought next month around the
precise spending and revenue items when deputies put forward amendments to
the draft.
The budget foresees a deficit of 7.7 per cent of gross national product, and
predicts an average monthly inflation rate of 2.5-3 per cent. Inflation last
month was 14 per cent.
The Duma agreed to provide Rbs18,000bn from central bank funds to cover
expenditure in the first quarter of 1995, when income is small. This appears
to contradict an earlier decision not to use bank funds to cover the
deficit.
However, two large issues loom over the budget strategy, which depends on
almost Dollars 13bn from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
Neither institution is willing to grant the aid until the issues are
settled.
The first, according to a senior finance official, is the still unknown cost
of the military operation in Chechnya - a bill which Mr Grigory Yavlinsky,
leader of the Yabloko faction, estimates will soon run into trillions of
roubles. Officially, the cost so far is put at around Rbs400m, with a
further Rbs1,000bn to reconstruct Chechnya after the military operation is
completed.
However, the official stressed that these figures were guesswork, and a
prolonged operation could radically change the expenditure needs -
especially if the military is successful in demanding higher defence
spending as a price for their actions in Chechnya.
Second, and more serious, the government is considering a draft decree which
would replace the regime of quotas on oil exports with an even more
restrictive regime of domestic quotas. Mr Chubais said this week that a
decision on the draft had yet to be taken, but most estimates point to its
being supported by powerful figures in the government and the presidential
administration.
The finance official said that the new regime would slow the pace of reform
and tend to discourage foreign investment, particularly in the energy
sector. More important in the short term, he said, would be its effect on
budget revenues, since an energy sector which could not recover its
production costs because of very low domestic prices would not be able to
pay taxes, nor could it bear losing the exemptions from import taxes which
the 1995 budget has promised to eliminate.
'If you're trying to get the budget deficit down,' said the official, 'then
letting the energy sector flounder will have a very profound effect on your
efforts.'
However, the official said that, if these two large obstacles were overcome,
the Fund was 'very positive' on the possibilities of stabilising the economy
next year. Mr Chubais said yesterday he believed the chances of agreement
with the IMF were 'very high'.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Bosnia signs interim ceasefire: Country-wide truce expected
to pave way for four-month halt in hostilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Bosnian Serbs and Moslems yesterday signed a country-wide interim ceasefire
agreement, after Bosnian Serb objections forced the truce to be postponed
from yesterday until noon today.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday said he had ordered
his forces to stop fighting even before the details of the agreement were
hammered out with Mr Yasushi Akashi, senior UN envoy in former Yugoslavia.
Before the noon deadline for the truce passed yesterday, Mr Akashi met
members of the Moslem-led Bosnian government in Sarajevo to discuss the
terms of the interim ceasefire agreement, which is expected to pave the way
for a four-month cessation of hostilities beginning January 1. The deal was
brokered this week by Mr Jimmy Carter, former US president.
Yesterday's delay was caused by Serb objections to two points in the
agreement. The first called for the resumption of political negotiations
which would lead towards a final settlement based on the five-nation Contact
Group plan. Serbs regard the plan - dividing Bosnia almost equally between
themselves and a federation of Moslems and Croats - as a starting point for
peace negotiations. The Bosnian government insists it should be the basis of
a peace settlement.
The second point of contention was over the exchange of prisoners of war and
the tracking of tens of thousands of people who have gone missing over the
past 32 months of war.
Before leaving the snow-covered mountain stronghold of Pale after talks
which included General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander, Mr Akashi
told reporters: 'Our enormous efforts have resulted in a happy outcome.'
He read aloud the declaration of a general ceasefire to come into effect
throughout Bosnia along all frontlines at noon today.
The most vulnerable point will be around Bihac, the Moslem enclave in the
northwest being strangled by Serb forces. The agreement does not include
Croatian Serbs and rebel Moslems fighting government forces there.
In Belgrade, the state power company has announced that electricity cuts
will be extended to 12 hours a day throughout Serbia. Outraged citizens have
already set up barricades in several cities and towns and assaulted workers
from the state power company.
The company announced that prices would be increased by 60 per cent.
In a joint appeal issued by state-run television and the electricity
company, citizens were urged to 'shut off at least one of their heaters' so
everyone in Serbia would be able to watch a Brazil-Yugoslavia soccer match
on television yesterday evening. It was the first foreign match to be played
since UN sanctions on Belgrade were eased in October. Brazil won 2-0.
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic last night took over Borba, the last
independent newspaper in Serbia. Even though Borba was privatised four years
ago, a Serbian court, which is under Mr Milosevic's control, proclaimed that
Borba, as of yesterday, was no longer private, but state property. Mr
Dragutin Brcin, current minister of information and a member of the ruling
Socialists' politburo, was named as editor-in-chief.
The move was part of a wider campaign to stamp out any dissent in Serbia. It
has intensified since Mr Milosevic was named by the west as the 'key man for
finding peace and stability in the Balkans'.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Peace, goodwill and profits in Santa theme parks: Hugh
Carnegy on how four Nordic countries have put the Christmas story to work
for them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you believe everything you hear in the Nordic countries, four Santa
Clauses will be heading for your chimney stack tonight.
Christmas may only come once a year but in the north the legend of Father
Christmas is a year-round business that begs a rather sensitive question
about where Santa really comes from.
In four countries - Greenland, Finland, Norway and Sweden - you can visit
Santa centres where you can meet the 'real' Santa Claus in his 'real'
northern fastness, tour his workshop and, of course, spend lots of money on
souvenirs, in restaurants and on such suitable activities as taking a sleigh
ride.
Everyone involved in Nordic Santa operations is a little coy about the
inherent paradox in the proposition that there are four of the benevolent,
bearded old men. Destroying the myth of a single Santa might upset an awful
lot of children - not to mention damage a good business.
'We don't like to encourage rivalry between us,' says Mr Mauri Hakulinen,
marketing director of Finland's Santa centre near Rovaniemi in the Arctic
Circle. 'It doesn't serve the children who want to fulfil their dreams. If
people want to go to Norway or Sweden and are satisfied, then that's fine by
us.'
A colleague from another of the region's Santa parks puts it rather more
succinctly. 'Nobody can own Santa - but everybody can profit from him.'
The competition may be discreet, but it has become real enough as the
ambitions of the Santa centre operators have grown over the past decade. The
least successful, with just 15,000 visitors a year - probably because of its
inaccessibility - has been Greenland's Yuletide park, recently relaunched
with a hefty government subsidy after going bust.
In Rovaniemi, the Santa attractions are part of a larger Arctic Circle
Centre set up in 1985 as a focus of tourism in Finnish Lappland. It brings
almost 500,000 visitors a year to its range of 30 shops, restaurants and
other attractions. Annual turnover is around FM30m (Pounds 4m) a year but
one of the ironies of the Santa business is that peak season is in the
summer - winter is too dark and cold to attract many foreigners.
Rovaniemi has a reputation as the most overtly commercial of the Nordic
Santa parks. Since it opened, travel agents have chartered a Concorde every
Christmas to bring in families from the UK, often for a one-day visit.
But Santa World (Tomteland in Swedish) near Mora in central Sweden has also
developed into a busy theme park since it was established in 1984,
attracting 150,000 visitors a year and achieving turnover of SKr35m (Pounds
3m). Mr Peter Wahlberg, the main owner, reports cheerfully that Santa World
is 'very profitable', although he declines to give a figure.
Apart from Santa's home and workshop - the latter housed in what is claimed
to be Europe's biggest log cabin - the park offers everything from elf shows
in the forest to skiing and, in summer, Santa's golf course, Santa's
swimming pool and Santa's campground.
Yulhuset (Christmas House), operated by Willy and Eva Johansan in Droebak,
just south of the Norwegian capital of Oslo, is a less extensive centre but
still claims 250,000 visitors a year, including many from Japan, where
Scandinavian Santas apparently have a strong appeal.
The irony of the whole Nordic Santa business is that the legend of a
benevolent Santa Claus conflicts with the original Scandinavian folk myth of
a magical Christmas-time visitor.
The Norwegian 'Nisse' and Swedish 'Tomte' were evil figures who had to be
appeased with gifts from each family. 'The real Scandinavian Santa was a
nasty, ugly little elf who caused trouble all year round, letting the cattle
out of the barn and other things like that,' explains Mr Wahlberg. 'You had
to leave out sweet rice porridge and other offerings for him at
Christmas-time so he would leave you in peace.'
At some point over the past 100 years, however, this legend got confused
with the Americanised version of a jolly fellow in fur-trimmed red costume
who handed out presents to the world's children. This in turn was an
adaption of a Dutch wintertime tradition of Sinterklaas (St Nicholas)
leaving gifts to children in a shoe on the night of December 6. The original
St Nicholas was a 4th century archbishop who lived in Lycia, part of what is
now southern Turkey.
Every Nordic Santa centre is aware of these uncomfortable details. But
business is business.
'To claim that Santa is here is a big responsibility,' says Mr Hakulinen in
Rovaniemi. 'But it is a well known fact that Santa Claus travels with
reindeer and up here in Lappland it is full of reindeer.'

FT  24 DEC 94 / French president steps into 'Gaullist fraud' case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France's Socialist President Francois Mitterrand yesterday intervened after
a FFr1m (Pounds 118,200) bribe was allegedly offered to get a magistrate to
drop his investigation of possible Gaullist financial improprieties.
The magistrate, Mr Eric Halphen, is investigating allegations of false
invoicing on public housing contracts awarded by the city of Paris, whose
mayor is Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist presidential candidate.
In the wake of the investigation, Mr Michel Roussin, France's foreign aid
minister, who used to work for Mr Chirac, has already resigned.
In addition to Mr Roussin, Mr Halphen has placed 13 others under formal
investigation for financial impropriety.
One of them is Mr Didier Schuller, a Gaullist local politician. He has
accused Mr Halphen's father-in-law, Mr Jean-Pierre Marechal, of demanding
money in return for trying to persuade his son-in-law to drop the inquiry.
After receiving FFr1m in a little box from Mr Schuller at Charles de Gaulle
airport, Mr Marechal was arrested by police and charged with extortion.
Yesterday Mr Marechal claimed he had been 'framed' by Mr Schuller, whom he
said he knew professionally. Mr Marechal claimed he thought Mr Schuller had
given him a box of cigars, and said he was amazed to find it contained FFr1m
instead.
France's justice minister, Mr Pierre Mehaignerie, has said he will leave it
to the public prosecutor to decide whether Mr Halphen should now be taken
off the case.
The public prosecutor, in turn, has given Mr Halphen a few days to come to
his own conclusions about the propriety of continuing his investigation.
Strongly supported by fellow magistrates, Mr Halphen was yesterday ploughing
on with his probe into Paris municipal contracting.
But with the Socialist party warning the government not to bury the
investigation, President Mitterrand has now asked the Superior Council of
the Magistrature, which he chairs, for their opinion on whether Mr Halphen
should continue.
Handing the dossier to another magistrate would almost certainly delay a
conclusion to the investigation until after next May's presidential
election.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Custody for disgraced ex-Banesto head Conde
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mario Conde, who became Spain's celebrity financier in the late 1980s as
chairman of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), was yesterday remanded in
custody on charges of defrauding the banking group's shareholders.
The decision by a high court judge in Madrid to commit Mr Conde to prison
came almost exactly a year after the Bank of Spain dismissed him as chairman
of Banesto, along with the bank's 19-member board, alleging mismanagement,
overspending and an excessive concentration of risk.
Mr Conde was transferred to the maximum security Alcala-Meco jail, near
Madrid, after Judge Manuel Garca Castellon had spent 40 hours this week
questioning him over his business affairs.
A self-made billionaire, Mr Conde, 46, mesmerised domestic society as
chairman of Banesto between 1987 and 1993 when he picked up a succession of
awards as the most admired Spaniard of the year and became a role model for
Spain's fledgling yuppie generation.
In Alcala-Meco he will join his close business associate Mr Arturo Roman,
jailed last week by Judge Garca Castellon in the same fraud indictment of
former Banesto executives.
The indictment served by Judge Garca Castellon on Mr Conde and Mr Roman
involves a web of shell companies, some of which they owned jointly, that
allegedly sold companies to the group's industrial holding company,
Corporacion Banesto, at inflated prices.
A friend of the royal family (he hired a sister of King Juan Carlos as an
executive of a Banesto cultural foundation) and widely viewed as a future
prime minister (he acknowledged his admiration for Italy's Mr Silvio
Berlusconi in a book he published this year), Mr Conde included among his
flamboyant activities the creation of a Madrid Business School, a seminar in
Moscow that had Spanish politicians discussing the transition to democracy,
and a gathering of intellectuals in the Vatican to debate ethics in
business.
He was dismissed, on December 28 last year, as Banesto chairman after a Bank
of Spain inspection discovered that the bank had had overvalued its
Pta7,000bn (Pounds 34bn) assets by Pta503bn.
In April Banesto was acquired by Banco Santander after some Pta780bn in
public and private moneys had been spent on refloating the troubled
institution.
In the summer before his dismissal from Banesto, the bank raised nearly
Dollars 700m from the international markets in a rights issue co-ordinated
by the US bank J P Morgan.
Mr Conde's arrest may mark the climax of a reaction under way for some
months in Spain against those who made quick fortunes in in the past 10
years, when the domestic economy grew fast on the back of its liberalisation
and Spanish membership of the European Union.
The former governor of the Bank of Spain, Mr Mariano Rubio, and the former
head of Madrid's stock exchange, Mr Manuel de la Concha, were both held in
preventive detention at Alcala-Meco in May on charges of insider share
dealing before being released pending trial.
In October a Barcelona judge ordered the preventive detention of Mr Javier
de la Rosa, the architect of multi-million-dollar investments in Spain by
the Kuwait Investment Office, KIO, who is accused of defrauding his
shareholders in companies that he owned.

FT  24 DEC 94 / SFO denies suppressing evidence in Guinness trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Financial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Serious Fraud Office yesterday denied that it had deliberately
suppressed evidence relevant to the first Guinness trial.
Mr George Staple, director of the SFO, which prosecuted the case, said the
decision to withhold from the defendants details of share operations similar
to those at the heart of the Guinness case was based on legal advice that
such details were not relevant. On Thursday, the Home Office ordered the
Court of Appeal to review the convictions of the four businessmen prosecuted
in the 1990 case: Mr Ernest Saunders, Guinness's former chief executive, Mr
Gerald Ronson, the property developer, Mr Jack Lyons, the financier, and Mr
Tony Parnes, the former stockbroker.
'We are not here to deny people's human rights. We are here to ensure so far
as we can that people have a fair trial,' Mr Staple said. One of the main
reasons for the Home Office's decision is that the defendants had not been
made aware by the SFO during their trial of a judgment made by a City of
London tribunal in 1988 on the legality of a series of share transactions
carried out by TWH Management Limited.
TWH had been involved in an operation to support Guinness's share price
during the brewing company's takeover bid for Distillers in 1986. It had
also been involved in six other share transactions, in which guarantees were
given to the purchasers that they would suffer no losses from the deals.
The tribunal ruled that 'there is no evidence that such transactions were
improper'.
However, the case against the four Guinness defendants was in part based on
their involvement in similar operations to support Guinness's share price.
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's spokesman on the City, said the system of
prosecuting and investigating fraud cases needed a complete overhaul. He
said the Securities and Investment Board, the City regulator, should be more
involved in prosecuting financial crime.
The SFO's future is the subject of a government review by Mr Rex Davie, a
former civil servant. Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, is expected
in January to decide whether to end the SFO's independence and put it under
the aegis of the Crown Prosecution Service.
A merchant banker said: 'This leaves everybody deeply uncertain. On the one
hand there is this beating of the drum about regulation and on the other
hand any time anything gets into court it gets messed up.'
Lord Spens, a defendant acquitted in a second Guinness trial, alleged that
'someone quite high up' must have ordered the suppression of information. Mr
Staple denied that.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Russian army split over conflict in Chechnya

The Russian army's leadership is in turmoil over the bitterly fought
campaign in Chechnya, raising the possibility of growing political
intervention by senior officers opposed to the use of arms to resolve the
conflict.
The state Duma (lower house) voted by 228 to 38 yesterday for an appeal to
President Boris Yeltsin to break off military action in favour of peace
talks.
However, Russian forces continued to pound Grozny, the Chechen capital, with
bombs and artillery rounds. The city is under constant air bombardment and
large parts of the centre have been destroyed.
Mr Valery Borshchev, a liberal member of the Duma, said at least 80 people
had been killed yesterday and 56 wounded.
Russian official sources estimate that 44 Russian troops have died since the
action started nearly two weeks ago.
Britain and France voiced concern over the conflict. 'We are concerned and
have impressed on (the Russians) the need for a solution to be arranged as
soon as possible which prevents further bloodshed,' the British Foreign
Office said.
In an interview to be published today in the daily Sevodnya, Colonel General
Eduard Vorobyev, deputy commander of Russian land forces, says: 'We have to
save Russia by getting out of the situation which has been created in the
country, in Chechnya and in the armed forces.'
Gen Vorobyev has tried to resign from his command in protest at the handling
of the Chechnya crisis. He says the army involvement was hasty and 'the
whole principle is wrong'.
Gen Vorobyev says he was offered the command of the Chechen conflict by
General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, on Wednesday but refused and
instead wrote a letter of resignation.
The Post Factum news agency reported last night that his resignation had
been refused by his immediate superior, Colonel General Vladimir Semyonov,
commander of Russian land forces.
Adding to tensions, Lieutenant-General Alexander Lebed, commander of the
14th Army in the Transdnestr area of Moldova, told the RIA-Novosti news
agency that he would accept command of the Chechen operation, if offered,
but only to get the troops out of Chechnya.
'From the military point of view, the Russian army should never have entered
Chechnya,' he said.
Gen Lebed, whom a recent poll showed to be the most popular commander among
his military peers, has criticised the operation before. But his
intervention might aggravate what is now a highly charged situation.
The Ministry of Defence is still denying a RIA-Novosti report on Thursday
that six senior commanders had been dismissed - although unofficial sources
say they have offered resignations, which have been refused.

FT  24 DEC 94 / QE2 halted in New York on safety fears: Cruise liner trapped
at quayside as Cunard faces threat of lawsuit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Queen Elizabeth 2 was trapped at a New York quayside last night, hours
after it was due to sail for the Caribbean, when the US Coastguard refused
to give the cruise ship a safety certificate.
The move is highly embarrassing for Cunard, the cruise line that owns the
QE2, and follows questions about safety raised by passengers on board the
liner, which sailed from Southampton to New York this week with a Dollars
45m (Pounds 28.8m) refit incomplete.
Last night, Trafalgar House, which owns Cunard, admitted that, with
hindsight, the liner should not have sailed from Southampton before the
refit was complete.
Mr Tom Smith, head of corporate communications, said: 'We have to
acknowledge that we should have done things differently but we were
receiving advice that it would be ready right up until the day it sailed,
which meant we had a shipload of passengers waiting on the dock at
Southampton.
'Many were keen to go on board, even when they were told it would not be
complete.'
He added that Trafalgar House would be considering legal action over the
refit.
Cunard in New York would not comment on the Trafalgar House statement.
The US Coastguard said last night it refused to give the QE2 a safety
certificate because of hazards including openings in bulkheads and fire
walls and obstacles in passageways.
It said there were openings in draught stops in the ventilation system,
which close during fires to prevent the passage of flames and fumes.
During the transatlantic voyage, which began last Saturday, angry passengers
complained that the failure to complete the refit before the vessel sailed
had resulted in 'building site' conditions, cabins without water and closed
amenities.
One passenger, Mr Andrew Coad, a vice-president for global equities systems
at Wall Street securities house Merrill Lynch, said on arrival in New York
that he and others planned to file a class action lawsuit against Cunard
citing the safety issue.
Mr John Olsen, Cunard's chief executive, strongly denied that safety had
been jeopardised. 'We take great care with this sort of thing,' he said. 'We
are not compromising our safety standards, and we have had a Marine Safety
Agency inspector on board who signed a safety certificate (in Southampton).'
The MSA is the British government agency responsible for safety at sea.
Speaking from on board the QE2, one passenger, who asked not to be named,
said passengers were 'bitterly disappointed' by the latest delay. He said
Cunard had offered to repatriate any passengers who did disembark, and give
them a free cruise next year.
The QE2 had been due to leave New York at midnight on Thursday for the
Caribbean, but was still lying at the terminal on Manhattan's west side last
night. Cunard said it was aiming for the ship to sail at midnight.

The US Coastguard refused to give a safety certificate to the Queen
Elizabeth 2 cruise ship yesterday, leaving her trapped at a New York
quayside hours after she was due to sail for the Caribbean.
The move is highly embarrassing for Cunard, the cruise line that owns the
QE2. It follows questions about safety raised by passengers on board the
liner, which sailed from Southampton to New York this week with a refit
incomplete.
The coastguard's grounds for refusal included the presence of obstacles in
passageways. This was understood to refer to the building materials being
used for the Dollars 45m (Pounds 28.8m) refit.
During the transatlantic voyage, which began last Saturday, angry passengers
complained that the failure to complete the refit before the vessel sailed
had resulted in 'building site' conditions, cabins without water and closed
amenities.
When the QE2 arrived in New York at 8pm on Thursday evening, some passengers
complained that safety had been jeopardised because corridors and emergency
exits were blocked by building materials and debris.
One passenger, Mr Andrew Coad, a vice-president for global equities systems
at Wall Street securities house Merrill Lynch, said on arrival in New York
that he and others planned to file a class action lawsuit against Cunard
citing the safety issue.
Mr John Olsen, Cunard's chief executive, strongly denied that safety had

The US Coastguard also said there were openings in draught stops in the
ventilation system, which close during fires to prevent the passage of
flames and fumes, and there were holes in fire-containment bulkheads.
Speaking from on board the QE2, one passenger, who asked not to be named,
said passengers were 'bitterly disappointed' by the latest delay. He said
Cunard had offered to repatriate any passengers who did disembark, and give
them a free cruise next year.
The QE2 had been due to leave New York at midnight on Thursday for the
Caribbean, but was still lying at the passenger ship terminal on Manhattan's
west side in the early afternoon yesterday.
Cunard in New York said: 'The coastguard said refurbishment work needed to
be completed. We expect the QE2 to sail at 6pm (New York time).'

FT  24 DEC 94 / The great mediator returns to base with offer for US
strikers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Man has done it all this season. No matter what they threw at him in
Pyongyang, Port-au-Prince and Pale - dictatorial curve balls and sliders and
sneaky Balkan change-ups - he hit them all out of the park, the trademark
toothy grin getting wider with each victory. The crowds loved him for
bringing peace to their troubled lives, even if his technique seemed
sometimes unorthodox.
But now The Man wants to take on the ultimate Mission Impossible - and on
his home ground, too. He has told the White House and the warring factions
that he is ready yet again to step up to the plate.
It all happened in a rush late on Thursday. Jimmy Carter - for who else
could it be but the former president? - let it be known that he was ready to
intervene in the US baseball strike.
His offer came just hours before the owners of the 28 major league teams
voted to declare an impasse in their negotiations with the players in a
dispute that cut last season short in August and threatens the existence of
the next one.
The statement from the Carter Centre in Atlanta was carefully guarded. 'Our
mediation services are available only when both parties genuinely want a
settlement and desire us to be of assistance,' it said.
And therein lies the rub that yesterday morning suggested he might this time
not get even the chance to star. For Mr Bud Selig, an owner who also serves
as acting commissioner of America's national sport, said after talking to Mr
Carter: 'No, thanks.'
The owners' argument was that if Mr Bill Usery, one of the best and most
experienced federal labour mediators in the business, could not get the two
sides to agree, there was no reason to believe Mr Carter could.
The strike has arisen because the owners want to put a ceiling on team
payrolls so as to level the competitive playing field between the richer and
poorer sides. The players, whose earnings range from Dollars 109,000 (Pounds
69,800) for the 162-game season to more than Dollars 32,000 a match, want
nothing to do with a salary cap. They think it smacks of the indentured
servitude from which they have worked over the last 25 years to escape. This
being America, the dispute will now go to court.
The owners will also go ahead with plans to start next season with minor
league players, including, possibly, Michael Jordan, the retired basketball
superstar who enjoyed only modest success last season as an outfielder in
Birmingham, Alabama. But the players have already gone to court to stop the
import of foreign professionals from south of the border and Asia.
Owners have also advised the sport's umpires, involved in a separate
contractual dispute, that they will all be fired on January 1. If they are
deemed disposable, then who needs Jimmy Carter?

<TEXT>
A knife-wielding homeless man shot by police in front of the White House
yesterday died after undergoing two lengthy operations. Marcelino Corniel,
33, was shot by a US Park Police officer on Tuesday after he ran across
Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House pavement with a hunting knife taped
to his arm. White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers said the
administration was saddened by the death.
President Bill Clinton, who was working in the Oval Office at the time of
the incident, was never in danger. Officials defended the shooting as a
justified use of force because the man did not follow orders to give up his
weapon. Witnesses said Corniel was menacing police. But video footage showed
him standing almost motionless facing four officers when one of them fired
twice, hitting him in the torso and leg.

A barge carrying crude oil hit an underwater object in the Mississippi
River, ripping a hole in one tank and spilling up to 21,000 gallons of crude
into the water. The oil spread about 6 miles downriver and reached shore at
various points as far as Meraux to Braithwaite, about 10 miles south of New
Orleans. Clean-up crews worked to contain the spill about a half mile
downriver of the ferry landing not far from the New Orleans-Chalmette city
limits. The Coast Guard closed the busy stretch of river to all marine
traffic.

Cunard chief executive John Olsen, speaking at a press conference in New
York, where he acknowledged there had been difficulties on board the Queen
Elizabeth 2 after a recent Pounds 30m (Dollars 45m) refit. Asked to comment
on reports of exploding toilets on the vessel, he said the biggest single
issue had involved the plumbing.
He was later due to board the vessel to avert a threatened sit-in by 150
passengers.

FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: Bankers Trust fined over
derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers Trust has agreed to pay Dollars 10m in fines to the US government to
settle claims that it broke federal anti-fraud laws when it sold derivatives
to a Cincinnati-based company, Gibson Greetings, which incurred Dollars 20m
in paper losses on the derivatives.
Although the New York-based bank did not admit or deny wrongdoing in the
case, its settlement with two federal regulators - the Commodities Futures
Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission - is the first
time a big US bank has been fined for its activities in the fast-growing
derivatives market, where a variety of companies in the US and overseas have
lost large amounts of money this year.
According to the settlement, Bankers Trust misrepresented the value of the
derivatives when it first sold two derivatives products - both complex forms
of interest rate swaps - to Gibson Greetings, and later provided the company
with valuations which significantly understated the extent of the losses it
faced on the derivatives. The value of the products dropped sharply in early
1994 after US interest rates rose.
Yesterday, Bankers Trust attributed the misrepresentations to a single
employee, who it said was no longer with the company.
The agreement with regulators comes less than a month after the bank reached
a separate settlement over a lawsuit brought by Gibson Greetings. Under that
deal, Bankers Trust agreed to swallow Dollars 14m of the Dollars 20.2m in
losses Gibson Greetings faced on the two derivatives contracts.
The bank still faces a second derivatives-related lawsuit, filed by Procter
&amp; Gamble, the consumer products group, which is seeking Dollars 130m and
unspecified punitive damages over a single interest rate swap that went bad.
Bankers Trust says it will defend itself vigorously against the P&amp;G lawsuit.
Legislators in Washington, who this year have expressed growing concern
about the largely unregulated derivatives market, welcomed the fines against
Bankers Trust.
Mr Edward Markey, chairman of the House telecommunications and finance
subcommittee, said the settlement sent 'a strong signal to Wall Street's
derivatives traders that lying and cheating customers will not be
tolerated.'
He pledged legislative action to improve the oversight of derivatives
dealers' activities.

FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: Eastern Air poised to emerge
from bankruptcy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eastern Air Lines, once one of the biggest US airlines but long defunct, may
start flying again following a US court's approval of its plan to emerge
from bankruptcy.
The New York court approved a scheme announced in September under which
Eastern will emerge from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection by paying off its
creditors, so clearing the way for a new Eastern Air Lines.
Under the plan, unsecured creditors with claims of Dollars 100,000 or less -
mostly ticket holders, employees and vendors - will get 11 cents for each
dollar's worth of debt on Dollars 200m worth of allowed claims. About 150
unsecured creditors with claims of more than Dollars 100,000 will receive
several distributions over a period of 12-18 months. These will probably
total 9 cents to 14 cents in the dollar, but could possibly reach 17 cents.
Allowable claims total Dollars 1.1bn.
The plan also provides for full payment of secured creditors and reconfirms
all prior payments made to various creditors since the shutdown.
Eastern went into bankruptcy in March 1989 amid a bitter power struggle
between its unions and its then chairman, Mr Frank Lorenzo. It was grounded
in 1991.

AT&amp;T, the US telecoms group, has purchased the Interchange Network from
Ziff-Davis Publishing, Reuter reports from New York.
Interchange provides small publishers with the architecture and editorial
tools to build next-generation electronic newspapers and magazines, and
control pricing, advertising and presentation. Interchange is in the second
stage of testing, and is expected to be commercially available in 1995.
Although no financial details were disclosed, it has been reported that the
acquisition would cost more than Dollars 50m, down from Dollars 100m
originally sought, because of impending competition from Microsoft, which in
November announced plans to develop its own online service.

FT  23 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome was restrained in early trading as the latest
audit data on sales of its Zovirax treatment for herpes prompted
profit-taking. The data were not believed to be seriously worrying but
Wellcome, along with other leaders in the sector, has performed strongly.
Then in the afternoon there was heavy buying of traded options, fuelling old
bid speculation and the stock recovered to close 3 higher at 709p.
Zeneca fell in spite of the acquisition of 50 per cent of Salick Healthcare
for Dollars 195m. The deal will expand Zeneca's involvement in cancer care
and was described by Mr Paul Krikler of Goldman Sachs as an 'excellent
move'. But the shares dipped 6 to 893p as dealers noted that they had hit a
record high on Wednesday.
Shares in property group Stanhope were suspended pending clarification of
the company's financial position. The shares had advanced a penny to 8p
before the mid-afternoon suspension, which came as the market waited to hear
if the group's bankers would come up with a financial rescue plan.
The Pounds 1.5bn offer for Kuwaiti owned St Martins Property reported
earlier this week continued to boost demand in the rest of the sector.
Hammerson, which announced the acquisition of two retail property sites in
Canada, put on 5 at 348p.
Insurers were sold down on growing concern that the cut in household
insurance premiums by the Halifax would lead to a price war, but some houses
were taking a more fundamental approach which led to a strong two-way tussle
in the sector.
Some integrated securities houses were ignoring the impending margin
pressures and concentrating on the valuations of the stocks compared to
their net asset values. UBS was one house which was actively supporting the
sector, and which bought several of the composite stocks up from their lows.
Sun Alliance, the main underwriter for the Halifax and which was off 11 at
worst, also received support from an SGST buy recommendation. It ended the
day only 3 lower at 297p.
General Accident, off 14 at one stage, closed 4 down at 515p and Royal
Insurance moved from 11 off to end a net penny down.
The rumoured dawn raid on bid target Northern Electric did not happen but
the shares rose 7 to 1007p in anticipation. The view is that Swiss Bank
Corp, acting for Trafalgar, will soon go into the market to try and buy
around 10 per cent of Northern's shares.
The latest speculation in the water sector suggested international
conglomerate Hanson may launch a bid for Welsh Water. The latter raced 12
ahead to 650p and Hanson firmed 1 3/4 to 234p.
The recent recovery seen in the stores sector was extended yesterday as
optimism about Christmas trading continued in some quarters. Great Universal
Stores gained 11 1/2 at 543p and Argos 4 at 349p. Marks and Spencer brushed
aside a James Capel profits downgrade to end 4 ahead at 396p.
News that fund manager Jupiter Tyndall was in talks over its possible
acquisition gave a shot in the arm to others within the sector. Gartmore
appreciated 6 to 182p, Invesco 3 to 166p and Perpetual 30 to 1165p. However,
Jupiter lost 9 at 393p.
Hotels and leisure group Ladbroke gained 5 at 170p in trade of 5.5m, with
dealers reporting further switching into the stock from Rank Organisation, 1
1/2 lighter at 408p. Yesterday's trades followed a move by Goldman Sachs
earlier this week in which it switched a large holding out of Rank and into
Ladbroke.
Granada Group was another stock said to have benefited from some switching
out of Rank. The shares climbed 10 to 506p as greater note was taken of a
recent buy recommendation from BZW. A circular from the investment bank said
Granada 'has made very clear its resolve to keep dividends rising strongly'.
Burmah Castrol moved ahead 17 to 801p after SG Warburg upgraded the company
to 'add' from 'hold' following the stock's recent poor showing relative to
the overall market. Warburg said the shares had underperformed the market by
13 per cent since August when they reached a 12-month peak of 915 1/2 p.
A big buyer for tightly traded Associated British Foods helped the shares
appreciate 14 to 582p. Food manufacturer Canadian Pizza, off 6 at 83p,
stunned the market with its second profits warning this year, prompting
brokers to downgrade estimates.
BTR was the most heavily traded Footsie stock, notching up turnover of 13m
shares following news of the latest acquisition within its far flung empire.
BTR Nylex, the 62 per cent-owned Australian unit, is paying ADollars 800m
for the US group which makes Formica laminates. BTR shares put on 3 1/2 at
290p against a background of heavy switching with the 1995 warrants.
A buy note from Henderson Crosthwaite focusing on break-up value helped to
lift British Aerospace. The agency broker's revised break-up value for BAe
is 800p, against which the shares, up 5 at 431p, stand at a discount of 45
per cent.
Hall Engineering tumbled 13 to 150p following the announcement of Pounds
4.2m reorganisation provisions. Process plant specialist APV eased 2 to 54p,
with turnover in the stock boosted to 5.5m as several largish lines of stock
went through the market. Analysts have begun to suspect that the group's
restructuring timetable, initially scheduled for late this year, has been
put back to early in 1995.

FT  23 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: US link talk lifts C&amp;W
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bolstered by talk of a possible deal with US telecoms giant AT&amp;T, shares in
Cable and Wireless continued to improve, moving forward 5 to 381p in 6.7m
turnover.
Speculation suggests that the group's hard pressed Mercury subsidiary has
become the focus of AT&amp;T's expansion plans following this week's granting of
a licence allowing the US group to offer a full range of telephone services
in the UK.
Past link-up talks between the two groups have foundered. But the severe
price and volume squeeze under way at Mercury, which is widely estimated to
face a 10 per cent fall in operating profits in 1995, is said to be putting
urgent impetus behind the present discussions.
According to one whisper, C&amp;W is about to split Mercury into two companies -
services and network - and that AT&amp;T is prepared to buy up to 30 per cent of
Mercury's network operations. These, according to Nomura Securities, have a
basic value of around Dollars 1.2bn.
This week C&amp;W has outperformed the market, having lagged behind by around a
fifth on a 12-month view.

FT  23 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: End-year rally sees FT-SE on the
verge of 3,100 - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK market took another hard look at the 3,100 level on the FT-SE 100 but
ultimately failed in its effort to break through that level, despite more
good news on the domestic economy, underlying takeover speculation and
renewed strength on Wall Street.
The general expectation around London's trading days after the market closed
was that the 100 index should manage to move through what is seen as a
substantial chart level if Wall Street managed to hold the level it was
trading when London dealersclosed their books for the day.
But a move above 3,100 is by no means a foregone conclusion, dealers said.
'It could well be something of a trial of strength in the market, with the
futures boys trying to drive the underlying market through that level; but
you must remember that the Liffe market closes shortly after noon and there
are stories that the market's bears could move in to sell the cash market,'
said a senior marketmaker.
The stockmarket remains open until the normal 4.30pm close, after a Bank of
England request, apparently to provide liquidity for the gilts market.
At the end of another session of keen interest in equities, the FT-SE 100
index closed 21.3 higher at 3,091.7, its highest closing level since
November 21, and a rise of 148.3, or 5 per cent, since December 13. The
FT-SE Mid 250 index also made rapid progress, closing 19.3 higher at
3,485.9.
There was reassurance around the City's dealing rooms at the relatively high
levels of customer activity still going on so close to the Christmas
holiday. Turnover yesterday totalled 577.4m shares, with non-FT-SE issues
providing activity in 345.7m shares, or 60 per cent of the overall figure.
Wednesday's good turnover levels translated into lucrative customer business
for the market with deals worth Pounds 1.65bn, well above recent daily
levels and a figure given a warm welcome in the market.
The securities industry has been hit by a series of small but widely
publicised job losses recently and the feeling around the City of London is
that the market needs a strong boost to head off what are expected to be
further losses in the near future. Rumblings of substantial mergers between
some of the big UK marketmaking firms and overseas firms, mainly US, have
been heard for some weeks. One story doing the rounds in London was that
Chase Manhattan, the US bank, could be seeking to re-establish a presence in
the European/UK equity markets after its expensive foray in the wake of the
Big Bang.
London began the session in good form and apart from an early bout of
selling pressure, which was never more than an irritant, performed strongly
all day.
The early thrust for the market came from the US which jumped more than 50
points at one stage before settling 34 higher. Sentiment was bolstered in
mid-morning with news that the UK's balance had moved into the black to the
tune of Pounds 846m in the third quarter, the first positive quarterly
result since 1987. The marginal downward revision of third quarter gross
domestic product, from a 0.9 per cent rise to one of 0.8 per cent, giving an
annualised growth rate of plus 4.1 per cent, gave the market. no cause for
concern.
The good economic news and a strong opening performance by Wall Street,
where the Dow showed a double-digit rise shortly after the opening and was
up over 20 points two hours after London closed, provided a real boost to UK
equities and drove the FT-SE 100 up more than 25 points, before it eased
slightly at the close.
BP, one of the UK market's great success stories over the year, approached
its all-time peak, with UK institutions still trying to achieve market
weightings in the stock.

FT  23 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and trading options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures had another strong session, with the FT-SE 100 March
contract breaking through the 3,115 resistance level, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The day's performance was strung about with all sorts of buying signals,
dealers said, adding that were it not for the seasonally low level of
activity the market could be expected to surge further.
At the close of pit trading the March contract had reached 3,125, up 32
points for a five-day advance of 132 points. The premium to the cash market
was 34 points, or 10 points above fair value.
There was a limited amount of genuine buying during the morning session, but
for the most part activity was nominal. Less than 4,000 contracts were
traded up to the official 4.10pm close.
In contrast, the traded options market had a busy day with 26,465 lots
transacted. The main feature was the high proportion of call business. At
17,223 lots, calls outstripped puts by almost two-to-one, their best day
since mid-October.
The most active stock option was drugs group Glaxo at just under 2,000
contracts traded. Dealers said business was steady, with the recent strong
rise in the cash market providing the spur. Wellcome, Hanson and Marks and
Spencer were also actively traded. Wellcome had 1,853 lots dealt.

FT  23 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Investors build on Wednesday
rally in Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
In spite of further turmoil on Latin American debt and equity markets and
declines in Treasury prices, leading US stocks firmed yesterday as investors
looked to build on Wednesday's strong rally, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 13.12 at 3,814.92. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 performed less well, ending only
0.06 higher at 459.67, while the American SE composite slipped 0.41 to
427.52 and the Nasdaq composite rose 2.22 to 739.34. New York SE volume was
340.3m shares.
The market opened in an upbeat mood following the previous day's 35-point
gain which pushed the Dow above the 3,800 level for the first time since
mid-November.
The day's main economic news - an upward revision in third-quarter gross
domestic product growth from 3.9 per cent to 4.0 per cent - had little
impact on stocks. Although bond prices declined, this too had little effect
on the market, which appeared to be in the middle of establishing a solid
late-December rally.
The positive mood, however, was dampened by events in Latin America, where
most bond and stock markets were rocked by the news that the Mexican
government had abandoned plans to try and keep the value of the peso within
a particular trading range. From now on, it will let the currency float
freely against the dollar.
The announcement prompted heavy selling of Mexican ADRs (American Depositary
Receipts). Telefonos de Mexico fell Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 40 5/8 in
volume of 17m shares, the construction giant Grupo Tribasa by Dollars 2 3/4
to Dollars 19 5/8 , the media conglomerate Grupo Televisa by Dollars 3 3/8
to Dollars 32 1/8 and the bank Grupo Financiero by Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars
8 7/8 . Selling spread to other Latin American ADRs, with Telecom Argentina
falling Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 47 5/8 .
The Latin American turmoil upset US banks which do a lot of business in the
region. Citicorp fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 41 1/4 , Bank of Boston Dollars
3/4 to Dollars 26 3/4 and JP Morgan Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 55 1/4 . In
contrast, Bankers Trust rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 56 5/8 after the bank
agreed to pay a relatively modest fine of Dollars 10m to government
regulators to settle charges relating to its sale of derivatives to the
Gibson Greetings company.
On the Nasdaq market, Borland International declined Dollars  7/8 to Dollars
6 5/8 after the technology group said revenues in the current quarter would
be substantially lower than a year ago.
Canada
Toronto finished slightly higher as markets showed signs of winding down for
the holiday season. The TSE 300 composite index added 7.10 at 4,182.72 and
advances outscored falls by 399 to 321 after volume of 48.1m shares valued
at CDollars 527m. Ten of the 14 sub-indices rose, including golds.

FT  23 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Volatility in Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexican equities were extremely volatile as investors reacted to news that
the government had decided to allow the peso to float freely against the
dollar.
The IPC index opened with a gain of nearly 4 per cent before sliding into
negative territory by mid-morning, and then staging another rally to close
4.66 per cent or 102.59 points up on the day at 2,306.26. Volume was a heavy
223m shares.
Mr Alfredo Viegas, emerging market strategist at Salomon Brothers in New
York, downgraded Mexico and recommended a switch into Brazil.
He said that while the government's devaluation of the peso and subsequent
decision to float the currency was good news in the long term, 'it comes at
the wrong time and in an environment of confusion . . . Brazil, however,
should continue to demonstrate positive momentum through early next year'.
Brazil
Equities in Sao Paulo plunged nearly 11 per cent at the opening as investors
liquidated positions, fearing a fallout from the crisis in Mexico.
However, some recovery was seen later and the Bovespa index finished 2,740
or 6.1 per cent down at 42,212. The government was seen selling dollars to
support the Real.
Argentina
The Merval index fell 4 per cent in the first minutes of trading, but ended
above the worst with a loss of 14.61 or 3.0 per cent at 472.09. Local stocks
tumbled after ADRs opened sharply lower on Wall Street.

FT  23 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris gains ground as it nears
end of account
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sandwiched between two sets of Wall Street gains, bourses mostly kept their
nerve, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS gained ground, with the CAC-40 index rising 11.16 to 1,952.05, after a
high of 1,956 and a low of 1,935.
Turnover was heavy on the last day before the end of the December account at
FFr5.7bn.
James Capel downgraded Lyonnaise des Eaux, off 90 centimes at FFr474.10, to
hold. The broker said that it had altered its opinion following the
company's recent announcement that it was seeking to expand its cable
television activities, after it had failed to win the concession for the
country's third mobile telephone licence.
Capel was worried over the group's strategic focus, and feared that it would
'see further heavy expenditure offering inadequate returns,' which could
result in a deterioration of previously stable debt levels.
'The Lyonnaise share has outperformed by 3 per cent over the last twelve
months,' the broker concluded, 'and it is now on a 30 per cent premium to
the market in 1996. Although we expect 20 per cent per annum earnings growth
in 1997 and 1998, we feel that the current rating reflects this.'
Elsewhere, Accor rose FFr14 to FFr570 and Michelin continued to be well
supported, gaining FFr3.10 to FFr199.10.
FRANKFURT switched its attention from chemicals to steels, engineers and
retailers as the Dax index added to Wednesday's post bourse gains, closing
the session 13.99 higher at 2,100.65, and the post bourse at 2,102.25.
Turnover rose from DM4.4bn to DM5.2bn.
Bayer and Hoechst, in the spotlight on Wednesday, were less than a
percentage point better. The hope that higher product prices would be
established in 1995 moved to the metal-based industries, said Mr Hans-Peter
Wodniok at Robert Fleming in Frankfurt: Linde was up DM10.50 at DM899,
Preussag DM6 at DM448 and Thyssen DM5 at DM289.50.
Traders were probably more excited about Thyssen's plans for carving itself
a 10 per cent slice of the German telecommunications industry, said Mr
Wodniok, who rated this a long term prospect; he saw recovery prospects in
retailing in the same light, and thought that the gains of DM9 to DM574 for
Karstadt, and DM20.50, or 4.4 per cent to DM483 for Kaufhof were too early
for an industry which may still have problems to face in 1995.
MILAN accepted the news of the resignation of Mr Silvio Berlusconi as prime
minister with a slight improvement, while investors began to speculate what
the next course of action would be. The Comit index was up 3.24 at 627.30.
Although the resignation had been expected all week, Mr Berlusconi's action
opened up fresh political problems.
The Italian president, Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, asked Mr Berlusconi to
remain in office while he decided the next step in the constitutional
process. Mr Berlusconi, who was due to make a televised address to the
nation last night, has insisted that new elections take place; but the
president could ask for the formation of a new government, possibly led by a
non-political leader for which there is recent precedent.
With investors, brokers and analysts concentrating on the political arena,
corporate activity was limited. Stet gained L70 to L4,630, while Telecom
Italia slipped L80 to L4,095; Fiat lost 1.4 per cent to L5,890 and Olivetti
1 per cent to L1,953.
ZURICH followed Wall Street higher in late afternoon, the SMI index closing
13.70 higher at 2,649.8. The higher dollar promoted stocks of companies with
a substantial proportion of their sales denominated in the US currency.
Alusuisse rose SFr8 to SFr655 as it followed the recent rise in US aluminium
stocks, and denied rumours that it might sell its own aluminium business.
Ciba-Geigy put on SFr17 to SFr795; the shares broke through a resistance
level as Ciba bought Rhone Poulenc Rorer's proprietary pharmaceutical
business in the US and Canada.
Elsewhere, Union Bank of Switzerland led the advance in the banking sector,
advancing SFr18 to SFr1,095 amid reports of year-end window dressing.
However, Holderbank, the building group, led active stocks as it fell SFr14
to SFr1,042.
AMSTERDAM was firmer in subdued trading. The AEX index put on 2.00 to
415.35.
While activity was generally patchy, interest continued in KPN and Philips,
whose shares were the most heavily traded.
The telecoms group lost 80 cents to Fl 58.40 as some profits were booked
after recent strength. Philips added 30 cents to Fl 52.50 on news that its
lighting joint venture with Siemens of Germany had been cleared by the
European Commission.
Further strength was seen in Unilever, up Fl 2.10 to Fl 204.30 and Akzo
Nobel, up Fl 2.60 at Fl 197.70.
MADRID fell yet again, with Telefonica prominent among the losers. The
general index closed 0.39 lower at 291.20 with Telefonica down Pta40, or 2.5
per cent at Pta1,535 in 2.3m shares.
COPENHAGEN heard an analysts' poll say that the KFX index would rise by some
20 per cent next year; the same poll, noted Reuter, predicted a 15 per cent
gain for 1994 but, by yesterday morning, the market was 14 per cent down on
the year so far.
Yesterday the KFX index bridged some of the gap with a rise of 1.70, or 1.8
per cent to 94.12. Novo Nordisk rose DKr23, or 4.2 per cent to stock on
plans to reorganise and streamline the pharmaceutical company.

FT  23 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Seoul anticipates easing
of securities regulations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Heavy arbitrage buying spurred by a stronger futures market boosted share
prices, and the Nikkei index closed 1.5 per cent up, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index added 292.86 to close at the day's high of 19,633.53
after opening at a low of 19,400.58. Arbitrage linked buying supported the
index, absorbing selling by institutional investors in the afternoon.
Corporate profit-taking and position covering dampened buying around the
19,500 level, but continued arbitrage purchases supported the index, which
closed at its highest since November 4.
Volume rose to 370m shares from Wednesday's 282m. The Topix index of all
first section stocks gained 23.01 or 1.5 per cent at 1,545.02, while the
Nikkei 300 advanced 3.84 or 1.4 per cent to 284.70. Rises led declines by
1,011 to 107, with 83 issues unchanged.
Traders said that arbitrage buying both on the Nikkei 225 and Topix futures
were being executed by a leading US investment house. In London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 1.23 at 1,281.60.
Bank stocks were higher on arbitrage buying. Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank rose Y40
to Y1,910 and Sakura Bank moved up Y10 to Y1,350. While the banking industry
has been previously weak on fears of bad loans, some analysts predicted that
they could perform more strongly next year on a rise in index-linked
purchases. 'Stock picking is going to be harder than ever and many domestic
institutions are likely to purchase the index,' said one Japanese broker.
The rise in trading volumes supported brokerage stocks. Nomura Securities
rose Y50 to Y2,070 and Nikko Securities added Y20 at Y1,080. Smaller houses
were also stronger, with Sanyo Securities climbing Y25 to Y510.
High-technology issues were bought as investors were encouraged by a
stabilising currency market. Hitachi rose Y9 to Y969 on active buying by
dealers and financial institutions, while Toshiba appreciated Y5 to Y704.
Some drug companies, on the other hand, lost ground on profit-taking.
Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical and Daiichi Pharmaceutical each fell Y20 to Y2,050
and Y1,550.
Japan Tobacco rose Y38,000 or 4.1 per cent to Y974,000, advancing for the
fourth day and bringing its gain since last Friday to 7.3 per cent.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 231.83 to 21,327.86 in volume of 91.5m
shares.
Roundup
On balance, share prices in the region ended on the plus side, some of them
less firmly than they started.
SEOUL climbed, anticipating the Finance Ministry's post- bourse announcement
of measures to ease securities rules in capital markets, and the stock
exchange's widening of the permissible daily band in which share prices
could move, from 4.6 to 6 per cent.
The composite index closed 13.34 higher at 1,040.20 as volume rose from
40.93m shares to 45.47m. The stock exchange also said it would scrap an
obligation for institutions to deposit 20 per cent of the total cost when
placing buy orders, effective from January 3.
MANILA extended its advance to a sixth consecutive day, but profit-taking
pulled back substantial early gains that followed New York's good overnight
recovery. The composite index ended at 2,807.07, up 16.48, after hitting
2,834.75 at midsession.
HONG KONG, too, was trimmed back by profit-taking, the Hang Seng index
closing 81.10 higher at 8,412.66 after 8,460.35. Analysts said that
investors, widely expecting another US rate increase in January, were
unwilling to commit themselves beyond the short term.
Mainland China stocks outperformed the market, the H share index rising
17.87 or 1.7 per cent to 1,087.56.
KUALA LUMPUR's composite index topped 1,000, with an intraday high of
1,003.61, before profit-taking brought it back to close 12.17 or 1.2 per
cent up on balance at 994.34. Brokers, however, thought that window dressing
might allow the market to test the 1,000 level before the year ended.
SINGAPORE saw the Straits Times Industrial index close 2.11 higher at
2,219.59 after early buying by Japanese investment trusts of blue chips took
it to an intraday peak of 2,242.57.
JAKARTA gained ground mainly on local buying as the JKSE index moved ahead
2.88 to 469.29. However, the market newcomer, Davamas Abadi, ended at
Rp3,000 after Rp3,350, trading in more than 2m shares, compared with the IPO
price of Rp3,300.
KARACHI reported fresh buying, prompted by the arrival of Pakistan's
president, Mr Farooq Leghari, and its prime minister, Mrs Benazir Bhutto, in
the violence-plagued city.
The KSE 100 index rose 27.62 or 1.4 per cent to 1,983.72. Dealers also said
that reports of progress in peace talks between the government and the
ethnic Mohajir National Movement had boosted investor confidence.
WELLINGTON closed 1.4 per cent down in spite of Wall Street, and a Standard
&amp; Poor's upgrade to AA of New Zealand's credit rating.
The NZSE-40 index fell 27.22 to 1,911.05 in turnover of NZDollars 55.3m,
dealers saying that a good deal of foreign selling had still been
overhanging the market.
Fletcher Challenge led the market down as brokers said a threatened strike
in its Canadian operations could hit FCL earnings by NZDollars 10m a week.
They added that there was the potential for a lengthy dispute. The shares
ended 18 cents down at NZDollars 3.70.
SYDNEY found enthusiasm for Wall Street's lead abating in afternoon trading,
and the All Ordinaries index finished just 2.7 higher at 1,908.2 in turnover
of ADollars 397.1m.
A strong performance from the market leader, BHP, underpinned the market.
The stock continued to find buying support following the release of strong
half-year results last Friday, and finished 12 cents higher at ADollars
19.60.
COLOMBO overcame year-end profit-taking.
Institutional investors booked capital profits but the CSE index closed 9.13
points firmer at 979.84.
TAIPEI ended below the 7,000-point level following active trade on
profit-taking in textiles, the weighted index closing 44.92 lower at
6,965.68, after a day's high of 7,086.23, in turnover of TDollars 114bn.

South African shares finished easier but the undertone was still firm,
supported by a strong bullion price and gains on world markets.

further US interest in South African ADRs, but shed gains later.
The overall index declined 5.8 to 5,798.7, the industrial index was 15.1

FT  23 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Mexican peso hits fresh low in volatile
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican peso was again the focus of attention yesterday as the
government's decision to allow it to float freely drove the currency to a
new low, writes Philip Gawith.
This followed the government's decision on Tuesday to try and manage the
peso's decline by announcing a 15 per cent devaluation.
Yesterday's decision was a recognition that the speculative forces lined up
against the currency were too powerful to be resisted.
Trading conditions were thin and volatile, with investors nervous about the
outlook. Spreads were very large, with the peso quoted at 4.6-4.8 to the
dollar in the New York morning. It closed at 3.987 pesos in London on
Wednesday.
The Italian lira continued its slow recovery on news that Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the prime minister, had resigned. It finished in London at
L1,039 per D-Mark from L1,045.
In thin trade, the Canadian dollar broke through Dollars 0.7147, its weakest
level in more than eight years. Traders said investors were worried about
Canadian fiscal and political issues.
The US dollar was firmer, helped by a flight to safety from Mexico. It
closed at DM1.5805 from DM1.5703 and at Y100.495 from Y100.17. In New York
it eased back to end at DM1.5742 and Y100.25.
Sterling had a steady day following its sharp overnight fall of around two
cents against the dollar. Traders said this was a function of dollar
strength, not sterling weakness. The pound closed at DM2.4417, from
DM2.4491, and at Dollars 1.545, from Dollars 1.5597.
In Germany, the Bundesbank council left interest rates unchanged. It did the
same for the 1995 M3 money supply growth target, left at 4 to 6 per cent, as
in 1994.
The Mexican treasury secretary Mr Jaime Serra Puche said the free float of
the peso would be allowed for a 60-day period. He said the government had
decided, with business and trade union leaders, against permitting any price
or wage increases during the period.
Explaining the decision, he said: 'The financial authorities have decided
that supply and demand will freely determine the rate of exchange until the
currency markets show conditions of stability.'
Mr Serra Puche revealed that reserves of the central bank, Banco de Mexico,
had fallen to Dollars 6.5bn in recent days, following attempts to prop up
the peso during recent bear markets.
Mr Serra met with officials of the New York Fed and other banking and
investment officials. Earlier the US and Canadian central banks had pledged
USDollars 1bn and CDollars 1bn to support the peso, if necessary.
A trader at a large New York bank said there continued to be a 'major
exodus' from Mexico, although selling pressure was not as heavy as in the
previous two days.
She added that trading conditions were very thin. On deals of only Dollars
5m the spread was 20 centavos. Normally, though, 'Mexico was a market that
could absorb Dollars 100m without a problem'.
The trader predicted that the peso would probably settle at around 4.5 pesos
to the dollar, although it could be a while before this happened.
Analysts were puzzled at the sharp overnight weakness in sterling, which
coincided with the announcement of the UK's first current account surplus
since 1987.
Mr Jonathan Griggs, economic adviser at Barclays, said markets were
exceedingly thin, and technically driven. He said sterling had fallen
through key chart points, prompted by dollar strength following the unrest
in Mexico.
Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-Amro in London, said there
was little logic to sterling's decline, and he was reluctant to draw any
conclusion about trends in such thin trading conditions.
He surmised that one of the reasons sterling had been hard hit was that it
was one of the more liquid currencies. Matters were not helped by an opinion
poll showing the government to be the most unpopular in polling history.
Traders said there had been negligible market response to the Bundesbank
council meeting. Mr Tietmeyer repeated the Bundesbank line that it had the
option both to raise and lower rates. His other main point was that monetary
policy needed support from wages and fiscal policy.
The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 1.2bn money market shortage in its
morning operations.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK Christmas tree buyers go
up-market - Customers want bushier varieties that do not drop their needles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hormone therapy for Christmas trees might sound a bit far-fetched. But the
novel technique is being tested for the first time in the UK as part of a
drive by growers to respond to the demands of an increasingly discerning
public.
For decades British customers have been content to buy a traditional Norway
spruce at Christmas and sweep up the needles as they drop off in centrally
heated living rooms. But now the market - which takes over 5m trees worth at
least Pounds 50m a year - is demanding varieties with no 'needle drop' and
developing a taste for bushier or more scented types, with less spiky
needles.
Hormone therapy, already used in Denmark, involves spraying the central
leader, or main spike, of the Christmas tree to inhibit its growth and allow
the side branches to become more bushy.
Mr Joseph Noblett, a dealer based near Preston in Lancashire, plans to try
it out on top-priced Noble firs on several plots in Scotland next year. He
sells about 30,000 trees a year, most of which are Lodgepole pines from
Scotland - similar to Scots pines but with darker, straighter needles. Bushy
growth on these trees can be encouraged through seed selection without the
need for expensive hormone treatment.
'We believe there's been a significant growth in the market for Lodgepole
pines in the last couple of years, particularly in the north of England and
the Midlands,' he says.
Enthusiasm for the Lodgepole is a bonus for woodland owners, who have used
the trees for the past two decades as a 'nurse species' to force the growth
of Sitka spruce, the main timber tree. Lodgepoles are good at taking up
nutrients from deep, peaty soil, which they then transfer to the Sitkas as
their roots inter-link.
Normally they wither and die after 25 to 30 years as the Sitkas shade them
out, says Mr Bruce Taylor, forestry manager with Bell Ingram, a firm of
chartered surveyors, which manages 25,000 acres of commercial woodland on
estates in northern Scotland. However, the more recently introduced Alaskan
variety of Lodgepole is proving suitable for the Christmas tree market and
can provide landowners with a net return of up to Pounds 3 a tree when
harvested after seven to 10 years, once its 'nursing' role is over.
'The Lodgepole's main asset is that it holds its needles,' Mr Taylor
explains. 'It can be cut in October and still have its needles in
mid-January. The Norway spruce has to be cut in December, otherwise the
needles will fall off.'
The cost of Lodgepole or Scots pines is the same as or slightly more than
that of Norway spruces. Yet despite the recession, the biggest growth in the
market has been in the more elegant and expensive Nordmann and Noble firs,
according to the British Christmas Tree Growers' Association. These have
softer needles, stronger branches and a more pronounced scent and they
command a retail price of about Pounds 5 a foot, compared with Pounds 2 a
foot for a Norway spruce.
'People are keen to have real trees, and there's quite a lot of money
about,' says Mr Tony Richardson, the association's secretary. The market
share of the Nordmann fir has grown from 5 per cent to 15 per cent in the
past five years, while that of the Norway spruce has dropped from 75 per
cent to 60-65 per cent. As growers have learnt to shape Lodgepole and Scots
pines for the Christmas market, their share has risen to about 10 per cent.
Less than a fifth of the trees on sale in Britain this year are imported -
mainly from Denmark and Belgium. This is partly because expert Danes have
begun to grow Christmas trees in the UK and partly because British producers
are improving their methods.
Woodland managers like Bell Ingram are urging landowners to take advantage
of the Christmas market and increase production. Otherwise, they believe, UK
supplies of pines like the Lodgepole could become scarce because of the
decline in new timber plantings that followed the abolition of tax
concessions in 1988.
'The market is being built up just now, but it might disappear again,' says
Mr Taylor.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Titanium development to cost
over ADollars 200m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian resources group, is to invest over
ADollars 200m (Pounds 99m) in developing a titanium minerals deposit at
Beenup in Western Australia.
When operational, in about a year's time, the dredge mining and mineral
separation operation at Beenup will generate about 600,000 tonnes of
ilmenite and zircon a year. BHP added that it had also negotiated a smelter
joint venture with the Tinfos group in Norway to process the ilmenite from
the mine into high-quality titanium pigment feedstock. This will be used in
the Tinfos Titan &amp; Iron smelter at Norway's Tyssedal.
Sale contracts covering the bulk of the ilmenite and slag output had been
negotiated, BHP said.
The Beenup deposits, discovered in 1988, contain an indicated resource of
83m tonnes of ilmenite. Of this, 33m tonnes is measured. BHP said there was
also exploration potential, which could extend the resource. The company's
shares closed 14 cents higher on the news, at ADollars 19.60.
Robe River, the iron ore producer which is 53 per cent owned by Australia's
North group, yesterday announced that it had negotiated a 7.3 per cent
increase in the selling price of iron ore sinter fines for 1995-96 in its
annual contract negotiations with the Japanese steel mills.
It said it had also agreed a guaranteed minimum sales volume to Japan of
12.5m dry long tons for 1995/6, the same as in the current year.
Much of the benefit of rises in the pricing current round could be eroded by
the increased strength of the Australian dollar over the past year. The
contract prices, and the percentage increases, relate to US dollars.

FT  23 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The only wool auction this week was in New Zealand, and prices were
generally a little firmer. The official market indicator closed 7 cents
higher at 517 cents a kg. and only 11% was unsold at growers' reserves, a
little better than recent clearances. Wool markets for some weeks have
managed to hold firm, and closed firmly before the Christmas recess, despite
some loss of confidence in the strongly rising price trend which applied for
most of 1994. There is uncertainty about price changes ahead. Statistically
the evidence points to strength in the outlook, but there is powerful
resistance to price rises already established in primary markets, but not
yet passed on to consumers. The problems in absorbing raw material price
increases are not confined to wool or to textiles and trade opinion is that
a further price rise would not make things easier.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Anglesey mine hopes revived
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes have been raised again that Britain's first big base metals mine for
decades will be developed at Parys Mountain, Anglesey.
This follows a change in the majority shareholder at Anglesey Mining, the
London-quoted company that has been dormant for two years after running out
of cash for the mine, which was to have produced zinc, lead and copper plus
a few troy ounces of gold.
However, Mr John Kearney, well-known in the mining industry as chairman of
Northgate Exploration, a Canadian company, and who has taken over as
chairman of Anglesey, is cautious about prospects. He says that, although
his objective is to see the UK company as an active mining company, at
present there are no plans to re-start the Parys Mountain project.
First Anglesey's outstanding debts have to be dealt with. Then Mr Kearney
promises 'we will take another look at the Parys Mountain project. It has
titillated mining companies for decades'. Anglesey spent about Pounds 8.5m
in four years on the project and Mr Kearney says that all the work will be
reviewed. 'It is a marginal property. We will see if mining can be done more
cheaply, more efficiently.'
The Parys Mountain area of North Wales has a long mining history, dating
back to Roman times. During the late 18th century it had one of the world's
largest copper mines, supplying much of the metal required for Britain's
industrial revolution.
About 3.5m tonnes of rock was moved by hand, pulled up from a growing pit by
ropes and eventually the mountain contained the biggest man-made hole in the
world - a position it retained until the late 1890s. Mining eventually ended
in 1911 after 143 years of almost continuous activity during which an
estimated 130,000 tonnes of copper was produced.
Backing the attempted revival of the Anglesey company is Mid Ocean
Investments, a private, Bermuda-based corporation which Mr Kearney says
'represents private money which believes in the mining business'. He is a
director of Mid Ocean.
Mid Ocean acquired a 29.3 per cent stake in Anglesey from Imperial Metals,
another Canadian company which previously backed Anglesey and is left with
11.9 per cent. Mid Ocean also bought all of Imperial's loans to Anglesey
totalling Pounds 1.8m. Mid Ocean has agreed not to call these in, says Mr
Kearney.
However, there is another Pounds 800,000 owed to about 12 third-party
creditors so the debt must be restructured.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: BHP iron ore price settlement
disappoints other producers - The implications of a bench-mark deal reached
this week with Japanese steel-makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BOB JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The international benchmark prices for 1995 iron ore deliveries settled by
BHP in Japan on Wednesday go some way to make up the drop suffered by miners
this year. The reaction of BHP's fellow suppliers, however, has been less
than enthusiastic.
The details are that iron ore fines prices, on an fob basis, will rise by
5.8 per cent for deliveries to Japan from April l next year. The new BHP
fines price is 27.15 cents for each 1 per cent of pure Fe content (or, per
dry long ton unit). The new lump ore price of 33 cents a lont ton unit
represents an increase of 7.9 per cent and gives BHP a rough overall price
rise for its Japanese deliveries of 6.9 per cent. Most miners had been
hoping for the fines price to rise by a high single-digit percentage.
BHP ranks as the second largest Australian iron ore supplier to Japan after
CPA's Hamersley Iron. In 1994 its Japanese shipments are likely to total
about 11m tonnes - 800,000 tonnes higher than the minimum it contracted to
supply during 1994. Its minimum contractual tonnage in the 1995 fiscal year
will be 13.6m tonnes.
By settling before Hamersley BHP regained some of the clout as an iron ore
supplier that it lost when a wall collapsed at its Mt Whaleback mine in 1989
and the company had to declare force majeure. The settlement also
established a new record premium in Japan for lump over fines of 8.74 cents.
Lump ore makes up just over half of BHP's Japanese deliveries.
To many in the ore trade, however, the fact that BHP has recently been
supplying more than its minimum obligation in what is supposed to be a
disastrous financial year for the Japanese mills indicates that the
suppliers could have got higher prices. It is true that Japanese steel MilIs
have been heavily lossmaking until very recently, but there are undeniable
signs of recovery. Japanese crude steel output in November was 15 per cent
higher than in November 1993.
In the latter half of 1994, iron ore consumers, especially in Europe, have
been concerned about running short of higher grade lump and pellet. Unlike
fines, these grades are directly chargeable to the blast furnace and do not
require sintering. European steelmakers, especially in Benelux and
Scandinavia, are closing their sinter plants for environmental reasons,
adding to the pressure on direct-charge ores.
Steelmakers, which in Europe and Japan tend not to have direct stakes in
iron ore mines, are often accused of ignoring the necessity of allowing
miners a reasonable return on investment. In the economically sluggish years
since 1990 iron ore prices have fallen. Miners are nowadays frequently heard
to say that prices are returns are insufficient to justify the expansions or
developments of new capacity needed to ensure healthy supply in the future.
Analysts believe supplies of lump and pellet will be tight throughout 1995,
with fines remaining in balance. Investment may not be taking place in large
greenfield mine developments, but there have been just about enough
expansions or capacity replacements to cover short-term consumption.
Hamersley's new Marandoo mine in Western Australia and the M'haoudat mine in
Mauritania are among the most significant such developments this year.
China's continuing hunger for imported iron ore was witnessed in the opening
by Portman Mining of a new joint venture mine at Koolyanobbing in Western
Australia dedicated entirely to supplying China. In addition Venezuela's CVG
opened a 3m-tonnes-a-year pelletising plant last month. In April 1995 LKAB
of Sweden plans to inaugurate its 4m-tonne pelletiser at Kiruna.
Until ore prices improve sufficiently to allow large-scale investment for
the blast furnace market, the ore industry's attention will be focused on
developing direct-charge products for the direct reduced iron sector. DRI is
the fastest growing area in iron making, because the various DR technologies
are beginning to prove themselves as viable alternatives to traditional
blast furnace-based steelworks. Smaller scale, cleaner plants can be built
at a fraction of the cost of the traditional works.
Already this year the leading US mini-mill, Nucor Corp, has opened the
world's first iron carbide plant in Trinidad. BHP is also on the point of
approving the construction of an export-oriented hot briquetted iron plant
in western Australia. India has built a 5m-tonnes-a-year DRI industry in the
last few years. Further investments in DRI have been announced in South
Korea, Venezuela and Bahrain.
The volume of iron ore consumed in DR iron making is still small compared
with the blast furnace sector. The total seaborne trade in iron ore this
year has been estimated at 368m tonnes. Annual world production of DRI has
only just topped 2.5m tonnes, but the demand for DR-grade ores is likely to
double in the next few years. Prices for DR-grade ores look set to outstrip
those in the blast furnace sector.
The fact that scrap consuming mini-mills such as Nucor, which are the
fastest growing steelmakers in the world, are themselves beginning to invest
in the new iron making processes spells hope for the iron ore industry in
the long term.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries weaken as auction flounders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Treasuries yield curve flattened further yesterday after a
disappointing auction of five-year notes left the short end of the market
bearing the burden of late selling pressure.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/8 at 95
13/16 , yielding 7.853 per cent. The short end was even weaker, with the
two-year note down  7/32 at 99 19/32 , to carry a yield of 7.707 per cent.
Trading was quiet in the morning as business continued to wind down ahead of
the Christmas holiday. The only economic news - an upward revision in the
figure for third quarter gross domestic product from growth of 3.9 per cent
to growth of 4 per cent - had little impact on sentiment.
Instead, the chief influence on market activity was the auction of Dollars
11bn in five-year notes. Although the strength of demand at Wednesday's
two-year note auction was encouraging, dealers were concerned that the
five-year notes would prove a harder sell.
As feared, the auction was poorly received, and the notes were sold at an
average yield of 7.85 per cent, higher than expected. The sale left dealers
holding a large amount of the new issue, and prompted them to sell
shorter-term securities to make room for the new inventory.
European government bonds had another quiet day, with turnover drying to a
trickle as participants began to leave for their Christmas holidays.
Italian bonds rose following the resignation of prime minister Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, but some of their gains were wiped out in late trading as
dealers pondered the implications of his departure.
'Berlusconi had been on the brink for so long that his resignation was just
a confirmation of everyone's expectations - it had been widely discounted,'
said one dealer.
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro today will begin consultations on the
nomination of a new prime minister. If no satisfactory candidate is found,
he could dissolve parliament and call new elections.
Many dealers consider elections the worst-case scenario, as they would
prolong the political uncertainty which has dogged Italy's markets for
months. Their favourite solution seems to be an institutional government
encompassing most of the parties represented in parliament.
The March BTP futures contract on Liffe ended around 99.69, up 0.24 point
but off its intra-day high of 99.96.
French bonds staged a smart rally, recovering from recent oversold levels.
Although the March notional bond futures contract drifted slightly lower in
after-hours dealings on Globex, it rose by 0.70 point on Matif to 111.36.
The 10-year yield spread over Germany narrowed by five basis points to 59
basis points.
At the short end, the March three-month Pibor contract on Matif gained 0.11
point to 93.36. After sharply underperforming its German counterpart in
recent weeks, it needs to get more in line with the German euromark
contract, given that France's monetary policy is likely to continue tracking
Germany's, dealers said.
German bonds posted small gains on scattered cash buying and some late
short-covering in extremely thin volume. As expected, the Bundesbank left
its M3 money supply growth range for 1995 unchanged from this year's, at
between 4 and 6 per cent. The March bund futures contract on DTB ended at
89.87, up 0.22 point.
UK gilts had a slow day, shrugging off news that the current account turned
into surplus for the first time in years. The long gilt future on Liffe
ended at 102 5/32, down 3/16 point.

FT  23 DEC 94 / International Bonds: Issuers play on French volatility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Highly-structured French franc deals dominated the eurobond market
yesterday, as issuers moved to take advantage of increased volatility in the
French bond market.
French short-term bond market rates, in particular, have been volatile in
recent months, over uncertainty surrounding next year's presidential
election.
Depfa, Germany's largest mortgage bank, launched two FFr1bn offerings of
two-year floating-rate notes (FRNs), both with a cap on the maximum coupon
payable.
Societe Generale Acceptance (SGA), a special purpose vehicle which taps
international capital markets through a Dollars 10bn medium-term note
programme, launched a FFr1.5bn offering of three-year FRNs, which also have
a restriction on the maximum coupon payable.
The SGA notes pay a coupon of 150 basis points above the three-month Paris
interbank offered rate (Pibor) only if the Pibor is within a 100 basis point
range, calculated using the average of the Pibor spot and future rates.
Capping the coupon in this way means the notes can generate a higher margin
above Pibor than would have been the case without a cap. This increases the
notes' attractiveness to investors.
The first Depfa tranche offered 50 basis points over three-month Pibor with
a maximum coupon of 7.7 per cent. The second tranche, targeted more at
investors who think French interest rates are set to rise further, offered
30 basis points above Pibor up to a maximum coupon of 8 per cent.
The Depfa transactions, part of the proceeds from which were swapped into
floating-rate D-Marks and the remainder kept in French francs, were driven
mainly by French institutional interest, Depfa said. However, the deals also
met interest from German banks and institutions, and funds in the Benelux
countries, Switzerland and the UK.
The deals bring Depfa's borrowing programme for 1994 to a close. It has
borrowed an equivalent of DM18bn this year, Dollars 5bn of this on the
eurobond market, Mr Frank Reuhland, treasurer, said.
The Societe Generale offering was sold to investors in the Benelux and
Switzerland and to funds in London.

FT  23 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Paying for the excesses of an
acquisitive past - Credit Lyonnais appears to be behind schedule in its
FFr20bn asset sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christmas may be near, but Credit Lyonnais, the troubled bank controlled by
the French state, has hardly had time to enjoy the festivities as it deals
with its over-consumption of the past few years.
Barely has a day gone by in the past few months without some mention of the
bank: either the latest effort to sell off part of its portfolio of
subsidiaries and investments, or a new twist in its long-running battle with
Mr Bernard Tapie, the businessman and politician.
In the latest development, Credit Lyonnais yesterday confirmed it was in
talks to sell off the 20 per cent stake owned by its investment arm Clinvest
in the Forum des Halles, the former central Paris fresh food market
converted into a commercial centre in the 1970s.
In July, it disposed of its 65 per cent stake in FNAC, the retailer which
has one of its main showrooms in the complex of shops inside Les Halles.
On Tuesday, it announced the sale of its 57.3 per cent stake in Banca
Lombarda to Credito Agrario Bresciano for about FFr650m (Dollars 119.9m). It
has already closed other European operations this year, including its retail
branches in the UK.
Its other important sales this year include its stake in UAF, the life
insurance company, for FFr1.16bn, and its shareholdings in Meridien Hotels,
the specialist glass company Essilor, retail group Pinault-Printemps and
TF1, the television channel.
An announcement is likely shortly on the possible sale of Adidas, the
sportswear manufacturer, which Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus, its chief executive,
has an option to buy until the beginning of January.
Other important deals include MGM, the film studio, which the bank is
committed to selling, at least in part, by 1997.
All of these transactions reflect the bank's plans to shed costs and
generate income as part of a restructuring aimed at reducing its enormous
losses, reported at FFr6.9bn for 1993 and FFr4.5bn for the first half of
this year alone, on top of bad debt provisions of FFr10.1bn.
However, Credit Lyonnais faces a difficult task. As part of the
restructuring agreed with the French government last year, it needs to sell
off FFr20bn in industrial and commercial assets in 1994 and 1995. Currently,
the total is a little more than FFr9bn, and it looks as though it may be
falling behind its target.
Nevertheless, some analysts have been convinced by the apparent assurances
given in the autumn by Mr Jean-Louis Peyrelevade, the chairman appointed by
the government last year, that losses this year will be no more than in
1993.
This was taken to imply that the state has in effect underwritten any losses
beyond this level - something the French treasury refuses to confirm.
However, one French analyst said yesterday: 'Nobody really knows enough
about the accounts and assets of Credit Lyonnais, and only a few people in
the government know whether they will salvage it.
'The bank can offer an opportunity to an investor who is ready to assume a
very risky bet.'
Certainly, little of the recent news of court battles and disposals has done
much to affect the price of its certificats d'investissement, the bank's
only traded shares, which are non-voting. They have remained relatively
stable, after a succession of bad news earlier in the year drove them down
sharply.
Even so, Credit Lyonnais has remained a story of interest to the French
press, if only because of Mr Bernard Tapie, the colourful businessman and
politician who was an important client of the bank and who symbolises
something of its history.
Recent weeks have seen numerous twists in the protracted legal battles
between Mr Tapie and the bank. He has now been declared personally bankrupt,
and a court ruling in a few days will determine whether a liquidator can
begin to sell his assets - the proceeds from which would be split primarily
between Credit Lyonnais and the French tax authorities.
Mr Tapie has appealed the bankruptcy order - which jeopardises his political
career - and a hearing is expected in March. Meanwhile, he is suing Credit
Lyonnais, claiming that it shares responsibility for the management of some
of his companies.
The courts recently rejected his libel claim against the bank and against
newspapers that ran advertisements portraying his name on dustbins
associated with the clear-out at the bank. Based on past experience, he will
no doubt appeal.

FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: CRA provides more for copper
buy-out costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRA, the Australian mining group, said yesterday that it would take a
further ADollars 115m (USDollars 89m) after-tax provision to cover the costs
of buying out its Japanese partners in Southern Copper, and closing and
possibly demolishing the smelting operation, writes Nikki Tait. The
provision is in addition to writedowns on the investment in previous years,
and will be treated as an abnormal item against 1994 earnings.
The decision to close the facilities has already been announced, but CRA,
which is 49 per cent owned by RTZ of the UK, said yesterday that it formally
bought out its partners, Nissho Iwai and Furukawa.

Pacific Dunlop, the Australian conglomerate, has formed a new joint venture
with the Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon, Sri Lanka's largest
listed company, and this in turn has acquired a 75 per cent interest in
Kelani Cables, a local cable manufacturing business, writes Nikki Tait.
Pacific Dunlop, which has a majority interest in the Lanka Olex joint
venture, said about ADollars 23m (USDollars 17.8m) would be invested in
Kelani Cables over the next three years, with the aim of making this the
first local manufacturer of metallic telecommunications cables in Sri Lanka.
A new plant will be built as part of the venture, and this should start
operating by early-1996.

at halfway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wheelock and Company, the Hong Kong holding company for the late Sir YK
Pao's listed corporate empire, lifted first-half net profits 13 per cent to
HKDollars 1.06bn (USDollars 137m) from last year's corresponding HKDollars
940.3m, year, wites Louise Lucas in Hong Kong.
Profits were lifted by an exceptional gain of HKDollars 79.2m on property
sales. Earnings per share rose 14 per cent to 52.6 cents from 46.1 cents,
and shareholders are to receive an interim dividend of 10.5 cents, up 10.5
per cent from last year's 9.5 cents a share.
Mr Peter Woo, group chairman, said the profit rise was solid when viewed
against the unfavourable property and retail environments, and the fact the
company has been in a building mode.
On the retail side, luxury department store group Lane Crawford saw profits
slump 47 per cent to HKDollars 52.7m from HKDollars 99.2m over the six-month
period.
About 66 per cent of the interim profits came from group associate The Wharf
(Holdings), Wheelock's 44 per cent-owned associate whose interests include
property, infrastructure and hotels.

<TEXT>
Sega Enterprises, the Japanese video game manufacturer and creator of Sonic
the Hedgehog, cited continuing strength of the yen as the reason for
shifting production of hardware for its next-generation video-game to
south-east Asia, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The company said it would move the manufacturing base of its 32-bit game
machines to Taiwan and other countries in the region next year. The products
are currently being manufactured in Japan by a subsidiary of Hitachi, the
Japanese electronics concern, on behalf of Sega.
Sega officials said it was difficult to make profits at a dollar/yen rate
below Y100. The company's foreign-exchange losses for sales in the US
totalled Y1.1bn (Dollars 10m)in the first half to September.
However, the company said it was seeing strong sales of its new 32-bit game
hardware and it was possible that manufacturing in the south-east Asian
region would be expanded.

stage

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wheelock and Company, the Hong Kong holding company for the late Sir YK
Pao's listed corporate empire, yesterday announced a 13 per cent rise in
interim net profits, to HKDollars 1.06bn (USDollars 137m) from HKDollars
940.3m at the halfway stage last year.
Profits were lifted by an exceptional gain of HKDollars 79.2m on property
sales. Earnings per share rose 14 per cent to 52.6 cents from 46.1 cents,
and shareholders are to receive an interim dividend of 10.5 cents, up 10.5
per cent from last year's 9.5 cents a share.
The government's measures to curb speculation in the property market, which
were implemented in June in an attempt to temper overheating home prices,
were partially blamed for the relatively modest growth.
Developers' inability to book profits from sales because of the lack of
government pre-sale consent means units not sold will be deferred to later
years.
However, Wheelock believes its landbank, accumulated at a low cost relative
to that prevailing in the secondary market, will ensure a good cushion of
profit in future years.
In addition to Hong Kong, Wheelock has about 25m sq ft of landbank in South
China.
Mr Peter Woo, group chairman, said the profit rise was solid when viewed
against the unfavourable property and retail environments, and the fact the
company has been in a building mode.
He said: 'In a tough cyclical economic environment we see an opportunity to
build, since the group's debt position is low. The group will continue the
process of value building, recognising that expansion during the start-up
years often results in marginally lower profits.'
On the retail side, luxury department store group Lane Crawford saw profits
slump 47 per cent to HKDollars 52.7m from HKDollars 99.2m over the six-month
period.
This was attributed to significant start-up costs of new stores in Hong Kong
and Singapore, general weakness and over-supply in these two markets. and a
wet summer in Hong Kong.
Poor conditions in the retail market notwithstanding, there are plans to
build Lane Crawford's franchise.
About 66 per cent of the interim profits came from group associate The Wharf
(Holdings), Wheelock's 44 per cent-owned associate whose interests include
property, infrastructure and hotels.

FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: Cautious welcome for BTR Nylex
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MELBOURNE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Investors and analysts yesterday gave a cautious welcome to news that BTR
Nylex, the Australian-listed arm of the UK's BTR group, was back on the
acquisition trail with the ADollars 800m (USDollars 620m) purchase of
Formica Corp, the New Jersey-based laminates manufacturer which has been
undergone a series of leveraged buy-outs and refinancings in recent years.
By yesterday's close, BTR Nylex shares had gained 4 cents to ADollars 2.47,
while in London BTR rose  1/2 p to 290p in active trading of 10m shares.
The US deal comes in the wake of concerns that BTR Nylex had lost direction,
and a sharply weaker share price following the release of disappointing
interim results in September. Earlier this month, in an effort to address
these problems, the company announced that it was calling in an outsider, Mr
Philip Aiken, as managing director, part of whose job would be to identify
acquisition opportunities.
Yesterday, in Melbourne, the company acknowledged that the Formica
transaction, which was already in the pipeline before Mr Aiken's
appointment, could double the gearing ratio - perhaps to 30-35 per cent. But
it did not see this as a limitation on further deals.
The Formica consideration of ADollars 800m will comprise the assumption of
the US group's debts, put at ADollars 440m at end-September, with the
balance payable in cash. The principal sellers, who have all agreed to
accept the terms, are Dillon Read, the US investment bank, with a 51 per
cent interest; Masco Corp, with 32 per cent; and Formica's management, with
7 per cent.
Formica is the number two force in the US decorative laminates market, with
total sales in 1993 of ADollars 580m. More than half the sales are in the
US, with the UK, France and Spain accounting for a further 30 per cent.
About 11 per cent of revenue comes from Asia.
Pre-interest operating profits last year were ADollars 45m, but finance
charges of ADollars 62m left an after-tax loss of ADollars 5m. Mr Jackson
said Formica had been paying an overall rate of about 14 per cent on its
debt burden, but a recent refinancing had cut this significantly. BTR Nylex
did not expect any dilution of earnings in year one as a result of the deal.
BTR maintains the US interests should tailor neatly with the
Australian-based Laminex business, and that its own knowledge of the Asian
markets should help it to boost Formica's sales there. According to Mr
Jackson, Laminex's pre-interest margins are around 18-20 per cent, more than
double Formica's.
The two BTR laminates businesses will have sales of ADollars 850m annually,
making this division the biggest decorative surfaces manufacturer worldwide.

India will hand over three oil and gas fields to a joint venture between
Reliance Industries and Enron of the US, according to local press reports,
Reuter reports from New Delhi.
An oil production deal is due to be signed tomorrow by the government, the
state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), which currently owns the
fields, and the Reliance-Enron consortium.
Petroleum ministry officials were not immediately available for comment.
The three oilfields, Mukta, Panna and Tapti, off India's west coast, would
be tapped by Reliance and Enron for oil and natural gas. The deal is a part
of India's privatisation programme. The reports gave no details on either
the cost of the deal or the amount of recoverable oil and gas in the fields.
The decision to sign the deal would follow months of debate over concessions
that could be made to the private consortium by the Indian government. The
consortium already owns a 60 per cent stake in the Mukta and Panna
oilfields.

Leading members of the Unison international insurance broking network have
announced an exchange of board directorships among European and US partner
companies, writes Ralph Atkins in London.
Mr John Gussenhoven, Unison president, said the exchanges could be a prelude
to increasing cross-shareholdings between members, all privately-owned
insurance brokers. Unison's members include US group Johnson &amp; Higgins,
Jauch &amp; Hubener of Germany, Gras Savoye of France and Gil y Carvajal of
Spain.
Unison has a network of some 250 offices in about 60 countries and acts, in
effect, as an international network for members. Mr Gussenhoven said each
company valued their independence but expanding cross-shareholdings could
allow members to participate in each other's results.
Johnson &amp; Higgins announced it has appointed three new directors: Mr
Christian Dahms, partner of Jauch &amp; Hubener; Mr Patrick Lucas, chairman of
Gras Savoye; and Mr Santiago Gil de Biedma, chairman of Gil y Garvajal.
Similarly, Jauch &amp; Hubener announced it would add three new members to the
appropriate board, including Mr Gussenhoven, director of Johnson &amp; Higgins.

FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: Tata Tea gets a taste for
expansion - India's biggest plantation group is seeking acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Tata Tea, India's biggest plantation group, made known its target of
eventually doubling tea output from its present level of 58m kg, it was
clear that it would be on the acquisition trail.
It is one of several which has looked at Tetley, the tea business put up for
sale by Allied Domecq, the UK spirits group.
Analysts believe Allied might be asking about Pounds 375m (Dollars 585m) for
Tetley, which generates operating profits of about Pounds 24m on annual
turnover of about Pounds 350m.
Tata and Tetley already operate one joint venture, an export-oriented
tea-bag manufacturing unit in Cochin. Tata Tetley tea bags are selling well
in western Asia and Poland, where a production unit is likely to be set up.
Tata is the only Indian tea company to move from a production-led to a
market-led producer of tea and set up a base in the US to market instant
tea.
Breaking away from a long tradition of selling tea in bulk, Tata Tea, which
owns 52 tea estates, has pioneered in India the marketing of tea with added
value, such as tea bags, packet tea and tea in polybags.
Tata Tea stands out in establishing several consumer brands, in competition
with the long-established players in the Indian market such as Brooke Bond
and Lipton.
Having consolidated its position in the value-added market, the management
has turned to acquiring new estates. Recently it bought Borjan tea estate,
spread over 872 hectares in Assam. It believes it can raise productivity at
Borjan to more than 2,000 kg a hectare from the present 1,390 kg.
The company is hopeful that its negotiations with several tea estate owners
will yield positive results. Except for Darjeeling where the best tea in the
world is grown, Tata Tea owns gardens in all tea-growing centres in India.
The strategy will be to buy gardens and then bring them up to the Tata Tea
standards.
'Tata Tea is financially very strong to bid for a number of tea estates
simultaneously. It has reserves of nearly Dollars 70m and it has a
debt-to-equity ratio of 0.61,' said an analyst with a leading merchant bank.
Tata Tea, which two years ago took over Consolidated Coffee, is now
acquiring a majority stake in Asian Coffee, the instant coffee manufacturer.
Tata Tea has a joint venture in Sri Lanka which manages several tea estates
in the island. It will bid for some tea estates in Sri Lanka when there is
privatisation.

<TEXT>
Borland International, the troubled US computer software company, expects a
'substantial' operating loss for its third fiscal quarter, with revenues
falling sharply from the previous quarter.
The group said it was planning a restructuring in the first quarter of 1995.
Analysts said Borland was expected to lay off about one-third of its 1,700
employees next year.
Borland also said its chief operating officer, Mr Keith Maib, planned to
resign.
Yesterday, the share price fell Dollars  7/8 to close at Dollars 6 5/8 .
Since the beginning of this week the stock has fallen 19 per cent.
'We must re-engineer and re-size the company in a manner that enables us to
operate profitably and allows us to meet the changing needs of our
customers, especially as they move to client-server,' said Mr Philippe Kahn,
chairman and chief executive.
Borland has been hurt by price-cutting and delayed products. The company had
pinned its hopes on a new version of its database program, dBASE for
Windows, which was introduced this summer after lengthy delays. But analysts
said sales had been disappointing.
Borland reported net income of Dollars 350,000, or 1 cent a share, in the
second quarter, down from Dollars 2.8m, or 11 cents, a year earlier.

A former deputy chairman of Banco Espanol de Credito Banesto (Banesto) is
suing the US bank JP Morgan, which was the Spanish banking group's financial
adviser when the Bank of Spain dismissed the Banesto board a year ago.
A claim filed against JP Morgan by Mr Ricardo Gomez-Acebo, a member of
Banesto's board for 23 years up to the end of 1993, alleges that the US bank
breached its fiduciary duties to Banesto by giving negligent advice.
Mr Gomez-Acebo's suit alleges that Morgan, as Banesto's adviser, withheld
information from the board after the completion, in the summer of 1993, of
the first two tranches of a three-part equity raising programme.
Morgan began to advise the Spanish bank early last year, and it became a
Banesto investor in the spring and summer of 1993 when it led international
equity issues that raised nearly Dollars 700m for the bank.
JP Morgan said yesterday that the suit had been filed several months ago,
and there had been no significant changes since then. The bank described the
action as 'frivolous' and said all allegations in it were groundless.
Banesto was the first target of the Dollars 1.1bn Corsair fund, a portfolio
set up by Morgan to invest in undervalued banks. Corsair took a Dollars 175m
stake in Banesto to hold nearly 8 per cent of equity and become its largest
shareholder.
Included in documentary evidence is a 15-page letter from Morgan's chairman
Sir Dennis Weatherstone to the US Congress committee on Banking, Finance and
Urban Affairs last February, concerning Morgan's relationship with Banesto.
Sir Dennis wrote that after due diligence of Banesto in the autumn of 1993,
Morgan learnt of 'certain problems related to troubled equity investments .
. . and asset quality'. This led to the postponment of a Dollars 400m debt
issue.
The statement of claim filed by Mr Gomez-Acebo says that this information
was not made available to Banesto's board when it met during that period.
Mr Gomez-Acebo's lawyer said that Morgan Espana, Morgan's Spanish arm, had
said the statement had not followed procedural rules because the only party
which could bring a suit against it would be Banesto.
Separately, Mr Mario Conde, Banesto's former chairman, was being questioned
yesterday for the fourth successive day by a Madrid high court judge on
charges of defrauding Banesto's shareholders.
Last week the judge, who is investigating a criminal fraud accusation
brought in November against Mr Conde and former Banesto executives by the
court's public prosecutor, indicted and committed to prison Mr Arturo
Romani, a former board member.

Groupe Axa, the French insurance group, said its Cie Financiere de Paris
unit was selling Banque d'Orsay to Westdeutsche Landesbank for about FFr450m
(Dollars 83m), agencies report.
Axa said the divestiture, which must be approved by French banking
authorities, was in line with its policy of selling off non-core assets.
Banque d'Orsay was formed in 1990 from the merger of Deltabanque and MR
Finance, a unit of the Meeschaert Rousselle brokerage. It specialises in
arbitrage in the equity and bond markets and manages investment portfolios
totalling nearly FFr10bn. It reported a net profit of FFr60.5m in 1993.

FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: ABN Amro takes over Polish bank

ABN Amro, the Dutch bank, is to pay Dollars 10m for Interbank, a small,
ailing Polish bank, and to inject Dollars 30m of capital over the next few
years.
The National Bank of Poland, the Polish central bank, took control of
Interbank in October 1993 after losses had eroded its capital base.
ABN Amro will in effect be rebuilding the bank from scratch by providing
initial capital and promising support.
In return, it will acquire a 98 per cent stake in the bank, which is to be
renamed ABN Amro (Polska).
The remaining 2 per cent was owned by small shareholders who declined to
sell or who could not be traced, ABN Amro said.
Interbank is based in Warsaw and has a branch office in Wyszkow.
It had assets of about 242bn zlotys (Dollars 11m) and a workforce of 85 in
mid-1994.
The Polish bank is active in corporate and retail markets. ABN Amro said it
had faced competition from other international banks for Interbank.
The Polish central bank had talked to Deutsche Bank of Germany about a
takeover.

FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: Ciba to acquire RPR's consumer
medicines arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the US-based drugs arm of Rhone-Poulenc, the French
chemicals company, is to sell its north American consumer medicines
operations to Ciba of Switzerland.
The deal, worth up to Dollars 500m over seven years, includes the sale of
Maalox, a 45-year-old brand that has lost market share in recent years and
is no longer the best-selling antacid in the US.
RPR blamed the decline of Maalox for its decision to sell. The company was
only 16th in the US non-prescription over-the-counter (OTC) market and 'did
not have the necessary critical mass'. It had tried to forge alliances with
other companies without success.
Mr Roland Jeannet, head of Ciba's OTC division, said the acquisition would
add about 20 per cent to the sales of Ciba's OTC division worldwide, which
stand at about SFr1bn (Dollars 752m).
It would almost double US sales, putting the company into the top 10 there,
said Ciba.
RPR said its OTC business in the US and Canada was expected to have 1994
sales of Dollars 154m, with Maalox contributing Dollars 100m.
The agreement calls for an initial payment by Ciba of Dollars 189m for
assets and intellectual property rights for seven years. Ciba also pays
Dollars 24m a year for seven years, at the end of which it has the option to
buy the intellectual property outright for Dollars 143m.
The net present value of the transaction is Dollars 407m, assuming the
option is exercised. Ciba also has first refusal on RPR prescription
products eligible for sale as consumer medicines in North America.
RPR said sales by its North American OTC brands represented less than 4 per
cent of total sales. The company keeps its European OTC business, including
the right to sell Maalox outside north America.
Maalox in Europe had most of its sales through hospitals and pharmacies,
rather than supermarkets as in the US, presenting it with fewer marketing
problems than in the highly competitive US market.
Ciba said the acquisition would not have a significant effect on gearing or
earnings per share. The deal is the largest by Ciba in OTC. The most recent
was the Dollars 140m acquisition of UK company Fisons' consumer medicines
business in North America in 1992.

FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: Tally-ho sounds for elusive
German breed - Insider dealers are hard to track down - but the hunt is on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The hunt is about to start in earnest for insider traders in Germany, a
breed known to exist in abundance but almost impossible to track down. Their
elusive nature has been aided by a lack of sanctions and a network of cosy
contacts between companies, banks, analysts and journalists.
Until now, that is. Since August, insider trading has been punishable with a
maximum prison sentence of five years and heavy fines. Profits of insiders
caught after the act will have to be handed over to the state. The
criminalisation of insider trading is part of a set of legal reforms aimed
at making Germany's securities markets more efficient and attractive to
investors at home and abroad.
From the start of 1995, the scrutiny of insider dealings will be led by a
new regulatory body in Frankfurt. Headed by Mr Georg Wittich, a former
finance ministry official who dealt with international stock market matters,
the Federal Supervisory Office for Securities Trading will operate with an
annual budget of DM12m (Dollars 7.60m) and an eventual staff of 97 people.
As well as monitoring share transactions, it will ensure that companies
publicise as quickly as possible any information that could affect their
share prices.
Failure to comply with such 'ad hoc publicity' requirements could lead to
fines of up to DM3m. Also, shareholdings of 5 per cent in listed companies
will have to be notified (as will stakes at thresholds of 10, 25, 50 and 75
per cent). The previous minimum was 25 per cent; fines of up to DM500,000
will apply if the new rules are ignored.
As Mr Wittich is aware, it is one thing to pinpoint insider traders, but
quite another to convict them. 'We will pursue this task energetically,' he
says.
Under the previous self-regulatory system, proof was hard to obtain. The
system was made tougher after the government and banks became concerned
about the damage to Germany's financial image of the previous laxity.
European Union guidelines on insider dealings also had to be implemented.
In Mr Wittich's view, the knowledge that tough legal penalties now exist
will be as important as the actual punishments. 'I am convinced that the
existence of an authority with the necessary investigative powers will prove
a deterrent to insider dealings.' That may be so, but an early conviction or
two may be needed to show the new body has teeth.
It will have the power to demand confidential information on possible
insider dealings from banks, companies and other sources. This can be passed
on to authorities abroad.
'At last, Germany has the full ability to co-operate according to
international standards,' says Mr Wittich. 'You can't pursue insider trading
on a purely national basis any more.'
Using special computer programs, dealings at Germany's eight stock exchanges
 -Frankfurt, the world's fourth biggest, accounts for more than 70 per cent
of business - will be monitored for any unusual price or volume movements.
If such evidence appears, the new organisation will try to run insider
culprits to ground.
Insider trading has long been a tricky subject in Germany, with flurries of
excitement when scandals erupt but rarely any action.
The lack of punitive sanctions has hampered any clamp-down on insider
information.
Last year, Mr Franz Steinkuhler resigned as head of the IG Metall trade
union after he had bought shares worth DM1m in Mercedes AG Holding, a
Daimler-Benz holding company, just before Daimler announced a share swap
with MAH and the latter's shares rose sharply.
Since Mr Steinkuhler was on Daimler's supervisory board, his position became
untenable once the news of his dealings emerged. He denied insider trading
but stepped down from the Daimler board.
Eight years previously, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange found that Mr Klaus
Kuhn, then head of the AEG supervisory board, had bought shares in the
company while takeover talks were continuing with Daimler. He sold the stock
at a DM16,000 profit, which he later repaid.
Such affairs hardly helped Frankfurt's reputation. 'The fact that insider
trading was not liable to prosecution met with scepticism,' said
Landeszentralbank in Hessen, the regional central bank for the state of
Hesse in which Frankfurt is located. 'This was one of the reasons why
foreign investors favoured the London financial market, even for their
D-Mark transactions in domestic securities. Greater confidence in the
supervisory system will strengthen the competitiveness of Frankfurt as an
international financial centre.'
The ad hoc publicity and disclosure rules will also give investors more
information. Under the old rules, companies could accumulate large stakes
(as Krupp did with Hoesch steel, before buying it in 1991) without the
target company knowing. This will no longer be possible. Nor will the German
practice of 'fireside chats', at which selected journalists are fed titbits
of news.
For smaller companies, complying with the ad hoc rules could be a nightmare.
'They may not know what the capital market wants,' said an investor
relations official at one big German industrial concern. It is Mr Wittich's
job to see they find out quickly, as well as to root out investors who abuse
insider information.

FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: Independent News takes 25% stake
in Irish Press
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MCMANUS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Independent Newspapers, the Irish publishing and media company, has taken a
24.9 per cent stake in the Irish Press, Ireland's second largest newspaper
group, in what is seen as a defensive move.
Mr Conrad Black's Telegraph Group is also understood to have been interested
in taking a stake in the ailing company, which is losing IPounds 300,000
(Pounds 295,000) a month.
Independent, headed by Mr Tony O'Reilly, is anxious to prevent a takeover of
the Irish Press by non-Irish interests which could introduce low-cost
production and threaten sales of Independent's titles, which dominate the
Irish daily, weekly and provincial markets.
Although the Irish Press said it was looking for additional investors,
Independent is expected to have a say on who they will be.
Mr Richard Bruton, Irish minister for enterprise and employment, has
requested details of the investment in order to decide if it has to be
approved under Irish monopolies legislation. The stake is just under the 25
per cent level above which it would automatically need government approval.
Independent has paid IPounds 1.13m for 24.9 per cent of the two operating
companies in the group, Irish Press Newspapers and Irish Press Publications.
Also, it has provided a secured loan of IPounds 2m for working capital which
has assured the imm-ediate survival of the papers.
The investment was not made in the holding company, Irish Press, as it is
currently involved in legal proceedings with a previous investor in the
Irish Press, Ingersoll Irish Publications, owned by Mr Ralph Ingersoll, a US
businessman.

FT  23 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Travelling by Clubb class - The future for
CTR without Robert Montague
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ian Clubb, the new chief executive of Central Transport Rental Group, was
yesterday plotting the company's strategy without the man he once described
as crucial to the future of the business.
Mr Clubb took over the position at the indebted trailer rental company,
formerly known as Tiphook, on Wednesday prior to Mr Robert Montague, the
former incumbent, being declared bankrupt at Oxford county court yesterday.
Mr Clubb will also continue as non-executive chairman and with his other
directorships at TLG, Expro and First Choice.
Mr Montague, who founded Tiphook 16 years ago, building it into one of the
largest container groups in Europe, has personal debts said to be in excess
of Pounds 35m.
'There is no doubt that the loss of Robert Montague is a blow,' said Mr
Clubb yesterday. 'He added value. He is someone who really understands the
trailer rental business. But life goes on.
'We have been aware of the possibility of Robert's bankruptcy for some time
and have been putting into place contingency plans.'
These have included a rationalisation programme at the group's headquarters,
involving hefty staff cuts and relocating out of palatial Whitehall offices
into more sombre surroundings in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire.
It has also meant devolving more responsibilities to the regional managers.
'We have an excellent team out there, and I am convinced that we can take
the business forward from here,' Mr Clubb said.
CTR recently reported sharply reduced losses of Pounds 7.2m for the
half-year, although debts stood at Pounds 502m against shareholders funds of
just Pounds 26.3m.
Industry opinion is divided over the group's long-term future. 'Robert
Montague's departure is the best thing that could have happened for CTR,'
said Mr Michael Williams, chief executive of Dawsongroup, which specialises
in trailer rental. 'He has done a lot of damage to the company and had an
adverse effect on the industry. He was too busy fighting fires to get on
with the day-to-day things.'
Mr Jim Cleary, a former director of TIP, Tiphook's main rival in the
European container market, said: 'What Robert Montague achieved was
tremendous. This is a people business and he was very good at it. CTR will
need a new chief executive who can build relationships with its major
customers and motivate the sales force.'
As important, he stressed, was the need for capital expenditure, a view
echoed by industry analysts.
'CTR needs either a massive restructuring, or a big backer,' said one.
'Otherwise it will not be able to update its fleet and compete.'
Another suggested that CTR's best hope lay with a friendly takeover as
happened with GE's capture of TIP.
'There may be a future for CTR, but it will need considerable investment,
and shareholders will not be the source of it,' he said, a reference to the
group's long-suffering investors who have seen the shares drop from nearly
600p three years ago to just 33p yesterday.
Mr Clubb agreed that a restructuring was inevitable, possibly some time next
year, with a debt-for-equity swap considered the most likely solution.
Mr Montague's future is less assured. Although bankruptcy disqualifies him
as a director, CTR had planned to employ him as a consultant. 'I very much
wanted to keep him on in some capacity but the legislation in this area made
it too difficult,' said Mr Clubb.
A friend yesterday described Mr Montague as 'deeply distressed' at being
made bankrupt. His creditor banks were last night discussing the appointment
of a receiver to his estate, which includes an Pounds 8m mansion in
Oxfordshire and a Pounds 7m yacht.
He is thought to have run up the bulk of his debts - possibly as much as
Pounds 20m - by borrowing money against his shareholdings in Tiphook in
order to take up his rights in the three issues the group made in the second
half of the 1980s.
His lifestyle reflected his borrowings and included sports cars, a private
jet, a country estate and cattle breeding, which earned him a reputation as
an icon of the entrepreneurial 1980s.
Mr Montague's popularity with investors soured in the 1990s as Tiphook's
fortunes began to wane and he attracted considerable criticism for the hefty
salary increases - he earned Pounds 1.3m last year - and options benefits.
'Robert Montague's legacy is to leave behind a business that is the market
leader in Europe,' Mr Clubb said yesterday. Both Mr Montague and CTR
investors may feel they have paid a high price for that position.

FT  23 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Royal Bank's life arm shows 60% income rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of guaranteed equity plans and bonds helped Royal Scottish Assurance,
the life insurance subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland, to increase its new
premium income by more than 60 per cent in the year to September 30.
Mr Ian Kerr, head of marketing, said that the increase was also because of
significant growth in the sales force from slightly more than 200 to almost
300 over the year.
Royal Scottish's new annual premiums were broadly flat at Pounds 17.6m
(Pounds 17.1m), but new single premiums rose by 70 per cent to Pounds 249.5m
(Pounds 146.4m). Funds under management grew by 56 per cent from Pounds
272.3m to Pounds 424m.
Mr Kerr said the company planned a further, smaller increase in the sales
force next year, but other factors might have a depressing effect on the
market in gen-eral.
The introduction of the new regime requiring sales agents to volunteer more
information about the policies they sell and the cost of selling them is
thought by many in the industry to have a negative effect on sales volumes.
Mr Kerr also said that if interest rates rose next year, as expected, some
traditional bank and building society customers would be discouraged from
switching to investment products because they were dissatisfied with low
savings rates.

FT  23 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Greenwich wins tender for Czech gold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greenwich Resources, the metals and minerals exploration group, yesterday
announced it had won the tender for the award of the Rozmital Exploration
Area in the Czech Republic, writes Peter Franklin.
The area includes the Hora gold deposit, which is reported to have a
near-surface resource of more than 800,000 ounces.
Greenwich also announced it was to raise Pounds 3.9m net of expenses through
a placing and open offer. Of the new funds, Pounds 1.8m will be raised by
way of a placing of 13.5m shares and Pounds 2.1m through an open offer of
14.7m shares, both at 15p. The shares dipped  1/2 p to 15 3/4 p yesterday.
The open offer, which is not being underwritten, is on a 1-for-6 basis.
Qualifying shareholders may make additional applications in respect of the
open offer.
Mr Colin Phipps, chairman, said a large part of the proceeds would be
applied to maintaining the group's 49 per cent interest in the Sappes gold
exploration joint venture in Greece.
The nearby Pefka Concession, in which Greenwich has a 100 per cent interest,
will also be evaluated, along with the Hora gold deposit.
Greenwich also announced it had ended the year to September 30 with a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 185,000, against a profit of Pounds 106,000.
Operating income fell to Pounds 109,000 (Pounds 374,000) and administrative
expenses, after capitalisation of overheads of Pounds 149,000 (Pounds
145,000) rose slightly to Pounds 323,000 (Pounds 285,000).
Losses per share were 0.2p (0.1p earnings).

FT  23 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hall warns of Pounds 4.2m provisions for
Stadco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hall Engineering (Holdings), the automotive engineering, steel products and
stockholding group, announced a larger than expected restructuring of Stadco
Automation, its automotive pressings and production systems business, which
will require provisions of Pounds 4.2m.
Hall's shares fell 13p to 150p and analysts said they expected pre-tax
profits for the year to be reduced from an estimated Pounds 5m to about
Pounds 800,000. However, the company said it hoped to maintain the final
dividend at 3.02p, which will be paid from reserves.
The move comes less than two months since Mr John Sword took over as
managing director.
Mr Alastair Smith, finance director, said Stadco had suffered from a lack of
new orders because of strong competition and a slowdown of car sales in
Europe. He said the restructuring would involve 125 redundancies, or half
the division's workforce, along with a write-down of certain assets, mainly
plant and equipment.
The estimated cash cost of the restructuring is Pounds 3.1m, including the
cost of redundancies, pension top-ups and provisions on current contracts
with Audi which have suffered delays.
The group issued a profit warning in May in anticipation of restructuring
costs of about Pounds 500,000 at Stadco and because of competitive pressure
across all its divisions. Interim pre-tax profits were later reported down
from Pounds 3.75m to Pounds 2.01m.

FT  23 DEC 94 / UK Company News: British Assets revamp approved - Trust's
relationship with fund manager questioned at EGM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in British Assets Trust yesterday approved a capital
reorganisation following an occasionally acrimonious meeting which raised
questions about the trust's relationship with Ivory &amp; Sime, its fund
manager.
The debate about the restructuring has focused attention on broader
questions about the corporate governance of investment trusts and the
accountability of their directors to shareholders.
The trust's directors are not directly employed by Ivory &amp; Sime, in
accordance with corporate governance guidelines issued by the Association of
Investment Trust Companies. However, most of the directors also serve on
several other Ivory &amp; Sime trusts from which they earn income.
British Assets's restructuring is required because poor performance by Ivory
&amp; Sime has meant it has not earned sufficient income from investments to
cover its annual dividend increases, causing it to eat into reserves.
To preserve dividend levels for the majority of its shareholders, the plan
requires 16 per cent of shareholders to forgo dividends for seven years. In
exchange, they will receive 61.2m additional shares to be issued in seven
years' time.
These will increase in value if the net asset value of the trust rises over
the next seven years.
The proposals required approval of 75 per cent of voting shareholders.
At an extraordinary meeting in Edinburgh, 78 per cent of the shares -
roughly 160m - were voted in favour of the proposal, with 22 per cent -
about 45m - against.
Mr Roger Inglis, British Assets chairman who will retire next June, said
afterwards that he was delighted with the outcome. 'The size of the vote in
favour speaks for itself,' he said.
However, as it had earlier indicated, Sun Life, the trust's largest
institutional shareholder, voted its 11.06 per cent stake against the
proposal and insisted that all proxy votes also be counted.
Sun Life had argued that the effect of issuing the new shares would be to
dilute the net asset value for all shareholders, and that it was not clear
that earnings would be sufficient seven years from now to continue to pay
inflation-linked dividends as it has promised.
Also, some analysts had questioned the Pounds 2.7m cost of the
restructuring, which includes a payment of Pounds 610,000 to the big
institutional shareholders who have agreed to forgo a portion of their
dividends for seven years.
It had privately argued that the trust's poor performance in recent years
raised questions about whether Ivory &amp; Sime ought to be reappointed as fund
manager.
In a prepared statement, Sun Life said yesterday: 'It is now up to the
directors of British Assets, together with Ivory &amp; Sime, to deliver improved
performance.'
Sun Life could sell its stake in the market or it could use its muscle as
the leading shareholder to force the directors to drop Ivory &amp; Sime if the
trust's performance does not show suitable improvement.
Two small shareholders at the meeting attacked the mechanism used by the
trust to secure the backing of institutions, and charged that the directors
of the trust were not sufficiently independent of Ivory &amp; Sime.
Mr Martin Harper, a retired merchant banker, called the scheme
'unsatisfactory, unsound, costly and harmful'. It provided only a
'temporary, cosmetic palliative to the problem' of the trust.
He had earlier attacked British Assets' promised Pounds 1.3m investment in
Ivory &amp; Sime Trustlink, a marketing company for investment trusts.
'Trustlink may well be of benefit to the managers. But it is a basic
principle of marketing that you do not push a product until it performs
satisfactorily. This large investment cannot be appropriate to the company
at this time.'

FT  23 DEC 94 / UK Company News: London Securities disposes of its largest
asset for Pounds 5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Securities, the property company which is being wound down under a
voluntary arrangement with its creditors, has sold its largest asset, Mill
Ride Golf Club in Berkshire, for Pounds 5m.
The proceeds will be paid to Barclays, which financed the development and is
owed Pounds 15m, including rolled-up interest.
The disposal came on the eve of today's extraordinary meeting at which
shareholders will be asked to approve a deal which will pass control to Mr
Michael Ashcroft, the Bermuda-based businessman who runs the ADT car
auctions and security group, and Mr Jacques Gaston Murray.
Under the terms of the deal London will buy a Pounds 17.6m property
portfolio from Nu-Swift, the former fire extinguisher company taken private
by Mr Ashcroft and Mr Murray earlier this year.
Nu-Swift already owns 29 per cent of London. If the deal is approved, it
will reduce its holding to 75 per cent through a placing in order to
maintain the company's Stock Exchange listing.
The deal will effectively give Mr Ashcroft and Mr Murray control of a quoted
property company.

FT  23 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Debt talks need patience and trust - The
mechanics of complex reconstructions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in Queens Moat Houses may not believe it, but they are
relatively lucky to get proposals to resolve their company's financial
crisis so quickly.
Compare the 20 months it took Barclays to guide all but one of Queens Moat's
74 lenders towards agreement, with the three years which shareholders in
Heron Group have had to wait.
The long delays are symptomatic of the increasingly complex nature of debt
reconstructions over the last decade.
'The corporate crises of the early 1970s were easier to deal with because
there were fewer companies with multi-bank facilities,' said Mr Eddie
Theobald, who led the Queens Moat reconstruction talks for Barclays Bank.
Multi-bank facilities are a legacy of London's rapid expansion as a
financial centre in the 1980s. With more foreign banks anxious to establish
a presence in London, companies had no difficulty in raising loans from a
variety of sources.
This makes untangling the financial web when companies fall into difficulty
a Herculean task. 'If you are dealing with a multi-bank company and the area
of lending covers a number of jurisdictions, you know you have a problem in
putting a reconstruction together,' said Mr Theobald.
Debt reconstructions are generally sparked by a cash crisis which puts the
company in danger of insolvency.
The first step in a reconstruction involving a number of lenders is to
appoint a lead bank. In general, the bank with the largest exposure, if it
is a UK clearing bank, will be asked to adopt the lead position. In Queens
Moat's case, this role was given to Barclays.
'The first thing the lead bank must do is maintain stability,' said Mr
Theobald. 'It has to keep things even so we do not witness an undignified
scramble, with the banks cutting their lines and running for cover.'
The lead bank will then call for an all-bank meeting, preferably within
seven days, at which the lenders will be briefed on the financial situation
and offered proposals for solving the difficulties.
This is where the reconstruction is likely to hit its first wall. If the
lead bank cannot offer proposals in time for the all-bank meeting, it will
have to ask the lenders to agree to a debt standstill.
Some lenders will be reluctant to do so until they have all the financial
information. Generally, however, even if some refuse to sign, the principles
of a standstill are adhered to until the information is available.
Nevertheless, this increases uncertainty in a situation where all the
lenders must trust each other not to pull the plug.
The first all-bank meeting is also important as it appoints a steering
committee to represent all the different types of lenders, both large and
small. In Queens Moat's case these included lessors, debenture stockholders
and straightforward term lenders.
The meeting will also begin to establish the blueprint for the ranking of
creditors, their strengths and weaknesses in relation to each other.
The so-called dividend model is maintained throughout the debt negotiations
and will determine the returns to various lenders when a reconstruction
package is devised. One of the most difficult tasks facing the steering
committee will be to get each bank to agree its relative position.
This is where the Queens Moat reconstruction could yet fall down.
One creditor is unhappy with its position in the dividend model and is
vigorously resisting the package unveiled last week. . This is understood to
be Trust Company of the West, the California-based debt trader. TCW bought
its share of the Queens Moat debt in the secondary market.
The emergence of the debt trading industry, largely out of the US, is the
greatest threat to what bankers in the UK call the London Approach. The
heart of the London Approach is described by Mr Theobald as 'exercising
forebearance'.
When a company faces insolvency the lenders decide to support it until
enough information is gathered to determine whether it is viable.
Debt traders, however, have different agendas. Their interest is in making a
quick turn on the investment, and the potential loss will be much less than
that facing the original lenders.
'There is only one or two cases where debt traders bought debt from an
unhappy bank and increased the stability,' says Mr Theobald. 'Our experience
is that it leads to additional complexity.'
If the debt traders are particularly unco-operative, the company could fail.
So far, Queens Moat's bankers and advisers are confident the outstanding
lender will eventually come on board.
However, the temptation for TCW to look out for its own interests could yet
bring the company down.

FT  23 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Northern Electric hits out at bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Electric is strongly urging shareholders to ignore this week's
Pounds 1.25bn takeover bid by Trafalgar House, writes David Lascelles.
In a letter to shareholders, the board of the Newcastle-based company says
the bid is 'wholly inadequate and unacceptable'. It fundamentally
undervalues Northern Electric, and offers no advantages to shareholders. The
letter continues: 'Northern Electric has demonstrated its ability to deliver
value to shareholders and customers, and has a clear strategy to continue to
do so as an independent company.'
Some analysts believed the letter was meant to imply that Northern would
entertain a higher bid, though many regulatory obstacles would have to be
removed before a true contest could develop.

BM Group has received acceptances in respect of 94.3 per cent of the 9 per
cent preference share capital of Blackwood Hodge, the company it acquired in
1990.
However, for the much smaller 5.75 per cent and 4.7 per cent classes of
preference share, it received acceptances for only 14.1 per cent and 11 per
cent respectively.
Three of the Blackwood Hodge preference shareholders have filed a petition
at the High Court alleging that their interests have not been properly
represented.
Mr Alun Hicks, BM's finance director, said: 'We are delighted at this very
satisfactory response from the large majority of preference shareholders.'
BM now intends to put Blackwood Hodge into liquidation.
Mr Stephen Cockburn, one of the petitioners, said: 'This is a wholehearted
endorse-ment from two of the classes of preference shareholders for the
stance we have taken.'

</HEADLINE>

   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster Bank is to sell its 78.2 per cent stake in F van
Lanschot Bankiers, the Dutch bank, to a group of banks and institutional
investors in the Netherlands.
The sale, which ends a 21-year relationship between the two banks, follows a
difference of opinion about future strategy in private banking.
No financial details were disclosed but NatWest said it was 'more than
satisfied' with the price. Van Lanschot, a medium-sized bank focusing on
wealthy private clients, institutional investors and family-owned companies,
had net assets of about Fl 340m (Pounds 113m) in December 1993.
Mr Bert Heemskerk, management board chairman of van Lanschot, said the bank
did not want to concentrate exclusively on private banking, as NatWest
wished.
The Dutch bank believed there was important synergy between its commercial
banking activities for family-owned companies and its private banking aimed
at wealthy clients in the Benelux countries.
A stake of 21.2 per cent will be sold on December 30 to Friesland Bank, a
regional co-operative bank which wants to develop commercial links with van
Lanschot. The rest is being sold in smaller parcels to ABN Amro Bank, ING
Group and AVCB, the insurance group, as well as to the National Investment
Bank and Nederlandse Participatie Maatschappij, a venture capital group.
The sale is a forerunner to a flotation over the next three to five years,
when 20 to 25 per cent of the shares are to be sold on the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange.

Shares in WMGO Group fell 3 1/2 p to 14p yesterday after the business
communications company issued a profits warning following the unexpected
cancellation of three big projects.
Pre-tax profits for the year to February 28 were revised down from Pounds
2.2m to Pounds 1.35m by Beeson Gregory, company broker.
WMGO was transformed from the MMI sponsorship and financial marketing group
earlier this year and reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 254,000 for the
half year to August 31.
Two contracts were lost by Park Avenue, the exhibitions promotions business,
and the third was cancelled over a fee dispute between its advertising
agency and Sun Life.

FT  23 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Canadian Pizza shares fall on warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Canadian Pizza, which floated in November last year, fell 6p to
83p yesterday after the pizza and pizza crust maker issued its second
profits warning of the year.
Forecast pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 have been reduced from
Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 2.3m.
The shares are now worth only 42 per cent of their flotation price of 200p.
Mr Reg Bolton, finance director, said that revenues were lower than expected
because of delays with four of the nine new UK retail customers it had won
this year.
The company also faces a charge of Pounds 133,000 due to the early
retirement of Mr Harry Kent, the 67-year-old deputy chairman and co-founder.
In April the company issued a profits warning after its biggest client, J
Sainsbury, which accounted for 25 per cent of turnover, withdrew a large
part of its business.
Mr Bolton said: 'We have not been able to fill the gap left by the lost
Sainsbury business in the timescale we had hoped.'
The company also said that it had abandoned plans to build a new
manufacturing base in continental Europe. All exports of pizza crusts will
continue to be sourced from the Salford factory.

FT  23 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Thorn EMI sells Defence Group to
Thomson-CSF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thorn EMI, the music and rentals company, is to sell Defence Group, part of
its electronics division, to Thomson-CSF of France for Pounds 15m cash.
The sale, which is subject to regulatory and other approvals, marks an
important step towards Thorn's goal of ending losses in its electronics
division.
The disposal is expected to be completed at the end of February and to
result in a pre-tax exceptional gain of Pounds 3m. Thorn's shares closed up
6p at Pounds 10.19.
Defence Group's turnover is about Pounds 80m - roughly 40 per cent of Thorn
EMI Electronics - and its main activities are manufacturing fuses for
missiles and shells and electro-optics. It has about 970 employees.
Thomson-CSF is expected to continue to operate the missile and ordnance
fusing business from the existing plant at Blyth Road, Hayes, Middlesex
under the name of Thomson Thorn Missile Electronics.
The electro-optical business will become part of Pilkington Optronics, a
joint venture between Thomson-CSF and Pilkington and will operate under the
Pilkington Thorn Optronics banner.
Thorn's defence sensor activities, which are based at Crawley, West Sussex,
and Wells, Somerset, and the microwave devices business at Hayes are not
included in the agreement with Thomson.
Last month, Thorn EMI announced that it was in talks with Racal Electronics
over the sale of the defence sensors business which employs 1,140 people and
had turnover of about Pounds 75m last year.
Thorn has also sold its electronic security business. The sale of both the
defence and sensors businesses will end losses in the electronics division
which totalled Pounds 13.5m last year.
Once the sales are completed, Thorn will only be left with its transaction
ticketing operation outside its declared core areas. Preliminary talks on
the ticketing business are also taking place.
Sir Colin Southgate, chairman, has said that the company will concentrate on
its music production, music retailing and rental operations.

FT  23 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Brokers face a 'normal trading day'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bad year in the London equity market, which has seen disappointing levels
of business, is ending on a sour note as brokers are having to put in a full
day's appearance on what is traditionally the quietest day of the year.
The Stock Exchange has decreed that dealing will, as usual, continue until
4.30pm today even though the derivatives market, which provides much of the
liquidity, will close shortly after noon.
The Stock Exchange said: 'It is not Christmas Eve so it is just a normal
trading day.' But market hands said the half-day closure had applied
historically even when it was not Christmas Eve.
And because of the quote-driven nature of the London market, big integrated
securities houses will have have to maintain staffing levels of about 60 per
cent to ensure that the quality of the price quotation is maintained.
Some blame US investment houses, which stay open to tie in with the opening
of Wall Street. One leading US house commented: 'Normally we have to provide
coverage anyway, so we don't care whether the market is open or not.'
The Stock Exchange shifted some of the blame on to the Old Lady of
Threadneedle Street. 'All the banks will be open today, so the board decided
there was no justification to close early. We are following the Bank of
England.'

FT  23 DEC 94 / Stanhope totters as bank talks collapse: The rise and fall
of the trend-setting UK property developer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The suspension of Stanhope Properties' shares yesterday, after the breakdown
of negotiations with banks owed Pounds 140m, leaves the UK's most
influential developer of the last decade hanging by a thread.
The company's existing credit facilities ran out at 3.30pm yesterday after a
three-day extension granted on Monday by 16 banks led by Barclays.
A board meeting broke up without resolution late last night, although
executives and advisers were working into the night to stave off
receivership.
When Mr Stuart Lipton started Stanhope 11 years ago - from tiny offices in
Stanhope Gate, Mayfair - he was already a familiar figure on the property
scene. In 1976, Mr Lipton had founded Greycoat Estates, along with Mr
Geoffrey Wilson and Mr Ron Spinney. During the late 1970s and early 1980s,
Greycoat took part in some of London's most imaginative office developments.
These included Cutlers Gardens, built around old East India Company
warehouses on the fringe of the City of London, and Victoria Plaza
straddling Victoria Station. Mr Lipton left Greycoat abruptly in 1983. While
there were rumours of a rift with his partners, he said that he simply
wanted a change of scene.
Despite Stanhope's modest beginings - Mr Lipton's initial investment was
Pounds 100,000 - the company was soon involved in a string of ambitious
projects.
By the time of its flotation on the Unlisted Securities Market in 1987,
Stanhope had already helped develop the Stockley Park office park near
Heathrow Airport, one of the first of its kind in the UK. Work on the
Broadgate office development in the City was also under way, in partnership
with Mr Godfrey Bradman's Rosehaugh.
Stanhope's flotation prospectus detailed the first two completed phases of
Broadgate and plans for four additional phases. Eventually 14 phases were
built, providing 3.5m sq ft of offices.
With such an impressive development record, investors were more than ready
to back Mr Lipton. The tender price for Stanhope's shares was set at 250p,
well above the 180p minimum price, giving the company a market value of
Pounds 277m.
The following year, Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian developer responsible for
Canary Wharf and controlled by the Reichmann family, paid Pounds 137m for a
29.9 per cent interest in the company.
Mr Lipton's reputation was then at its height. Stanhope and Rosehaugh were
chosen to redevelop 125 acres around King's Cross station, which would have
been Europe's largest inner-city development, and the Royal Docks area of
docklands.
Stanhope also backed a controversial scheme to redevelop the South Bank arts
complex. While none of these grand designs came to fruition, the company's
shares peaked at 321p in mid-1988, valuing Stanhope at Pounds 500m. Its
decline since then can be blamed on the worst property recession in living
memory and the way in which Stanhope was financed.
Under the influence of Mr Bradman, who had imported non-recourse financing
techniques from the US, the Broadgate development was funded almost entirely
with bank debt.
All the equity in the project was retained by Stanhope and Rosehaugh, each
of which held a 50 per cent stake in Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments, later
re-named Broadgate Properties.
When property prices were rising, this high leverage worked in favour of
Stanhope shareholders. The company's net assets soared from Pounds 42m in
1987 to Pounds 457m in 1990. As prices fell, though, the value of Broadgate
to its shareholders was quickly eroded. Once the bank debt supporting
Broadgate is deducted, Stanhope's half share in Broadgate Properties is now
valued at only Pounds 116m.
It would be easy to conclude that Mr Lipton's talent for development does
not extend to finance. Yet Stanhope was not alone in under-estimating the
severity of the downturn and over-gearing at the wrong point in the property
cycle.
Mr Bradman was regarded as one of the best financiers in the property
sector, yet Rosehaugh went into receivership two years ago. Greycoat - still
headed by Mr Geoffrey Wilson until last year - survived by a whisker.
'To say Stuart does not care about profit margins and efficiency is
laughable,' said one former development partner. 'He revolutionised
construction techniques in this country and made buildings far quicker and
cheaper to erect. The truth is that no-one saw the recession coming.'
There is no doubting Mr Lipton's legacy as a developer. The Broadgate
complex, in particular, is widely regarded as the City of London's most
successful development since the second world war. Broadgate moved the
City's centre of gravity decisively to the north - an achievement all the
more remarkable for the fact that the area was regarded as a backwater by
most City occupiers.
It is doubtful whether Broadgate would have been possible without Mr
Lipton's passionate concern for the quality of the buildings. His reputation
for being extraordinarily demanding to work for and, on occasions, brutally
direct may arise from this uncompromising approach.
One close adviser commented: 'Stuart pays an enormous amount of attention to
his buildings. They are like a part of his family. It is an approach which
leads to great buildings but some people find that degree of commitment
difficult to deal with.'
Whatever the future for Stanhope, few doubt that Mr Lipton could build many
more fine buildings. He has just passed his 52nd birthday and, despite
yesterday's events, his reputation as a developer remains intact.
Others of his generation have proved that episodes of financial distress are
not a permanent barrier in an industry accustomed to boom and bust. After a
brief spell in Germany after Rosehaugh's collapse, Mr Bradman is operating
from offices close to Regent's Park.
While shareholders who backed Stanhope may feel less than sympathetic,
history has proved that building fine buildings is a risky business from
which few escaped unscathed.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Thyssen to spend DM4bn on expansion of telecom interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Thyssen, the German steel-based conglomerate, plans to spend up to DM4bn
(Pounds 1.60bn) expanding its fledgling telecommunications operations into
an integrated service business turning over DM10bn a year by the end of the
decade.
Existing interests in mobile communications, terrestrial network and
satellite-based services will be bundled together in a stand-alone
joint-stock company called Thyssen Telecom, said Mr Dieter Vogel, deputy
group chairman.
Medium-term plans include a stock market flotation, and collaboration with a
strategic partner might also be considered, he said. However, Thyssen would
retain a majority stake.
The company would specialise in services rather than networks and other
hardware, Mr Vogel said, as 80 per cent of the added value in telecoms came
from services rather than networks.
Current operations were already turning over DM2bn, Mr Vogel said. This
would be augmented soon by income from an added-value data transmission
service and a personal computer-based multimedia 'users' club' offering
shopping and information services.
The new company, to be chaired by Mr Vogel, would also be applying for a
licence in 1996/97 to offer the public speech telephone services from early
1998, the time set by the government for the ending of the state network
monopoly.
Although relatively late in joining the line of companies unveiling firm
investment plans and sales targets for the telecoms market, Thyssen has been
building on its base of an extensive in-house voice transmission service.
It and the Veba group each have 28.4 per cent stake in the E-Plus German
mobile phone business with most of the balance held by BellSouth of the US,
Britain's Vodafone, and France's Caisse de Depots.

FT  23 DEC 94 / BAT wins go-ahead for US tobacco deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries, the UK tobacco and financial services group, has won US
government approval for its planned Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) takeover of
American Tobacco, the fifth-biggest US cigarette maker.
The US Federal Trade Commission withdrew its opposition to the deal in
exchange for undertakings that BAT would divest some of American Tobacco's
minor brands in the next 12 months. The acquisition will take place
immediately.
The US brands that BAT will acquire are Lucky Strike, Pall Mall and Carlton
in the premium sector and Misty, Private Stock and some private-label brands
in the lower-priced segment. BAT will also get the rights to sell Silk Cut
outside Europe.
BAT said the acquisition would result in a restructuring charge of about
Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m after-tax for the year just ending, but expected
to derive efficiency savings of Dollars 200m a year by combining American
Tobacco's headquarters and sales organisations with those of Brown &amp;
Williamson, the US tobacco company it already owns.
BAT agreed to buy American Tobacco from American Brands, its US parent, in
April, but the FTC sought to block the bid on competition grounds. During a
federal court hearing, the FTC argued that the US tobacco industry was
already highly concentrated with only six participants.
BAT countered that a merger of Brown &amp; Williamson with its 11 per cent
market share and American Tobacco with its 7 per cent share would increase
the combined company's ability to compete with Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds
Tobacco, the two industry giants, which together account for 70 per cent of
US cigarette sales.
The eight-day court hearing ended last week, with the judge reserving his
decision. FTC lawyers later acknowledged that the case had gone badly for
them: but BAT was under pressure to do a deal with the FTC because of the
risk that the commission would appeal against an unfavourable decision,
further delaying the deal.
Yesterday's out-of-court settlement requires BAT to divest Montclair, a
low-priced brand, and certain minor discount brands within 12 months. The
acquiring company will also be given the option of buying Tareyton, a
premium brand.
As a result of the divestitures, BAT's share of the US cigarette market will
rise to 17 per cent instead of the 18 per cent originally envisaged.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Dow buys 80% stake in east German chemical complex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dow Chemical of the US has bought a majority stake in one of east Germany's
former state-owned chemical complexes, giving it a strategic position in
Germany and eastern Europe. The price for the enterprise, which has been
making losses, was not disclosed.
The US company will take an 80 per cent stake in Buna/Bohlen and invest
DM1bn (Pounds 400m) while the Treuhand privatisation agency will retain the
remaining 20 per cent and provide DM3bn in investment. The Treuhand had
sought buyers for one of the most polluted and inefficient industrial
complexes under the former communist regime.
Dow will buy the steam cracker facilities at Sachsische Olefinwerke in
Bohlen, the electrochemical units and derivative operations at nearby Buna,
and the intermediate chemical operations at Leuna.
All are based in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, and are one of the last
remaining large industrial enterprises under the Treuhand, which winds up
operations at the end of 1994.
The investments will be spread over four years. Dow will make an initial
payment, followed by additional sums as turnover increases. It will also
guarantee 2,700 jobs. Buna employed more than 18,000 workers before 1990.
All sectors of this petrochemical complex are losing money. Buna is expected
to lose DM300m this year but its turnover is expected to have increased by
two-thirds from the 1993 figure of DM600m because of the upswing in the
chemical industry. Bohlen will lose about DM160m for this year.
Privatisation of the east German chemical sector was resisted by the west
German industry, which maintained that Dow's investment in Buna would
increase capacity levels. The Treuhand, backed by the finance ministry, has
picked up the DM3.5bn debts of the whole Buna/Bohlen/Leuna chemical complex
and has invested a further DM5.5bn.
Treuhand energy experts yesterday confirmed that Bohlen would have the
annual capacity to produce 450,000 tonnes of ethylene. The ethylene will be
converted at Buna into polyethylene and propylene, the basis for synthetic
materials used, among other things for the car industry. Buna will have a
200,000 tonnes annual capacity for propylene.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Zeneca to buy US healthcare company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zeneca, the UK bioscience company, is to spend up to Dollars 485m (Pounds
310m) buying a US healthcare company.
The deal is easily Zeneca's biggest since demerger from Imperial Chemical
Industries in 1993.
The target is Salick Healthcare, a Los Angeles-based operator of specialist
cancer centres. Zeneca will take a 50 per cent stake by the end of the first
quarter of 1995 and is likely to buy the rest of the company within four
years.
The deal commits Zeneca to a broadly based attack, through both drugs and
hospital management, on the Dollars 1,000bn-a-year US healthcare industry
along the lines pioneered by rivals such as Merck and SmithKline Beecham.
Others, such as Glaxo Holdings, remain committed to concentrating on drug
development.
Mr David Barnes, Zeneca's chief executive, said the deal was part of a
response to the rapidly changing US healthcare market. Zeneca has already
started Stuart Disease Management Services, which specialises in managing
patients with heart diseases in the US.
The deal will dilute earnings by less than 2 per cent in the first year and
be 'earnings accretive' in the third year, Mr Barnes said. Gearing, debt as
a percentage of net assets, will increase from 'less than 10 per cent at the
end of 1994 to low double digits', Mr Barnes said.
For the year to August 31 1994, Salick Health Care had net assets of Dollars
102m and made pre-tax profits of Dollars 16.9m on sales of Dollars 131.5m.
For each two shares held, Salick shareholders would receive:
Dollars 37.75 in cash from Zeneca, worth Dollars 195m
One share of a new special common stock to be issued.
A payment to those shareholders from Salick of Dollars 1.25 per share, worth
Dollars 5m.
Holders of the special common stock have an option to sell to Zeneca after 2
1/2 years at Dollars 42 a share. Zeneca has the right to buy the outstanding
shares at any time over the next four years. For the first 2 1/2 years,
Zeneca would pay the market price subject to a floor of Dollars 42 and a
ceiling of Dollars 50. After that the price is the market price.
With options also to be bought, the total amount payable if the shares are
bought at Dollars 50 would be Dollars 485m, said Zeneca. Salick shares rose
Dollars 5.75 to Dollars 35.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Moscow purges rumoured as Grozny battle rages on
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Evidence of upheavals within the Russian government emerged yesterday as
reports of resignations and a purge of top military commanders were denied
by the defence ministry and fierce fighting continued around the Chechen
capital of Grozny.
President Boris Yeltsin announced he would shortly present a solution to the
Chechen crisis 'based mainly on using political methods'. But on the ground
the Russian military continued its 12-day-old assault, switching for the
first time to daylight bombing raids on selected targets in Grozny.
Correspondents remaining in the city reported at least 20 people killed,
including a US photographer, as bombs and rockets hit blocks of flats and,
in one case, a crowd clearing away the debris of a previous bomb.
In Chechnya, a defiant President Dzhokar Dudayev issued a televised appeal
for a holy war to fight 'the satanic methods of Russia'.
A report that six generals had been dismissed - including the entire top
leadership of the north Caucasus army group and Colonel General Georgy
Kondratyev, the deputy defence minister, for 'indecision and inaction' - was
carried by the RIA-Novosti, the state-owned press service.
Citing 'an informed source', the report said General Pavel Grachev, the
defence minister, was taking personal command of the operation. The report
was later denied by the ministry of defence.
Separately, Mr Sergei Yushenkov, the chairman of the Duma (lower house)
defence committee, announced to reporters that General Eduard Vorobyev,
deputy commander of Russian land forces, had resigned because he disagreed
with the conduct of the war.
Unofficial sources said Gen Vorobyev had been asked to take over command of
the Chechnya operation, and chose to step down instead.
The same sources last night said the likely explanation for the flurry of
announcements and denials was that the generals' letters of resignation had
not been officially registered or accepted.
Curiously, the resignation announcements did not include that of General
Ivan Babichev, the divisional commander in Chechnya who has refused to move
his division closer to Grozny.
Mr Yeltsin wrote a letter to the Duma, suggesting that he would seek a
political solution to the Chechen crisis in the form of an appeal to Russian
citizens. Several influential figures, including Mr Sergei Kovalev, his
representative on human rights, urged Mr Yeltsin to hold out the possibility
of negotiations once more.

FT  23 DEC 94 / EU settles fishing row with Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union settled its long-festering fisheries row over Spain's
access to the waters around Ireland last night, ending the threat of
Madrid's vetoing the entry of Austria, Finland and Sweden into the EU in
January.
The UK was isolated after the German presidency of the EU took the unusual
step of putting the dispute to a vote, producing 11 member states in favour
and an abstention by Britain.
The dispute, which dates from Spanish accession in 1986, could have led to a
full-blown European crisis had it blocked expansion of the Union next month.
In spite of its isolation, the UK government may have reason to be satisfied
with the result. British obstruction tactics have limited inroads by Spain's
large fishing fleet.
Mr William Waldegrave, Britain's agriculture and fisheries minister, said:
'We have kept the Spanish out of the Irish Sea and the Bristol Channel,'
which he described as taking 'two thirds of the pot' while playing poker
with a poor hand.
Spain's fleet appears to have won less access to the waters west of the UK
and Ireland than it was guaranteed in its accession treaty or than it was
promised this year during entry negotiations for new EU members.
Spanish officials said they were satisfied with the compromise. Madrid had
made the entry of new EU members conditional on Spain's being given equal
treatment under the Union's Common Fisheries Policy, which was not scheduled
to come into operation until 2002.
However, Article 158b of Spain's accession treaty gave rights for 70 Spanish
fishing vessels to fish inside the so-called Irish Box - the waters
surrounding Ireland - by the end of next year.
Under last night's compromise, only 40 Spanish vessels gain access to the
Irish Box, and two of the three areas at dispute with the British will be
off limits.
Spain's trawlers will, however, be able to fish in the so-called Celtic Sea
 -the area between south-east Ireland and south-west England - which was
always Spain's main objective.
'Mission accomplished,' said Mr Luis Atienza, Spain's agriculture and
fisheries minister, at the end of the talks. His officials pointed out that
Spain had never traditionally fished in the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel
anyway.
Mr Waldegrave said: 'I would have liked to have (kept) the Celtic Sea as
well.' However, he insisted, the main point was that 'there will be no
Spanish free-for-all'.
But Eurosceptic Conservative MPs - nine of whom refused to support the
government's fishing policy in the House this month - attacked the deal.
Mr Tony Marlow MP, a leading Eurosceptic, said the government had submitted
to 'blackmail' from Spain and Portugal.
British fishermen reacted with fury to the deal and threatened clashes with
Spanish vessels in sensitive coastal waters around the British Isles.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Payments balance back in surplus: City surprised as current
account moves Pounds 846m into black after seven years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's current-account balance of payments moved into surplus for the
first time for 7 1/2 years in the third quarter of this year.
The Central Statistical Office confounded City expectations of a modest
deficit by announcing yesterday a seasonally adjusted surplus of Pounds 846m
in the three months to the end of September compared with a revised deficit
of Pounds 1.1bn in the second quarter and a deficit of Pounds 2.09bn in the
third quarter of 1993.
The current account has been the bugbear of governments since the second
world war. News of the first surplus since the first quarter of 1987 was
seized upon by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, as 'crowning an excellent
year for the British economy'. Speaking on a day in which a MORI poll for
The Times showed support for the government at a new low, Mr Clarke said
Britain was 'selling more goods and services abroad than at any time'.
Other official figures showed a slight easing in the rate of economic growth
to 4.1 per cent in the year to the third quarter from an estimate last month
of 4.2 per cent, calming fears that interest rates might have to rise early
in the new year. At the same time, reports of a late surge in Christmas
shopping held out the hope that retail sales in December would grow compared
with last year.
The improvement in the current account reflected a sharp jump in Britain's
'invisible' surplus from trade in services such as banking and insurance and
investments abroad.
That jumped, according to yesterday's provisional figures, to Pounds 2.37bn
in the third quarter from Pounds 1.32bn in the previous three months, and
more than offset the deficit on visible trade, which fell to Pounds 1.52bn
from Pounds 2.43bn.
However, part of the higher invisible surplus reflected potentially erratic
movements in the volatile investment income account. In particular, it was
boosted by British banks reporting Pounds 700m of net earnings from interest
rate swaps in the third quarter, which may be subject to later revision.
The investment income surplus increased between the second and third
quarters to Pounds 2.73bn from Pounds 2.18bn. An improved performance by
financial services, including insurance, helped to raise the surplus from
trade in services to Pounds 1.39bn from Pounds 822m. Offsetting those
components, the deficit on transfer payments increased to Pounds 1.75bn from
Pounds 1.68bn.
According to Ms Alison Wright, the director-general of British Invisibles, a
trade body, the UK's private sector invisibles balance recorded a record
surplus of Pounds 13.4bn in the first three quarters of this year compared
with Pounds 10.8bn for the whole of last year.

FT  23 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Northern Electric
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Electric's first letter to shareholders gives little sense of a
defensive strategy against the Trafalgar House bid. But Northern can afford
to take its time.
A government special share and a restriction on ownership of more than 15
per cent of a regional electricity company should both be removed by early
April. But referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission could frustrate
the battle.
The current share price, 4 per cent below the cash offer, suggests
expectations of a referral. This might be impossible to pursue on commercial
grounds, but the justification of 'public interest' provides sufficient
breadth to squeeze through a referral. A desire to establish a framework
before a likely glut of other bids, together with pressure from politicians,
could mean a decision which is clearly against the interests of shareholders
in both companies.
Even so, the bid would be unlikely to be blocked. And referral could give
Northern six months to sharpen its defences, before predators returned. As
one regional electricity company is very much like another, the defence will
have to bring out the attractions of the sector as a whole. However Northern
will also have to emphasise its individual allure, and this will probably be
done through hard cash. It has next to no debt, and could well afford to
reward loyal shareholders with special dividends. Referral talk has
depressed Northern's share price, but it still remains in play. Shareholders
should be patient.

FT  23 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1993 and 1994, the Bundesbank cut short-term interest rates despite
ballooning growth in M3 money supply. Next year, the opposite could happen:
M3 growth will slow or be altogether reversed, but interest rates are likely
to go up. Special factors can be blamed for the fluctuations but, as a
practical matter, monetary policy has become divorced from money supply
targeting. Yesterday's decision to leave unchanged the M3 target for next
year does not the hold the key to what happens to German short-term interest
rates next year. More important is the outlook for medium-term economic
growth and inflation. On the inflation front, the picture for the next six
months is encouraging: by spring, headline inflation is set to fall to close
to the Bundesbank's 2 per cent target. Thereafter, inflation is set to rise
as the economic recovery gathers pace.
Third-quarter gross domestic product figures showed a marked acceleration in
growth, suggesting that domestic demand is taking over from exports as the
engine of recovery. With German GDP growth forecast to come in at 3.1 per
cent this year and next, industry is working at close to full capacity,
adding to price pressures. The wage round is another risk, and it is
distinctly possible that the government will resort to further inflationary
tax increases in 1996 in an attempt to plug its spending shortfall. As
always, monetary policy is a balancing act, and the Bundesbank will be
mindful of the impact of January's solidarity surcharge on consumer
confidence. But the likelihood is that the Bundesbank will launch a
pre-emptive strike to nip future inflation in the bud.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A current account surplus for the UK is exciting by its very novelty. The
last time the country posted a quarterly surplus was in 1987. The
chancellor's enthusiasm yesterday was therefore wholly understandable.
Whether the surplus remains sustainable is another matter. Exports, which
have put in a powerful performance so far this year, should not be the
problem. Take the automotive industry: year-on-year quarterly car production
was up 11.5 per cent. While output for the home market was up only 2.6 per
cent, production for export rose 27 per cent. Such achievements should be
sustained in this and other sectors as the continental economies continue to
recover.
The difficulties lie on the imports side. Domestic consumption may have
stayed depressed over the past 12 months, but that is no guarantee it will
remain so next year. The quarter-on-quarter increase in the personal saving
ratio from 9.6 per cent to 10.5 per cent indicates the possibility of a
recovery in consumer confidence. So, too, does the improvement in employment
prospects. Imports could also be boosted by an increase in industrial
investment. Corporate liquidity is high, but investment this year has been
hesitant. With many industries running close to capacity, the corporate
sector will have to start installing machinery often imported from overseas.
The chancellor can afford to crow over his quarterly surplus, but not too
loudly. It could deteriorate into deficit all too quickly.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Emerging markets enthusiasts have been faced with the prospect of a
nightmare before Christmas. The Mexican devaluation set off a whiff of panic
that spread from central America all the way to Argentina.
With hindsight, the Mexican devaluation seems inevitable. The country funded
its huge current account deficit through capital from abroad, especially the
US. Foreign investors were content to provide funds as long as they ran no
currency risk - the peso was pegged to the US dollar - and Mexican interest
rates were double those in the US. But a combination of higher US rates and
Mexican political crises reversed the flow of funds. With the government's
limited foreign currency reserves quickly running out, the logical response
was a devaluation capable of correcting the deficit by cutting imports and
boosting exports.
The theory of devaluation was economically justified, but poorly executed.
The subsequent debacle threatens to scatter six years of stability to the
winds. Overseas investors have taken a bath. While the equity market may
have weathered yesterday better than expected, the peso's fall knocked
another 10 per cent off the value of foreign investors' portfolios. Future
prospects are not rosy. Corporate earnings in the final quarter will suffer
from increased financial charges on their dollar debt, while economic growth
could slow because of increased interest rates. Bargain hunters may return
once the currency has stabilised, but bruised investors may well conclude
Latin America remains as unreliable as ever.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Not such a safe haven: Why bond market investors have had a
more exciting year than they might have expected or wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bond markets are supposed to be the natural haven for investors who want a
secure income and minimal excitement. In 1994 they have been more like a
high-tech adventure playground in which the electronics have gone awry.
The collapse in bond prices around the world prompted by a quarter-point
increase in US interest rates in February has continued to reverberate,
leaving many governments with unsustainably high real borrowing costs.
How, with the benefit of hindsight, can these gyrations be explained? And
what do they tell us about the state of the financial system?
As with most seismic upheavals in capital markets, the starting point is
monetary policy. Throughout 1993, this was lax in the US as a result of the
Federal Reserve's continuing efforts to prop up the US banking system.
Looking back, it is clear that monetary policy remained loose for longer
than was necessary. By the end of last year, excess liquidity had spilled
over into foreign markets. A global bull market in bonds turned into a
bubble.
As the charts imply, US investors' foreign purchases of bonds and equities
reached an unprecedented peak in 1993. It is fashionable to attribute this
to US pension fund investors' new-found enthusiasm for international
diversification. Yet the subsequent plunge in the outflow of dollar funds
suggests that this was less important than two other, more speculative
forces.
The first was the response of US retail investors to disappearing inflation.
Just as unanticipated inflation in the 1970s penalised those who held
long-dated fixed-interest securities and forced them to save more to offset
the decline in the value of their real capital, unanticipated disinflation
in the 1990s penalised people who held short-term assets. It deprived them
of income as nominal interest rates fell.
US depositors, including many unsophisticated pensioners, deserted the
banking system in the 1990s for higher-yielding bond mutual funds (the US
equivalent of unit trusts) or for equity funds that appeared to hold out the
hope of capital growth. Yet as capital values rose and the yield on US
Treasuries fell, mutual funds, in turn, were forced to scour global markets
for higher income. They became panic buyers of high-yielding paper in the
more outlandish economies of Latin America and Asia.
That was the unleveraged part of the story, since mutual fund investors were
speculating chiefly with their own money. The second force behind the bubble
came from the commercial banking system, where the banks were using other
people's money to take a huge speculative position on bonds. They did so in
response to clear signals from the Fed chairman Mr Alan Greenspan.
Part of the Fed's strategy for restoring the profits and capital of a
banking system burdened by bad debts in property was to keep short-term
interest rates artificially low from early in the decade. The banks could
thus borrow cheaply from depositors to invest in higher-yielding longer-term
government IOUs.
As long as everyone knew that the market was being rigged in the banks'
favour to avoid a credit crunch, the mismatch in the maturity of assets and
liabilities was riskless. So the commercial banks entered 1994 with more
than Dollars 300bn of public sector debt on their books.
With the Fed providing a safety net, it was not surprising that small
amounts of capital should support larger and larger speculative positions on
bonds - leverage, in a word. What was surprising was that, when Mr Greenspan
indicated in January that the time had come to tighten policy, the momentum
was such that nobody in the markets responded.
Only after February 4, when people confronted a worldwide margin call as
banks demanded more collateral for their loans, did the financial community
wake up.
Why was the fall-out so severe? The extent of leverage in the system - which
multiplied the loss arising from a modest increase in interest rates -
provides one answer.
The misnamed hedge funds which borrowed vast sums to speculate in the market
were merely the tip of the iceberg. As we now know, everyone from the
treasury department at Procter &amp; Gamble to the officials at Orange County,
California, had taken to behaving like hedge fund managers: they were
punting, not hedging.
So, too, had the US investment banks. Their collapsing profits this year are
symptomatic of a wider shift in the culture of finance towards high-octane
trading on their own account.
The resulting increase in leveraged dealing activity helps explain the
volatility and extraordinary foreshortening of response times in the
markets. In effect, a bear market adjustment that might once have been
spread over years took place in a matter of weeks.
And as the tide of liquidity retreated, the conflicts of interest inherent
in the banks' new trading focus emerged. US industrialists discovered their
treasurers' 'hedging' activity consisted of buying complex derivative
products from Wall Street about which Wall Street knew more than the
treasurers.
Yet derivatives - swaps, forwards, options and the rest - have, like the
hedge funds, received a disproportionate amount of blame. Orange County's
Dollars 2bn losses had more to do with the use of 'repos' - sale and
repurchase agreements - than derivatives.
And one of the biggest new sources of volatility in the system,
collateralised mortgage obligations (CMOs), are not really derivatives at
all. Yet they have been responsible for a whiplash effect in bond markets
all across the world.
One of the problems of a US-style mortgage market, where fixed-rate
mortgages are packaged and turned into securities for investors, is that the
outstanding life of those mortgages changes with interest rates. If interest
rates rise, mortgage borrowers have an incentive to hold on to their
mortgages longer, since their interest burden is lower than at the new going
rate. If rates fall, they have an incentive to repay the mortgage sooner and
to take out a cheaper one.
Institutional investors that use CMOs to match fixed liabilities or to
speculate are thus obliged to hedge against potential changes in the life of
their mortgages. Immediately after the Fed tightened in February, the
duration of the mortgage component of the Lehman Brothers Bond Index,
covering Dollars 1,200bn of outstanding mortgage paper, rose from 3.47 years
to 4.35 years.
Analysts at JP Morgan calculated at the time that to offset the increase in
the duration of the portfolio, investors would have had to sell Dollars
140bn of 10-year Treasury bonds or nearly Dollars 250bn of five-year
Treasuries. Current estimates of such short positions range even higher.
These sums are huge, even by the standards of the bond markets. They explain
a great deal of this year's selling and hedging activity in bonds and
derivatives markets. They also offer a clue to why the futures markets'
implicit forecasts of interest rates often appear so much more bearish than
most commentators' assumptions. The sheer weight of money has probably been
defeating arbitrageurs who would normally iron out such anomalies, not least
because they have been the victims of margin calls from their own bankers.
The leverage in the system is still unwinding, as the US regional banks'
provisions against losses on bond portfolios underline. Yet the new
volatility of the bond markets is not exclusively explained by technical
factors. Distortions to the underlying pattern of global capital flows are
also to blame.
The natural flow of capital across the world is from Japan, with a current
account surplus in 1993 of Dollars 131bn, to the US, with a current account
deficit of Dollars 109bn. Yet as the accompanying charts demonstrate,
long-term capital flows run counter to the financial requirements of the two
economies. The US, despite the need to finance a large current account
deficit, has become a long-term capital exporter. The resulting leakage of
portfolio funds from the world's biggest debtor country weakened the dollar
against the yen.
Japanese investors, having lost billions on their US Treasury stocks in the
1980s, are no longer prepared to act as stabilising speculators to underpin
the price of dollar assets. This means more of the US balance of payments
financing burden has fallen on short-term bank finance and central bank
purchases for the official reserves - a recipe for unstable currency and
bond markets.
Instability is made worse by a new capital regime for Japanese life
companies, which imposes a heavy risk-weighting on foreign bonds relative to
domestic bonds. Higher yields outside Japan are an attractive match for the
life companies' fixed income obligations on policies. Yet the rules
encourage them to take only short-term speculative positions in foreign
markets.
A more fundamental explanation for the rise in bond yields this year has
simply been the increasing calls made on the global pool of capital as
economic recovery raised the demand for finance. According to Mr Michael
Hughes of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities, the real economy competed with
the capital markets for funds this year, and won.
In January there was an overwhelming consensus that, while the interest rate
cycle in the US was on the turn, European bond markets would provide a
further leg to the bull market since Europe was pulling only slowly out of
recession.
In the event Europe - along with the rest of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development area - saw a far greater upsurge in
manufacturing output in 1994 than the forecasters expected. The perception
of accelerating growth played as important a part in the movement of bond
prices as the Fed's decision to tighten policy.
If the rise in yields in the British index-linked gilt market is any guide,
this factor accounts for a little under 1 per cent of the rise in bond
yields since February. The remaining rise in yields over the year in the
accompanying table has much to do with increasing worries about credit risk.
There has been a flight from countries with a large outstanding stock of
debt and a history of devaluation. In the case of Canada and Italy, the
financial concerns are compounded respectively by the fear of separatism in
Quebec and the weakness of the Italian political structure.
The market's worries about first-world debt reflect a generalised decline in
public finances. In the 15 years to 1992, gross national saving as a
percentage of gross domestic product fell from 23.5 per cent to 19.4 per
cent in the OECD area. Over the same period net public debt rose from 21.2
per cent of GDP to 36.7 per cent, and is projected by the OECD secretariat
to rise to 43.9 per cent by 1995. These figures make no allowance for
rapidly growing unfunded pension liabilities.
Governments find it easy to default on their pension promises: Germany and
the UK already have, by downgrading the benefits in their state pension
systems. But will governments also default on their debts to investors,
either internally through inflation or externally through devaluation?
As long as real rates of interest exceed underlying real growth rates in the
more heavily indebted first-world countries, default is an issue that
becomes harder to ignore. Yet it is striking that governments are
increasingly using their regulatory powers to give themselves breathing
space in financing large structural budget deficits.
Apart from the new Japanese life assurance regime, minimum solvency
requirements for US pension funds include an inbuilt bias in favour of
bonds. There must also be some likelihood that the regulatory backlash in
the US Congress over Orange County and other scandals will push
institutional investors even further in this direction, notwithstanding the
current enthusiasm for balanced budget legislation.
In the UK, pension funds will shortly be encouraged by a new minimum
solvency regime to increase their bond holdings. Many are doing so already,
in response to the maturing of their liabilities. Across the European Union,
the decision to drop the recent pension fund directive liberalising capital
flows in the single market will perpetuate domestic constraints on overseas
investment and a bias in favour of government bonds.
While such regulatory market-rigging provides some protection against a
foreign bond-investors' strike, it usually does so at the price of raising
the borrowing country's cost of capital and increasing bond market
volatility.
In the banking system, meanwhile, the Bank for International Settlements'
capital regime accords a zero risk-weighting for government borrowers. This
encourages a distortion in favour of those countries that the bond markets
regard with most suspicion - and is a recipe, ultimately, for a repeat in
Europe of the Latin American debt crisis.
The government borrowers' best hope must be that the political climate will
permit fiscal adjustment on a sufficient scale to bring the bond markets
round. An important lesson of 1994 is that, if the bond markets buy the
story, the whiplash will prove quite as devastating on the way up as on the
way down.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK is enjoying a textbook-perfect, export-led recovery. It is
unfortunate for the government that the public is unpersuaded of its merits.
But that scepticism may also prove disastrous for the economy.
A close connection exists between the excellence of the recovery and the
sourness of the electorate. This is a recovery led by exports, not by
consumption: in constant prices exports of goods and services rose 10.2 per
cent in the year to the third quarter of 1994, while consumption rose only
2.2 per cent. It is a recovery led by manufacturing, not services: real
manufactured output increased 5 per cent in the year to the third quarter,
while services expanded 3.3 per cent. It is a recovery in which GDP has
grown far faster than personal disposable income: GDP in constant prices
expanded 4.1 per cent in the year to the third quarter of 1994, while real
disposable income rose a mere 1.5 per cent.
Neither the rate of growth nor its pattern was expected a year ago, but they
are explicable. One side of the story is the indebtedness of the personal
sector, the flat housing market and the sluggishness of borrowing. The other
side is the unplanned devaluation of September 1992, reinforced by the
unexpectedly rapid recovery of the European economy. Partly because the
depreciation occurred when inflation was low and the recovery had just
begun, partly because consumers were suffering from the after-effects of
their excesses of the late-1980s and partly because Messrs Lamont and Clarke
introduced increases in taxation amounting to 1.2 per cent of GDP in 1994-95
alone, this devaluation has worked - so far.
One result is the improved balance of payments. The current account surplus
of Pounds 0.8bn in the third quarter was the first since early 1987. Even
the visible deficit was only Pounds 1.5bn (about 1 per cent of GDP), as
against Pounds 2.4bn in the second quarter.
So the economy is doing well and, as in a mirror, the public is feeling bad.
But nothing could be better than such a recovery. Surges in exports promise
an output expansion with consumption following, sustainably, behind. Nothing
would be more disastrous than another rapid increase in consumption. That is
why the latest interest rate increase and the tax rises to come are what the
economy needs.
They are not, however, what the public - or the Tory party - wants. The
government has stumbled on the right mixture of a competitive exchange rate,
flexible markets, and fiscal and monetary prudence. It has promised Nirvana
before, been believed, and been wrong. Now it is not believed, but is right.
Another U-turn is all too likely, however, precisely because it is
mistrusted. If so, the sceptics would be proved right after all. It is a
funny old world.

Surely Kenneth Clarke deserves a well-earned Christmas rest? He has licked
Britain's balance of payments problem, conquered inflation and got the
economy growing at more than 4 per cent a year. Time to relax.
Not a bit of it. While the nation rests, Britain's chancellor of the
exchequer will be back at work on Wednesday, holding his regular monthly
monetary policy meeting with the governor of the Bank of England. Then he is
off for a fortnight's business trip to the Far East, where he will be in
Penang on New Year's eve. Not a bad place for a party, according to

Lazards' Ali Wambold is a fast mover. He popped up on the Tomkins board a
few weeks ago, but yesterday abruptly changed his mind about joining that of
Saatchi.
The volte face may have been prompted by the fact that he reassured Maurice
Saatchi that it would be wrong for the board to kick him out - and the rest
of the board took no notice.
In a letter to Saatchi on December 13, Wambold wrote: 'Directors of a public
company, in both the US and the UK, have a fiduciary duty to act in the best
interests of the company as a whole, not of any particular group of
shareholders . . . It is not possible for the board to delegate its
obligations to shareholders even if it risks being ultimately overruled in a
shareholder vote.'
SG Warburg disagreed, advising the board that because it almost certainly
would lose a shareholder vote on Saatchi's future, he would have to go - and
he did.

How humiliating. The World Trade Organisation invited photographers to turn

So earlier this week Peter Sutherland, the WTO's caretaker, tried a
different tactic. Journalists assembled at a convenient hour, Sutherland
took down the Gatt name plate outside the Geneva HQ and replaced it with the
WTO's. Champagne corks popped; the historic moment was snapped. Then a lowly
official took down the WTO plate and replaced it with the Gatt sign pro tem.
Not the best augury for the new dynamic organisation.

Just in case Warburgs' chief executive Lord Cairns has not yet received his

Not that Cairns need take exception to the decorous cover - the Angel
Musician by Rosso Fiorentino. But the enclosure: a blue stress ball with a
picture of a globe and the legend Morgan Stanley etched upon it - together
with the card's message, 'Season's Greetings and best wishes for a

FT  23 DEC 94 / Observer: Aladin's lamp in Grozny
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What was the chief of Jordan's military intelligence - Ahmad Aladin Arsala -
doing recently in Grozny, the Russian-besieged capital of Chechnya? To say
that he was having a cosy chat with Russif Shamsuddin - Chechnya's
Jordanian-born foreign minister - hardly clears up the mystery.
The waters are further muddied by news that one of Jordan's leading
parliamentarians has now begun enlisting volunteers to help the Chechnyan
resistance fight Russian troops.
For an insight, step back to the early 19th century, when the Ottomans set
up a military garrison in (what is now) Amman, employing conscripts from the
Caucasus. When Prince Abdullah, King Hussein's grandfather, became the first
ruler of the emirate of TransJordan in 1921, he won Circassian and Chechen
hearts and minds by giving important government posts to their nationals.
Today, Jordan's 80,000-strong Caucasian community remains fiercely loyal to
their adopted country; an elite group acts as the ceremonial bodyguard to
King Hussein.
But they also retain strong feelings for their Caucasian roots. Since the
Russian-Chechnya conflict erupted, many more than usual have taken advantage
of the resumption of flights to Moscow by the Royal Jordanian airline -
including a delegation of Circassian political figures from Jordan,
accompanied by Ahmad Aladin Arsala.
This plot is positively congealing; even Jimmy Carter may need more than a
couple of days to square the Circassian circle.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Mr Yeltsin's weakness
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia has got itself into a terrible and bloody tangle in its latest
attempt to hold itself together: the confrontation with the people of
Chechnya in the northern Caucasus. It is a battle from which no one is
likely to emerge the winner, and which could severely undermine the position
of President Boris Yeltsin back in Moscow.
Using columns of tanks against a warrior nation of mountain people can never
be sensible, as one might think the Russians would have learnt in
Afghanistan. President Yeltsin can have had only one good reason for
forgetting that lesson: the need to keep the Russian army quiet, and to
appease the increasingly vocal nationalist lobby in Moscow.
In the event, the use of regular soldiers and heavy armour in Chechnya in
the largest Russian military operation since the invasion of Afghanistan has
had the opposite effect. It has split the army down the middle, and
obviously alienated significant numbers of very senior officers. The morale
of the troops is rotten. They are no longer prepared to lay down their lives
for the empire. And Mr Yeltsin is looking more foolish, not more decisive.
He has failed to woo most conservatives, while horrifying most liberals.
This is not to say that the government of Chechnya has right on its side.
The so-called independent republic is recognised by the outside world as a
constituent part of Russia. Its declaration of independence had no legal
basis, and its government, under General Dzhokar Dudayev, is strongly
suspected of having links to organised crime. It is no myth that Chechen
gangs play a big part in Moscow's rising lawlessness.
Yet by throwing his tanks into the fray, Mr Yeltsin runs the risk of
alienating the entire 18m-strong Moslem population of Russia. He has united
most of the extraordinarily disparate peoples of the Caucasus against him,
bringing back ominous memories of the interminable wars fought by the Tsars
of old to force those same warring tribes into their empire.
The Russian leadership has not grasped that it is still in the midst of a
process of decolonisation, the unravelling of that empire. Mr Yeltsin
started that process, to overthrow Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, and now he cannot
stop it. So far the outside world has sought to ignore the problem. It
cannot continue to do so indefinitely. It is not up to the west to seek to
maintain the borders of today's Russian federation precisely where they are
 -nor, on the other hand, to encourage a continuing process of
disintegration. But it is in the western interest to have a stable Russia,
not chaos.
Mr Yeltsin must be urged to provide a constitutional framework to handle
those questions of decolonisation which are not going to go away. He should
pay attention to the lessons - good and bad - of the end of the British and
French empires. He needs an independent body of arbiters to settle disputes
 -perhaps an oversight body of republican leaders from all over the Russian
federation as proposed by the president of Ingushetia, Chechnya's neighbour.
Moscow is simply not trusted by its subjects, and the use of excessive
force, or the threat of such force, can only have aggravated that
perception. Mr Yeltsin is not proving his strength by using his tanks. He is
proving his weakness.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Force of destiny
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia won the general election in March,
many Italians believed he represented the best chance of resolving the
country's economic and political difficulties. That hope has crumbled into
dismay. Far from providing solutions, Mr Berlusconi has become one of the
chief problems. By announcing his resignation as prime minister yesterday,
but suggesting that he should stay on pending new elections, Mr Berlusconi
is compounding Italy's uncertainties.
Forza Italia's partners, the Northern League and the neo-fascists, shoulder
some of the responsibility, but most of the blame for his coalition's
failure falls on Mr Berlusconi. He has shown insufficient energy to tackle
Italy's debt and deficit crisis. He has become entangled in the corruption
investigations which brought down the previous political establishment. And
he has proved unable to put distance between himself and his media
interests, now linked still more closely to his own political future.
Earlier this month, Mr Berlusconi's ownership of three commercial TV
channels was judged unconstitutional. His chances of resolving this issue to
his own satisfaction may depend directly on his ability to remain in power.
The state broadcasting organisation can be added to the string of Berlusconi
supporters in the media. So he would have considerable scope to gather a
strong sympathy vote in a short and probably vitriolic campaign targeting,
in particular, the Northern League. Another election less than a year after
the previous one would, however, resolve next to nothing. If it was
conducted under the present unsatisfactory mix of proportional
representation and majority voting, neither the parliamentary line-up nor
the dilemma of how to form a cohesive government would be substantially
changed. Yet external circumstances, determined partly by the international
financial markets, would be even more trying than in March.
Italy's immediate political destiny depends on President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro, who can dissolve parliament, as Mr Berlusconi wants, or entrust
another leader with the prime ministership. Since the first option would
lead to a dead end, the right course would be to seek a broad-based
government drawing its legitimacy from the parties voted into parliament
last March, including some representatives of Forza Italia.
An interim government of an institutional character similar to that of Mr
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in 1993-94 would need a specific mandate geared to
restructuring social security financing, clearing up the muddle over
broadcasting control, and bringing in a new electoral law. This would be, at
best, a breathing space. But it would give Italy a glimmer of an opportunity
to tackle problems that Mr Berlusconi has done so much to highlight and so
little to resolve.

cut-back (2)

<TEXT>
Sir, Re your article, 'City thefts take the biscuit', it may surprise
everyone that lawyers are not the only firms that experience problems with
the dreaded chocolate biscuits. As surveyors we made sure that our clients
were well tanked-up with them and, if that also meant that the 'workers'
benefited by the odd Jaffa cake to improve their performance, so be it.
We took pride in our refreshments. We even provided cappuccinos and, at one
stage, hand-made chocolates from my sister's very own chocolate shop.
But the heydays of the 1980s gave way to the tightening of belts of the
1990s and, because our waistlines were drooping over our belts, drastic
action had to be taken. We decided to go environmentally friendly. Now we
offer fresh fruit and caffeine-free fruit-flavoured tea. It has transformed
our business. We now have no clients and only one part-time secretary
working for us and she brings in her own sandwiches and flask.

Sir, Your article, 'City thefts take the biscuit' (December 20) spells out
in detail the pounds (Pounds ) saved by solicitors in reducing the
consumption of biscuits. Surely of much greater importance would have been
to have noted the savings in pounds (lbs).

FT  23 DEC 94 / Economic Watch: W German factory prices up 1.4%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
West German producer prices rose 0.4 per cent in November from October and
were up 1.4 per cent compared with November 1993, the federal statistics
office reported. The November figures are higher than the consensus forecast
of a 0.1 per cent gain in the month and a 1.1 per cent year-on-year rate
predicted in a survey of analysts.
The year-on-year rise in French housing starts quickened in the three months
to the end of November compared to the year-on-year rise in the quarter to
end-October, according to figures from the Housing Ministry. Housing starts
from September to November were up 14.2 per cent on the same period a year
earlier, at 76,300 homes. The August to October period's rise had been 13.4
per cent, or 69,400 homes.
Norway's unemployment rate rose to 4.6 per cent in December compared with
4.4 per cent in November and 5.3 per cent for the same month last year,
according to the Labour Directorate.
Gross domestic product in the Czech Republic was up 2.1 per cent in the
first nine months of 1994 compared to the first nine months of 1993, in
constant prices.

FT  23 DEC 94 / In a state of resignation: Robert Graham asks what lies
ahead for Italy and Berlusconi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's first experiment of a media magnate in politics ended acrimoniously
yesterday, when Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi handed in the resignation
of Italy's 52nd postwar government.
Mr Berlusconi, the owner of the Fininvest business empire who decided to
become a politician in January, had been in office only 226 days. For those
enamoured of statistics, he was the 28th longest serving premier since 1946.
He was forced to resign to head off the defeat of his battered rightwing
coalition in parliament. Defeat became inevitable last weekend when Mr
Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League and one of his two
principal partners in government, decided to table a motion of no
confidence. Mr Bossi's defection, even though it split the League, left Mr
Berlusconi without a working majority in both houses of parliament.
The next step will be up to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. He has to decide
whether to sustain the life of the present legislature or to impose
elections on the country for the third time in four years. Every option
carries serious risks for the future political and economic stability of
Italy.
Perhaps the most destabilising would be a snap election with Mr Berlusconi
heading a caretaker administration. Another election would automatically
take a chunk out of the nation's life. Between dissolving parliament and
voting in a general election, 60 days must pass. It then takes up to two
months for the government to be formed, a confidence vote to be passed and
the necessary parliamentary commissions to be staffed.
Mr Berlusconi was asked to form a government on April 28, one month after
the general elections. His cabinet team was ready 13 days later and another
week passed before all the confidence votes in the two houses were
concluded.
A quick dissolution of parliament after Christmas risks leaving Italy with a
weak caretaker government for five months, and there is no clear picture of
who would constitute the next government: alliances are so fluid.
The League is splitting; Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia has no coherent
structure and even less ideology. Of the bigger groupings, only the former
communist Party of the Democratic Left on the left and the neo-fascist
MSI/National Alliance on the right have well-defined positions. Amid
shifting political allegiances, the country's mood is probably still centre
right.
But the outgoing government has had little time and even less will to tackle
a number of serious issues that will impinge on early elections. The most
important are electoral reform, the conflict of in-terest between Mr
Berlusconi's ownership of Fininvest and his position as a politician,
control of the media - especially television, the confrontation between the
executive and the judiciary over corruption investigations, and the pensions
reform needed to tackle Italy's budget deficit.
Going to the polls with the existing electoral system will encourage a
confused agglomeration of parties, rather than coherent coalitions with
common platforms. The electoral laws, approved in August 1993 as a result of
an earlier referendum, introduced a compromise of first-past-the-post voting
and proportional representation. All the parties agree that Italy should
drop proportional representation. But divisions remain, especially in the
Berlusconi camp, over whether to adopt a single round of voting or a second
run-off as in France.
On the conflict of interest, Mr Berlusconi has time and again been
confronted with problems arising from his ownership of Italy's second
largest private group, which is involved in a range of economic activities -
not least publishing and television. He is also under investigation for
alleged corruption while running Fininvest. A further reminder of these
problems came yesterday, when his younger brother and close busi-ness
associate, Paolo, was sentenced to 10 months in jail for bribery in
connection with refuse treatment contracts.
Mr Berlusconi has proclaimed his innocence, while telling colleagues he
believes he will be sent for trial by a vindictive Milan magistrature. His
own judicial position is unlikely to be clarified during an election
campaign.
Another worrying aspect of a snap election would be the outgoing
administration's control of the RAI television and Mr Berlusconi's dominance
of the commercial networks. The television screen will be the battle-ground
for the hearts and minds of the electorate; and the current opposition could
be denied equal opportunity.
There is also a financial dimension. The 1995 budget, approved this week, is
already out of date, and additional measures will be needed to find
L20,000bn or more in the first half of the year. This is bound to worry the
markets - as will the likely slippage in the June target for completing
reform of the costly state pensions system.
Against this background, President Scalfaro will want to see if a new
parliamentary majority might be feasible. This could be difficult, however,
with Mr Berlusconi and his allies, who represent close to half the deputies,
opposed to such an idea. Failing this, Mr Scalfaro will probably try to
appoint an interim 'techno-political' government, to ensure that Italy can
go to the polls with revised electoral laws and free from chaos on the
financial markets.
In resigning rather than waiting for the outcome of the no-confidence vote,
Mr Berlusconi has sought to force the president's hand in favour of
elections, as early as March if possible. The outgoing premier even told
parliament that any failure to go to the electorate after Mr Bossi's
desertion would be defrauding the voters.
Mr Berlusconi's only real chance of political survival lies in pressing for
early elections. He could hope for a sympathy vote. Already he is making
direct appeals to the people: he says all sovereignty resides in the voters,
implying that the television audience rather than parliament should be the
real judge of his government.
His other allies - the MSI/National Alliance of Mr Gianfranco Fini and the
small Christian Democratic Centre - have stood solidly behind him. He will
also pick up support from dissident members of the League. But it is
questionable how long they will wish to be associated with a man who has
shown himself lacking in leadership and political skill. And if he were
returned to power, he would face the same problems he inherited eight months
back, but magnified by his initial failure.

Sir, British Rail's 'customer care' programme is raising InterCity's
in-train announcements to new heights of ingenuity.
On Tuesday, some 10 minutes after a London-bound train advertised as
stopping at Milton Keynes had hurtled through the station, the senior
conductor reassuringly told us: 'You will have noticed that the train did
not, in fact, stop at Milton Keynes. I have spoken to the driver about it.
He tells me that he had developed a problem which prevented him stopping
safely at Milton Keynes. Passengers for Milton Keynes should change at
Watford Junction.'
The sense of mounting excitement during the remainder of the journey was
almost tangible.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Better than 'bingle jells': This year's corporate Christmas
cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They are piled on your desk, taped to your wall and strung up over your
head. Some have been put aside, for their senders to be added to next year's
list, others are already on their way to recycling.
Chances are you received more Christmas cards than usual at the office. From
organisations you have never heard of, signed by strangers - first names
only - in an illegible scrawl. Some, even, with rubber-stamped signatures.
Companies just cannot kick the habit. Apart from a no doubt genuine desire
to communicate their good will, the occasion is so good an opportunity to
try to make a sale.
And little is sacred. Overt Christian themes are a dying tradition, in
honest acknowledgment of the religious, cultural and national diversity of
most companies' mailing lists.
The blasphemous mixing of religion, humour and commerce also appears to be
declining (or malefactors are being more selective about who receives such
cards).
Interregnum Venture Marketing does have a biblical looking star over what
might be a stable, with the seasonal beatitude 'transforming technology into
wealth', but that seems to qualify as obscure rather than offensive.
Even more gnomic is the card from Dyson, the UK vacuum cleaner maker. One of
two appliances has a star above it. The official explanation is that this
represents a Christmas tree, but whispers from Dyson's Wiltshire
headquarters suggest it heralds the launch of a new model in February, the
second in a 'trinity'. Please say no more.
Product placement is much more straightforward. Guinness serves up a richly
toned photographic still life, an Old Master with a word from our sponsor.
The usual accoutrements - fig, walnuts, pomegranates and pine cones - share
the picture with bottles of Bell's, Johnnie Walker, Gordon's gin and a pint
of stout.
And what good is an ad campaign if it can't be milked? Insurer Direct Line
dresses its red telephone in seasonal garb. 'Does Santa use Switch? Do
children like Christmas?' fits in neatly with the debit card's outdoor
poster campaign.
Perrier harks back to a previous ad campaign by sending a large green
balloon and instructing: 'Bleau'. Fizzy nostalgia or discreet testing of the
waters for a revival?
Fiat and Vauxhall also implicitly admit things aren't what they used to be
by featuring vintage cars rather than current models. Citroen finds a more
artistic way for the display of logo that seems mandatory in the motor
industry.
Christmas is also a time to lobby. Robert Maxwell appears as a snowman, to
underline the Maxwell/AGB Pension Fund Contributors Association's point that
its members are 'still out in the cold'. The Brewers and Licensed Retailers
Association sends a cartoon of Father Christmas, reindeer and sleigh coming
in over the channel with the observation: 'It seems like everyone is doing a
beer run to France.'
'Let us show you our building' remains a favourite theme of the
imagination-impaired. Universities and business schools are frequent
offenders, and one hopes for the sake of Sun Alliance Life &amp; Pensions that
the night-lit offering of its Horsham HQ does an injustice to the edifice.
Daewoo Heavy Industries features a snap of one of its tankers.
'Let us show you ourselves' is even worse. Mockery here would only gratify
the offenders, so we will not mention most of them. But the
self-aggrandising extravaganza from derivatives traders Intercapital cannot
pass unacknowledged. Their cavortings as 'merrie men' (and women) are
recorded in 12 A4 pages, bound in a green-and-gilt folder.
Leeds Development Corporation sends another execrable card, showing its
chairman dressed as Santa on a cabin cruiser. But North West Water depicts a
winter's day on Ullswater, and the Scottish Tourist Board makes effective
display of the landscape.
Fewer companies send kiddie drawings this year, although Legal and General's
childishly abstract three kings come in the colours of the insurer's
umbrella logo. The chairman of Mendip district council turned to his wife
for the painting on its card. A nice one, too.
There are more cards with railway scenes, an inevitable result of corporate
fragmentation in the sector. Most offerings, like Railtrack's (above), are
suitable for slipping into a train-spotter's anorak, but France's SNCF is
more stylish.
Sakura Global Capital wins points for topicality in the year of the
derivative. Its card shows Santa packing a parcel with curves, ceilings,
floors, caps, collars and other instruments of the financial engineering
trade, while wondering 'whatever happened to Action Man and Lego'. If you
like 'funny', this is as good as it gets. It is certainly better than a
tipsy Santa repeating 'bingle jells' 14 times.
Among abstract cards, two of the best were commissioned by the senders:
paintings by Sarah Henson for solicitors Nabarro Nathanson and Linda Melia
for video processing equipment maker Snell &amp; Wilcox. A Charity Christmas
Card Council illustration by Robert Guy, sent by several firms, is also
outstanding.
In the 'views of London' category, Guinness Flight sent a dramatic
photograph of Tower Bridge and frozen River Thames in February 1895. Faintly
in the background is the outline of Butler's Wharf, where the fund manager's
offices now are.
Martin Ryckaert's Flight into Egypt, sent by Schroders, is the best
religious card we have seen this year. In the secular branch of high art,
Hardy Oil &amp; Gas sent a juicy 19th century Still Life of Oranges by Carl
Vilhelm Balsgaad.
Perhaps the best overall was one of the simplest, from London PR agency
Fishburn Hedges. A blue cover bears a simple green tree in red pot. When the
card is removed, holes in the cover create yellow ornaments on the tree.
But if only all cards could be as personal as that received by the FT's
banking editor from Lloyds Bank. Looking at the Tavistock streetscape, he
pointed to a first-floor window and exclaimed: 'I lived in that flat when I
was a cub reporter]'

FT  23 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Power to the people - very
Machiavellian
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JULIAN WELLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Whatever Machiavelli's faults or merits, as either human being or
management consultant ('Pioneers and Prophets', December 19), to say that
'empowerment was not in his vocabulary' is true only in the sense that this
grisly word had not come into currency in the 15th century.
This is what he said about political turmoil in Rome's republican era: 'If
tumults led to the creation of the tribunes, tumults deserve the highest
praise, since, besides giving the populace a share in the administration,
they served as the guardian of Roman liberties' (Discourses, 1.4).
In Discourse 58 (roundly titled 'The Masses are more Knowing and more
Constant than is a Prince') he explicitly concludes that 'government by the
populace is better than government by princes'.
Machiavelli speaks plainly about how to impose or maintain tyranny because
he wishes to avoid the consequences of taking would-be tyrants on the smooth
face they present to the public.
So no talk of 'empowerment' - but then none about 'downsizing', either.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Government not disingenuous on a
minimum wage claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PHILLIP OPPENHEIM MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article, 'Figures show benefit of a minimum wage' (December 19),
suggests that the government has been disingenuous in claiming that a
national minimum wage would lead to a fall in the number of jobs.
Denis MacShane's argument, that a number of other countries with minimum
wage mechanisms have seen a higher growth in employment than the UK, is
deeply flawed. The facts are that those countries quoted and which have seen
a significant growth in employment have, in the main, very different types
of wage-fixing mechanisms from the sort of national minimum wage which
Labour is proposing.
In the US, the minimum wage is currently set at the extremely low level of
Dollars 4.25 per hour. Moreover, despite coming to power committed to
raising the minimum wage, President Clinton has not done so, clearly because
of fears about the effect on jobs. In Australia, wages are set at state
level; in Japan, there are different industry rates; in both countries, the
level is very low.
France and Spain, which are the only EU countries with a national minimum
wage of the sort Labour proposes, have significantly higher unemployment
rates than the UK.
It is not surprising Mr MacShane finds UK employment performance poor
compared with other European countries, as he uses the wrong figure. Mr
MacShane claims that employment growth for the UK was 1.5 per cent between
1980 and 1990; the actual OECD figure was 6.4 per cent (recently revised up
to 6.8 per cent). When comparisons are based over the economic cycle
(1979-90) - the correct way of assessing employment growth - the UK rate of
job creation was faster than in France and Spain.
The government believes the only sustainable way to improve real pay is
through a combination of enhanced education and training. This will provide
people with the skills to obtain better paid jobs together with the
framework for monetary stability, low inflation, and a climate for
successful investment and enterprise to allow individuals to provide better
paid jobs. That we have been successful in this endeavour is indicated by
the fact that whereas pay and productivity levels stagnated during the last
Labour government, both have risen substantially since 1979.

<TEXT>
Sir, Lex (Albright &amp; Wilson, December 14) asks why investors should consider
paying more for Albright than the business is worth to Tenneco or trade
buyers.
If Tenneco's parenting of Albright is destroying value (a fairly common
situation), the chemical business will be worth more as an independent
company than as part of Tenneco.
Since speciality chemicals companies mostly perform badly when they are
divisions of larger chemical companies, the logic of a flotation rather than
a trade sale appears sound.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Arts: Bibalo's 'Macbeth' - Opera in Bern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You will find the Macbeths in every political establishment - the insecure
husband, the scheming wife, both playing classic roles in the destructive
drama of power. That is the premise behind Antonio Bibalo's operatic version
of Macbeth, which has just received a successful German-language premiere in
the Swiss capital, Bern.
Bibalo chose his subject well. Outwardly successful and fascinating in their
fateful loneliness, the Macbeths look credible in whatever clothes you give
them, always coming out with their hands covered in someone else's blood.
Like Verdi, Bibalo has based his libretto on the Shakespeare play, but he
skilfully avoids comparison by creating a dramatic world of his own.
Bibalo (b1922) grew up in Trieste, studied the 12-note technique with
Elisabeth Lutyens in London and settled in Norway in 1956. His music, modern
but undemanding, combines Mediterranean colour with Nordic stillness and
melancholy. He has written three previous operas, based on texts by Henry
Miller, Strindberg and Ibsen. Macbeth was first performed in English at Oslo
in 1990.
The plot unfolds in 16 scenes over just 90 minutes. Unlike Verdi Bibalo
gives Duncan something to sing, includes Shakespeare's porter, but omits the
scene in England. The rest is cut to the barest bones. Everything is
concentrated on the Macbeths' psychological development. The soliloquies are
brief, but the key lines register clearly.
The music tries to conjure the inner world of thought and motivation - not
so much in the solo vocal parts, which consist of lyrical declamation and
unaccompanied Sprechgesang, as in the instrumental and choral writing.
Wordless female voices, enveloping the stage in a web of mysterious sound,
are Bibalo's most atmospheric device. The orchestra's contribution is
limited to gestural flourishes, impressionist strokes and mini-crescendi.
The overall result is concise but one-dimensional. I found myself longing
for a sense of developing line, of musical argument and contrast.
Bern's municipal theatre deserves credit not just for presenting a new work,
but for importing a German production team of proven experience. Kurt
Horres' staging, designed by Gottfried Pilz, matched the composer's vision.
The bare box-set was white, the costumes predominantly black, making the
blood-stained hands and cloaks all the more striking. The sleep-walking
scene was particularly effective: Lady Macbeth was confined to a roped-off
area centre-stage, observed by psychiatric staff. The three witches moved
like invisible sirens of the mind.
Macbeth is a character tenor, his wife a mezzo. With his shaven head and
great-coat, Uwe Schonbeck made a very German-looking Macbeth, but gave the
part a universal quality, thanks to his intelligent vocal acting and command
of the visual language of guilt. Renee Morloc's Lady was young and
bewitching. The Bern Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Hans Drewanz, sounded
comfortable in Bibalo's fastidious musical idiom.

There is always one witty person in Have I Got News for You? Paul Merton is,
unlike his colleagues, genuinely quick, funny, intelligent and not dependent
on snideness, malice, implied superiority or retarded infantilism.
Tonight's edition (10pm BBC2) is the last of the series; time to take stock.
Is Angus Deayton really such a one-joke man, that joke being his air of prim
supercilious (which does not rule out schoolboy smut)? Has Ian Hislop really
nothing more to him than the tacky raffishness of a middle-aged imp with the
charisma of a gargoyle carved from a potato? His air of gleeful
naughty-child mischief verges on the grotesque. This has turned into a cosy
little club, inimical to real satire and reeking dangerously of
irresponsible self-satisfaction. Which sitting duck shall they put the boot
into tonight? Which personal and private feud will they generously share
with us? One of the guests is Kelvin Mackenzie, ex-editor of The Sun. They
probably feel superior to him but are brothers under the skin; he is merely
more honest. A grubbily smirking little programme.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Arts: Confused sexual identities - Theatre off-Broadway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the great pleasures of this bustling off-Broadway season is a rare New
York stage appearance by Vanessa Redgrave, in Vita and Virginia, Eileen
Atkins' adaptation of the letters of Vita Sackville-West and Virginia Woolf
which played in Chichester and London last year.
Redgrave is in stunning form: few actors look as alive, emotionally and
physically, on stage as she, and the passionate, voracious Sackville-West is
a character she was born to play. Atkins, here as in the show's English
incarnation, plays Woolf, and though her performance brings out the woman's
quiet strength, wry humor, and weakening emotional and physical health, even
she cannot make sense of the story's abrupt ending: because the script
focuses on the women only in relation to each other we have little sense of
the factors which are sending Virginia over the edge to suicide. It is a
lone weakness in Zoe Caldwell's otherwise elegant and entertaining
production, which looks well ensconced at the Union Square Theatre until
March, perhaps beyond.
While Vita and Virginia feeds America's seemingly insatiable appetite for
things English and literary, You Should Be So Lucky, another of the season's
off-Broadway success stories, is one of those theatrical phenomenons that
could only happen in New York. The play marks a turning point in the career
of its playwright and star, Charles Busch, heretofore New York's best-known
drag performer; it is his first stage appearance as a man.
A modern-day Cinderella story/screwball comedy, You Should Be So Lucky
concerns Christopher, an agoraphobic gay played by Busch, whose life is
transformed when he lends a kind hand to an elderly stranger who turns out
to be a millionaire. The conceit is far from original, Busch's storytelling
is often clunky, and Kenneth Elliot's production is awkward to the point of
being amateurish. But the play's spirit is so big-hearted that its faults
end up working it its favour: we are drawn into a world as winningly
idiosyncratic as Busch's lovably nebbishy stage presence.
Play and production carry the authentically obsessive flavour of
contemporary Manhattan life: everyone is either in therapy or desperately in
need of it, and trying to create some sense of community in a world of
opportunism, tiny apartments, rampant diseases, and trashy talk shows. A hit
at the not-for-profit Primary Stages Company, it has now transfered to the
Westside Theatre.
As Busch gives voice to Manhattan's manic spirit, the outer boroughs have an
able representative in Danny Hoch, a 23-year-old actor and writer whose solo
show, Some People, is playing at the New York Shakespeare Festival's Public
Theatre.
A multi-character monologuist in the tradition of Anna Deavere Smith and
John Leguizamo, Hoch impersonates New Yorkers of different social and racial
backgrounds, from an Afro-Caribbean late-night DJ to a middle-aged Jewish
mother to a Cuban-American girl in her 20s to a Puerto Rican senior citizen.
Hoch is an astonishingly adept mimic, but he is still learning that the
strength of his work lies in letting characters speak for themselves; a
preachy coda tacked on to the 90-minute-long monologue undermines its
subtlety. Nonetheless, it is a stunning debut from a young artist whose
politics and aesthetics are bound to shape the next generation of American
theatre.
Lesbian English authoresses; a drag queen in trousers; an ethnically
politicised monologuist: whence the voice of straight white America? A play
by AR Gurney, America's premier playwright of White Anglo Saxon Protestant
culture, seems a well-timed addition to this diverse theatrical climate,
particularly given his present source material: the short stories of John
Cheever, the Pulitzer Prize-winning chronicler of New York middle class
culture.
But the series of scenes and monologues Gurney has patched together out of
these stories, called A Cheever Evening, does not add up to much of a play.
The vignettes are so brief and Don Scardino's production at Playwrights
Horizons so brisk and surface-level that there is no chance to get to know
or care about the characters. We are left with a vague, generalised idea of
the anxieties and passions underlying this social class's pristine exterior,
but without anything solid to hang on to; it is like a dinner party that
never gets past the hors d'oeuvres.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Arts: Sex, taboos and the selfish gene - Andrew Clark
reviews the premiere of 'Lolita', Shchedrin's new opera staged in Stockholm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lo, Lola, Lolita] First came the novel by Vladimir Nabokov, alternately
scandalising and seducing its readers when it first appeared in the late
1950s. Then there was the Stanley Kubrick film starring James Mason and
Peter Sellars. Now we have the opera - written by Rodion Shchedrin,
conducted by his Russian compatriot Mstislav Rostropovich, and staged by
Sweden's Royal Opera in Stockholm.
Lolita is the story of a middle-aged man's fixation for an under-age girl,
set in suburban America around 1950. It is both sick and psychologically
fascinating. Sick, because the idea of a 40-year old man having sex with a
12-year old nymphet, and killing the rival who steals her, is an affront to
conventional morality. Psychologically fascinating, because it raises issues
which puritanical Christian society likes to put a cap on - such as the war
of the sexes, the 'selfish gene', and why an ageing male should be attracted
to a female at the most productive stage of her sexual development.
For the reader, the power of Lolita lies in the fluency and elegance of
Nabokov's English prose (which he later translated into his native Russian).
For the theatre composer, its appeal is more down-to-earth: it deals with a
girl, distantly related to Carmen and Lulu, who so obsesses a man that the
only way he can rid himself of her is to kill.
Shchedrin (b1932) is not the first composer to see the novel's dramatic
potential. Leonard Bernstein apparently wanted to write an opera with
Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau as Humbert Humbert, the European emigre who tells
the story from his death-cell. But Bernstein never pursued the idea. Perhaps
it was the intellectual quality of the story-telling which put him off, or
the difficulty of casting a nymphet.
Nothing so mundane entered Shchedrin's mind. He simply went ahead, not even
stopping to think about literary rights. That was the first headache in the
run-up to the Stockholm premiere. The Nabokov estate had already sold the
rights for dramatic adaptation to Hollywood for a new film, and was
threatening legal action if Shchedrin's opera was performed in a major world
language.
Thanks to that stand, Lolita can be sung in Swedish, Serbo-Croat or Swahili,
but not English, Russian or German. The estate even banned the circulation
of an English libretto - though only Nabokov's words are used - and insisted
on editorial control of the Swedish programme. The novelist's son, Dmitri,
who is the main beneficiary of the estate, attended the premiere and his
presence excited curiosity.
More problems arose when Swedish child protection campaigners tried to force
the opera's cancellation, claiming that paedophile acts on stage would
encourage sexual abuse. Eskil Hemberg, the Royal Opera's director, put up a
spirited defence on national television, saying no-one had called for the
suppression of The Ring just because it portrayed incest and murder. 'If we
can't show human failure on stage, there's no future for opera,' he said.
'Theatre must cover the problems of society. An opera house is a university
of feelings - it is our job to demonstrate those feelings on stage, and let
our audiences make up their mind.'
The opera itself is well-made but unsensational. Shchedrin dispenses with
the book's European prelude, ignores all minor characters and incidents, but
retains the flavour of Nabokov's word-games. Each of the three acts is a
flashback from Humbert's cell, where he is haunted by visions of the jury
(male chorus) and Clare Quilty, the man he killed. This gives Quilty a
prominence which, in the book, he lacks until the final pages. It also gives
Humbert a false aura of remorse.
Shchedrin's music runs for nearly three and a half hours. Acts 2 and 3 sag,
not just because the story itself loses its early frisson, but because there
is insufficient dramatic and musical contrast. The three orchestral
interludes could easily be cut; so could the banal ditties for two
butterfly/bunny girls, which have period flavour but hold up the flow.
Otherwise Shchedrin shows a musical adroitness to match his political
reputation as former head of the Russian composers' union. He uses flute
choirs and sustained lower strings to cultivate a languid, almost gloomy
atmosphere, occasionally interrupted by outbursts reminiscent of a
Shostakovich scherzo. The lyrical tone-painting bears a whiff of Barber and
Copland; an unvaried lento conjures the monotony of transcontinental car
travel. Voices are never covered. The most memorable music is a naive Sancta
Maria for boys' choir, haunting Humbert's cell and recalling the lost world
of his tragic first love.
The Royal Opera was lucky to find an ideal interpreter for the title role.
Lisa Gustafsson, a 25-year old student, had most of the qualities Nabokov so
eloquently describes: the 'high voice, turned-in toes, agile giggling legs
and schoolgirl thighs'. In short, she looked and sounded like an emotionally
immature pubescent, before transforming herself into a dowdy, pregnant
teenage housewife for the penultimate scene.
The baritone Per-Arne Wahlgren made a plausible Humbert - less Nabokov's
weak-willed roue than a repressed New Englander in mid-life crisis, hitting
the bottle and ultimately resorting to rape. It is a long role, but not
vocally exacting. Laila Andersson Palme played Lolita's mother as a
big-bosomed, predatory red-head. Bjorn Haugan sounded comfortable in the
high dramatic tenor role of Quilty.
Ann-Margret Pettersson's staging served the work well. The simulated sex
scenes lacked the poetry of the book, but only a prude would object. John
Conklin's representational sets, inspired by the paintings of Edward Hopper
and the American Surrealists, were full of period detail - gas-pumps,
lipstick tubes, cigarette packets and patterned sofas. Rostropovich unfolded
the score with loving care, but the result was too slow and self-effacing.
Performances continue till February 10.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Property: Rate of return slow in November
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rate of total return slowed across the market in November, with an
all-property return of 0.3 per cent for the month, according to research
group Investment Property Databank.
This represents a slide of 0.1 percentage points from October. Rental values
have shown a negligible rise over the month, with the all-property rental
value index standing at 136.52 in November.
Capital values continue to slide, falling 0.3 per cent in November. For the
calender year to date the total return measured 14.9 per cent. If the most
recent capital value trends continue into December, it will mean a 12-month
return to the end of the year of just over 15 per cent. This compares with a
return of 16.4 per cent for the year to December 1993.
Long-term capital growth has fallen from 12.6 per cent in the year to
October to 10.0 per cent for the 12 months to November. The rate of rental
value decline continues to slow, recording -1.8 per cent for the same
period.
Retail property continues to lead the pack with a total return of 0.5 per
cent. Offices move into second place with a return of 0.2 per cent followed
by the industrial sector with a return of 0.1 per cent.
The long-term sector rankings are unchanged with retails recording a total
return of 21.2 per cent for the year to November, followed by industrials
(19.5 per cent) and offices (15.7 per cent).

Fred Crawley is to step down as chairman of Alliance &amp; Leicester Building
Society at the end of next week, after three years in the post.
A resignation at the top in a building society - particularly given current
levels of interest in mergers and takeovers - often acts to spur speculation
about possible deals, since it removes one of the possible difficulties
about filling senior posts.
But A&amp;L has appointed a successor to Crawley - Simon Everard, 66, who has
been deputy chairman since 1990, and has had more than 25 years on building
society boards since becoming a director of the Leicester Temperance
Building Society in 1967.
Crawley, 68, joined A&amp;L - now the fourth largest society - from a background
in banking. This proved particularly relevant to the integration of Girobank
into the society's activities. He had joined Lloyds Bank in 1942, and was
deputy chief executive when he left in 1987.
Within a few months of his becoming A&amp;L chairman, the society's chief
executive, Scott Durward, resigned amid claims - which were denied - that he
had been ousted in a boardroom coup. Peter White, deputy chief executive and
finance director, succeeded him.
Crawley will remain on the board of Girobank, the society's subsidiary, as a
non-executive director.

<TEXT>
Nigel Ellis, BAA's 55-year-old finance director, is opting for a change in
lifestyle before he gets too old to enjoy himself. He has decided to chuck
in his job at Britain's biggest airport operator so that he can spend more
time at his home in France's Dordogne region.
Ellis, whose recreations include collecting Swedish stamps and chess, joined
BAA in 1988 shortly after the government had privatised the old British
Airports Authority. Having started as an articled clerk in 1957, he worked
as chief accountant in several firms before becoming finance director of
Hammerson Property in 1979.
Ellis was unavailable yesterday, but BAA stressed that his departure was
very much his own decision.
Sir John Egan, BAA's chief executive, says Ellis has made an 'invaluable
contribution' to the company's success and would continue to act as a
consultant.
Ellis intends to retire at a mutually convenient date after the end of the
current financial year ends in March 1995. BAA will begin its search for his
successor in the New Year.

FT  23 DEC 94 / People: Southern increases geographical base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATHARINE CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eight months after an internal reorganisation at NatWest Markets, Garry
Southern, managing director of international development, is moving across
to Standard Chartered Markets into the newly created position of chief
executive of the capital markets division.
Southern will assume responsibility for debt capital markets and derivatives
business worldwide. The bank's focus on Asia meshes well with Southern's
love of the region and he claims to have become tired of the 'basis point
business' that characterises mature capital markets.
His is the most senior appointment made to date by John McFarlane, who heads
Standard Chartered Markets. McFarlane, who joined from Citibank 18 months
ago, has had to spend much of his time reorganising the Asian operation in
the aftermath of a series of scandals, notably in Bombay and Hong Kong.
Brought up in South Africa, Southern, who has just turned 50, began his
professional life in London as a barrister. He quickly moved into the
Euromarkets - on the advice of his cousin Alastair Morton, (now Sir Alastair
and running Eurotunnel).
In the 1970s he worked for the consortium bank Rothschild Intercontinental
specialising in Asian project finance before moving to Manufacturers Hanover
where he ran the North American banking operation, principally concentrating
on derivatives. He joined what was then County NatWest in New York in 1986;
he moved to London in 1989, and headed the capital markets operation until
April 1994.
Having arrived at County NatWest around the time of the Blue Arrow affair,
he will probably not be unduly put off by Standard Chartered's difficulties.
'Either you join a firm that is running like a Rolls-Royce or you join one
that has enormous potential,' is his view.

FT  23 DEC 94 / People: Now virtually executive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Dennis Ohryn has moved from virtual manager (monthly transatlantic flights
to attend board meetings) to the real world with his appointment as
executive deputy chairman of Virtuality Group, one of a handful of UK-based
companies making waves in the esoteric field of virtual reality. He has been
a non-executive director of the company since 1993.
It should not prove much of a a culture shock for the distinguished US
computer professional. Now in his mid-50s, Ohryn has spent 30 years in
international sales and marketing in the computer business. His career has
included spells at Prime Computer and more recently at Sun Microsystems,
market leader in workstations, where he was responsible for developing
worldwide sales.
Virtuality, on the other hand, is a tiny company, newly floated but with
some prestigious contracts in the VR market including one with IBM. Ohryn is
clearly someone with an eye for a likely winner. In his new role, he will
help Virtuality develop its business in the US and Japanese markets while
developing existing relationships with IBM and other product companies
including Atari and Sega.
Jon Waldern, Virtuality founder and chief executive, says the company is now
doing more than half its business in the US and may open a California
office. Ohryn's knowledge of the US high-tech scene will be invaluable, he
says.
Ray Ticer, 48, who has worked for Apple Computer since 1984, most recently
as a consultant, but before that as financial controller in Latin America,
has been appointed finance director. The current fd Mark Bernstein is
resigning but will remain an adviser.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Property: The new realism - Sellers are willing to accept
lower prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After an exceptionally quiet autumn, the property investment market is
stirring. The Pounds 1.5bn unsolicited offer for St Martins Property Group,
owned by the Kuwaiti government, is the most obvious sign of life.
But other, less glamorous, deals completed over the past few weeks could be
more significant indications of the overall health of the market.
Properties which have been on sale for months have finally been sold. This
is not because enthusiastic buyers are offering better prices, but because
sellers are now willing to accept the prices on offer.
Land Securities' sale last week of its Milton Gate office block in the City
of London looks like a case of this new realism among sellers.
AP Fonden, the Swedish national pension fund, paid Pounds 76.5m for the
property. While that is above the property's March valuation, it is much
below the original asking price - thought to be about Pounds 85m.
'We thought we were going to see a lot of activity this autumn but it never
happened,' said Mr John Slade of Richard Ellis, the surveyors. 'Expectations
on the part of vendors were clearly too high and have had to come down to
more realistic levels.'
Similarly, Friends Provident's purchase of London Capital Holdings from
Citibank followed an unsuccessful attempt to float the company on the stock
market in May.
Citibank withdrew the planned flotation because stock market investors were
not willing to pay a price close to the company's Pounds 240m net asset
value. While the details of the Friends Provident deal were not disclosed,
it seems likely that the life insurer has paid less than Citibank
anticipated in the summer.
Realism on the part of sellers bodes well. A healthy property investment
market relies on some common ground between buyers and sellers.
The snag is that the weight of UK institutional money trying to get into the
property market has dissipated over the past year. According to Hillier
Parker, the surveyors, institutional cash totalling Pounds 10bn was waiting
to be invested in property at the peak of the market in March. Since then
interest has fallen. The top funds now have only about one-third the amount
available.
The drift of institutions away from property partly reflects a realisation
that the outlook is not as rosy as it seemed.
According to forecasts by the London Business School, capital values will
rise by just 2.6 per cent next year against about 9 per cent this year.
Moreover, property has outpaced both bonds and equities in 1994. Even
without committing additional funds, the weighting of most life and pension
funds to property has risen through this year.
Funds have been drawing breath after the frenetic activity of the first half
of the year, but that will change when 1995 asset allocations are decided,'
said Mr Philip Nelson of Nelson Bakewell, the surveyors. 'I sense that the
investment market is unsticking.'
AP Fonden's latest acquisition also underlines that foreign investment has
become a permanent feature of the central London property market.
The inflow of overseas funds this year - at about Pounds 1.8bn - is nowhere
near the Pounds 3bn-plus annual totals of the late 1980s. But such huge
inflows were caused by an extraordinary mixture of sky-high confidence and
deregulation in countries such as Sweden and Japan.
The evidence of the past four years suggests that central London might, in a
normal year, expect Pounds 1.5bn - Pounds 2bn net investment from overseas.
'The UK is now seen by international funds as an established long-term
destination for investment in property,' said Mr Peter Evans, head of
research at DTZ Debenham Thorpe, the surveyors.
Having done well from acquisitions made at the trough of the market in
1991-92, German open-ended funds are particularly keen buyers.
Overseas buyers appear to be interested in different types of property than
UK funds. Milton Gate - sold on a yield of 8.85 per cent - was typical of
the kind of over-rented building foreign investors are keen to buy. In
contrast, UK fund managers are willing to acquire properties on low yields
if they can scent rental growth. Yields of 5-6 per cent are not uncommon in
the City.
With money flowing in from overseas, steady interest from domestic
institutions and some agreement among buyers and sellers, a healthier flow
of investment deals is in prospect for the new year.
However, old hands warn that the market may never recapture its heady past.
Sir Brian Goswell, head of Healey &amp; Baker's City office, said: 'The market
is slow in relation to the late 1980s but activity is normal from a
long-term point of view. The difference is that agency fees are much lower
than in the past. The feel-good factor among agents is simply not there.'

FT  23 DEC 94 / Technology: Science and the perfect turkey - FT writers
offer words of wisdom on food, drink, nutrition and the legend you're likely
to be taking part in this weekend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES

<TEXT>
Christmas is a time to eat, drink and be merry. For many, it is a time for
reflection. For the cook, it is a time for stress. But let us assume that
much of the preparation is under way. With only 48 hours to go, it is too
late to make the perfect Christmas pudding, but there's still time to get
the rest right.
As any physicist knows, the important thing is to understand the structure
and dimensions of what is being cooked; then know your cooker.
Peter Barham, lecturer in physics at the University of Bristol, takes an
equation based on Fick's Law of diffusion as a starting point for the right
cooking time for a turkey. Fick's Law (named after Adolph Fick, the German
physiologist) says that the mass of solute diffusing through unit area per
second is proportional to the concentration gradient.
Applied to a turkey, Fick would have told his mother to buy a spherical
bird, to measure its radius, to use a convection cooker and to hope for the
best; expressed as an equation: dm/ds = DS dc/dx.
Barham's simplified approach has it that the time for the centre of a turkey
to reach a certain temperature is proportional to the square of the radius
of the bird. The point is that heat takes longest to reach the centre. The
wings and legs may be done to a turn, but the meat inside is only just
warming up. Judge a turkey by its inner heat.
Yet more important is the bird's molecular structure, which begins to change
at specific temperatures.
Nicholas Kurti, emeritus professor of physics at Oxford University, points
out that the protein molecules in turkey flesh - myosi and actin - cook at
meat (not oven) temperatures of between 60`C and 70`C. The blobs of protein
start to change shape at lower temperatures as the heat breaks the bonds
that normally keep them in place.
'There are two stages,' says Kurti. 'As the meat temperature rises, the
molecules unroll and give out threads like an uncurled octopus. The
tentacles loosen and spread.' This is the point at which the bird is
becoming tender.
'Heat it further and the tentacles start grabbing each other - the molecules
coagulate and form a soft but rigid network at about 70`C'
This is the critical point. Allow the meat temperature to go much higher, or
for coagulation to go on too long, and the networks harden, crack and break
up. The bird toughens, and it dries up as the water evaporates. 'You'll get
a solid and not very tasty meat,' says Kurti.
'If only the manufacturers would put in with the bird a small, light
thermometer, about the size of a darning needle. You stick this into the
turkey (where it stays throughout cooking) to check whether the meat on the
inside has reached the right temperature.'
Moistness also depends on the condition and fat content of the bird (a
turkey is roughly 60 per cent water, 20 per cent fat and 20 per cent
protein). 'The meat has a loose density, a loose texture which is mainly
water,' says Kurti. 'It can dry out whereas if there's more fat, say with a
duck, it will be better.'
Some cooks dress their turkey in a muslin vest soaked in butter before
roasting. The bird, we are told, will emerge a moist and tender creature.
But the scientific truth is that the muslin will not help the breast meat
deep inside. Its contribution can be only superficial.
For cooking times, Kurti says about 20 minutes per pound for a large turkey,
but he urges careful observation of temperature and adjustments to time as
appropriate.
John Fry, lecturer in physics at the University of Liverpool, also
recommends watching the bird's temperature. 'The temperature in the middle
is a reasonable guide to cooking time. The formula of 20 minutes per pound
and 20 more for the bird is very approximate. If it's an enormous piece of
meat you would have to cook it longer.'
Barham quotes the equation: t = (M/MO) 2/3 tO. This will give the time for
cooking your Christmas bird after experimentation, where M = mass, t = time
(the only variables), and O denotes constants. In experiments, MO = the mass
of a test bird; tO = a fixed cooking time. Time for the bird is worked out
once the other figures are inserted after a test run.
Harold McGee, author of The Curious Cook and On Food and Cooking - The
Science and Lore of the Kitchen, also points to the importance of
temperature as it relates to protein coagulation and other changes in the
muscle and connective tissues. However, his general approach is about
'doneness' - that is, whether or not the meat looks done, though this is
more readily applicable to red meat.
On the stuffing, McGee says stuffed poultry should be cooked in an oven
temperature of 163`C because 'lower temperatures allow bacteria in the
stuffing to flourish for too long, and higher temperatures shorten the
cooking time enough that the stuffing may never cook through'. The safety
margin on pork is 66`C to kill the trichinae parasite.
Kurti cautions against putting the stuffing into the bird cavity. 'It's very
tricky if there's raw meat, such as sausage meat. The cavity doesn't get hot
enough to cook it.' It should be pre-cooked, cooked separately, or put in
the neck, where the temperature is higher. There is no problem with a
breadcrumb and chestnut stuffing which takes less time to cook than meat and
is not potentially poisonous raw.
Now the turkey is safely in the oven, vest on, thermometer in place, the
potatoes need attention, particularly those for roasting.
Potatoes contain water and starch molecules. 'These puff up,' says Kurti,
'and the potato becomes crumbly and woolly as the starch molecules break up
and absorb water.' Overboiling makes them fall apart. Woolly starch
molecules are to blame.
Kurti's approach to roast potatoes indicates that some of his research has
been carried out in the kitchen: 'To produce the right consistency for
roasting,' he says, 'it is best to peel them, quarter them and part cook
them in the microwave - for five or six minutes. Then put them in the oven
in the fat for half to three-quarters of an hour.'
Barham's equation for cooking potatoes is t= r 2 /c, where t is cooking
time, r the radius of the potato and c the constant which depends on the
surface area of the potato and the heat capacity of the water.
They should be pre-cooked until they acquire a gel-like surface layer which,
says Barham, will prevent the starch granules below absorbing too much fat.
Barham thinks the perfect potato should reach 66`C throughout.
For the vegetables, overcooking is generally worse than undercooking. But in
most cases, cooking enhances flavours because high temperatures 'make the
aromatic molecules more volatile and so more easily detected,' says McGee in
On Food and Cooking. These volatile compounds, along with nutrients and
vitamins, will be driven out with overcooking.
Most greens will emerge crisp and more brightly coloured after rapid boiling
in large volumes of water for five to seven minutes - uncovered for the
first few minutes. The water will dilute the plant's acids, explains McGee,
which dull the vegetable colour. Some of the acids will evaporate quickly
and will drop back in if the saucepan is covered.
If all is well with the vegetables and meat, the gravy will be good too. The
worst accidents happen with thickening. Where flour is used, starch
molecules swell in the liquid. It becomes crowded and gelatinous with too
much flour, McGee warns. Lumps occur because starch gelatinises quickly in
hot gravy, creating a barrier to the surrounding liquid.
As the turkey is lifted majestically from the oven, only a scientist will
reach for the calculator. The rest of us will reach for a cracker, a glass
of wine and a party hat. Bon appetit.

If the holiday season is likely to leave you feeling ill, worried or guilty,
the world's home healthcare industry is ready to spring to your aid.
On offer are a host of diagnostic tools to help you find out whether you
have high blood pressure or too much cholesterol, have ovulated or are
pregnant. There is no home sanity test yet.
But the experts say some products may not be reliable, and could even be
illegal.
After all the revelry and stress, you might be tempted to buy cholesterol
and blood pressure testing kits. High cholesterol levels are associated with
high fat diets and with heart disease. High blood pressure can lead to heart
problems, stroke, kidney and eye disease.
Tests on the UK market range from a Pounds 7 cholesterol test - a drop of
your blood spilt on special paper will change its colour according to your
cholesterol level - to a Pounds 100 computerised blood pressure machine.
The problem, according to the British Medical Association, is that there are
many contributory factors to heart disease including family history, diet
and exercise.
'You are not getting the whole picture with these devices,' says the BMA.
Trials by the Consumers' Association found the cholesterol tests on the
market give 'variable' results but blood pressure machines are 'promising'.
Nevertheless, the British Heart Foundation said that 'tests can be
unreliable' because measurements might not be taken 'under ideal
conditions'. It said that the machines 'might cause panic or offer false
reassurance'.
There is better technology in home pregnancy and ovulation kits. These work
by measuring variations in hormone levels in a woman's urine. The Family
Planning Association says that today's pregnancy tests are 'very accurate'.
It warned, however, that confirmation of ovulation does not mean that a
couple can have children.
The woman's egg might fail to implant, for example, or the man might be
infertile. There is not, as yet, a home fertility kit for men.
For those worried they might have been infected with HIV, home HIV testing
kits are on the market. However, the Terence Higgins Trust, the Aids
charity, says they are unreliable, inappropriate and illegal in the UK. It
says that anyone who thinks they might harbour the virus should seek
professional advice and the counselling that may follow a positive
diagnosis.
Perhaps a better idea than home kits is a subscription to on-line
computerised medical help. Compuserve has medical discussion groups,
diagnosis forums and drugs databases.
But in response to worries that ordinary folk might use a distant computer
instead of a doctor, it requires subscribers to first acknowledge they have
read a screen saying the information is 'solely for your education and
enrichment'.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Technology: Mystery of the Star of Bethlehem - FT writers
offer words of wisdom on food, drink, nutrition and the legend you're likely

<TEXT>
Lo, the Star, which they had seen in the east, went before them, till it
came and stood over where the young child was.
 - St. Matthew, chapter 2, verse 9.
Comet? Supernova? Conjunction of planets? Myth? Or miracle?
Those, broadly speaking, are the five favourite explanations for the Star of
Bethlehem - an apparition whose identity has attracted much speculation from
astronomers, amateur and professional, over the years.
Of course the atheist who regards the Bible as superstitious nonsense can
dismiss the Star as a figment of the imagination of whoever wrote Matthew's
gospel. At the other extreme, the fundamentalist who regards the Bible as
literal truth can claim the Star simply as a miracle; if so, there is no
point in trying to relate a divine sign to known astronomical events.
However, there are many Christians who would be prepared to believe that God
made use of natural events to give a sign of his Son's coming. And there are
many non-Christians who accept that there could be historical - though not
supernatural - explanations for some stories in the Bible.
So, what natural phenomena could account for the Star of Bethlehem? Anyone
who has seen the planet Venus shining bright in the western sky on a crisp
winter evening may feel that no further explanation is needed.
But Venus could not really be the answer. Nor could any other regular
feature of our night sky.
Surely only a really remarkable portent would have drawn the wise men or
Magi several hundred miles west to Palestine from their presumed homes in
Persia.
If we are looking for a special astronomical event, we need to know its date
as accurately as possible. Our current system of numbering years, supposedly
starting from Christ's birth, was not fixed until the 6th century AD, when
the historical record was far from clear.
Modern Bible scholars believe that the date of the nativity was somewhere
between 8 BC when the Emperor Augustus ordered his great tax census and 4 BC
when King Herod died. They have no clues about the time of year. Three or
four centuries later, people began to celebrate Christmas just after the
winter solstice, to take advantage of existing pagan festivals.
Although no reliable astronomical chronicles survive from the Roman Empire,
we do have such records from ancient China. They provide no clear evidence
that a brilliant new star appeared in the sky between 8 and 4 BC. This seems
to rule out the most obvious explanation for the Star of Bethlehem - a
supernova or gigantic cosmic explosion elsewhere in our galaxy.
However, Chinese observers did describe a bright comet which appeared in the
spring of 5 BC and remained visible well into the summer. A comet with a
vertical tail might fit Matthew's description of a Star that 'stood over'
Bethlehem.
Although some historians have rejected this theory on the grounds that a
comet was usually regarded as an ill omen, others maintain that a comet
could equally well portend good news in the ancient world.
A different line of argument moves away from the Christmas card image of the
Star as something spectacularly bright and beautiful. After all, St. Matthew
tells us that Herod, his chief priests and scribes failed to notice it until
the wise men appeared in Jerusalem.
Perhaps the Magi saw a more subtle astrological sign. This would not have
been obvious to the contemporary Jewish court, which paid little attention
to astrology, but could have been a powerful portent for the wise men, who
were probably Zoroastrian priests from Persia.
The most likely event of this sort occurred in 7 BC - a 'triple conjunction'
of the planets Jupiter and Saturn in the constellation Pisces. The planets
appeared close together in the sky on three occasions during the year, most
dramatically on September 15 when they rose simultaneously above the horizon
at sunset.
David Hughes, an astronomer at Sheffield University, believes that the wise
men took this as the moment of Christ's birth. Jupiter was king of the gods,
Saturn represented justice and Pisces was the sign of the Jews, giving the
event an astrological potency that is hard to imagine today.
Whatever happened, the Star is a romantic addition to the Christmas story,
not an essential part of its message. But for some astronomers it is the
most fascinating mystery in the Bible - all the better because there is
little prospect of anyone ever coming up with a definitive solution.

Christmas eating is seriously misrepresented. Not only is it not bad for
you, but it provides the nearest thing to the perfectly-balanced day's
eating.
When else does one eat dates (loaded with potassium)? Don't we all eat
tangerines (beta-carotine, vitamin C) at Christmas? Is there anybody who
does not get chocolate and nuts (vitamin E, magnesium, potassium) in their
Christmas stocking?
The menu was created by a great nutritionist.
Turkey is a very low-fat meat, which helps maintain a healthy cholesterol
level. It is rich in folic acid - especially important for pregnant women
and elderly people. It contains zinc which contributes to healthy sexual
functioning. And there is evidence it may help psoriasis sufferers,
according to Earl Mindell, author of The Food Medicine Bible. The meat also
contains vitamins B1 and B6 which help digestion, while potassium is good
for the heart.
Poultry liver contains iron and selenium, which help combat free radicals
(which can damage the cells genetic material and lead to cancer). Chestnuts
are rich in starch, an important energy source. Cranberry juice helps to
flush out the bacteria (E. coli) responsible for most urinary infections.
Goose contains a high proportion of oleic fat, which is valuable in
protecting the cardiovascular system. Michel Montignac points out in his
Recipes and Menus for healthy eating that high life expectancy rates in
Gers, France, coincide with a high consumption of duck and goose fat, eaten
mainly in foie gras.
Potatoes, the Cinderella vegetable (or 'dieter's dream', according to
Mindell), are a great source of fibre (for regular bowel movement),
potassium, and vitamins C and B6. Green vegetables are packed with vitamins
and nutrients, but don't overcook them or much will be lost.
Wine contains a high concentration of minerals, trace elements and soluble
fibre to help the digestion. Sherry is said to have aphrodisiac qualities.
Christmas pudding with brandy and cream must be bad for you, but eat it for
the sheer pleasure as happier people live longer, according to Professor
David Warburton, director of the human psychopharmacology group at the
University of Reading.
But if Christmas festivities become too much of a strain 'take time out to
indulge a little and relax', says Warburton, also a member of the Arise
group (Associates for Research into the Science of Enjoyment). He recommends
'guilt-free enjoyment' as a relaxation strategy at a stressful time of year.
'There is clear scientific evidence that spoiling ourselves with, say, a
glass of wine or beer . . . or a few pieces of chocolate and all things
sweet, makes people calmer, more relaxed and generally happier. And medical
evidence shows that happier people live longer, so moderate indulgence can
only be beneficial.'
You need never feel guilty again.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Management: Change for the better - A new role for the
supervisor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The role of the supervisor and the environment in which he or she operates
have been 'transformed' for the better, according to new research published
by Noel Patterson, director of Patterson James, a Surrey-based management
consultancy.
The role now holds a position in the management structure unrecognisable
from that which it held a decade or more ago, claims Patterson, who draws
his optimistic conclusion from research he has recently conducted in three
industries: vehicle manufacture, paper manufacture and chemicals.
However, he warns that a number of issues need to be addressed, including
greater integration of supervisors in the management hierachy. Second,
better promotional opportunities are needed in organisations where
graduate-only entry is becoming the norm at higher levels.
The demise of the supervisor began after the second world war, with the rise
of trade unions and local shop stewards reducing the control, and hence the
authority and status, of the supervisor.
Patterson says: 'It was less than 10 years ago in managing oil distribution
terminals in the Midlands that I witnessed first-hand the organisational and
managerial view of supervision as a buffer between the 'decision-makers',
that is the management, and the 'troops', a highly unionised workforce to be
courted and placated.
'Management believed that good supervision 'kept things going' within the
rulebook. However, when the rules came into conflict with the behaviour of
those supervised, it was usual to abandon the supervisor who had held his
line.'
An erosion of trade union power, says Patterson, was among a number of
changes that transformed the role of the supervisor. Others factors included
the adoption of human resource management methods, which focused on the
empowerment of the individual.
Supervisors' views were canvassed in the preparation of Patterson's research
at three companies. The results showed a gap between what managers perceived
as the job performed by supervisors and the reality on the shopfloor.
Managers, for example, saw the role as a motivational and co-ordinating one,
but in practice it was production and quality targets which dominated
supervisors' jobs.
However, Patterson notes the emergence of a tier immediately below
first-line supervisor level, which could free the supervisory role from the
direct, more mundane tasks of supervision, leaving him or her free to take
on a higher co-ordinating, managerial role. Supervisors, he said, were
floating upwards in organisations where many middle managers had been
removed by delayering.
He warns, however, that as the economy picks up many employers could lose
experienced supervisors who believe there is little opportunity for career
progression. This is because a combination of the slimming down of
organisations plus more graduate-only recruitment at higher levels has
greatly reduced promotional opportunities for a group which at its core
remains generally a white, male enclave.
More attention, he warns, will need to be devoted to furthering supervisors'
activities in communicating with the workforce and the promotion of a
broader understanding of organisations' objectives.
Indicative of this trend is the finding that 'motivational potential' is a
selection criterion that is slowly emerging for supervisors, with both
supervisors and management recognising that 'behavioural training'  - how to
influence people's behaviour rather than their skills - is important.
Patterson warns: 'In practice, it is technical job-related skills which
tended to dominate and cross-functioning training is rare.'
He adds that while the formal picture is optimistic much still needs to be
done to truly consolidate the role of the modern supervisor. 'The agenda is
there to be faced.'

FT  23 DEC 94 / Management: Arrest of the corporate police - Financial
managers need a new outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial managers should stop behaving as corporate policemen whose main
role is to oversee operating managers, according to a report* by Conference
Board Europe, a business membership organisation which researches management
policy and practices.
Instead financial managers should be increasingly prepared to serve and
share control with line managers, says the research, which is based on case
studies, interviews and a survey of 250 North American and European
companies.
'A detached, control-laden finance function does not respond to the new
imperative to execute flexible, worldwide product and customer strategies,'
it says. 'The traditional finance function role as guardian of internal
company resources distances staff from the marketplace.'
Finance staff should offer value-added services to line managers, by
participating in operating business meetings and helping line managers with
competitive analysis, it argues.
Finance specialists' own perception of their role often differs from that of
other employees. 'Although a majority of finance managers believe that they
already have a business-advocate mindset, the majority of non-finance
managers express the opinion that finance personnel behave like corporate
policemen,' the report says.
The attempt to change the role of the finance department is often
accompanied by a drive to reduce its cost, a measure that was viewed as a
top priority by a third of the respondents to the survey.
The cost of the finance function is particularly high in US firms, which
employ three times as many finance people as Japanese firms, the report
says. The explanation partly lies with the existence in US firms of
elaborate accounting control systems - separate from operating systems -
with large staffs that monitor line managers' performance.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Management: No more jobs please - William Bridges believes
current work patterns are going out of date
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first thing you need to know about William Bridges is that he is
forecasting the end of the job as we know it. The second is that he earns
money telling us what he means by this. He seems to have his work cut out.
His message is simple - the job as a way of compartmentalising work is going
to disappear. To those who ask whether this is really going to happen, he
replies that it already is. Pursuing the concept of 'job creation' is a
waste of time and effort, he argues. He has predicted that by 2020, 'our job
chase will look like fighting over the deck chairs on the Titanic'.
How and why the job is disappearing - and the consequences - are the
practical and social questions that are challenging governments, companies,
managers and employees to establish new ways of organising work, says
Bridges, whose latest book, Jobshift, will be published in the UK in March.
He ended his own job - his conventional one - about 20 years ago. He was a
professor of American literature in California, aged 40. Mid-life crisis or
simply a yearning to do something different drove him to search for
something new.
'In my parents' generation people would hold on to what they were doing for
the next 20 years. They weren't very happy but they held on for security,'
he says. Giving up a regular job forced some self-examination of Bridges'
abilities. 'I was faced with a dilemma: what do I want to do? I want to stop
teaching. What do I know how to do? Teach. That's a vicious circle in which
you can run around for a long time.
'The only way around that is to find all the factors that have gone into the
success of what you have done before and then reassemble or recycle them
into some new undertaking. I became very interested in why it was hard to
make a career change, so I started teaching a seminar at a local college
called 'being in transition'.' The thinking and teaching developed into a
book - Transitions, Making Sense of Life's Changes, published in 1980.
Fourteen years on it has sold 250,000 copies and is into its 29th print run.
His ideas attracted the interest of companies, many of which in the early
1980s were merging, restructuring or acquiring new businesses. Managements
were recognising that many of their staff were therefore undergoing a period
of transition themselves. Bridges began to receive requests to go into
companies and run seminars for managers learning to manage transition.
It was his experiences in some of these companies, particularly electronics
and computer organisations, that inspired some of his latest theories about
the limitations of the job. 'Many of the people in these companies did not
have anything like what I would call a job. They were on a payroll and had a
series of assignments, reporting to different people for different
projects,' he says. He also saw companies using temporary staff and
contracting out some of their functions to other companies or individuals.
'I decided there was an economic movement going on that people were not
talking about,' he says.
Bridges noticed that in areas of a quickly changing economy the traditional
job had been transformed from something that proved the best way to get
things done to an inefficient way of accomplishing work. Wherever the job
dominated people's thinking, they were not working on what needed to be
done, and developed the response 'that isn't my job'.
He began to see the job as a 'historical artefact' well adjusted to the
forms of production that developed in the 18th and 19th centuries. Until
about 1800, says Bridges, 'people did jobs but didn't have jobs'.
He goes back to the derivation of the word 'job'. Before the industrial
revolution, he says, its primary meaning was that of a task. The carriage
driver's job was a particular hiring to take someone from one place to
another, not the carriage driving itself.
Suppose he is right about the death of the job. How do we confront this
social revolution? People, he says, will need four 'qualifications' for
work. Formal attributes and previous experience are not among them. He
identifies them as:
Desire: that you really want to do the work.
Ability: that you are good at what the work requires.
Temperament: you are emotionally suited to the work.
Assets: individual advantages or resources, such as languages or personal
equity, that the work may require.
Organisations, he says, are beginning to recruit people on the basis of
Data, the acronym he adopts to describe these attributes.
New recruitment methods are being developed. For example, if a company wants
to test candidates for a customer service job, it is possible to simulate a
situation where a customer screams at the candidate for some imagined
slight. The way people handle such problems is more revealing than years of
experience or impressive CVs, says Bridges.
One of the most basic changes in this post-job society, he believes, will be
to the role of the manager. Most middle managers will go, but what about at
the top?
At Ideo, the US's largest industrial design company, in Palo Alto,
California, no one has a title or a boss. People are recruited for 'the
right fit'. Hierarchies, Bridges observes, are disappearing in those
companies that have pioneered the use of project teams. If we are seeing the
end of the job as we know it, could we be also approaching the end of the
boss? Bridges is still mulling that one over.
Today, says Bridges, we are returning to self-management, but not in the old
way where you took care of your job while you followed the leader. The new
self-management is to approach the business as if you had an ownership stake
in it. One of the challenges facing de-jobbed workers will be pacing
themselves - a familiar problem of the self-employed.
The end of the job has proved quite timely for Bridges who at 61 is close to
the age when someone in a conventional job would be retiring. He says:
'Should companies be able to force out people no longer doing adequate work?
Yes. Do I want anyone to press a retirement age on me? No, I certainly
don't. So it's a dilemma, a paradox.' He adds: 'One of the reasons I like
working for myself is that nobody is going to retire me.'

FT  23 DEC 94 / Controversy fails to curb the power of wind and waste: The
latest contest for renewable energy subsidies has revived arguments over
their cost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wind power and other renewable sources generate only a fraction of the
electricity needs of England and Wales, but few aspects of environmental
policy power such controversy.
This week's announcement of funding for the third round of the Non Fossil
Fuel Obligation (NFFO) - the subsidy for renewables paid for by a levy on
electricity bills - is no exception.
The arguments this time have been more strident than in the past, partly
because the contracts are much bigger than in previous rounds.
The government approved more than 500 bids to generate almost 630MW in
England and Wales. In Scotland, bids for almost 80MW passed muster - twice
the government's original estimate.
Local planning objections, financial difficulties and - in the case of waste
power - problems with supplies are likely to put paid to some schemes. The
government estimates the latest round will add 300MW to 400MW of capacity in
England and Wales. It will roughly double the 340MW currently generated from
renewables - about 1.5 per cent of electricity needs.
The new contracts have brought a further fall in costs. The highest price
for wind-generated electricity dropped to 4.8p per kWh from a peak of 11p.
The average prices for electricity from landfill gas (3.76p/kWh), municipal
and industrial waste (3.84p) and wind (4.32p) remain well above the average
price of 2.5p/kWh for electricity sold to the wholesale electricity 'pool'
by PowerGen and National Power.
But the gap has closed steadily for various reasons. Technology has advanced
across the board and renewables have also gained operating experience,
bringing productivity improvements. Also, lenders' growing confidence in the
industry has triggered a fall in the risk premium operators pay for finance.
Longer payback periods have also helped. Bidders in the third round of NFFO
have been able to base their calculations on a 19-year period for subsidies
 -more than twice as long as in previous rounds.
In spite of controversy, wind and waste projects have been the main
beneficiaries this time. In England and Wales the government approved 55
wind schemes totalling almost 166MW and 20 gas projects entailing 242MW.
Supporters of both technologies had feared they would suffer from negative
publicity. Wind schemes have been criticised as being 'blots on the
landscape' and some successful bidders may yet stumble at the local planning
stage.
Country Guardian, a pressure group, has questioned the economic feasibility
of the latest wind power bids. Others have asked whether the lower prices
include allowances for dismantling wind farms which prove to be uneconomic.
Waste-fuelled generators have suffered from accusations that incineration
leads to emissions of toxic gas and that recycling is preferable to
combustion.
More innovative schemes to generate power from crops and forestry were the
main losers, although three agricultural schemes were passed, in spite of
costs about double that of electricity from other renewables. The Department
of Trade and Industry, which runs the NFFO, said it had tried to stimulate
diversity in awarding contracts.
The wrangling illustrates the difficulties facing the DTI in trying to
promote renewable energy sources while they remain more expensive than
conventionally generated electricity.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, had urged the
government to concentrate on landfill gas, waste combustion and wind,
requiring a total subsidy of Pounds 400m over 15 to 20 years. That would be
the most economic way, he argued, of meeting the government's target of
replacing 1,500MW of electricity generated by traditional methods by the
year 2000.
More exotic renewables, such as wave and geothermal power have already been
discarded as their costs are too high. Yet the DTI says it retains a
watching brief on technologies which have so far been excluded, in spite of
Prof Littlechild's arguments.
The DTI said: 'We want to get new technologies on a learning curve.' Any
scheme will be considered if it appears feasible and economically
competitive. Likewise, relatively costly projects, such as energy crops,
could be left out in future if they do not show signs of converging with
cheaper renewables.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Insurance group settles dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aegon Financial Services Group, the UK subsidiary of Dutch insurance group
Aegon, yesterday settled one element of a bitter legal dispute with a former
manager after a High Court bailiff arrived at the company's head office to
begin confiscating goods.
The bailiff had been instructed by Mr John Gaulton after a court ruling last
Friday.
The legal tussle is one of several hundred involving insurance groups and
former sales agents that are disputing cash thought to total tens of
millions of pounds. The sums mostly cover claims for lost earnings, or debts
the companies say the former agents owe.
Aegon Financial Services yesterday sent Pounds 23,638 to Bevans, the
solicitors acting for Mr Gaulton. The cash was paid a few hours after the
bailiff had entered the company's London headquarters, and before he started
seizing goods.
On Wednesday Bevans applied for a winding-up order against the company in an
effort to force it to settle. Aegon said yesterday the matter had been
resolved. It did not wish to comment further.
Yesterday's actions came after a judgment by the Bristol commercial court
last week that Aegon should pay more than Pounds 20,000 to a trust set up by
Mr Gaulton to finance his children's education.
Mr Gaulton was dismissed from Aegon in February. After this he tried to cash
in an insurance policy taken out with Aegon and held in the trust's name.
Aegon refused to pay, arguing that the cash ought to be used to pay back
some of the Pounds 36,000 it claims Mr Gaulton owes as a result of a loan.
The arguments over the Pounds 36,000 continue in separate High Court
proceedings.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Rules tightened on financial controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Listed companies will have to make a statement in their accounts next year
describing their internal financial controls or face censure by the Stock
Exchange.
The new rules were published yesterday by a working group on internal
control convened at the request of the Cadbury committee on the financial
aspects of corporate governance.
Mr Paul Rutteman, chairman of the group, which includes representatives of
the Hundred Group of Finance Directors, said: 'The focus on the
effectiveness of a company's system of internal control will add to
shareholder confidence in UK listed companies.'
The Cadbury committee, which issued its report at the end of 1992, advised
companies to provide a statement of internal controls in their accounts,
which led to the creation of the working party.
Companies are not forced to comply, but any quoted business that does not
must note in its accounts that it fails to meet this requirement of the
Cadbury code on pain of reprimand from the Stock Exchange.
Failures in internal financial controls have been identified as the key
element in several corporate failures in recent years.
Effective internal controls include regular training in financial
instruments, authorisation limits, segregation of duties and the production
of accurate and regular business statistics.
The guidance requires that directors.
State that they are responsible for internal financial controls.
Explain that such a system is no guarantee against loss or misstatement.
Describe the key procedures of financial control in the company.
Confirm that they have reviewed the effectiveness of the controls.
Comment where weaknesses in systems have resulted in 'material losses,
contingencies or uncertainties' which require disclosure.
The guidance comes into force from January 1, although there are
transitional arrangements which will allow some companies to report on
systems in place after July 1.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Government decision threatens UK energy chances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's decision to back only three small projects producing
electricity from crops has jeopardised Britain's chances of becoming the
European Union leader in this emerging technology, claim supporters of the
industry, Alison Maitland writes.
Fast-growing willow and poplar trees, harvested for burning in power plants,
could provide 20 per cent of Britain's electricity needs by 2025, according
to the most optimistic projections.
Farmers' leaders see short rotation coppice as a promising source of
alternative income as food production is cut. However, the government
announced funding for coppice power plants with a capacity of only 19MW in
its latest round of subsidies for renewable energy. Two of the three
approved bids are believed to have been from South Western Electricity and
the third by Yorkshire Water.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Pools operators in plea on lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Football pools operators are renewing their campaign to persuade the
government to do something about their disadvantages compared with the
National Lottery.
The pools have lost a significant slice of their revenue to the lottery and
some executives fear that the viability of the industry, which employs
45,000 full-time and more than 80,000 part-time workers, could be undermined
in the long term.
It is thought that the lottery has already led to a reduction of about 12.5
per cent in the weekly takings of Vernons, the pools subsidiary of Ladbroke.
Littlewoods, which accounts for nearly 80 per cent of the pools market, says
it has been hit by the lottery but Mr Tony Hodge, marketing manager, said
the effect had been 'relatively minimal'. Its revenue drop is almost
certainly less than 9 per cent.
The main concern of the pools companies is the higher percentage of income
they pay to the government and good causes. The lottery pays 12 per cent tax
and gives a further 28 per cent to good causes. The pools are taxed at 37.5
per cent and pay a further 5 per cent plus a voluntary 5p in every 105p to
sport and the arts.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Belfast shoppers reap the peace dividend: John Murray Brown
finds consumers bullish as the city's retailers enjoy their best ever
Christmas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Belfast's retailers are having their best ever Christmas as consumer
confidence returns in the first December free of the threat of terrorism for
25 years.
Scores of buses are lined up along Adelaide Street in the city centre, many
from the Republic of Ireland. Until recently, a parked car was likely to be
demobilised by the bomb squad.
Mr Chris Newton, manager of the BHS store in Belfast, said: 'We've had our
best ever day, our best ever weekend, and this week looks like being our
best ever Christmas.' Mr Frank Caddy, head of the Belfast Chamber of Trade
and Commerce, explained: 'There is no more money around. It's just more
stable.'
The chamber says takings in Belfast city centre in the first eight months of
1994 were 4 per cent down on the same period last year.
This has been transformed since the IRA's ceasefire on August 31. September
sales were up 2 per cent, October's 8 per cent, and November's 13 per cent.
Mr Caddy believes December's takings could increase about 10 per cent over
1993, itself a record year.
He also estimates that sales volumes will increase by about Pounds 30m to a
total of Pounds 400m for the Christmas period.
Mr Stephen Brown, professor of retailing at the University of Ulster, said
Belfast had suffered from poor accessibility in the past. Because of the
frequent bomb alerts, people were reluctant to shop in the city centre. As
well as fear of personal injury, there was the inconvenience of finding the
city centre sealed off, leaving cars marooned overnight.
One factor is the shoppers from the republic. Mr Newton said: 'We're taking
so many transactions from Irish customers, we're now taking the punts (Irish
pounds) through our tills and personal Irish cheques, on a pound-for-pound
basis. Normally it would be dealt with by our customer services people.'
For southerners, it was once a regular event to shop in the North,
particularly for wines and spirits - differences in value added tax being
the main attraction. And this year wine is still one of the main items, with
Marks and Spencer reporting a 400 per cent increase in sales. The city
centre is also attracting shoppers from distant parts of the province and a
hovercraft service from Stranraer is pulling in people from Scotland.
Mr Newton said that some people were shopping in the city centre for the
first time in 10 years. 'We're getting people . . . asking where our food
hall is. Well we haven't had a food hall for 10 years. The area they're
remembering is now occupied by Mothercare.'
Mr Caddy said: 'The most exciting thing for us is we have a level playing
field with the other UK regions. We can start to project Belfast as it is
rather than how it's perceived to be.'
Northern Ireland's retail sector has always outperformed the rest of the UK.
The M&amp;S Sprucefield megastore has been the group's best performing operation
for years.
Latest figures on the Northern Ireland economy are encouraging. Unemployment
is down 1 per cent on a year ago, job vacancies are up and house prices are
rising faster than the UK average. Of those in work, 30 per cent work for
the state, either the civil service or the security services. Rents are
appreciably lower than in the rest of the UK, resulting in greater
disposable income.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Hurd may have to retreat on dam aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government could be forced to return some Pounds 24m already spent on
Malaysia's Pergau dam to the Overseas Development Administration, in spite
of a recent statement that 'the books for previous years are closed'.
The World Development Movement, which recently secured a High Court ruling
that payments for Pergau were illegal, said yesterday that it would take up
the case again if money spent on the dam in previous years was not returned
to the aid budget.
In a recent statement, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, told the
Commons that funds which were due to be paid to the Malaysian government
this year and next would come out of the Treasury reserves, and that the ODA
could retain existing funds for other projects.
But, according to WDM, Mr Hurd is also obliged by the court judgment to
reimburse the aid budget with money spent on the Pergau project in previous
years.
As evidence for this, the organisation cites the High Court ruling that 'the
secretary of state would take such steps as were necessary to give effect to
the judgment of the court'.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Dublin allows release of nine IRA prisoners
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government of the Irish republic last night approved the release from
prison of nine IRA members.
Ms Nora Owen, the justice minister, confirmed the release of the nine -
which had been due last month but was cancelled after the shooting of a
postal worker in Newry, County Down, during a robbery on a sorting office.
Ms Owen, who also announced seven days' seasonal parole for 30 other IRA
members, described the release as a significant gesture and a sign that the
Irish government was moving to consolidate the peace process.
But the move provoked fury among unionists. Mr David Trimble, Ulster
Unionist MP for Upper Bann, said: 'This is political interference in the
legal system to achieve short-term political gain. It is something that
happens in a banana republic, not a civilised country.'
Meanwhile, security sources in Northern Ireland said they believed a bomb
found in Enniskillen last Sunday was made by the IRA - and may have been
planted as a way of keeping up pressure on the government.
The IRA leadership earlier this week denied that any of its units were
responsible for planting the bomb, which was defused. But there are
suspicions that the organisation has within it an element which is becoming
increasingly impatient with the ceasefire.
The prisoners include two men serving life sentences for murder, Mr Aaron
O'Connell (35) and Mr Eamonn Nolan. The other seven men are serving between
three and nine years and are all due out of prison within the next 12
months.
They are Mr Owen Gallagher (44), serving four years for arms possession, Mr
Gerard Hamilton (34), serving seven years, Mr John Hartnett (36), serving
three years for arms possession, Mr Gerard Burns (38), serving six years for
arms possession, Mr Richard Comerford, serving three years for arms
possession, Mr Patrick Griffin (54), serving nine years for armed robbery
and Mr Patrick Daly (49), serving four years for arms possession.
Mr Thomas McMahon who was convicted for the murder of Lord Mountbatten in
1979 is not among the nine - but he is one of the 30 prisoners convicted for
terrorist-type activities that have been granted short periods of Christmas
parole.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Cheap exports infuriate dairies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Milk Marque, the farmers' dairy co-operative, sold cut-price milk to Ireland
last week after causing a furore in November when it raised prices in
England and Wales by as much as 20 per cent.
The exports have caused an outcry in the dairy industry where higher prices
forced some companies to close processing plants. Dairies are angry that
surplus milk has been made available to Irish cheesemakers at about 3p per
litre below the cost of supply on the daily UK wholesale market.
'It is infuriating for companies which are locked into high-priced annual
contracts. British consumers are clearly being ripped off by this abuse of
monopoly power,' said Mr Neil Davidson, president of the Dairy Industry
Federation.
Dairies and supermarkets raised consumer prices for milk by between 1p and
2p per pint in response to higher wholesale prices when the Pounds 3.3bn
market was deregulated in November.
Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive of Milk Marque, said the export sales were
required to cope with an emergency breakdown of Unigate's large processing
plant at Chard, Somerset, and the annual shutdown of several other plants.
The current milk surplus is unusual and is partly caused by the mild weather
which encourages cows to produce more milk - farmers are producing 2.6 per
cent more than their quotas - and partly by farmers' attempts to cash in on
high prices.
Mr Dare said supply and demand in the run-up to Christmas were always
difficult to forecast.
Milk Marque's sales system forced dairy companies to bid for yearly supplies
at a range of prices. Some companies' bids were scaled back in November
because of a shortage of supply at that time.
Milk Marque has also put a reserve price on the spot market for daily
wholesale sales to stop prices falling below 22p per litre. Sales to Ireland
are understood to have been at 19p per litre.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Pools renew call to change lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Football pools operators are renewing their campaign to persuade the
government to do something about their disadvantages compared with the
National Lottery.
The pools have lost a significant slice of their revenue to the lottery and
some executives fear that the viability of their industry, which employs
45,000 full-time and more than 80,000 part-time workers, could be undermined
in the long term.
National Lottery sales are going particularly well in the run up to
Christmas and yesterday Camelot, the lottery operator, revised its estimate
of the Christmas Eve jackpot to Pounds 8m from Pounds 6m.
The lottery, it is believed, has already led to a reduction of about 12.5
per cent in the weekly takings of Vernons, the pools subsidiary of Ladbroke.
Littlewoods, which accounts for nearly 80 per cent of the pools market,
concedes that it has been hit by the lottery but Mr Tony Hodge, marketing
manager, said the effect had been 'relatively minimal'. He would not give a
percentage but Littlewoods' revenue drop is almost certainly less than 9 per
cent.
The main concern of the pools companies is the higher percentage of income
they must pay to the government and good causes.
The lottery pays 12 per cent tax and gives a further 28 per cent to good
causes. The pools are taxed at 37.5 per cent and pay a further 5 per cent
plus 5p in every 105p to good causes - sport and the arts.
The last 5p for the Foundation for Sport and the Arts is 'voluntary' and
Vernons says it will consider giving notice to terminate the payment if the
revenue trends worsen.
Vernons, with less than 20 per cent of the market, would also like to see a
fiscally neutral tax banding system introduced to help smaller pools
companies.
Littlewoods also wants the right to advertise on television. Although it is
concerned by long-term damage to its business, it is not at the moment
thinking of ending the 5p payment to the Foundation for Sports and the Arts.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Mercury reduces overseas tariff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury Communications, the UK's second largest public telecommunications
operator, yesterday made large cuts in international call prices for its
largest users in reaction to intensifying competition.
It said daytime telephone calls to north America would come down 55 per
cent, to 20p from 44p a minute, for customers spending Pounds 35,000 or more
a month. To major European destinations, the price will also be 20p a minute
compared with 26p while calls to Hong Kong will be 55p a minute compared
with the standard Mercury business rate of 78p.
The moves reflect Mercury's need to improve its competitiveness over
long-haul routes. Analysts said that Mercury's international prices were
slightly cheaper than British Telecommunications, the largest operator,
before yesterday's cuts, but that both were being undercut significantly by
UK competitors such as Colt and US operators including Sprint.
Mercury's profits slipped in the first half of the year, forcing a
reorganisation, redundancies and abandoned services. Mr Duncan Lewis,
newly-appointed chief executive, said the cuts were an example of Mercury's
new approach to customers.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Watchdog sees bright future for building societies: The
regulator is looking forward to his new job despite an early shock from
Halifax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No sooner had Mr Geoffrey Fitchew moved into his office as head of the
Building Societies Commission than two of the largest societies announced
plans to move out of the sector.
It was nothing personal. But it was a sign of the widespread changes in the
personal financial services industry which will dominate Mr Fitchew's time
as head of the independent statutory regulator for societies.
Societies have long been a stable financial presence in the high street,
apparently generating more affection than the main clearing banks.
But while smaller, local societies still have many traditional
characteristics, the last remnants of cosiness have gone from the largest
and most diversified.
The announcement late last month by Halifax Building Society, the UK's
largest mortgage lender, of plans to merge with Leeds Permanent and then to
convert to a public limited company with a full banking licence sent a shock
wave through the sector. It had been galvanised in April by the impending
departure of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society to become part of the
Lloyds Bank group.
So in applying to be head of the commission, Mr Fitchew had to consider how
long there would be a sector to regulate.
'Needless to say, I didn't expect to be confronted with the specific Halifax
and Leeds development in my first week in the office,' he said. 'But when I
applied I took the view, and still hold the view, that the building
societies' sector has a healthy future ahead of it.'
The vast majority of the 80-plus societies did not want to become plcs, he
said. 'It was a psychological shock to the system, but people get over
psychological shocks.'
The shock of the Halifax move is not the only significant shift in the
sector.
Early this year, the Treasury began a two-stage review of what powers
building societies should have, and how they should be accountable to their
customers. As mutual organisations, they are owned by their 33m or so
borrowers and investors rather than by institutions.
All the signs - including a report this week from the cross-party Treasury
committee of MPs - are that societies will be allowed greater freedoms, but
that they will also have to pay more attention to customers' rights as
owners of the business.
Before the review is published Mr Fitchew can say little about it, but he
believes there are limits to the guilt that societies should feel about
being unaccountable compared with plcs.
'A member of a society is not putting in risk capital and so it is not the
same as being a shareholder in a plc,' he said. People who were unhappy with
the way a society was behaving could simply move their accounts or
mortgages.
He is also clear that what matters is that customers are given more
information about exercising membership rights, rather than being forced to
take them up.
'It's up to members of the society to decide how active they want to be. In
that sense it is no different from any kind of voluntary association such as
an angling club or a golf club,' he said.
'Frankly, the ordinary building society customer has a lot of other things
to do with his or her time.'
Whatever the other challenges Mr Fitchew faces as head of the commission,
maintaining the organisation's close links with the Treasury is unlikely to
be one of them, as that is where he has spent most of his 30-year civil
service career.
His other postings have been mainly in Brussels. Most recently he ran the
financial services department of the European Commission, where he was
responsible for seeing through the banking, insurance and securities market
legislation for the single market.
Returning to the UK last year, he became head of the European secretariat at
the cabinet office.
From there, he took the view that heading the Building Societies Commission
would combine his specialism in financial services with the prospect of
running his own show, as he had done in Brussels.
'I was attracted by coming to be in charge of an independent operation of
this kind,' he said. 'While in the European Commission I became used to
being the person up-front in an organisation.'
Further back in his career, however, there are aspects he must hope do not
resonate with his new post.
As a young high-flier in the late 1960s, he was private secretary to Mr Dick
Taverne, then a Treasury minister whose main task was ensuring the
parliamentary passage of the decimalisation bill.
Mr Fitchew recalls how popular warmth towards the sixpence led to its being
kept for a limited period, even though it swiftly became irrelevant in the
new coinage.
The coin, he said, 'was retained in the system for a time but in practice
rapidly went out of circulation because of the way shop assistants give
change. Nature took its course, and they all ended up at the banks.'
One of the tests on which he will be judged in his new post will be whether
a similar fate awaits building societies.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Recovery is export-led says CSO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK economy's increased overall output in the third quarter reflected
strong net growth in the export of goods and services, but domestic
expenditure on these items was unchanged, according to figures from the
Central Statistical Office.
The CSO yesterday revised downwards slightly its estimates of third quarter
gross domestic product growth to a seasonally adjusted 0.8 per cent compared
with the second quarter, from 0.9 per cent published last month.
Growth in the year to the third quarter was put at 4.1 per cent compared
with 4.2 per cent previously.
The CSO's analysis of the GDP figures showed how Britain's recovery has
become export-led. Total domestic expenditure was flat between the second
and third quarters and up 2.5 per cent in the year to the end of September.
The improvement in Britain's trade performance was equivalent to the 0.8 per
cent third quarter rise in GDP and contributed 1.6 percentage points of
growth in the year to end-September.
Separate third quarter balance of payments figures revealed a sharp
improvement in UK invisible trade, due to higher surpluses from trade in
services and investment income.
Within the domestic expenditure totals, consumers' expenditure increased by
0.5 per cent between the second and third quarter and was up 2.2 per cent
over the year. Overall investment (gross domestic fixed capital formation)
fell by 0.6 per cent largely because of reduced investment in dwellings, but
was up 2.2 per cent over the year. Manufacturing investment rose 0.3 per
cent in the third quarter and was 1.9 per cent higher than in the third
quarter of 1993.
The CSO's national figures showed that total real personal disposable income
increased by 1.5 per cent between the second and third quarters and was 1.5
per cent higher than in the third quarter of last year.
Because total income increased at a faster rate than consumer spending, the
amount of personal savings in the economy rose. The savings ratio, which
expresses total personal saving as a percentage of total personal disposable
income, increased to 10.5 per cent in the third quarter from 9.6 per cent in
the second quarter and 10.7 per cent in the first quarter of this year.
CSO statisticians warned, however, that this reversal of a downward trend in
the savings ratio did not automatically signify increased caution among
consumers. The growth in disposable income in the quarter largely reflected
a big increase in dividend payments.
The national accounts statistics pointed to continued health of the
corporate sector. Gross trading profits of industrial and commercial
companies, after deduction of stock appreciation, rose 2.2 per cent in the
third quarter and were 14 per cent up on the year before. These companies
ended the quarter with a financial surplus of Pounds 2.7bn, up from Pounds
1.95bn in the second quarter.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Ministers back reform of EU cash transfers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has given broad support for a European Commission plan to
make it cheaper and quicker for small businesses to transfer money across
borders.
The proposed legislation has been vigorously opposed by European banking
organisations, which argue that legislation could disrupt efforts by larger
banks to improve transfer arrangements and mean that smaller banks would no
longer offer transfer services.
Apacs, the UK organisation which represents payment clearing services, said
yesterday that it would now try to ensure that the commission's directive
would be flexible enough not to inhibit competition.
Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury minister, said that while British banks
generally did well compared with other European banking sectors in terms of
providing transfer services in good time, they were ranked much lower in
terms of expense.
He said: 'We need higher standards and much more observance of standards.
The average time taken to transfer a payment - which a study for the
commission showed had increased to 4.8 days in 1994 - is wholly
unsatisfactory in the single market.'
The French government has indicated that pursuing the proposals would be a
priority for its presidency, although the UK government believes that the
target of reaching a common position on the proposals by April is 'very
optimistic'.
The measures put forward by the commission would ban double-charging - where
banks charge customers for receiving cash as well as for sending it.
It would mean that banks would have to refund the charge where the transfer
was not completed, unless another organisation accepted responsibility.
They would also have to ensure that money should be credited to the
recipient's account within six working days, unless the customer and
originating bank agreed it could take longer.
The government will be looking in detail at elements which include the
proposals for refunds if the transfer is not completed; that interest should
be paid if a transfer is completed late; and that administrative charges
should be limited to those that would apply in a domestic credit transfer.
Apacs expressed some concern that the draft directive appeared to apply to
high-value as well as to low-value payments. The original intention had been
to limit the plans to transfers of under Ecu10,000 (Pounds 7,894).

FT  23 DEC 94 / Scots economy reported to be slipping back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish economy, which outperformed all other UK regions during the
recession, has begun to slip back in the recovery, according to Scotland's
main economic research organisation.
The Fraser of Allander Institute at Strathclyde University says that
although Scottish manufacturing output has risen faster than that of the UK
as a whole since 1992, this is almost entirely due to rapid expansion by the
electronics sector.
Without the electronics sector manufacturing output would have declined.
'The recovery in Scottish manufacturing is much more narrowly based than
manufacturing in the UK,' the institute says.
Its latest quarterly bulletin points out that official statistics for output
by the production and construction industries in the second quarter of 1994
(the latest avail-able) show a fall of 1.1 per cent in Scotland compared
with a rise of 1.8 per cent in the UK.
In the year to the second quarter of 1994, output in production and
construction grew by 3.3 per cent against 3.4 per cent in the UK.
Over the two years from the second quarter of 1992 production in Scotland
grew by 6 per cent compared with 8.1 per cent for the UK.
Manufacturing output in Scotland grew by 7.5 per cent over the two years,
outpacing the UK's 5.1 per cent. However Scotland's advantage was almost
entirely due to a rise of 64.2 per cent in the electrical and instrument
engineering (electronics) sector, compared with a rise of 19.4 per cent in
the UK.
Only two other industrial sectors in Scotland - oil processing and chemicals
and fibres - showed growth in the two-year period, while mechanical
engineering, and metals and metal goods showed sharp declines.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Guinness aims to raise spirits at Christmas: The strategies
directed at boosting whisky sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The advertisements for Bell's eight-year-old Scotch whisky, launched this
summer to replace the original, five-year-old blend, proclaim: 'It's
challenging stuff.'
On the face of it, the challenge that Bell's owner Guinness is making to
drinkers is to try a smoother, older blend of the UK's biggest-selling
brand.
But it is also a three-pronged challenge for Guinness itself: to build up
the value of the brand by offering a better product at the same price, to
convert consumers from the original blend, and to win people over from other
spirits.
The strategy is designed to stop the downward spiral of sales volume and
value in the whisky market. Whisky suffered badly in the recession. From
1988, UK sales volume fell some 25 per cent, with brands suffering even more
as drinkers sought economy in own-label whisky. The fastest growing brands
continue to be 'the cheapest on display'. The very cheapest retail for about
Pounds 7.99 a bottle of which some Pounds 7 goes to the exchequer in tax and
excise duties.
'Selling less whisky at lower prices was a very, very dangerous trend for us
and the whisky industry,' maintains Mr Anthony Greener, Guinness' chairman.
Introducing the improved Bell's was designed to encourage consumers back
upmarket. Also, Guinness wanted to hold whisky prices, particularly in the
face of strong seasonal pressure. Retailers are demanding good Christmas
deals and some competitors are pricing aggressively.
Guinness is running a calculated risk. If its prices get out of step with
its competitors - notably Famous Grouse from Highland Distilleries and
Teacher's from Allied-Domecq, the second and third largest brands - it might
lose some of the one-bottle-a-year buyers it needs to convert to the new
blend.
Under the pressure of Christmas competition, Guinness has had to give more
ground than it hoped. As the season opened, a typical supermarket or
off-licence price for Grouse was Pounds 11.99 a bottle (less in Scotland),
Pounds 11.79 for Bell's and Pounds 11.29 for Teacher's. Guinness considered
Bell's 20p discount to Grouse and 50p premium to Teacher's as the
traditional positioning of its brand in terms of quality and value.
Grouse dropped to Pounds 11.49 and held, Bell's dropped to Pounds 11.29 then
to Pounds 10.99, while Teacher's dropped to Pounds 10.99, then Pounds 10.79
plus a 'multibuy' discount of Pounds 3 off a pair of bottles.
This has distorted brand differentials and undercut Guinness' pricing
strategy. With a tense two days until Christmas and scope for a last-minute
cut by one brand which the others might have to follow, Guinness is still
not home and dry.
November and December account for 25 per cent of annual UK whisky sales and
whisky accounts for about half of all spirits sold over the Christmas
season.
One helpful trend for the three top whisky brands is that their collective
market share typically rises by about 5 percentage points at this time of
year.
Highland is defending Grouse's position as the most expensive mainstream
blended whisky. 'It is a premium brand at a premium price,' said Mr Brian
Ivory, managing director. 'But that's a relative statement. There are always
some discussions with retailers which we hope will be resolved in a
satisfactory way.'
The group raised marketing expenditure by 15 per cent in the current half
year but has shunned multibuys which, said Mr Ivory, 'increase volumes but
inevitably erode the price position of the brand'.
Guinness launched the new Bell's with a 50 per cent increase in the annual
spending on marketing to Pounds 15m. It said it would avoid multibuys but
succumbed as the Christmas season got under way - there are limited supplies
of paired bottles with Pounds 2 off.
It says it is spending to build up the value of the Bell's brand. It is
critical of other distillers - notably Allied-Domecq, which increased its
marketing budget for Teacher's to Pounds 16m - for spending money on
cut-price promotions.
Keeping Christmas strategies intact is hard when retailers start turning the
screws. Kwik Save, for example, has knocked the price of Grouse down to
match Bell's at Pounds 10.95. Where a retailer breaks ranks, the cut
probably comes out of the distiller's margins rather than the retailer's.
But for all the price anguish, this Christmas looks a good one in volume
terms. Building on a gentle turnround that began a year ago, distillers
could end 1994 with volume growth of between 1 per cent and 2 per cent, its
first upturn in five years. Better still, exports are up 5 per cent.
The new Bell's 'has stimulated the whole market', said Mr Richard
Maude-Roxby, trading director of Booker Belmont Wholesale, the UK's largest
independent drinks distributor.
The new year brings a new challenge for Guninness - to push prices back to
pre-Christmas levels and add 26p from the chancellor's mini-Budget. This
would mean a 10 per cent price rise from Bell's Christmas low.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Rules for workplace insurance relaxed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A temporary relaxation of the law on compulsory insurance for workplace
deaths and injuries was announced by the government yesterday, pending a
comprehensive review of the 25-year-old legislation.
The move follows a decision by insurance companies to impose policy changes
that threatened to leave many large companies without legally required
cover.
Mr Phillip Oppenheim, employment minister, ordered the review of the 1969
Employers' Liability Act after admitting that large corporate groups would
have found it impossible to meet a requirement that each subsidiary should
have at least Pounds 2m of cover.
Worries about the escalating cost of injuries and disease have led to
insurance companies imposing a basic claims limit of Pounds 10m on policies
renewed from January 1. Such policies previously offered unlimited cover.
Even where companies have only a few subsidiaries it is not clear Pounds 2m
would have been available for each in all circumstances - as required by law
 -under the policy terms proposed by insurers.
Under the temporary rules, a holding company with subsidiaries will now be
treated as if it was a single company.
Mr Oppenheim said that, longer-term, he wanted the legislation amended to
provide an 'acceptable level' of protection consistent with the cover the
insurance market was able to deliver. He also wanted to avoid employers
having to take out unnecessarily expensive policies.
Employment department officials said that most companies comfortably
exceeded the Pounds 2m minimum - or had the resources to self-insure
themselves. They did not rule out the review concluding that no increase was
necessary.
However the Trades Union Congress warned that even the temporary relaxation
would leave people who were seriously injured at work without compensation.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said: 'This is a step backwards.'
The government's announcement will do little to ameliorate the extra costs
companies are likely to face from buying cover above the Pounds 10m level.
But there are signs that a market for cover up to about Pounds 50m is
emerging. Mr Laurence Law, national services director at Alexander &amp;
Alexander (UK), part of the international insurance broking group, said:
'The insurance market isn't standing there with proposal forms printed but I
think that cover can be got.'
Mr Peter Lerwill, chairman of the Association of Insurance and Risk
Managers, welcomed the government's move. 'It's a pity that we've had to
wait until the 11th hour for this to be resolved, but it's good news,' he
said.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Surge in car export production gives record high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A further surge in car production for export in November has ensured that
total car output this year will be the highest for two decades, John
Griffiths writes.
Statistics released yesterday coincided with the signing of a potentially
export-boosting agreement between Rover Group and Indonesian government
authorities for an Indonesian national car project.
Under the deal, Rover will lead a project to design, develop and manufacture
a small car, the Meleo, for production in Indonesia. Mr Richard Needham, the
trade minister, said yesterday it was intended that 20,000-25,000 cars would
be built in the first year after production started in late 1997, rising to
100,000 a year at the end of the decade.
The motor industry's contribution to the UK's improving overall exports
performance was underlined by the November statistics, which showed a jump
of 53.8 per cent - to 79,290 - in production of export-destined cars
compared with November last year.
This lifted November's total car output to 157,613 - a year-on-year rise of
22.8 per cent.
As a result, output for the first 11 months of the year reached 1.36m, a 5.8
per cent rise on last year, figures from the Central Statistical Office and
Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show. The full-year total is
certain to exceed 1.4m, which would be the highest total since the 1.53m
achieved in 1974.
November's export performance more than compensated for fairly flat
production for the domestic market - up 1.9 per cent to 78,233.
However, the situation was reversed for commercial vehicle production. Total
output in November reached 25,639, a 16.9 per cent year-on-year rise. But
export production was down 10.7 per cent while output for the domestic
market rose by 51 per cent.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Milk Marque sells cut-price surplus to Irish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Milk Marque, the farmers' dairy co-operative, sold cut-price milk to Ireland
last week after causing a furore in November when it raised prices in
England and Wales by as much as 20 per cent.
The exports have caused an outcry in the dairy industry where higher prices
forced some companies to close processing plants. Dairies are angry that
surplus milk has been made available to Irish cheesemakers at about 3p per
litre below the cost of supply on the daily UK wholesale market.
'It is infuriating for companies which are locked into high-priced annual
contracts. British consumers are clearly being ripped off by this abuse of
monopoly power,' said Mr Neil Davidson, president of the Dairy Industry
Federation.
Dairies and supermarkets raised consumer prices for milk by between 1p and
2p per pint in response to higher wholesale prices when the Pounds 3.3bn
market was deregulated in November.
Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive of Milk Marque, said the export sales were
required to cope with an emergency breakdown of Unigate's large processing
plant at Chard, Somerset, and the annual shutdown of several other plants.
'When we get a breakdown we have to take immediate steps to move the milk,'
he said.
Mr Dare said it was preferable to export some milk rather than have
inefficient excess capacity among British processing plants to cope with
sudden surges in supply.
The current milk surplus is unusual and is partly caused by the mild weather
which encourages cows to produce more milk - farmers are producing 2.6 per
cent more than their quotas - and partly by farmers' attempts to cash in on
high prices.
Mr Dare said supply and demand in the run-up to Christmas were always
difficult to forecast. Milk Marque, which controls 66 per cent of supply in
England and Wales, said its November price rises were justified by the
tightness in the market caused by restrictive European Union quotas.
Milk Marque's sales system forced dairy companies to bid for yearly supplies
at a range of prices. Some companies' bids were scaled back in November
because of a shortage of supply at that time.
Milk Marque has also put a reserve price on the spot market for daily
wholesale sales to stop prices falling below 22p per litre. Sales to Ireland
are understood to have been at 19p per litre.
Mr Tony Craske, managing director at Abergavenny Fine Foods, a specialist
cheesemaker in Wales, said: 'We were told there would be a milk shortage so
we bid for our entire yearly supplies and are paying 27.4p per litre to Milk
Marque.
'There is a tremendous amount of resentment amongst dairies that we could
now buy that milk much more cheaply on the spot market.'

Strong inventory-building helped the US economy to grow a little more
strongly during the third quarter than previously thought, the Commerce
Department said yesterday. GDP expanded at a 4 per cent annual rate in the
quarter rather than the 3.9 per cent estimated a month ago, the government
said in a final revision of the quarterly GDP figure. It was the second
upward revision in third-quarter GDP. Originally it was reported growing at
a 3.4 per cent annual rate.
'The general picture of economic activity is little changed from last month:
consumer, investment and government spending more than accounted for the
increase in real GDP, with one half of the increase attributable to consumer
spending,' the department said. Businesses built up inventories during the
third quarter at an annual rate of Dollars 57.1bn, even stronger than the
estimate a month ago of Dollars 56.1bn.

<TEXT>
Pharmaceutical companies will no longer have to conduct human clinical
trials to prove a proposed product could become a useful drug, the US Patent
and Trademark Office announced yesterday. Mr Bruce Lehman, commissioner of
patents and trademarks, said new guidelines for reviewing biotechnology
patent applications change the yardstick by which examiners will determine
if a drug could be useful.
Mr Lehman said examiners had required that drugs undergo extensive human
clinical trials before the patent could be granted. Now, he said, a drug
company applicant can use 'any kind of evidence' to prove the usefulness, or
utility, of the invention. The new guidelines would go into effect
immediately, he said, but the agency would accept public comment on the
issue until February 24 and a 'finishing gloss' would be put on the
guidelines in March. Officials of the Biotechnology Industry Organisation,
an industry trade group, said the new requirements would make it easier for
small companies to protect drug inventions.

Representatives. But the Christmas present - a book advance said to be worth
Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.5m) - has been instantly transformed into a distinctly
unseasonal row.
The congressman's office yesterday confirmed a Washington Post report that
Mr Gingrich would sign a contract with Harper-Collins, the New York
publishing subsidiary of Mr Murdoch's News Corporation, for two books. He
would write one about his own political philosophy and edit the other, a
political anthology.
The Post put the advance at Dollars 4m and an aide to Mr Gingrich said:
'That's about the figure I've heard.' Whatever the precise sum, it far
exceeds the congressman's previous literary earnings, such as the modest
Dollars 15,000 commission he received last year to write an as yet
unpublished novel.
Not surprisingly, the White House jumped all over the story yesterday. Ms
Dee Dee Myers, in her last day on the job as press secretary, said the deal
'raises some very important questions', such as the 'size and timing' of the
payment.
Mr James Carville, President Bill Clinton's campaign manager in 1992, was
typically more to the point. 'This is the first guy who tried to cash in
before he was sworn in. Are you sure he's not going to give it to some
orphanage?' - a wicked allusion to one of the next Speaker's solutions for
America's welfare problems. Mr Murdoch, in Beijing, said he had 'no
knowledge' of the deal.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Mexico's Financial Crisis: Equity and debt markets suffer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The devaluation of the Mexican peso yesterday triggered further sales in the
local debt and equity markets, with prices of Mexican Brady bonds falling to
their lowest levels for more than three years. And with investors'
confidence in emerging markets damaged, the sell-off extended to affect
other Latin American and even east European assets.
Mr Alexis Rodzianko, managing director of emerging markets at Chemical Bank
in New York and chairman of the Emerging Markets Traders Association (EMTA),
said the action was a 'big blow', following earlier losses this year for the
Brady bond market, made up of bonds issued in exchange for distressed
commercial debt. Trading volume more than doubled in 1993 and has increased
by at least 50 per cent this year, according to EMTA. But Mr Rodzianko said
growth was now likely to slow.
Mexico was regarded as a benchmark by emerging market investors, he said.
'Mexico is the flagship. It has just hoisted the white flag and turned
tail,' he said. 'This is a serious football injury. The patient is in
traction.'
Mexican Bradies were sold heavily on Tuesday and Wednesday, but the
government's decision to float the peso on Wednesday evening prompted
frantic sales efforts from managers.
'Clients were out of their beds at 3.30am New York time and were selling
pretty much everything. We have been deluged with calls,' said one trader in
London. 'For us it was one of the five busiest days of the year. Prices are
moving not by eighths and quarters but by halfs and whole points,' he said.
The widely traded Mexican par bonds fell by 2 3/8 cents in early trading in
London to 55 1/4 . Although they recovered later in the day the cumulative
fall since the end of last week amounts to more than 10 per cent. The prices
of Argentine, Brazilian, Venezuelan, Polish and Russian bonds have also
fallen in the past few days. The price of one popular variety of Argentine
Bradies fell to 63 in late trading in New York, compared to 71.5 at the end
of last week, for example. US institutions which have become big investors
in emerging markets - and especially in Mexico - are estimated to have lost
up to 20 per cent of their holdings in the country this week. Whereas sales
of Bradies earlier this year - following the increase in short-term US
interest rates in February - were led by US traders, analysts said
institutions have been responsible for the decline this time.
Mr Rodzianko said there was evidence that mutual funds were making sales to
meet redemptions from investors. Ms Ingrid Iversen, senior economist with
Morgan Grenfell Emerging Markets in London, said the fall in prices had been
exacerbated because some highly leveraged investors had to unwind positions
in order to meet margin calls.
Mr Dwight Churchill, head of taxable fixed-income funds at Fidelity
Investments, the largest US mutual fund group, said: 'The market is
relatively thin, but it is trading.' Although there were no signs of
outright panic among investors, he said there had been selling across the
board.
Mr Churchill said Fidelity was reassessing its investment strategy in the
wake of the peso's devaluation.
'We are clearly re-evaluating the Mexican situation, and we are disappointed
that a stable peso is not a centre-post of policy at this point. We will
give the Mexican government the opportunity to provide an explanation of its
current strategy, and will use that as a foundation to decide whether or not
to change our strategy.'
Mexican and Latin American equity markets were also affected. In Mexico the
market opened firmer, then lost initial gains as foreign investors began to
liquidate positions. By mid-morning the IPC index, which had risen more than
4 per cent at the opening, was down 22.37 or 1 per cent, at 2,181.30. But it
subsequently recovered to close 4.66 per cent higher.
Elsewhere in the region the picture was more negative. Brazil's Bovespa
index ended down nearly 6.1 per cent, recovering from 11 per cent, while the
Merval index in Argentina finished 3.0 per cent lower, also well above the
day's worst.
Ms Susanne Carrington, Latin American fund manager at Fleming Investment
Management in London, which has some Dollars 1bn in the region, said that
the present crisis had mainly come about as the result of political
inexperience and had delivered a serious blow to the new administration's
credibility.
'Many foreign investors had come round to the view of Mexico's economic
miracle, and that the country was politically stable,' she said. 'But at a
stroke that perception has been destroyed, and once more Mexico is seen as a
typical emerging market.'
Some investors are also concerned about Mexico's reduced ability to service
its foreign currency debt - although analysts at JP Morgan in New York
argued that internal and external debt was low at 22 per cent of GDP at the
end of 1993.
In the bond market traders say that with prices at current levels Brady
bonds represent good value but that psychological factors were influencing
sentiment. 'The market will hurt for a while,' Mr Rodzianko predicted.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Mexico's Financial Crisis: Zedillo's programme in question
after three weeks - Mexico's problems with the floating peso
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Popocatepetl, the snow-capped volcano overlooking Mexico City, was suddenly
on the brink of eruption yesterday, spewing smoke and ash over surrounding
towns and villages. But the country's economic stability and rock-solid
monetary policy, and confidence among foreign investors, were also
threatening to go up in flames.
Just three weeks into President Ernesto Zedillo's term, serious questions
have been raised about the direction the new administration is taking the
economy and the country.
Floating the exchange rate and freezing prices for at least 60 days could
have a largely negative short-term impact on many companies and individuals
and extend uncertainty into the areas of political reform and social policy.
The financial crisis casts a retrospective pall over the six-year term of
office of President Carlos Salinas and his finance minister, Mr Pedro Aspe.
Both had pursued an exchange rate policy that outlived their administration
by less than three weeks.
The devaluation was a surprise because most people had not realised how far
foreign exchange reserves had fallen over the previous few months.
Despite this, the most immediate problem is one of confidence in the new
economic team. 'Investors just don't know what direction the government is
going to take,' said Mr Sergio Sarmiento, an economic commentator. 'Even
when we had more serious problems at the beginning of the year, the markets
stayed relatively tranquil because people knew what was going on. Now they
don't'
'This is a big test for Zedillo,' said Professor John Bailey, director of
Latin American Studies at Georgetown University in Washington. 'He needs to
show leadership. . . and send a clear message about what steps are being
taken.'
Finance Ministry officials admit that Tuesday's announcement of a 15 per
cent devaluation was not handled well.
'It's going to take a while for us to restore confidence. But just wait a
couple of weeks until the irrational pressure leaves the market and people
will come around and see that the fundamentals of the our economy are still
quite sound,' said a senior official.
But two weeks is a long time in an unfolding financial crisis, and the
government runs the risk that by the time it regains control of the
situation investor confidence could be seriously damaged.
Analysts are predicting that despite the price freeze, prices could jump 3
per cent in January as a result of the devaluation, and inflation for 1995
settle at around 18 per cent.
Under this scenario, interest rates will stay high and economic growth could
fall to as low as 1.5 per cent, well under the government's projection of 4
per cent for the year. To maintain a balanced federal budget with reduced
tax revenues and increased debt-service payments, social spending and
government investment - stated priorities of the new administration - would
have to be cut, undermining Mr Zedillo's domestic political credibility.
'We haven't reached complete meltdown, but most of the conditions for our
worst-case scenario exist,' said one foreign broker.
The impact on the country's financial system and its most important
companies will be enormous. At yesterday's exchange rate, the peso will have
fallen by 40 per cent on the year, significantly increasing the debt load of
those companies with dollar loans.
The already overextended banking system, itself with significant levels of
dollar debt, will be stretched even further. In addition to this, the
government's bank insurance fund is undercapitalised after two important
payouts in the past six months.
The recently authorised foreign banks are unlikely to be much help in this
area. 'We were going to be very active in exchange rate coverage,
derivatives and the like. Now it's virtually impossible to price those
things, so our operations are basically on hold. The last thing we are going
to do is risk money or lend dollars in this kind of market,' said one
foreign banker.
With the threat of economic instability looming, the administration faces a
decision about how to proceed on political reform, which was supposed to be
the government's main priority for 1995. Mr Zedillo committed himself during
his election campaign to reform of the judicial system and easing the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary party's grip on the country's levers of power.
Mr Zedillo could follow the lead of his predecessor Mr Salinas and argue
that a political opening is unwise while economic stability must be
procured.
'That would be a mistake,' said Prof Bailey. 'Salinas had to deal with
structural problems. Zedillo has to deal with psychological questions about
his leadership ability. Political reform and solving the Chiapas problem
will give people a good signal that he is moving forward. This time economic
and political questions go together.'
The continuing political crisis in the southern state of Chiapas, scene of
an uneasy military stand-off since an armed peasant rebellion in January, is
another thorn in the new government's side.
Yet in order to keep inflation in check and maintain control over unions and
wages, Mr Zedillo will almost certainly need to use some of the old, albeit
slightly rusty, levers of authoritarian control. Giving up those mechanisms,
while tempting, may prove too risky.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Mexico's Financial Crisis: Latin America faces difficult
year ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just as prospects for a breakthrough in growth were beginning to emerge in
many parts of Latin America, the financial crisis in Mexico has called into
question the sustainability of even the modest growth seen over the past few
years.
Growth in the region through the 1980s was impeded by an inability to run
current account deficits because of a lack of access to foreign finance,
following the debt crisis which struck Mexico in 1982.
The question for 1995 is whether an investors' strike following the heavy
losses suffered as a result of the Mexican devaluation, and the losses which
Latin American bond markets suffered after the US began increasing interest
rates in February, will once more isolate the region from private finance.
To the extent that it does, growth will be hindered and recession may
threaten some economies.
Private economists had begun to scale up their forecasts for growth next
year. Average forecasts for Latin America for 1995, compiled by the
London-based Consensus Economics consultancy, suggested growth would exceed
4 per cent next year compared with 3.8 per cent this. In the fashion of the
Grand Old Duke of York, economists will be marching their forecasts back
down again.
Many economists say that on a fundamental basis Mexico's problems should not
spill over elsewhere in the region. 'This is more like the European exchange
rate crisis of 1992 than the Mexican and Chilean crises of the early 1980s,'
said Mr Sebastian Edwards, chief Latin American economist at the World Bank
in Washington.
He said fiscal policy in Mexico was under control, unlike in 1982, and the
productivity gains that have occurred in the past few years have provided a
basis - even at the old exchange rate - for expanding exports.
The Mexican panic will nevertheless cut deep. Investors who hold Mexican
assets have lost billions of dollars in a couple of days, as big currency
losses have compounded market downturns.
Devaluation will also hammer many Mexican companies and, perhaps more
worryingly, banks - some of which already have weak loan portfolios -
because of their large unhedged exposure in dollars.
They will have to recognise these losses in their 1994 income statements -
losses that will grow with the size of the devaluation. At 5 pesos to the
dollar Mr Edwards said - the rate at which the Mexican currency opened in
very thin trading yesterday in Mexico City - many Mexicans would now be
buying their local currency and it would recover.
The improvement in economic management in Mexico, however, has done little
to address the Achilles heel of its programme: low savings. That weakness,
which entails dependence on foreign capital to spur investment and growth,
is reflected elsewhere in Latin America.
The main comparison being made yesterday by investors was with Argentina.
The government there also has been using the exchange rate as an anchor in
the battle against inflation, and a possible currency overvaluation, and is
running a current account deficit.
However, Argentina's problem appears much less acute than Mexico's. The
current account deficit is smaller (around 4 per cent of GDP, half that of
Mexico), the currency is fixed against the dollar under a currency board
arrangement by law - arguably a more credible arrangement than Mexico's -
and Argentine inflation is less than 4 per cent.
The extent of any overvaluation will have been mitigated this year. Unlike
Mexico, which conducts around three-quarters of its trade with the US,
Argentina's trading relationships are more balanced and the dollar is a much
less important component of its trading basket.
The dollar and therefore the peso has depreciated against European
currencies this year and Europe accounts for around a quarter of its trade.
Two other important Argentine trading partners - Brazil and Chile - have
also revalued their currencies significantly in the past six months.
According to Mr Edwards, the other important Latin American economies should
be relatively well insulated from the shock. Chile is the one Latin economy
that - partly thanks to a successful pension fund reform  - has boosted
savings and does not depend on capital inflows. Colombia and Peru should not
be hugely affected, and Venezuela, suffering a banking crisis, is running a
current account surplus.
Brazil also embarked this year on an anti-inflation package that has, as an
important element, a currency anchor against the dollar. But it has Dollars
43bn in reserves and was running a trade surplus until November. Reduced
access to foreign capital may hinder the country's anti-inflation plan and
slow growth but should not imply disaster.
The consensus among those economists, with the luxury of standing back from
the markets, is that this crisis will prove to be a step backwards but not a
fatal blow for Mexico in the uneven process of developing a competitive
economy. Nonetheless, the markets are volatile and some investors spooked.
If they do not recover their peace of mind, 1995 could be a difficult year
for Latin America.

Fujimori. 'I've begun the procedure. I have the lawyer and he is attending
to the papers,' she said during a visit on Wednesday to a school in Lima.
Ms Higuchi, a civil engineer, has been estranged from the president since
August, when she publicly protested at a law which banned her from running
for public office. She has accused Mr Fujimori, who is standing for a second
term in next April's elections, of allowing corruption to spread in his
government although she has produced little proof. Mr Fujimori responded by
stripping her of her official duties. She now says she intends to run for
Congress.

<TEXT>
Pharmaceutical companies will no longer have to conduct human clinical
trials to prove that a proposed product could become a useful drug, the US
Patent and Trademark Office announced yesterday. Mr Bruce Lehman,
commissioner of patents and trademarks, said new guidelines for reviewing
biotechnology patent applications change the yardstick by which patent
examiners will determine if a drug could be useful.
Mr Lehman said examiners had required that drugs undergo extensive human
clinical trials before the patent could be granted. Now, he said, a drug
company applicant can use 'any kind of evidence' to prove the usefulness, or
utility, of the invention.
The new guidelines would go into effect immediately, he said, but the agency
would accept public comment on the issue until February 24 and a 'finishing
gloss' would be put on the guidelines in March. Officials of the
Biotechnology Industry Organisation, an industry trade group, said the new
requirements would make it easier for small companies to protect drug
inventions by requiring that the product usefulness be proven only in test
tube or animal tests. The new rules will have no effect on Food and Drug
Administration requirements that all drugs be extensively tested in human
clinical trials before they are approved for marketing and general
therapeutic use.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Burma's military dictatorship seems likely to kep Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the
Nobel Peace Prize winner and leader of the Burmese democracy movement, under
house arrest for several more years, it was revealed yesterday. There has
been speculation that Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, whose family home has been her
prison for nearly 6 1/2 years, would be released on January 20 when her
current detention order was thought to expire. However the Burmese foreign
minister, U Ohn Gyaw, in a written reply to Mr Yozo Yokata, the special
rapporteur of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Burma, explained that a
'central body' composed of the interior, foreign and defence ministers can
detain anyone for up to five years. This creates a new legal justification
within Burma for the detention, and reinforces a long-standing view in the
diplomatic community that the military will only release the popular
daughter of the country's independence hero Aung San when it feels they can
cope with her potent political appeal. Hopes for her release had been lifted
after she met the powerful intelligence chief, Lt Gen Khin Nyunt, and other
leaders of the State Law and Order Restoration Council twice, in September
and October.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Seoul encourages investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON, Seoul Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea yesterday announced measures to encourage stock investments as
part of the government's programme to cut the dependence of companies on
bank loans as their main source of finance. The government wants companies
to increase the raising of capital on financial markets to weaken amily
ownership of the country's leading conglomerates and ease the financial
burden on the banking system, which is suffering from many non-performing
loans.
All listed companies, excluding financial firms, will be allowed to raise
Won300bn (Pounds 242m) in new share issues annually, up from Won200bn,
beginning on January 3, the first trading day in 1995. Any listed company
will be allowed to raise paid-in capital by up to 50 per cent if it posted a
net profit in the previous financial year, instead of the more rigorous
requirement of achieving at least a 5 per cent return on paid-in capital.
Financial requirements for companies wishing to go public have also been
relaxed.

Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin's top military advisers have left for
secret talks with Syrian officials in Washington, Israeli and Syrian media
reported yesterday. Foreign minister Shimon Peres suggested closed-door
talks were planned with Syria but refused to elaborate. 'Considering that
these are secret negotiations, you cannot expect me to give all the
details,' he said. Syria officially announced that a meeting between the
Syrian and Israeli ambassadors to the US was due to be held in Washington
yesterday. The official Syrian news agency Sana said Syrian and Israeli
military officials would attend the talks due to be held at the State
Department under the auspices and participation of the US. Channel Two TV
said LtGen Ehud Barak, the Israeli military chief of staff, was in
Washington for the talks. The army refused to comment.
The peace talks appear still stuck over the Golan Heights captured by Israel
in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in 1981. Syria wants Israel to agree
to a full withdrawal before discussing the terms of peace, while Israel is
proposing a limited withdrawal followed by a testing period during which the
final withdrawal line would be negotiated.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Three Indian ministers quit
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three scandal-tainted Indian ministers resigned last night, clearing the way
for Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, to try to improve the ruling
Congress (I) party's corruption-tarnished image. Mr B Shankaranand, the
health minister, and Mr Romeshwar Thakur, the rural development minister,
stepped down following intense criticism of their roles in the 1992 Rs40bn
(Pounds 816m) Bombay securities market scandal. Mr Kalpanath Rai, the food
minister, resigned after he was condemned in a government report into the
handling of a massive sugar shortage earlier this year.
Their resignations come after two weeks of persistent attacks from Congress
MPs, who were prompted into action by the party's serious defeat in recent
state elections in which corruption allegations cost the party many votes.
MPs put pressure on Mr Rao to act quickly because the party faces another
round of state polls in February and a general election which is due to be
held by mid-1996. But the three ministers held out, saying they had done
nothing wrong. Mr Rao hoes the resignations will help stop in-fighting in
Congress and encourage ruling party MPs to unite in advance of the next
round of polls.

FT  23 DEC 94 / N Korea returns body of US pilot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON, Seoul Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
North Korea yesterday returned the body of a US army pilot killed when his
helicopter went down over its territory at the weekend and indicated that it
might release his surviving colleague by Christmas, writes John Burton,
Seoul Correspondent.
The delay in the return of the crew has been caused by North Korean
suspicions regarding the US claim that the helicopter strayed accidentally
into its air space, according to a US congressman who conducted 'intensive,
heated and hectic' negotiations on the issue during five days in Pyongyang.
'They were worried about conspiracy theories and acceleration of tension.
But I think it's been proven to them that it was an accident,' said Mr Bill
Richardson, a Democratic representative from New Mexico. The US has been
pressing North Korea to release the crew quickly to avoid jeopardising the
recent accord to dismantle the North's nuclear programme in exchange for
diplomatic ties with Washington.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Tokyo to lend China Y580bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan yesterday pledged Y580bn (Pounds 3.7bn) of soft government loans for
China and sent a visiting Chinese delegation home with a lecture against
nuclear testing.
The cash, to be disbursed over the three fiscal years starting in April
1996, is to help China reduce the prosperity gap between poor central
regions and fast industrialising coastal cities.
It is far less than the Y700bn the Chinese government was asking for in the
two days of negotiations which ended yesterday. But it represents an
increase, per year, over official aid under Japan's current five-year Y810bn
programme for China, ending in April 1996. China wanted another five-year
package this time, rather than a three-year one.
The Japanese government cited the fall in its budget revenues as the reason
for being unable to comply. Yet this reflects a growing body of opinion in
Tokyo for fresh loans to China to be conditional on clearer information
about its military spending and an end to nuclear testing. Two Chinese
underground nuclear tests over the past year have alarmed Tokyo.
Mr Hiroshi Hirabayashi, director-general of the Foreign Ministry's economic
co-operation (aid) bureau, reminded Chinese officials that the aid rules
oblige Japan to take account of recipient countries' military trends. More
nuclear tests could 'negatively affect' Japanese public support for loans to
China, he warned.
The Chinese delegation understood Japan's sensitivities but said it opposed
making aid subject to political conditions. Loans for the following two
years will be decided in another set of negotiations. The latest loans are
repayable over 30 years, with a 10-year grace-period and an annual 2.6 per
cent interest rate.
The loan package, the fourth since Japan reopened diplomatic relations with
China in 1972, is to fund 40 projects, stipulated in the aid agreement
signed yesterday.
They include measures against air pollution, a problem that affects Japan in
the form of acid rain from Chinese coal-fired power stations. Improvements
to Chinese water supplies and rural infrastructure are also stipulated.
This environmental slant marks a change from Japan's previous aid policy for
China, which focused on improving industrial infrastructure such as ports
and dams - a job now largely completed in the rich southern coastal areas.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Investment fall hits recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's economic recovery is being constrained by a continuing decline in
corporate investment, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the prime minister, warned
yesterday, writes William Dawkins.
The economy was out of the tunnel, thanks to a pick-up on corporate profits,
personal consumption and housing investment. Yet structural problems
remained.
Mr Murayama's analysis was borne out by the latest batch of economic
statistics yesterday, showing recovery overshadowed by a further, though
decelerating, fall in corporate capital spending.
Investment in plant and equipment fell an annualised 9.5 per cent in the
three months to September, making a record 11 consecutive quarters of
decline, the Finance Ministry's latest survey of 24,000 companies shows.
Officials think the capital investment fall may be bottoming out, from a
much steeper 16.8 per cent decline in the previous quarter. In previous
recoveries, capital investment has recovered strongly.
One reason for mild optimism is the recovery in pre-tax profits uncovered by
the survey. They rose 28.9 per cent in the three months to September, from a
year earlier, the first such rise in four years. This compared with a 0.2
per cent drop in the previous quarter.
Japan's Economic Planning Agency said its monthly index of business
conditions continued upwards.
The EPA's coincident index, a basket of indicators measuring business
conditions, stood at 70 in October, up from 60 in the previous month. It is
the third month the index has stood above 50, the divide between growth and
decline, and clear evidence the economy is recovering, the EPA said.
The leading index, a pointer to conditions six months ahead, fell from 58.3
in September to 50 in October, breaking a nine-month period when it had
hovered above the dividing line.

FT  23 DEC 94 / International airport for Moi's home town: Project draws
criticism over priorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kenyan president Daniel arap Moi's home town - Eldoret, population 112,000 -
is to get an international airport, built by a Canadian company at a cost of
KS3.7bn (Dollars 84m).
Eldoret, a sleepy market town surrounded by maize fields in the Rift Valley,
already boasts a university (named after Mr Moi). Its international airport
will be the third largest in Kenya, after Nairobi and Mombasa.
SNC-Lavalin-Group of Montreal says it expects to begin work on the two-year
project on January 5. 'The work includes construction of a 3.5km runway
suitable for aircraft such as the Airbus A-310, a 2,400 sq m terminal and a
33 metre-high control tower,' the company says.
'SNC-Lavalin will also construct ancillary buildings and a freight warehouse
with a refrigerated section.'
Eldoret does not figure on Kenya's tourist circuit, nor is it well known as
a hub of economic activity.
But the town has been blessed with good communications and some of the best
roads in the country, because it lies at the heart of Kalenjin country,
President Moi's tribal homeland.
News of Eldoret's new airport has caused an outcry in Kenya. Its cost is
equal to about half the health ministry's annual budget, and some Kenyans
question the government's spending priorities at a time of fiscal austerity
demanded by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
'The airport does not make a shred of economic sense,' Mr Robert Shaw, a
private Kenyan economist and critic of the government, said yesterday.
He believes the money would be better spent on improving Mombasa's primitive
airport, which handles tens of thousands of tourists each year, or on
rebuilding the Mombasa-Nairobi highway, the country's most important
economic artery. Traffic on the road ground to a halt this week after heavy
rains washed out an entire section of the route.
Ms Christine Wong, of the Canadian High Commission, said yesterday the
project would not be funded with Canadian aid.
'The contract was negotiated between a private Canadian company and the
Kenyan government. The Canadian government was not involved,' she added.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Two Palestinians killed
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two Palestinians died yesterday and two were wounded in a spate of incidents
in Jericho, Gaza and the occupied West Bank which threw a shadow over
continuing attempts to advance the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. In
Jericho, now under Palestinian rule, gunmen shot dead Ibrahim Yogi, a
27-year-old member of the armed wing of the Islamic Hamas organisation after
running him over with a car bearing Israeli licence plates. Hamas blamed
Israeli undercover agents and called a general strike but Israeli officials
denied involvement. Any such operation, they said, would have been a blatant
undermining of Palestinian authority. In Gaza, an Israeli naval patrol shot
and wounded two Palestinian boatmen fishing outside the permitted area,
which stretches 20 miles off the coast of the autonomous enclave. Under the
peace accord, Israel maintains narrow security zones opposite the Egyptian
and Israeli borders at either end of the strip. A military spokesman
explained: 'If boatmen do not obey orders to leave the zone, we have to
assume they are either smuggling arms or planning to attack Israeli
targets.' In Hebron on the West Bank, Eid Abdel-Mohsem al-Saghair, 19, died
in when a bomb he was carrying blew up in his hands, said the Israeli army.

FT  23 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Japanese ready for US pension demands
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's financial authorities are preparing to meet US demands that Tokyo
opens the management of its state pension fund. The authorities are putting
together a proposal to present to the financial service negotiations between
the two countries which will be held in Seattle next week.
The US government has long been lobbying for the Japanese government to
allow investment advisory companies to enter the country's Y20,000bn
(Dollars 200bn) public pension fund market, currently limited to life
assurers and trust banks. The issue has been a centrepiece in the financial
service negotiations which form part of continuing US-Japan framework talks
on bilateral trade.
In 1990, investment advisory companies were allowed into the private pension
fund market but foreign managers have failed to make a significant
breakthrough because of business practices based on long-term relationships.
The Ministry of Health and Welfare, which governs the state pension fund
system, has also been calling for deregulation in order to diversify fund
investments. However, it has come up against the Ministry of Finance which
regards itself as the bastion of prudent investments for state funds and
which has opposed deregulation, citing the possible increase in stock
investments regarded as high-risk.
The Japanese government is keen to reach an early settlement of the
financial service talks before Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's visit to
the US scheduled for early January. 'An earlier settlement is highly
desirable, although we are not promising to conclude the talks within this
year,' Mr Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister, said yesterday.
Details of the finance ministry's proposal are expected to be revealed early
next week. Local papers have reported that finance ministry officials intend
to allow investment advisory firms into the market by setting up an
'investment union' with a trust bank.

FT  23 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Canadian tax deepens culture row with US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A dispute between the US and Canada over efforts to protect Canadian
magazines, television services and cultural institutions deepened yesterday
when Ottawa imposed an 80 per cent excise tax on advertising revenues from
magazines compiled in the US and beamed electronically to Canadian printing
plants.
The new tax is payable by the printer or local distributor.
The move was specifically directed against Time Warner, the US entertainment
and publishing group which took advantage of a loophole in Canadian trade
laws last year to combine Canadian advertising and US editorial content in a
low-cost local edition of Sports Illustrated. Other US magazines, which
already dominate Canadian news stands, have been closely watching the Sports
Illustrated experiment.
US trade officials say Canada's most recent moves on cultural protectionism
represent 'a disturbing trend'. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative, is expected to announce that he will work closely with the
US industry to consider all options, including retaliation.
Ottawa secured an exemption for the cultural sector from the 1989 US-Canada
free trade agreement. But the US is allowed to retaliate against any new
protective measures to an equivalent commercial value.
Washington is also angered by a Canadian regulatory ruling this year to
withdraw a licence granted to Country Music Television (CMT), a US cable-TV
channel two-thirds owned by Westinghouse Electric. Cable operators are due
to replace the US channel with a Canadian country music service on January
1.
CMT, which has been available in Canada for about 10 years and is carried to
2m Canadian homes, plans to ask the US trade representative to file a
complaint under section 301 of the US international trade law. Although they
voraciously tune into US television stations and read US publications,
Canadians are highly sensitive to any perceived threat to their own cultural
institutions.
'The Americans simply see it as a product and entertainment,' Ms Catherine
Keachie, director of the Canadian Magazine Publishers Association said
yesterday. 'Canadians are quite clear that we have to have our own books,
films and magazines to maintain a unique culture.'
About half of Canada's 1,400 periodicals made a profit in 1992. 'It is not a
matter of profitability . . . but of survival,' Mr Michel Dupuy, heritage
minister, said yesterday.
The government also unveiled plans to impose a consumer levy on blank audio
tapes. The proceeds will be distributed to musicians, singers and other
artists to compensate for lost sales due to copying of tapes and records.
